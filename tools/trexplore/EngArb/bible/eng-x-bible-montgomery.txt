40001001	The book of the generation of Jesus Christ , the son of David , the son of Abraham .
40001002	Abraham was the father of Isaac ; Isaac was the father of Jacob ; Jacob , of Judah and his brethren ;
40001003	Judah ( by Tamar ) , of Perez and Zerah ; Perez , of Hezron ; Hezron , of Ram ;
40001004	Ram , of Amminadab ; Amminadab , of Nahshon ; Nahshon , of Salmon ;
40001005	Salmon ( by Rahab ) , of Boaz ; Boaz ( by Ruth ) , of Obed ; Obed , of Jesse ;
40001006	And Jesse , of David the king . David ( by Uriahs widow ) , was the father of Solomon ;
40001007	Solomon , of Rehoboam ; Rehoboam , of Abijah ; Abijah , of Asa ;
40001008	Asa , of Jehoshaphat ; Jehoshaphat , of Joram ; Joram , of Uzziah ;
40001009	Uzziah , of Jotham ; Jotham , of Ahaz ; Ahaz , of Hezekiah ;
40001010	Hezekiah , of Manasseh ; Manasseh , of Amon ; Amon , of Josiah ;
40001011	Josiah , of Jechoniah and his brethren , at the time of the carrying away to Babylon .
40001012	And after the carrying away into Babylon , Jechoniah became the father of Shealtiel ; Shealtiel , of Zerubbabel ;
40001013	Zerubbabel , of Abiud ; Abiud , of Eliakim ; Eliakim , of Azor ;
40001014	Azor , of Sadoc ; Sadoc , of Achim ; Achim , of Eliud ;
40001015	Eliud , of Eleazar ; Eleazar , of Matthan ; Matthan , of Jacob ;
40001016	And Jacob , of Joseph , the husband of Mary , of whom was born Jesus , who is called Christ .
40001017	So the whole number of generations from Abraham to David is fourteen ; from David to the exile to Babylon is fourteen ; and from the exile to Babylon to Christ is fourteen .
40001018	The birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way . After his mother , Mary , had been betrothed to Joseph , before they came together , she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit .
40001019	But Joseph her husband , because he was just a man and unwilling to disgrace her , was minded to put her away secretly .
40001020	And while he was having this in mind , behold ! an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream , saying .
40001021	" Joseph , son of David , do not be afraid to take Mary your wife home , for what is begotten in her is by the Holy Spirit ; and she will bear a son , and you are to call him Jesus , for he will save his people from their sins . "
40001022	All this happened that the word of the Lord spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled .
40001023	Behold ! the virgin shall be with child , and shall bear a son ; and they shall call his name Immanuel , a word which means " God with us . "
40001024	Now when Joseph awoke from his sleep he did as the angel of the Lord had directed him , and took his wife home ,
40001025	but did not live with her until after the birth of her son , whom he called Jesus .
40002001	After the birth of Jesus , which took place at Bethlehem in Judea , during the reign of King Herod , lo ! certain Magi arrived in Jerusalem , saying .
40002002	" Where is the new-born King of the Jews ? For we have seen his star in the East , and are come to worship him . "
40002003	When King Herod heard this he was troubled , and all Jerusalem with him .
40002004	So when he had gathered together all the chief priests and rabbis of the people , he began to inquire of them where the Christ was to be born .
40002005	And they told him . " At Bethlehem in Judea , as it is written in the prophet .
40002006	" And thou Bethlehem in the land of Judah , Thou are not least among the princes of Judah , For out of thee shall come a ruler Who shall shepherd my people , Israel . "
40002007	Thereupon Herod sent secretly for the Magi , and found out from them the time when the star appeared .
40002008	Then he sent them to Bethlehem , saying , " Go and make careful inquiry about the child , and as soon as you have found him bring me word , that I , too , may go and worship him . "
40002009	The Magi listened to the king , and went on their way , and lo ! the star which they had seen in the east led them until it came and stood over the place where the young child was .
40002010	And when they saw the star , they rejoiced with great gladness .
40002011	When they had entered the house , they saw the child with Mary , his mother , and opening their treasure-chests they gave him gifts , gold and frankincense and myrrh .
40002012	But because they were forbidden by God in a dream to go back to Herod , they returned to their own country by another route .
40002013	When they were gone an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream , saying ; " Rise ! Take the young child and his mother and flee into Egypt , and there remain until I bring you word ; for Herod intends to make a search for the child , in order to put him to death . "
40002014	So Joseph arose , took the child and his mother , by night , and departed to Egypt .
40002015	There he remained until the death of Herod , in order that the word of the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled , which says , Out of Egypt I called my son .
40002016	As soon as Herod saw that he had been mocked by the Magi , he was furious . He sent and put to death all the boys in Bethlehem and all the neighborhood who were two years old or under , in accordance with the date which he had ascertained from the Magi .
40002017	Then were fulfilled the words spoken through Jeremiah , the prophet , saying ,
40002018	A voice was heard in Ramah , Weeping and lamentation - Rachel weeping for her children , Inconsolable , because they were no more !
40002019	But after Herods death an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt ,
40002020	saying , " Rise ! Take the child and his mother , and came into the land of Israel , for those who were seeking the life of the child are dead . "
40002021	So he rose and took the child and his mother , and came into the land of Israel .
40002022	But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father , Herod , he was afraid to go there ; and being warned of God in a dream , he withdrew into Galilee and settled in a town called Nazareth ,
40002023	in fulfillment of the word spoken through the Prophets , He shall be called a Nazarene .
40003001	In those days came John the Baptist preaching in the desert of Judea ;
40003002	" Repent , " said he , " for the kingdom of heaven is at hand . "
40003003	This Johnit was of whom it was said through Isaiah , the prophet , The voice of one who cries aloud in the desert , " Prepare a way for the Lord , Make the paths straight for him . "
40003004	This Johnwore a garment of camels hair , and a leather belt around his waist , and his food was locusts and wild honey .
40003005	Then Jerusalem began to go out to him , and all Judea , and the whole neighborhood of the Jordan ,
40003006	and were baptized by him in the river Jordan , confessing their sins .
40003007	But when Johnsaw that many of the Pharisees and Sadducees were coming for baptism , he said . " O brood of vipers ! Who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
40003008	Then bring forth fruit worthy of repentance .
40003009	And do not presume to say to yourselves , We have Abraham as our father-I tell you that out of these very stones God is able to raise up descendants for Abraham .
40003010	And already the axe is lying at the roots of the trees . Any tree , therefore , that does not bear good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire .
40003011	I indeed am baptizing you in water , unto repentance ; but One is coming after me , mightier than I , whose sandals I am not worthy to carry . He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and in fire .
40003012	His winnowing-fan is in his hand , and he will thoroughly cleanse the threshing-floor . He will store his wheat in the granary , but will burn up the chaff in unquenchable fire . "
40003013	At that very time Jesus was on his way from Galilee to the Jordan , to John , to be baptized by him .
40003014	But he tried to prevent him . " It is I , " he said , " who need to be baptized by you , and are you coming to me ? "
40003015	But Jesus answered , " Permit it now , for so it is fitting for us to fulfill every religious duty . "
40003016	Then he consented . And after Jesus was baptized , as soon as he rose out of the water , lo ! the heavens opened , and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting upon him ,
40003017	while a voice from heaven said , " This is my son , the beloved , In whom I delight . "
40004001	Then Jesus was led up into the desert by the Spirit , to be tempted by the devil .
40004002	And after he had fasted forty days and forty nights , he became hungry ,
40004003	So the tempter came and said to him , " If you are the Son of God , bid these stones to become bread . "
40004004	Jesus answered him , " It is written , Not by bread alone shall man live , but by every word that comes from the mouth of God . "
40004005	Then the devil took him up into the Holy City and stood him on the parapet of the temple ,
40004006	and said to him . " If you are the Son of God , throw yourself down ; for it is written , " He will give his angels charge over thee ; Upon their hands they will bear thee up , Lest thou dash thy foot against a stone . "
40004007	" It is written again , " answered Jesus , " Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God . "
40004008	Then the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain , and showed all the kingdoms of the earth and the glory of them ,
40004009	and said to him , " All these will I give you , if you will fall down and worship me . "
40004010	" Begone , Satan ! " answered Jesus , " for it is written , " Thou must worship the Lord thy God , and Him only must thou serve . "
40004011	Then the devil left him , and behold ! angels came and began ministering to him .
40004012	Now when Jesus heard that Johnhad been arrested , he withdrew into Galilee .
40004013	He left Nazareth , and settled in Capernaum-by-the-Lake , near the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali ,
40004014	in order that these words spoken through Isaiah the prophet , might be fulfilled .
40004015	Land of Zebulun , land of Naphtali ; The road by the Lake ; the country beyond Jordan ; Galilee of the Gentiles !
40004016	The people who were dwelling in darkness Have seen a great light ; And on those who were dwelling in the land of the shadows of death Light has dawned .
40004017	From that time Jesus began to preach , saying , " Repent for the kingdom of heaven is near . "
40004018	And as he was walking by the see of Galilee , he saw two brothers - Simon who is called Peter , and Andrew , his brother-casting their net into the sea , for they were fishermen .
40004019	" Come , follow me , " said Jesus , " And I will make you fishers of men . "
40004020	And they dropped their nets at once , and followed him .
40004021	As he went farther on he saw two other brothers , Jamesthe son of Zebedee , and Johnhis brother , in the boat with Zebedee their father , mending their nets , and he called them .
40004022	They immediately left the boat and their father , and followed him .
40004023	Then Jesus went about through Galilee , teaching in the synagogues , and preaching the gospel of the kingdom , and healing every kind of disease and infirmity among the people .
40004024	And his fame spread throughout all Syria . They brought all the sick to him , those who were suffering from various diseases and troubles - demoniacs , epileptics , paralytics-and he healed them .
40004025	Great crowds followed him from Galilee , from the ten towns , from Jerusalem , and Judea , and from beyond Jordan .
40005001	When he saw the crowds , he went up the mountain , and when he had seated himself , his disciples came to him ,
40005002	and opening his lips he began to teach them , saying .
40005003	" Blessed are the poor in spirit , for the kingdom of heaven is theirs .
40005004	" Blessed are those who mourn , for they shall be comforted .
40005005	" Blessed are the gentle , for they shall inherit the earth . "
40005006	" Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for the righteousness , for they shall be completely satisfied .
40005007	" Blessed are the merciful , for they shall obtain mercy .
40005008	" Blessed are the pure in heart , for they shall see God .
40005009	" Blessed are the peacemakers , for they shall be called sons of God .
40005010	" Blessed are those who have been persecuted in the cause of righteousness , for theirs is the kingdom of heaven .
40005011	" Blessed are you when they shall revile you , and persecute you , and say all manner of evil against you falsely , for my names sake .
40005012	" Rejoice and exult in it , because your reward was great in the heavens ; for so did they persecute the prophets before you .
40005013	" You are the salt of the earth ; but if the salt lose its savor , in what way shall it be salted ? It is henceforth good for nothing but to be thrown out and trodden under foot of men .
40005014	" You are the light of the world . A city built on a hilltop cannot be hid ;
40005015	" nor do men light a lamp , and put it under the bushel , but on the lamp-stand , and it gives light to all who are in the house .
40005016	" So let your light shine before men that they may see good you do , and give glory to your Father who is in heaven .
40005017	" Do not suppose that I am come to destroy the Law or the Prophets . I am come not to destroy , but to fulfil .
40005018	" In solemn truth I tell you that until heaven and earth pass away , not an iota , not a comma , will pass from the Law until all has taken place .
40005019	" So whoever breaks one of these least commandments , and teaches others to break them , will be least in the kingdom of heaven . But he who keeps them and teaches them , he will be called great in the kingdom of heaven .
40005020	" For I assure you that unless your righteousness exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees , you will not find entrance into the kingdom of heaven .
40005021	" You have heard that it was said to the ancients , " Thou shall not commit murder , and " he who commits murder shall be liable to condemnation by the court ;
40005022	but I say to you that he who becomes angry with his brother shall be liable to condemnation by the court ; and he who says to his brother Raca , shall be liable to condemnation by the Sanhedrin , while he who curses his brother shall be liable to the Gehenna of Fire .
40005023	" If therefore when you are offering your gift upon the altar , and there remember that your brother has a grievance against you ,
40005024	" leave there your gift before the altar , and go and make friends with your brother , first of all ; then come and offer your gift .
40005025	" Come to terms with your opponent quickly , while you are yet with him on the way to the court , to prevent your opponent from handing you over to the judge , and the judge to the jailer , and so you be thrown into prison .
40005026	" I tell you truly that you would certainly not get out from there until you had paid back the last cent .
40005027	" You have heard that it was said , " Thou shalt not commit adultery .
40005028	But I say to you that whoever looks with lust at a woman has already committed adultery with her in his heart .
40005029	And if your eye , your right eye , entices you to sin , pluck it out and cast it from you . It is better for you to lose one of your bodily organs , than to have your whole body go down into the pit .
40005030	And if your right hand entices you into sin , cut it off and cast it from you ; for it is better for you to lose one of your bodily organs , than to have your whole body go down into the pit .
40005031	" It was also said , " Whoever divorces his wife must give her a bill of separation .
40005032	But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife , except on the ground of unchastity , makes her an adulteress , and whoever marries her when so divorced , commits adultery .
40005033	" Again you have heard that it was said to the men of old , " You must not forswear yourselves , but must perform your vows to the Lord .
40005034	" But I say to you , swear not at all ; neither by the sky , for it is Gods throne ;
40005035	" nor by the earth , for it is the footstool of his feet ; nor by Jerusalem , for it is the city of the Great King .
40005036	" Nor must you swear by your head , since you cannot make one hair white or black .
40005037	" But let your word be simply Yes or No ; anything beyond this comes from the Evil One .
40005038	" You have heard that it was said , " An eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth .
40005039	" But I tell you not to retaliate the injury ; but whoever strikes you on the right cheek , turn the other to him also ;
40005040	" and if any one wants to go to law with you and takes away your coat , let him take your cloak also .
40005041	" Whoever impresses you to go one mile , go two miles with him .
40005042	" Give to him who asks , and from him who wants to borrow from you , do not turn away .
40005043	" You have heard that it was said , " You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy . "
40005044	" But I say to you , love your enemies , and pray for those who persecute you .
40005045	" So you will become sons of your heavenly Father ; for he makes his sun to rise upon sinners as well as saints , and sends rain upon the unjust and the just .
40005046	" For if you love only those who love you , what reward have you ?
40005047	" Even the tax-gatherers do that , do they not ? And if you show courtesy to your brother only , what are you doing more than others ? Even the Gentiles do that , do they not ?
40005048	" You then must be perfect , as your heavenly Father is perfect . "
40006001	" Be careful not to do your good deeds in the sight of men , in order to be observed by them . If you do , you have no reward with your heavenly Father .
40006002	" And whatever you give alms , do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and streets , in order that men may praise them . In solemn truth I tell you they already have their reward in full .
40006003	" But when you give alms , do not let your right hand know what your left is doing ,
40006004	" so that your alms may be in secret ; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly .
40006005	" And whenever you pray , do not be like the hypocrites . For they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the corners of the avenues , in order that men may see them . In solemn truth I tell you that they have their reward in full .
40006006	" But you , when you pray , go into your own room and shut your door ; pray to your Father who is in secret , and your Father who sees in secret will reward you .
40006007	" While praying do not say the same words over and over again , as the Gentiles do , for they suppose that by their much speaking they will gain attention .
40006008	" Do not be like them , for your Father knows what you need before you ask him .
40006009	" So pray in this way . " Our Father who art in heaven , May thy name be hallowed ,
40006010	thy kingdom come , and thy will be done , On earth , as in heaven .
40006011	Give us today our bread for the day before us ;
40006012	And forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors ;
40006013	And lead us not into temptation , but deliver us from the Evil One ; For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory . Amen .
40006014	" For if you forgive men their offenses against you , your heavenly Father will forgive you also ;
40006015	" but if you do not forgive men your offenses , neither will your heavenly Father forgive you your offenses .
40006016	" When you fast , do not look downcast like the hypocrites ; for they disfigure their faces so that it may be apparent to men that they are fasting . In solemn truth I tell you , they already have received their reward .
40006017	" But when one of you fasts , let him anoint his head and wash his face ,
40006018	" so that he may not appear to men to be fasting , but to his Father who is in secret ; and his Father who sees in secret will reward him .
40006019	" Store up for yourselves no treasures on earth , where moth and rust consume , and where thieves break through and steal ;
40006020	" but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven , where neither moth nor rust consume , and where thieves do not break through nor steal .
40006021	" For wherever your treasure is , there will your heart be also .
40006022	" The lamp of the body is the eye . Therefore if your eye is sound , your whole body will be well lighted ;
40006023	" but if your eye is unsound , your whole body will be darkened . If then the very light within you is darkness , how dense is that darkness !
40006024	" No slave can serve two masters , for either he will hate the one and love the other , or he will pay heed to the one and despise the other . You cannot be the slaves both of God and of gold .
40006025	" For this reason I say to you , do not be anxious about your life , inquiring what you shall eat or what you shall drink , nor yet for your body , inquiring what you shall wear . Is not your life more than its food , and your body than its clothing ?
40006026	" Behold ! the birds in the sky ! They neither sow , nor reap , nor gather into barns , yet your heavenly Father feeds them ; and are not you worth more than they ?
40006027	" Which one of you by being anxious is able to add even one cubit to his stature ?
40006028	" Why be anxious then about clothing ? Consider the lilies of the field , how they grow . They toil not , neither do they spin .
40006029	" But I say to you that not even Solomon in all his glory was robed like one of these .
40006030	" If God then so clothes the grass of the field , which blooms today , and tomorrow is cast into the oven , will he not much more clothe you , you of little faith ?
40006031	" Then do not be anxious , saying , What shall we eat ? or What shall we drink ? or What shall we wear ? "
40006032	" For all these are things that the Gentiles are eagerly seeking ; for your heavenly Father knows that you have need of them all .
40006033	" But continue to seek first his kingdom and his righteousness , and all these things shall be added to you .
40006034	" Do not then be anxious about tomorrow , for tomorrow will bring its own anxieties . Enough for each day are its own troubles . "
40007001	" Judge not , that you may be judged , yourselves ;
40007002	" for with what judgment you judge , you will be judged , and in what measure you measure , others will measure to you .
40007003	" And why do you look at the mote in your brothers eye , and fail to notice the beam which is in your own eye ?
40007004	" Or how will you say to your brother , Permit me to remove the mote from your eye , when , behold , the beam is in your own eye ?
40007005	" Hypocrite ! First cast out the beam from your own eye , and then you will see clearly how to cast the mote out of your brothers eye .
40007006	" Do not give what is holy to the dogs , nor cast your pearls before swine ; lest in turn they trample them under their feet , and then turn and attack you .
40007007	" Ask , and it will be given you ; seek , and you will find ; knock , and the door will be opened to you .
40007008	" For every one who asks receives , and he who seeks finds , and to him who knocks the door is opened .
40007009	" What man of you is there who , when his son asks a loaf , will give him a stone ?
40007010	" or if his son asks for a fish , will offer him a snake ?
40007011	" If you then , evil as you are , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will your heavenly Father give good gifts to those who ask him ?
40007012	" Therefore everything that you would have men do to you , do you also the same to them ; for this is the Law and the Prophets .
40007013	" Enter by the narrow gate ; for broad is the gate and wide the road that leads to destruction , and many are they who go in by it ;
40007014	" but the gate is narrow and the road is steep , which leads to life , and they are few who find it .
40007015	" Beware of the false prophets who come to you in sheeps clothing , but within they are ravening wolves .
40007016	" By their fruits you will know them . Are grapes gathered of thorns , or figs of thistles ?
40007017	" No , every good tree bears good fruit , but a worthless tree bears bad fruit .
40007018	" A good tree cannot bear bad fruit ; neither can a worthless tree bear good fruit .
40007019	" Every tree which does not bear good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire .
40007020	" Hence it is by their fruit you will know them .
40007021	" Not everyone who says to me , Lord , Lord , will enter into the kingdom of heaven , but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven .
40007022	" Many in that day will say to me , " Lord , Lord , have we not prophesied in your name , and in your name cast out demons , and in your name done many mighty works ?
40007023	" Then I will tell them plainly , " I never knew you ; depart from me , you workers of iniquity .
40007024	" Every one who hears my words and does them I will liken to a wise man who built his house upon the rock .
40007025	" And the rain descended , and the floods came , and the winds blew , and beat upon the house , but it fell not , for it was founded upon the rock .
40007026	" And every one who hears these words of mine and does them not , I will liken to a foolish man , who built his house upon the sand .
40007027	" And the rain descended , and the floods came , and the winds blew , and beat upon that house , and it fell , and great was the fall of it . "
40007028	Now when Jesus had finished his discourse , the crowds were astounded at his teaching ,
40007029	for he was teaching them as one having authority , and not as their scribes taught them .
40008001	As he went down from the mountain , great crowds followed him .
40008002	And behold ! a leper came and knelt before him , saying , " Lord if you choose , you can make me clean . "
40008003	Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him " I do choose , " he said , " become clean , " and immediately he was cleansed of his leprosy .
40008004	Jesus said to him , " See that you tell no one , but go , show yourself to the priest , and offer the gift which Moses commanded , as an evidence to them . "
40008005	When he entered Capernaum , an army captain came , and entered him ,
40008006	saying , " Lord , my slave at home is lying ill with paralysis , in terrible agony . "
40008007	" I will come and heal him , " said Jesus .
40008008	" Lord , " said the captain in reply , " I am not worthy to have you under my roof , but speak the word only , and my slave will be cured ,
40008009	" For I myself also am a man under authority , and I have soldiers under me . To one man I say Go , and he goes ; to another , Come , and he comes ; and to my slave , Do this , and he does it . "
40008010	As Jesus listened to this reply he was astonished , and said to those who followed him . " In solemn truth I tell you that I have found faith like this in any Israelite .
40008011	" I tell you that many will come from the east and from the west , and sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven .
40008012	" but the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into the outer darkness ; there will be the wailing and the gnashing of teeth . "
40008013	Then Jesus said to the captain . " Go ! As you have believed , so be it unto you . " And his slave was healed in that very hour .
40008014	When Jesus came into Peters house , he found his wifes mother prostrated with fever .
40008015	He touched her hand , and the fever left her ; and she arose and waited upon him .
40008016	At evening-time they brought to him many demoniacs . He cast out the demons with a word , and healed all who were ill ,
40008017	that the word spoken through Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled , He took upon himself our weaknesses , and bore the burden of our diseases .
40008018	When Jesus saw the great crowds about him , he had given directions to cross to the other side ,
40008019	when a Scribe came up and said to him , " Teacher , I will follow you wherever you go ! "
40008020	" Foxes have their holes , " answered Jesus , " and wild birds their roosting-places , but the Son of man has not where to lay his head . "
40008021	Another of his disciples said to him , " Lord , allow me first to go and bury my father , "
40008022	" Follow me , " Jesus said to him , " and leave the dead to bury their own dead . "
40008023	Then he went in board a fishing-boat , his disciples accompanying him ;
40008024	and behold , a sudden storm arose on the sea , so that the boat began to be buried by the waves .
40008025	But he was asleep . And they came and woke him , saying . " Lord save us ! We are drowning ! "
40008026	" Why are you afraid ? " he said , " you men of little faith ! " Then he rose and rebuked the winds and the sea , and there came a great calm .
40008027	But the men were amazed , saying , " What manner of man is this , that even the winds and the sea obey him ? "
40008028	When he arrived on the other side , in the country of the Gadarenes , he was met by two demoniacs who were coming out of the tombs . They were so violently fierce that no one dared pass along that road .
40008029	" You Son of God , " they shouted , " what have you to do with us ? Are you come to torment us before the time ? "
40008030	Now there was , at some distance from them , a herd of many swine feeding ;
40008031	and the demons began entreating him . " If you are driving us out , " they said , " send us into the herd of swine . "
40008032	He answered , " Go ! " So they came out of the men , and went into the swine , and behold ! the entire herd rushed headlong down from the cliff into the sea , and perished in the water .
40008033	The swineherds fled . They went away into the city and told all about it , and what had befallen the demoniacs .
40008034	At once all the citizens came out to meet Jesus ; and when they had seen him , they begged him to move away from their country .
40009001	So he went on board , crossed the sea , and came to his own city .
40009002	And here they brought to him a paralytic lying on a bed . When Jesus saw their faith he said to the paralytic , " Courage , son , your sins are forgiven . "
40009003	And behold ! certain scribes said to themselves , " This man is blaspheming . "
40009004	And because Jesus knew well their thought , he said .
40009005	" Why do you think evil in your hearts ? For which is easier , to say Your sins are forgiven , or to say , Rise and walk ?
40009006	" But that you may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins " - he then says to the paralytic , " Rise , take up your bed , and go to your home . "
40009007	And he rose and went to his home .
40009008	But all the crowd were awestruck , and glorified God , who had given such power to men .
40009009	As Jesus was passing thence , he saw a man called Mathew sitting at the tax-office , and said to him , " Follow me . "
40009010	And he rose and followed him . And while he was at table in Matthews house , there came many tax-gatherers and sinners , and they dined with Jesus and his disciples .
40009011	When the Pharisees saw it , they kept saying to his disciples , " Why does your Teacher eat with the tax-gatherers and sinners ? "
40009012	" It is not those who are well , " said Jesus , when he heard this , " but the sick , who need a doctor .
40009013	" But go and learn what this means , " It is mercy I desire , and not sacrifice ; for I am come not to call just men , but sinners . "
40009014	At that time the disciples of Johncame and asked him , " Why are we and the Pharisees always fasting , while your disciples are not ? "
40009015	" Can the friends fast at a wedding-feast , " said Jesus , " so long as the bridegroom is with them ? But the days will come when the bridegroom has been taken from them , and then they will fast .
40009016	" No one ever sews a piece of undressed cloth on an old cloak . If they did , the patch put on to fill it up would tear away from the cloak , and the rent be made worse .
40009017	" Nor do they put new wine into old wine-skins ; if they did , the wine-skins would split , the wine would run out , and the skins be ruined . Instead , they put new wine into fresh wine-skins and both are preserved . "
40009018	As he was saying these words to them , a ruler came up and knelt before him , saying . " My daughter has just died ; but come , put your hand upon her , and she will live . "
40009019	And Jesus rose and followed him , and so did his disciples .
40009020	But a woman who had had a hemorrhage for twelve years came up behind him , and touched the tassel of his cloak .
40009021	For she said to herself , " If only I can touch his cloak , I shall be cured . "
40009022	But Jesus turned and saw her and said , " Be of good courage , daughter , your faith has healed you . " And the woman was healed from that hour .
40009023	Now when Jesus had come into the house of the ruler , and had seen the flute-players and the wailing crowd , he said ,
40009024	" Leave the room , for the little girl is not dead , she is sleeping . " And they began laughing at him .
40009025	When , however , the crowd had been driven out , he went in and took her hand , and the little girl woke up .
40009026	And the report of this spread throughout that whole region .
40009027	And as he went on from thence two blind men followed Jesus , crying , " Have pity on us , Son of David ! "
40009028	And when he had gone indoors , they came to him . " Do you believe that I can do this ? " asked Jesus . " Yes , Lord , " they answered .
40009029	Then he touched their eyes , saying " According to your faith be it unto you , " and their eyes were opened .
40009030	Jesus charged them sternly , saying , " See to it that you let no one know . "
40009031	But they went and published his fame in that whole region .
40009032	And as they were departing a dumb demoniac was brought to him ,
40009033	and when he had driven out the demon , the dumb spoke . The crowds were amazed , saying , " Never was such a thing seen in Israel ! "
40009034	But the Pharisees kept saying , " It is in the power of the Prince of the demons that he is casting out demons . "
40009035	And Jesus continued to go throughout all the cities and towns , teaching in the synagogues , preaching the gospel of the kingdom , and healing every kind of disease and infirmity .
40009036	And when he saw the crowds he had compassion on them because they were distressed and fainting , like sheep without a shepherd .
40009037	And he said to his disciples . " The harvest is great , but the laborers are few ;
40009038	" therefore beseech the Lord of the harvest to thrust forth laborers into his harvest field . "
40010001	And when he had called his twelve disciples to him , he gave them power over evil spirits , to cast them out , and to heal every kind of disease and infirmity .
40010002	These are the names of the apostles ( missionaries ) . First , Simon who is called Peter , and Andrew , his brother ; Jamesthe son of Zebedee , and John , his brother ;
40010003	Philip and Bartholomew ; Thomas , and Matthew , the tax-gatherer ; James , the son of Alphaeus , and Lebbaeus , whose surname is Thaddeus ;
40010004	Simon the Zealot , and Judas Iscariot who betrayed him .
40010005	These men , the Twelve , Jesus sent forth , after giving them the following instructions . " Do not go among the Gentiles , or enter any Samaritan town ,
40010006	" but rather be on your way to the lost sheep of the house of Israel .
40010007	" As you go , preach , saying , The kingdom of heaven is at hand .
40010008	" Heal the sick , raise the dead , cleanse the lepers , cast out demons . Freely you have received , freely give .
40010009	" Take no gold or silver or coppers in your purses ;
40010010	" not even a bag for the journey , or a change of clothes , or sandals , or even a stick ; for the worker is worth his rations .
40010011	" Into whatever city or town you enter , inquire for some worthy person there , and stay with him until you leave .
40010012	" When you enter the house , salute it ;
40010013	" and if the house is worthy let your blessing sit upon it ; but if it be unworthy , let your blessing return to you .
40010014	" And whoever will not receive you or listen to your words , as you go out from that house or that city , shake off the very dust from your feet .
40010015	" I tell you solemnly it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the Day of Judgment than for that town .
40010016	" Behold , it is I who am sending you forth like sheep among wolves . Be then as serpents and as guileless as doves .
40010017	" But beware of men ! For they will give you up to the Sanhedrin , and flog you in their synagogues .
40010018	" And you will be taken before governors and kings for my sake , as a testimony to them and to the Gentiles .
40010019	" But whenever they apprehend you , do not be anxious about how you shall speak or what you shall say ; for it will be given you in that very hour what to say .
40010020	" For it will not be you who is speaking , but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you .
40010021	" And brother will betray brother to death , and a father his child ; and children will rise up against their parents and put them to death .
40010022	" You will be hated by all men because of my name ; and he who endures to the end shall be saved .
40010023	" But when they persecute you in one city , flee to the next . In solemn truth I tell you that you shall not have completed the cities of Israel , before the Son of man comes .
40010024	" A pupil is not above his teacher , nor a slave above his masters .
40010025	" It is enough for the pupil to fare like his teacher , and the slave like his master . If they called the master of the house Beelzebub , how much more , the members of his household .
40010026	" So do not fear them ; for there is nothing concealed which shall not be revealed , nor anything secret which shall not become known .
40010027	" What I am telling you is in the darkness , do you speak in the light ; and what is whispered in your ear , proclaim upon the housetops .
40010028	" Do not be afraid of those who kill the body , but cannot kill the soul ; but fear rather him who can destroy both soul and body in Gehenna .
40010029	" Are not two sparrows sold for a half-penny ? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground without your father .
40010030	" The very hairs on your head are all numbered .
40010031	" Cease to be afraid ! You are of greater value than many sparrows .
40010032	" Every one , then , who will confess me before men , I also will confess before my Father who is in heaven .
40010033	" But whoever disowns me before men , I also will disown before my Father who is in heaven .
40010034	" Do not suppose that I am come to bring peace on the earth ; I am come not to bring peace , but a sword .
40010035	" For I came to set " a man against his father , a daughter against her mother , a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law ;
40010036	" and a mans own household will be his enemies .
40010037	" He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me ; and he who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me ;
40010038	" and he who does not take his cross and follow after me is not worthy of me .
40010039	" He who has saved his life shall lose it ; and he who has lost his life for my sake shall find it .
40010040	" Whoever receives you is receiving me , and he who receives me is receiving Him who sent me .
40010041	" Whoever receives a prophet because he is a prophet , shall receive a prophets reward ; and whoever receives a righteous man , shall receive a righteous mans reward .
40010042	" And whoever gives to drink to one of these little ones a cup of cold water only , because he is a disciple , I tell you in solemn truth , he shall not lose his reward .
40011001	After finishing his instructions to his twelve disciples , Jesus left that place , in order to teach and to preach in the neighboring cities .
40011002	But when Johnheard , in the prison , what the Christ was doing , he sent by some of his disciples to ask him ,
40011003	" Are you the Coming One , or are we to look for someone else ? "
40011004	" Go and tell John , " was Jesus answer , " what you hear and see ;
40011005	" the lame are walking , the lepers are cleansed , the deaf are hearing , the dead are being raised up , and the gospel is being preached to the poor .
40011006	" And blessed is the man who finds no cause of stumbling in me . "
40011007	As these men started to go away , Jesus began to speak to the throngs , about John .
40011008	" What did you go out into the desert to behold ? " he asked ; " A reed shaken by the wind ? If not , what did you go out to see ? A man clothed in soft raiment ? Behold , those who wear soft raiment dwell in kings palaces !
40011009	" But why did you go ? To see a prophet ? I tell you , yes , and more than a prophet ;
40011010	" for this is he of whom it is written . " Behold , I send my messenger before my face , And he will prepare thy road for thee .
40011011	" In solemn truth I tell you that there has not arisen among those born of women a greater than Johnthe Baptist ; yet one of the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he .
40011012	" From the days of Johnthe Baptist until now , the kingdom of heaven suffers violence , and the violent take it by storm .
40011013	" For the prophets and the Law prophesied until John ;
40011014	" and , if you are willing to receive it , he is the Elijah who was to come .
40011015	" Let all who have ears , listen !
40011016	" To what shall I compare this generation ? It is like little children sitting in the market-place , who call to the other children ,
40011017	" saying . We have piped to you and you have not danced ; We have wailed , but you have not beaten your breasts .
40011018	" For Johncame neither eating nor drinking , and they said , He has a demon ;
40011019	and the Son of man came eating and drinking , and they say , Lo , a glutton and a wine-drinker , a friend of tax-gatherers and sinners ! Nevertheless , Wisdom is justified by her deeds . "
40011020	Then he began to upbraid the cities in which most of his mighty works had been done , because they had not repented .
40011021	" Woe unto you , Chorazin ! Woe unto you , Bethsaida ! Because if the mighty works which have been done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon , they would have repented , long ago , in sackcloth and ashes .
40011022	" Moreover , I tell you it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the Day of Judgment , than for you .
40011023	" And you too , Capernaum ! Will you be exalted even to heaven ? You shall go down to the Place of Death ! For if the mighty works had been done in Sodom which have been done in you , it would have remained until this day .
40011024	" I tell you , it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the Day of Judgment , than for you . "
40011025	At that time Jesus answered and said . " I praise thee , Father , Lord of heaven and earth , that thou hast hidden these things from the wise and wary , and hast revealed them to the children .
40011026	" Even so , Father , for so it seemed good in thy sight .
40011027	" Everything has been handed over to me by my Father ; neither does any one know the Son , except the Father , nor any one know the Father except the Son , and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him .
40011028	" Come unto me , all who labor and are heavy laden , and I will give you rest .
40011029	" Take my yoke upon you and learn of me , for I am gentle and humble in heart , and you will find rest for your souls .
40011030	" For my yoke is easy , and my burden is light . "
40012001	At that time Jesus walked through the wheatfields one Sabbath Day ; and his disciples were hungry , and began to pluck some ears of wheat and to eat them .
40012002	But the Pharisees , when they perceived it , said to him . " Look ! Your disciples are doing what it is not lawful to do on the Sabbath ! "
40012003	" Have you not read , " answered Jesus , " what David did when he was hungry , and his men , too ?
40012004	" How he went into the House of God , and there they ate the loaves of the Presence , which neither he nor his men were permitted to eat , but the priests only ?
40012005	" Have you not read in the Law how on the Sabbath the priests in the Temple break the Sabbath and are guiltless ?
40012006	" But I tell you that One is here who is greater than the temple .
40012007	" And if you knew what this means , " It is mercy I desire , not sacrifice ,
40012008	" you would not have condemned the guiltless . For the Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath . "
40012009	As he passed along he went into their synagogue , and there he saw a man with a withered hand .
40012010	And in order to get a charge against him they asked him , " Is it permitted to heal on the Sabbath ? " ( So that they might have something to accuse him . )
40012011	" Is there a man of you , " he replied , " who has but a single sheep , who will not lay hold of it and lift it out , if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath Day ?
40012012	" And how much more is a man worth than a sheep ? Therefore it is right to do good on the Sabbath . "
40012013	Then he said to the man , " Stretch out your hand . "
40012014	The man stretched it out , and it had become sound like the other . But when the Pharisees came out , they consulted together how they might destroy him .
40012015	So when Jesus knew it , he withdrew from that place , and numbers of people followed him .
40012016	He cured them all ; but he strictly forbade them to blaze abroad his doings ,
40012017	that the word spoken through Isaiah , the prophet , might be fulfilled .
40012018	Behold my servant whom I have chosen , My beloved , in whom my soul delights ; I will breathe my spirit upon him , and he shall announce justice to the Gentiles
40012019	He will not strive nor cry aloud , Nor shall anyone hear is voice in the streets
40012020	The bruised reed will not break ; The dimly burning wick will not quench ; Till he has led justice on to victory .
40012021	And in his name shall the Gentiles hope .
40012022	Then they brought to him a blind and deaf demoniac ; and he healed him , so that the dumb both spoke and saw .
40012023	And all the crowds were amazed , and he began to say , " Can this be the Son of David ? "
40012024	When the Pharisees heard it they said , " It is only by the aid of Beelzebub , the Prince of the demons , that this fellow is driving out demons . "
40012025	Because Jesus knew what was in their minds , he said to them . " Any kingdom divided against itself will become desolate ; and any city or household divided against himself will not stand .
40012026	" So if Satan drives out Satan , he is divided against himself ; how then will his kingdom stand ?
40012027	" And if I am casting out demons in the power of Beelzebub , in whose power do your sons cast them out ? So they themselves shall be your judges .
40012028	" But if it is in the power of the Spirit of God is already upon you .
40012029	" Or how can any one enter the strong mans house and carry off his goods without first binding the strong man ? Then he can rob his house .
40012030	" He who is not with me is against me ; and he who is not gathering with me , scatters .
40012031	" Therefore I tell you that every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven men ; but the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit shall not be forgiven .
40012032	" And if any man say a word against the Son of man , it shall be forgiven him ; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit , it shall not be forgiven him , either in this age or in that which is to come .
40012033	" Either make the tree good and its fruit good , or make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt ; for by its fruit the tree is known .
40012034	" You generation of vipers ! How can you speak good , when you are evil ? For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of . " When the time of fruit drew near , he sent his slaves to the vine-dressers seized to get his fruit .
40012035	" A good man out of his good treasure brings forth good ; and from his evil treasure a bad man brings out evil .
40012036	" I tell you that for every careless word that men speak they shall give account on the day of judgment .
40012037	" For by your words you will each be justified , and by your words be condemned . "
40012038	Then some of the Scribes and Pharisees accosted him . " Teacher , " they said , " we want to see some sign from you . "
40012039	In reply Jesus told them . " An evil and faithless generation seeks a sign , and no sign will be given them except the sign of the prophet Jonah .
40012040	" For just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the sea-monsters belly , so the Son of man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth .
40012041	" The men of Nineveh will stand up in the Judgment with this generation and condemn it , because they repented under the preaching of Jonah , and lo ! a greater than Jonah is here !
40012042	" The Queen of the South will rise in the judgment with this generation , and condemn it , because she came from the ends of the earth to listen to the wisdom of Solomon ; and lo ! a greater than Solomon is here !
40012043	" Whenever an unclean spirit leaves a man , it wanders through waterless places , seeking rest but finding none .
40012044	" Then it says , " I will go back to my house which I left ; and on arrival finds it empty , swept , and garnished .
40012045	" Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits worse than itself ; and they enter in and dwell there . And the last state of that man is worse than the first . So shall it be with this wicked generation . "
40012046	While he was still talking to the crowd , his mother and brothers were standing outside , desiring to speak to him .
40012047	So some one told him , " Your mother and brothers are standing outside , and wanting to speak to you . "
40012048	But he answered the man who told him , " Who is my mother and who are my brothers ? "
40012049	And stretching his hand toward his disciples , he said ,
40012050	" Behold my mother and my brothers ! For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven , is my brother and sister and mother . "
40013001	On that same day , after Jesus had left the house , he took his seat on the seashore ;
40013002	and such a great crowd gathered about him that he got into a boat and sat in it , while all the crowd stood on the beach .
40013003	Then he told them many truths in parables . " Behold , " he said , " the sower went forth to sow ;
40013004	and as he sowed , some seed fell by the roadside , and the birds came and ate it .
40013005	Some fell on rocky ground where there was not much earth . Now because it had no depth of soil , it sprang up at once ;
40013006	but when the sun rose it was scorched , and withered away because it had no root .
40013007	Some fell among thorns , and the thorns sprang up and choked it .
40013008	But some fell on good soil , and bore a crop , some a hundredfold , some sixty , some thirty .
40013009	He who has ears , let him hear ! "
40013010	Now when his disciples came up to him , they said ,
40013011	" Why do you speak to them in parables ? " Jesus answered . " To you it has been granted to understand the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven ; but to them it has not been granted .
40013012	" For whoever holds , to him shall more be given , and he shall have abundance ; but whoever does not hold , from him shall be taken away even what he holds .
40013013	" This is why I speak to them in parables , because seeing they do not see , and hearing they do not hear , nor do they understand .
40013014	And in them is being fulfilled that prophecy of Isaiah which says . " Hearing you will hear and not understand ; Seeing you will see and not perceive ;
40013015	For the heart of his people is made fat , Their ears are dull of hearing ; Their eyes , too , have they closed , Lest some day their eyes should perceive , And their ears should hear , And their heart should understand and turn , And I should heal them .
40013016	" But happy are your eyes , because they see , and your ears because they hear .
40013017	" In solemn truth I tell you that many prophets and holy men have seen it not , and to hear what you are hearing , and have not heard it .
40013018	" Listen then , to the parable of the sower .
40013019	" Whenever any one hears the message of the kingdom , and does not understand it , the Evil One comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart .
40013020	" This is the seed sown by the wayside . And the word , and at once receives it with joy .
40013021	" But he has no root in himself ; he continues for a time , but when trouble arises , or persecutions , on account of the word , at once he stumbles and falls .
40013022	" And the seed sown among thorns is he who hears the word , but the anxieties of the age and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word , and it becomes unfruitful .
40013023	" But the seed sown in good soil is he who hears the word and understands it , who indeed bears fruit , and makes now an hundredfold , now sixty , now thirty . "
40013024	He told them another parable . " The kingdom of heaven , " he said , " is like a man who sowed good seed in his field ;
40013025	" but while men were asleep his enemy came and sowed tares among his wheat and went away .
40013026	" And when the blade shot up and formed the wheat-kernel , then the tares also appeared .
40013027	" The slaves of the owner went to him and said . " Was it not good seed , sir , that you sowed in your field ? From whence then , do you get tares ?
40013028	" It is an enemy who has done this , he answered . " The slaves said to him , Do you want us to go and collect them ?
40013029	" No , he answered , for fear lest while you are collecting the tares , you at the same time pull up the wheat .
40013030	" Let both grow together until harvest , and at harvest-time I will tell the reapers to first gather the tares and tie them in bundles for burning , but to bring all the wheat into my store-house . "
40013031	He set forth to them another parable , saying . " The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard-seed which a man took and planted in his field .
40013032	" This is indeed the smallest of seeds , but when it is grown it is greater than any herb , and becomes a tree , so that the winged things of the sky come and roost in its branches . "
40013033	He told them another parable . He said , " The kingdom of heaven is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour , until the whole was leavened . "
40013034	Jesus told all this to the crowd in parables ; indeed he never spoke to them except in parables ,
40013035	in fulfilment of the word spoken by the prophet , I will open my mouth in parables , I will utter things kept secret since the foundation of the world . "
40013036	After he had sent the people away and gone into the house , his disciples came to him and said , " Explain to us the parable about the weeds in the field . "
40013037	" The sower of the seed , " he answered , " is the Son of man ;
40013038	" the field is the world ; the good seed is the sons of the kingdom ; the weeds , the sons of the Evil One .
40013039	" The enemy who sows the weeds is the Devil . The harvest is the end of the age . The reapers are the angels .
40013040	" Just as the weeds are collected together and burnt with fire , so will it be at the end of the age .
40013041	" The son of man will send forth his angels , and they will gather out of his kingdom all hindrances , and whoever practises iniquity ,
40013042	" and will throw them into the fiery furnace . There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth .
40013043	" And then shall the just shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of their Father . Let him who has ears to hear , listen !
40013044	" The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure buried in the ground , which a man finds but buries again , and then in his joy goes and sells all that he has and buys that land .
40013045	" Again , the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of beautiful pearls .
40013046	" When he finds one of great price , he goes and sells everything he has and buys it .
40013047	" Again , the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea and gathered fish of every kind .
40013048	" When it was full they hauled it upon the beach , and sat down and sorted the good fish into baskets , but threw the worthless fish away .
40013049	" So will it be at the end of the age . The angels will go forth and separate the wicked from the righteous , and fling them into the furnace of fire .
40013050	" There shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth .
40013051	" Have you understood all this ? " he asked . " We have , " they answered him .
40013052	" Then , " said he , " every scribe who has been instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his storehouse new things and old . "
40013053	After Jesus had finished these parables , he withdrew from that place ,
40013054	and came into his own country , where he continued teaching the people in their synagogues , until they were amazed . " Where did he get such wisdom ? " they said , " and such wondrous powers ?
40013055	" Is not this the carpenters son ? Is not his mother called Mary ? and his brothers Jamesand Joseph and Simon and Judas ?
40013056	" Are not his sisters all living among us ? Where , then , did he get all these powers ? "
40013057	This kept them from believing in him . Wherefore Jesus said , " A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and among his own family . "
40013058	And he did no mighty works there , because of their lack of faith .
40014001	Just then Herod , the Tetrarch , heard of Jesus fame , and said to his courtiers .
40014002	" This man is Johnthe Baptist ; he is risen from the dead . That is why miraculous powers are working through him . "
40014003	For Herod had apprehended John , shackled him , and thrust him into prison on account of Herodias , his brother Philips wife ,
40014004	because Johnkept telling him , " It is not right for you to have her . "
40014005	And although he wished to kill John , he feared the people , for they considered Johna prophet .
40014006	But when Herods birthday , the daughter of Herodias danced before the company ,
40014007	and so pleased Herod that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked for .
40014008	So , prompted by her mother , the girl said , " Give me at once , upon a dish , the head of Johnthe Baptist . "
40014009	The king was displeased because of this , but because of his oaths and his guests he ordered it to be given her .
40014010	He sent and beheaded Johnin prison ;
40014011	the head was brought on a dish , and given to the young girl , who took it to her mother .
40014012	Then Johns disciples went and removed his body , and came and told Jesus .
40014013	When Jesus heard it he went away privately by boat to a lonely spot ; but the crowds heard about it , and followed him on foot from the cities .
40014014	So when he landed he saw a great multitude , and felt compassion for them , and healed their sick .
40014015	As twilight fell , his disciples came to him and said . " This is a lonely spot , and the day is far spent ; send the crowds away , so that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food . "
40014016	" They need not go away , " said Jesus , " do you , yourselves , give them something to eat . "
40014017	" We have nothing here , " they replied , " except five loaves and two fishes . "
40014018	" Bring them here to me , " said Jesus .
40014019	Then he told the people to sit down on the grass , and after taking the five loaves and the two fishes , he looked up to heaven and blessed them . Then he broke the loaves and handed them to the disciples , and the disciples handed them to the crowds .
40014020	And they all ate and were fully satisfied , and they took up of the fragments that remained , twelve basketfuls .
40014021	Those who had eaten were about five thousand men , besides women and children .
40014022	Then he made his disciples get aboard the boat and precede him to the other side , while he sent away the crowds .
40014023	After he had sent the crowds away , he went up into the mountain alone , to pray . When night came he was there alone .
40014024	But the boat was already a long way from shore , buffeted by the waves , for the wind was contrary .
40014025	And in the fourth watch of the night he came toward them , walking upon the sea ,
40014026	but when the disciples saw him walking upon the sea , they were terrified . " It is a phantom , " they said , and cried out for fear .
40014027	But at once Jesus spoke to them , " Courage , " he said , " it is I . Fear not . "
40014028	Peter answered , " Master , if it is you , bid me come to you upon the water . "
40014029	" Come , " said Jesus . Then Peter got down from the boat and walked on the water to go to Jesus .
40014030	But when he saw the wind , he was afraid , and as he began to sink , he cried out , " Master , save me ! "
40014031	At once Jesus stretched out his hand and caught hold of him , saying to him . " O little faith ! What made you doubt ? "
40014032	Then as they climbed into the boat the wind grew weary ,
40014033	and the men in the boat fell upon their knees before him , saying , " You are , indeed , the Son of God . "
40014034	Then they crossed over and came to land at Gennesaret ;
40014035	and when the men of that country recognized him , they sent into all the country round about , and brought to him all the sick ,
40014036	and kept begging him to let them touch the tassel of his cloak - and all who touched were completely cured .
40015001	Then some Scribes and Pharisees from Jerusalem came to Jesus , saying ,
40015002	" Why do your disciples keep transgressing the tradition of the elders by not washing their hands before eating ? "
40015003	" And why do you also keep transgressing the command of God by your tradition ? " he asked .
40015004	" For God said , Honor your father and mother , and , Let him who reviles father or mother be put to death ;
40015005	but you say that whoever tells his father or mother , Whatever of mine might have been of service to you is dedicated to God ,
40015006	is in no way bound to honor his father . Thus do you make void the word of God by your tradition !
40015007	Hypocrites ! Well did Isaiah prophesy concerning you , saying .
40015008	This is a people that honors me with their lips , But their heart is far from me .
40015009	In vain do they worship me , While they teach doctrines that are the commands of men . "
40015010	Then Jesus called the people to him and said .
40015011	" Listen , and pay attention . It is not what goes into a mans mouth that defiles him , but what comes out of it , that defiles the man . "
40015012	Then his disciples came to him and said , " Do you know that the Pharisees were scandalized when they heard that saying ? " He replied .
40015013	" Any plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted .
40015014	" Let them alone . They are blind men leading the blind ; and if one blind man leads another , both of them will fall into a ditch . "
40015015	Then Peter said to Jesus , " Explain the parable to us . "
40015016	He answered . " Are even you still without understanding ?
40015017	" Do you not know how all that goes into the mouth passes into the stomach and is afterward evacuated ;
40015018	while what comes out of the mouth comes from the heart - and that is what defiles a man .
40015019	For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts , murder , adultery , unchastity , theft , perjury , slander .
40015020	These are the things that defile a man ; to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man . "
40015021	Jesus then left that place , and withdrew into the region of Tyre and Sidon .
40015022	Behold , there came to him a Canaanite woman of those parts . She wailed loudly , saying . " Pity me , Lord , thou Son of David ! My daughter is possessed of an evil spirit . "
40015023	But he answered her not a word . Then the disciples came up and kept beseeching him . " Send her away , " they said , " because she wails after us . "
40015024	In reply he said , " I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel . "
40015025	But the woman came and knelt to him and said , " Lord , do help me . "
40015026	He answered , " It is not seemly to take the childrens bread and throw it to the little dogs . "
40015027	" True , Lord , " she said , " but even the little dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters table . "
40015028	Then Jesus answered her . " O woman , great is your faith . It shall be for you even as you desire . " And from that hour her daughter was healed .
40015029	On leaving that place Jesus went along the shore of the Sea of Galilee ; and after climbing a hill , took his seat there .
40015030	Great crowds came to him , bringing the crippled , the blind , the maimed , the dumb , and many others . They laid them at his feet and he healed them ;
40015031	so that the crowd wondered when they saw the dumb speaking , the cripples walking , and the blind seeing . And they glorified the God of Israel .
40015032	But Jesus called his disciples to him and said . " My heart yearns over the crowd , for they have been with me now three days , and they have nothing to eat . I am not willing to send them away hungry , for fear they faint on the road . "
40015033	" In a lonely place like this , " asked the disciple . " where can we get bread enough to satisfy such a crowd ? "
40015034	" How many loaves have you ? " answered Jesus . They replied , " Seven , and a few small fish .
40015035	So when he had summoned the crowd , and seated them upon the ground ,
40015036	he took the seven loaves and the fish , and gave thanks , then he broke them and gave them to his disciples , and the disciples to the crowd .
40015037	And all ate and were satisfied , and of the fragments that remained they gathered seven large basketfuls .
40015038	And those who ate numbered four thousand , besides the women and children .
40015039	When he had sent the crowds away , he got into the boat and came into the region of Magadan .
40016001	Then the Pharisees and Sadducees came to him , and in order to test him , asked him to show them a sign from heaven .
40016002	In answer he said . " In the evening you say , It will be fine weather , for the sky is red as fire ;
40016003	and at dawn you say , It will storm today , for the sky is red and lowering . You know how to discern the look of the sky , but the signs of the times you cannot read .
40016004	A wicked and faithless generation is seeking a sign , but no sign shall be given it but the sign of Jonah . " So he left them and went away .
40016005	When his disciples reached the other side of the lake , they had forgotten to bring bread .
40016006	Presently Jesus said to them , " Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees . "
40016007	And they began discussing it among themselves , saying , " It is because we did not bring any bread . "
40016008	When Jesus knew it he said . " Weaklings in faith ! Why are you arguing among yourselves , because you have no bread ?
40016009	" Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand , and how many large basketfuls you took up ?
40016010	" Nor the seven loaves for the four thousand , and how many large basketfuls you took up ?
40016011	" How is it that you do not perceive that I did not speak to you concerning bread ? But beware off the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees ! "
40016012	Then they realized that he had not told them to beware of the leaven , but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees .
40016013	When Jesus came into the neighborhood of Caesarea Philippi , he asked his disciples , " Who do people say that the Son of man is ? "
40016014	They replied , " Some say Johnthe Baptist ; others , however , say that He is Elijah ; others , Jeremiah , or One of the Prophets . "
40016015	" And who do you say that I am ? " he asked them .
40016016	So Simon Peter answered , " You are the Christ , the Son of the living God . "
40016017	" Blessed are you , Simon , Son of Jonah , " said Jesus ; " for flesh and blood have not revealed this to you , but my Father who is in heaven !
40016018	" Moreover I say to you that you are Petros ( a rock ) , and on this petra ( rock ) I will build my church , and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against her .
40016019	" I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven ; and whatever you bind upon the earth shall be bound in the heavens , and whatever you loose upon earth shall be loosed in the heavens . "
40016020	Then he enjoined his disciples to tell no one that he was the Christ .
40016021	After this Jesus the Christ began to show his disciples how he must go to Jerusalem , and suffer many things at the hands of the elders and chief priests and Scribes , and be put to death , and on the third day be raised again .
40016022	Then Peter took him aside and began to reprove him , saying . " God forbid , Master ! That shall never befall you . "
40016023	But he turned and said to Peter . " Get behind me , Satan ! You are a stumbling-block to me , because you are not intent on what pleases God , but what pleases men . "
40016024	Then Jesus said to his disciples . " If any man wishes to come after me , let him renounce self , take up his cross , and follow me .
40016025	For he who wants to save his life will lose it ; but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it .
40016026	What will it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul ? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul ?
40016027	For the Son of man is about to come in the glory of his Father , and his angels with him , and then will he reward each one in accordance with his actions .
40016028	Solemnly I tell you , some of those who are standing here shall not taste death , till they have seen the Son of man coming in his kingdom .
40017001	Six days later Jesus took with him Peter and Jamesand his brother John , and led them up a high mountain , by themselves apart .
40017002	Here he was transfigured before them ; his face shone like the sun , and his garments became as white as the light .
40017003	And behold ! Moses and Elijah appeared to them , talking with Jesus .
40017004	Then Peter said to Jesus . " Master , it is good that we are here ! If you are willing I will make here three tents , one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . "
40017005	While he was yet speaking , behold ! a luminous cloud overshadowed them ; and a voice out of the cloud , saying . " This is my Son , my Beloved , in whom is my delight . Listen to him . "
40017006	When the disciples heard this , they fell on their faces and were terrified .
40017007	But Jesus came to them and touched them , saying , " Rise , have no fear ! "
40017008	And when they raised their eyes they saw no one save Jesus only .
40017009	While they were going down from the mountain , Jesus laid a command on them . " Speak to no man about the vision , " he said , " until after the Son of man has been raised from the dead . "
40017010	And his disciples asked him , saying , " Why then do the Scribes say that Elijah must first come ? "
40017011	And he answered . " Elijah is coming , and will restore all things .
40017012	" Nay , I say to you that Elijah has come already , and they did not recognize him , but did to him whatever they chose . Even so the Son of man also is about to suffer at their hands . "
40017013	Then the disciples divined that he had been speaking to them about John , the Baptist .
40017014	As they reached the crowd , a man came up to Jesus , and fell on his knees before him , saying .
40017015	" Master , take pity on my son , for he is an epileptic and sore distressed . Often he falls into the fire and often into the water .
40017016	" And I brought him to your disciples , but they could not cure him . "
40017017	In reply Jesus said . " O faithless and perverse generation , how long shall I be with you ? How long shall I endure you ? Bring him here to me ! "
40017018	Then Jesus rebuked the evil spirit , and it came out of him ; and the boy was cured from that very hour .
40017019	Thereupon Jesus disciples came to him and asked him privately , " Why were we not able to cast it out ? "
40017020	" Because of your little faith , " he answered . " In solemn truth I tell you that if you have faith the size of a mustard-seed , you can say to this mountain , Move from this place to that ! and it will move ; and nothing will be impossible to you .
40017021	" But this kind is driven out by prayer alone . "
40017022	As they continued going from place to place in Galilee , Jesus said to them . " The Son of man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men ;
40017023	" and they will kill him , but on the third day he will rise again . " And they were greatly grieved .
40017024	As they came into Capernaum the collectors of the temple tax came to Peter and asked , " Does not your Teacher pay the temple tax ? "
40017025	" Indeed he does , " answered Peter . But on Peters entering the house , Jesus forestalled him , saying . " How does it seem to you , Simon ? From whom do earthly kings collect customs or taxes-from their own people , or from aliens ? "
40017026	And when he replied , " From aliens , " Jesus said . " Then their people go free .
40017027	" Nevertheless , that we may not give offense , go to the seaside , throw in your hook ; take the first fish that rises , and when you have opened its mouth , you will find a shekel in it . Take it and give it to them for us both . "
40018001	At that hour his disciples came to Jesus and asked him , " Who is really greatest in the kingdom of heaven ? "
40018002	When he had called a little child to him , Jesus set him among them , and answered .
40018003	" In solemn truth I tell you that unless you turn and become like little children , you will not even enter the kingdom of heaven .
40018004	" Whoever therefore will humble himself like this little child , is greatest in the kingdom of heaven ;
40018005	" and whoever receives one such child for my sake , receives me .
40018006	" But whoever shall cause one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble , it would be better for him if a great millstone were hung about his neck , and he were drowned in the depths of the sea .
40018007	" Woe unto the world because of such stumbling-blocks ! They will surely come , but woe unto each man by whom they come !
40018008	" If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble , cut it off and cast it from you . It is better for you to enter into life maimed or crippled , than to keep both hands or both feet and be cast into the everlasting burning .
40018009	" If your eye keeps causing you to stumble , pluck it out and cast it from you . It is better for you to enter into life with only one eye , than to keep both eyes and be cast into the Gehenna of fire .
40018010	" See to it that you never despise one of these little ones , for I tell you that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father in heaven .
40018011	" For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost .
40018012	" How does it seem to you , when a man has a hundred sheep and loses one of them ? Will he not leave the ninety and nine on the hills , to go and search for the one that has strayed ?
40018013	" And if he succeeds in finding it , I tell you solemnly that he rejoices over it more than over the ninety and nine that never strayed away .
40018014	" Just so it is not the will of my Father in heaven that one of these little ones should perish .
40018015	" If your brother sins against you , go and show him , between yourself and him alone . If he listens , you have won your brother .
40018016	" But if he will not listen to you , take one or two others along , so that by the testimony of two or three witnesses every word may be established . If he will not listen to them , tell the church ;
40018017	" but if he will not heed the church , let him be to you as a Gentile or a tax-gatherer .
40018018	" I tell you all in solemn truth that whatever you forbid upon earth will be forbidden in heaven , and whatever you permit on earth will be permitted in heaven .
40018019	" And again I tell you that if two of you on earth symphonize your praying concerning anything for which you have asked , it shall be done for you by my Father in heaven .
40018020	" For wherever there are two or three gathered together in my name , there am I among them . "
40018021	Just then Peter came to him , and asked him , " Lord , how often shall my brother sin against me , and I forgive him ? till seven times ? "
40018022	" I do not tell you till seven times , " answered Jesus , " but till seventy times seven .
40018023	" Thus the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his slaves .
40018024	" But when he began to settle , one of them was brought before him who owed him fifteen million dollars .
40018025	" And since he was unable to pay , his master ordered him to be sold , and his wife and children and all that he had , toward the payment of the debt .
40018026	" Thereupon his slave threw himself on his knees before him , crying , " Have patience with me , and I will pay you all !
40018027	" So then the master pitied his slave , and let him go , and forgave him his debt .
40018028	" But on his way out , that slave met a fellow slave who owed him fifty dollars . Seizing him by the throat , and nearly choking him , he exclaimed , " Pay me what you owe me !
40018029	" Then his fellow slave fell at his feet , and besought him , saying , " Be patient with me , and I will pay you .
40018030	" But he would not ; on the contrary he went and threw him into prison until he should pay the debt .
40018031	" When therefore his fellow slaves saw what had happened , they were very angry ; and they went and explained to their master all that had happened .
40018032	" Immediately his master summoned him and said . " You wicked slave ! I forgave you all that debt because you implored me .
40018033	" Ought not you also to have had pity on your fellow slave , just as I had pity on you ?
40018034	" Then in hot anger his master handed him over to the torturers , until he should pay him all his debt .
40018035	" So will my heavenly Father do to you also , unless from your heart each one of you forgive his brother . "
40019001	It came about after Jesus had finished these teachings , that he removed from Galilee , and went to that part of Judea which lay across the Jordan .
40019002	A great multitude followed him , and he healed them there .
40019003	Presently some of the Pharisees came up to him , and made test of him by asking , " Is it right for a man to divorce his wife for every cause ? "
40019004	" Have you not read . " he answered , " that He who created them from the beginning made them male and female , and said ,
40019005	" For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave to his wife ; and the two shall be one flesh ?
40019006	" Thus they are no longer two , but one . Therefore what God has joined together , let not man separate . "
40019007	They answered , " Why then did Moses command the husband to give her a written bill of divorce , and so to put her away ? "
40019008	" Moses , " said Jesus , " permitted you to divorce your wives on account of the hardness of your hearts , but from the beginning it was not so .
40019009	" And I tell you that any man who divorces his wife for any cause except her unfaithfulness , and marries another woman , commits adultery . "
40019010	" If that is the position of a man in relation to his wife , " answered the disciples , " it is better not to marry . "
40019011	He answered them . " Not all are accepting this teaching , but only those to whom it has been granted .
40019012	" For there are eunuchs who have been such from birth ; others who have been made such by men ; and others who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of God . He who is able to receive this , let him receive it . "
40019013	Then young children were brought to him , that he might lay his hands on them and pray . His disciples interfered , but Jesus said to them .
40019014	" Let the little children come to me , and forbid them not ; for it is to the childlike that the kingdom of heaven belongs . "
40019015	So he laid his hands upon them , and departed from that place .
40019016	But look ! a certain man came up to him and asked , " Teacher , what good thing shall I do to inherit eternal life ? "
40019017	" Why do you ask me about what is good ? " asked Jesus . " There is but One who is good . But if you want to enter into life , keep the commandments . "
40019018	" Which commandments ? " asked the man . Jesus replied . " Thou shalt not kill ; Thou shalt not commit adultery ; Thou shalt not steal ; Thou shalt not bear false witness ;
40019019	" Honor thy father and thy mother ; and , Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself . "
40019020	The young man answered . " I have carefully kept them all . What yet do I lack ? "
40019021	" If you want to be perfect , " said Jesus , " go , sell your property , give to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven ; and come , follow me . "
40019022	But when the young man heard this teaching , he went away sorrowful , for he was one who had much property .
40019023	So Jesus said to his disciples . " In solemn truth I tell you that a rich man will find it difficult to enter the kingdom of heaven .
40019024	" I tell you again , it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven . "
40019025	When they heard this the disciples were utterly astounded . " Who then can be saved ? " they exclaimed . Jesus looked at them .
40019026	" With men this is impossible , " he said , " but with God all things are possible . "
40019027	Whereupon Peter said to Jesus . " Look , Master , we have forsaken everything and followed you . Now what shall be our reward ? "
40019028	" In solemn truth I tell you , " Jesus answered , " that in the New Creation , when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory , you also who have followed me shall sit on twelve thrones , to govern the twelve tribes of Israel .
40019029	" And every one who has left houses , or brothers , or sisters , or father , or mother , or children , or lands , for my sake , shall many times as much , and fall heir to eternal life .
40019030	" But many who are first shall be last , and many who are last shall be first .
40020001	" For the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who went out at dawn to hire workmen for his vineyard .
40020002	" And when he had agreed with the workmen for two shillings a day , he sent them into his vineyard .
40020003	" About nine oclock he went out and noticed some other workmen standing idle in the market-place ;
40020004	" and he said to them , " Do you also go into the vineyard , and whatever is just I will pay you .
40020005	" So they went . Again at noon , and about three oclock , he went out and did the same thing .
40020006	" When he went out about five oclock , he found others standing around , and said to them , " Why have you been standing here idle , all the day long ?
40020007	" Because no one has hired us , they replied . " He said to them , Do you also go into the vineyard .
40020008	" And when evening came , the Lord of the vineyard said to his steward , " Call the workmen and pay them their wages , beginning with the last hired and ending with the first .
40020009	" When those came who had begun at five oclock , they received two shillings apiece ;
40020010	" and when the first came they supposed that they would get more , but they also received each two shillings .
40020011	" And as they took it they began to grumble against the master of the house .
40020012	" Those last men , they said , have toiled only one hour , and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden and the burning heat of the day .
40020013	" In reply he said to one of them . My friend , I am doing no wrong . Did you not agree with me for two shillings ?
40020014	" Take your wage and begone ! I chose to give to this last man the same as to you .
40020015	" Have I not the right to do what I choose with my own property ? Or is your eye evil because I am generous ?
40020016	" So the last shall be first , and the first , last . "
40020017	When Jesus was about to go up to Jerusalem , he took the Twelve aside by themselves , and as they went he said to them .
40020018	" Look ! We are on the way up to Jerusalem , and the Son of man will be betrayed to the chief priests and the scribes . They will condemn him to death ,
40020019	" and hand him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and scourged and crucified ; and on the third day he will rise from the grave . "
40020020	Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee , with her sons , kneeling down and begging a favor of him .
40020021	" What is it you wish ? " he said . She answered , " Command that these my two sons may sit upon your right hand and your left in your kingdom . "
40020022	" None of you indeed shall drink , " he answered , " but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant , but belongs to those for whom it has been prepared by my Father . "
40020024	When the ten heard of this , they were indignant at the two brothers ;
40020025	but Jesus called them to him and said . " You know how the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them , and their great men exercise authority over them .
40020026	" Not so shall it be among you . But whoever among you wishes to become great , shall be your minister ,
40020027	" and whoever wishes to be first among you , shall be your slave ;
40020028	" just as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto , but to minister , and to give his life as a ransom for many . "
40020029	Now as they were leaving Jericho a great crowd followed him .
40020030	And two blind men , sitting by the side of the road , heard that it was Jesus who was passing by , and cried out , " Have pity on us , Master , Son of David ! "
40020031	But the crowd checked them , to make them keep still . They cried out all the louder , saying , " Master , have pity on us , Son of David ! "
40020032	Then Jesus stopped and called to them , " What do you want me to do for you ? "
40020033	" Master , " they answered , " let our eyes be opened . "
40020034	Then Jesus , moved with compassion , touched their eyes , and they saw at once , and followed him .
40021001	And when they approached Jerusalem , and had reached Bethphage on the Mount of Olives , then Jesus sent two disciples , saying to them .
40021002	" Go on into the village facing you , and at once you will find an ass tied , and her colt with her . Loose them and bring them to me .
40021003	" And if any one says anything to you , tell him , The Master needs them , and he will send them without delay . "
40021004	This happened in fulfilment of the word spoken though the prophet .
40021005	Say to the daughter of Zion , " Behold thy King cometh to thee , Gentle and sitting upon an ass , And upon a colt , the fool of a beast of burden . "
40021006	So the disciples went and did as Jesus told them ;
40021007	they led back the ass and her colt , and placed their cloaks on them .
40021008	Then Jesus seated himself upon them , and most of the crowd kept spreading their cloaks on the road , and others began cutting branches off the trees , and spreading them in the road .
40021009	And the crowds who preceded and those who followed after him shouted again and again , " Hosanna to the Son of David ! Blessed be he who is coming in the name of the Lord ! Hosanna in the highest ! "
40021010	And as he came into Jerusalem , the whole city was stirred . " Who is this ? " they said .
40021011	And the crowds answered , " This is the Prophet Jesus , from Nazareth , in Galilee . "
40021012	Then Jesus entered into the Temple courts , and cast out all who were buying and selling there , and overturned the tables of the money-changers , and the seats of those who sold pigeons .
40021013	" It is written , " he said , " My house shall be called a house of prayer , but you are making it a den of thieves . "
40021014	Then the blind and the lame came to him in the Temple courts , and he healed them .
40021015	But when the chief priests and the Scribes saw the wonderful works he did , and the boys who were shouting in the Temple Courts and saying , " Hosanna to the Son of David ! "
40021016	they asked him , " Do you hear what they are saying ? " " Surely , " said Jesus , " and have you never read , Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise ? "
40021017	So he left them and went outside the city , to Bethany , and spent the night there .
40021018	At dawn , when he was on his way back into the city , he was hungry ;
40021019	and when he saw a solitary fig tree beside the road , he went to it , but found nothing on it but leaves . And he said to it , " Let no man gather fruit from you forever . " And at once the fig tree withered away .
40021020	When his disciples saw this , they were astonished . " How instantaneously , " they said , " the fig tree withered ! "
40021021	In reply Jesus said to them , " In solemn truth I tell you that if you have faith and never doubt , you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree , but even if you say to this mountain , Up , cast yourself into the sea ! it shall be done ;
40021022	" and everything that you ask for in your prayers you shall have , if you believe . "
40021023	When he had entered the Temple courts , and was teaching , the high priests and elders of the people came to him and asked him , " By what authority are you doing these things , and who gave you this authority ? "
40021024	Jesus answered . " I also will put a question to you , which , if you tell me , I also will tell you by what authority I am doing these things .
40021025	Johns baptism , whence was it , from heaven or from man ? " So they began debating about it among themselves .
40021026	" If we say , From heaven , he will ask us , Why then did you not believe him ? But if we say , From men , we are afraid of the crowd , for they all regard Johnas a prophet . "
40021027	So they answered Jesus , " We do not know . " He said to them , " Nor am I going to tell you in what authority I do these deeds .
40021028	" But give me your judgment . There was once a man who had two sons . He went to the first and said to him , " Son , go work today in my vineyard !
40021029	" I will go , sir , he answered ; yet he did not go .
40021030	" Then he went to the second , and said the same thing to him . " I will not , he answered ; but afterward he changed his mind and went .
40021031	" Which of these two did the will of his father ? " " The last , " they replied . " I tell you truly , " said Jesus , " that the tax-gatherers and harlots are going into the kingdom of heaven before you !
40021032	" For Johncame to you in the road of righteousness , and you did not give credence to him ; but the tax-gatherers and the harlots gave credence to him . But you , although you saw this , did not even then change your minds and give credence to him .
40021033	" Listen to another parable . " A man who was a householder planted a vineyard , fenced it about , dug a wine vat in it , built a tower , then rented it to vine-dressers and went abroad .
40021035	" And the vine-dressers seized his slaves , flogged one , killed another , and stoned a third .
40021036	" Again he sent other slaves , a larger number than at first , and they treated them in the same way .
40021037	" And last he sent his son to them ; Surely they will respect my son , he said .
40021038	" But when the vine-dressers saw his son , they said to themselves . " This is the heir . Come , let us kill him , and take his inheritance .
40021039	" So they took him and cast him out of the vineyard , and killed him .
40021040	" When therefore the lord of the vineyard comes , what will he do to those vine-dressers ? "
40021041	" He will utterly destroy those wretches , " they answered , " and will entrust his vineyard to other vine-dressers , who will pay back the fruits to him in their season . "
40021042	" Have you never read in the Scriptures , " Jesus answered , " how The stone that the builders rejected Has been made the corner-stone ; This is the Lords doing , It is wonderful in our eyes ?
40021043	" I tell you that for this reason the kingdom of God will be taken away from you , and will be given to a nation that does produce the fruit of it .
40021044	" He who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces ; but he upon whom it falls will be scattered as dust . "
40021045	As they listened to his parables , the chief priests and the Pharisees recognized that he was speaking about them ;
40021046	but although they longed to apprehend him , they were afraid of the crowds , because they held him to be a prophet .
40022001	Once more Jesus answered them in parables .
40022002	" The kingdom of heaven , " he said , " may be compared to a king who made a wedding-feast for his son .
40022003	" He sent out his slaves to summon the invited guests to the feast , but they did not want to come .
40022004	" Again he sent out other slaves . Tell the invited guests , he said , that my luncheon is now ready ; my oxen and fat cattle are killed ; everything is ready ; come to the wedding-feast .
40022005	" They , however , paid no attention , but went off , one to his own farm , another to his business ;
40022006	" while the rest seized his slaves and maltreated and murdered them .
40022007	" Then the kings wrath was roused , and he sent his troops and destroyed those murderers , and burned their city .
40022008	" Then he said to his slaves , " The wedding-feast indeed is ready , but the invited guests were not worthy .
40022009	" So go out into the partings of the highways , and summon everybody you find there to the wedding-feast .
40022010	" So those slaves went out into the roads , and gathered together all whom they found , good or bad , and the banquet-hall was filled with the guests .
40022011	" Then the king came in to inspect his guests , and he discovered there a man who had not put on a wedding-garment . He said to him ,
40022012	" Friend , how did you come in here without a wedding-garment ? " The man was speechless .
40022013	" Bind him hand and foot , said the king to his officers , and cast him into the outer darkness ; there will be the wailing and the gnashing of teeth .
40022014	" For there are many called , but few are chosen . "
40022015	Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how they might ensnare him during conversation .
40022016	So they sent their disciples to him , with the Herodians . " Teacher , " they said , " we know that you are honest , and that you are teaching the way of God in sincerity ; and are not afraid of any one , for you do not court mens favor .
40022017	" Give us your advice , then . Is it allowable to pay taxes to Caesar , or not ? "
40022018	And Jesus , because he knew their malice , said .
40022019	" Hypocrites ! Why are you tempting me ? Show me the tribute money . " So they brought him a shilling .
40022020	" Whose likeness and inscription is this ? " he asked .
40022021	" Caesars , " they answered . Then he said to them , " Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesars , and unto God the things that are Gods . "
40022022	When they heard this they were astonished , and left him and went away .
40022023	That very day there came to him some Sadducees , who say there is no resurrection . and they questioned him .
40022024	" Master , " they said , " Moses taught that if a man dies without issue , his brother is to marry the widow , and raise up a family for his brother .
40022025	" Now there were of our number seven brothers ; and the first married and died . As he had no children , he left his wife to his brother ;
40022026	" In the same way the second also died , and the third , unto the seventh .
40022027	" Last of all the woman died .
40022028	" In the resurrection , then , whose wife will she be ? They all had her . "
40022029	In answer Jesus said . " You err because you do not know the Scriptures , nor the power of God .
40022030	" For in the resurrection men do not marry , nor are women given in marriage , but they are like angels in heaven .
40022031	" But concerning the resurrection of the dead , did you never read what was spoken to you by God ,
40022032	" I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ? God is not the God of the dead , but of the living . "
40022033	And when the crowds heard it , they were astonished at his teaching .
40022034	As soon as the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees , they gathered themselves together ,
40022035	and one of them , a lawyer , tested him by asking a question .
40022036	" Master , which is the great commandment in the law ? "
40022037	Jesus answered , " Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy mind .
40022038	" This is the great and first commandment .
40022039	" The second , which is like it , is this , " Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself .
40022040	" On those two commandments hang the whole law and the prophets . "
40022041	Now while the Pharisees were together , Jesus put this question to them .
40022042	" What is your opinion concerning the Christ ? Whose Son is he ? " " Davids , " they answered .
40022043	" How then , " he said , " does David in the Spirit call him Lord , saying ,
40022044	" The Lord said unto my Lord , Sit thou on my right hand Until I put thine enemies beneath thy feet ?
40022045	" If David calls him Lord , how can he be his Son ? "
40022046	No one could answer him a word , nor did any one dare from that day to ask him another question .
40023001	Then said Jesus to the crowds and to his disciples .
40023002	" The Scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses seat ;
40023003	" therefore do and observe whatever they bid you ; but do not do as they do , for they preach , but do not practise .
40023004	" For they bind heavy burdens and lay them on mens shoulders , but they themselves will not lift a finger to move them .
40023005	" For they do all their good deeds to be gazed on of men . They widen their phylacteries ,
40023006	" and lengthen the tassels , and are fond of the best places at banquets , and the front seats in the synagogues .
40023007	" They enjoy salutations in the market-places , and to have men call them Rabbi .
40023008	" But you are not to be called Rabbi ; for one is your Teacher , and you are all brothers ;
40023009	" and call no one Father on earth , for One is your Father in heaven .
40023010	" And call no one Leader , because One is your leader , even the Christ .
40023011	" Whoever is great among you shall be your minister ;
40023012	" whoever exalts himself shall be humbled , and he who humbles himself shall be exalted .
40023013	" But woe unto you , Scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! You shut the kingdom of heaven in mens faces ; for you do not enter , yourselves , nor do you permit those who are about to come in , to enter .
40023014	( Is wanting in the oldest manuscripts . )
40023015	" Woe unto you , Scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! For you scour sea and land to make one proselyte , and when he is gained , you make him twofold more a son of hell than you are , yourselves .
40023016	" Woe unto you , blind guides , who say , If any one swears by the Sanctuary , it is nothing , but if any one swears by the gold of the Sanctuary , the oath is binding .
40023017	" You fools and blind ; for which is greater , the gold , or the Sanctuary which hallows the gold ?
40023018	" You say , too , that whoever swears by the offering that is upon it , his oath is binding .
40023019	" You blind ! Which is greater , the offering or the altar which hallows the offering ?
40023020	" He then , who swears by the altar , swears by it and by everything on it ;
40023021	" and he who swears by the Sanctuary swears by it and by Him who dwells therein ;
40023022	" and he who swears by heaven , swears by the throne of God and by Him who sits thereon .
40023023	" Woe unto you , Scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! For you tithe mint and anise and cummin , and neglect the weightier matters of the Law - justice and mercy and good faith ; these latter you ought to have done , and not to have left the former undone .
40023024	" You blind guides ! who strain out the gnat and swallow the camel !
40023025	" Woe unto you , Scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! For you clean the outside of the cup and the plate , but within they are filled with extortion and excess .
40023026	" You blind Pharisees , first clean the inside of the cup and of the plate , so that the outside of it may be clean also .
40023027	" Woe unto you , Scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! You are like white-washed sepulchers . They look beautiful without , but within they are filled with dead mens bones and all rottenness .
40023028	" Just so you also outwardly appear to men , just , but within you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness .
40023029	" Woe unto you , Scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! You rebuild the tombs of the prophets , and adorn the monuments of the righteous , and say ,
40023030	" If we had lived in the days of our fathers , we would not have been their comrades in the murder of the prophets .
40023031	" So you bear witness against yourselves , that you are the descendants of those who slew the prophets !
40023032	" Fill up then the measure of your fathers !
40023033	" You serpents ! You vipers brood ! How shall you escape the judgment of hell ?
40023034	" For this cause , behold ! I am sending you prophets and wise men and scribes . Some of them you will kill and crucify ; some of them you will scourge in your synagogues , and pursue from city to city ;
40023035	" that upon your heads may come every drop of innocent blood spilt upon the earth , from the blood of Abel , the just , to the blood of Zechariah the son of Berechiah , whom you murdered between the Sanctuary and the altar .
40023036	" In solemn truth I tell you that all these things will come upon this generation .
40023037	" O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , murdering the prophets , and stoning those who have been sent to you ! How often would I have gathered your children together , as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings , and you would not !
40023038	" Behold , your house is left to you desolate !
40023039	" For I tell you that never shall you see me again until you say , " Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord . " " nor did they know until the deluge came and swept them away ; so will be the coming of the Son of man .
40024001	Then Jesus left the Temple courts and was walking away , when his disciples came to point out to him the Temple buildings .
40024002	" You see all these buildings ? " he answered them ; " I tell you solemnly that there shall not be left here one stone upon another , that shall not be torn down . "
40024003	When he had seated himself on the Mount of Olives , his disciples came to him privately , saying , " Tell us , when will these things happen , and what will be the sign of your coming , and of the end of the age ? "
40024004	" Take care , " Jesus answered , " that no one mislead you ;
40024005	" for many will come in my name saying , I am the Christ , and will mislead many .
40024006	" And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars ; see to it that you are not afraid . Such things must happen , but the end is not yet .
40024007	" Such things must happen , nation , and kingdom against kingdom , and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places .
40024008	" All these things are the beginning of birth-pangs .
40024009	" Then they will deliver you up to suffer affliction , and will put you to death , and you will be hated by all nations for my names sake .
40024010	" And then many will stumble and fall , and will betray one another , and hate one another .
40024011	" Many false prophets will rise up and mislead many ;
40024012	" and because of the increase of iniquity the love of the majority will grow cold ;
40024013	" but he who endures to the end will be saved .
40024014	" And this gospel of the kingdom shall be proclaimed throughout the whole inhabited earth , for a testimony to the Gentiles , and then will come the end .
40024015	" So when you see the Abomination of Desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel , standing in the holy place let the reader take note of this ,
40024016	" then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains ;
40024017	" let him who is upon the housetop not go down to get the things in his house ,
40024018	" and the man in the field not turn back to get his cloak .
40024019	" Alas for thee women who are with child , and for the nursing mothers in those days !
40024020	" But pray that your flight may not be in the winter ; nor on a Sabbath ;
40024021	" for then shall be a time of great tribulation , such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now , no , and never shall be again .
40024022	" And if these days had not been shortened , no flesh would have been saved ; but for the elects sake these days will be cut short .
40024023	" If at that time any one should say to you , See , here is the Christ ! or There he is ! believe him not .
40024024	" For false christs and false prophets will arise , and will work great signs and wonders , so as to mislead , if it were possible , the very elect .
40024025	" See , I have forewarned you ! So if they say to you ,
40024026	" See , He is in the desert , do not go out there . " See , He is in the inner room , do not believe it .
40024027	" For just as the lightning flashes from the east , and is seen even to the west ; so will be the coming of the Son of man .
40024028	" Wherever the corpse lies , there will the vultures flock together .
40024029	" But immediately after the tribulation of those days , " The sun will be darkened , The moon will not shed her light , The stars will fall from the sky , And the powers of the heavens will be shaken .
40024030	" Then the signs of the Son of man will appear in the sky ; and then all the tribes of the earth will lament , when they see the Son of man coming upon the clouds of heaven , with power and great glory .
40024031	" And he will send forth his angels with a great sound of a trumpet , and they will gather his elect together from the four winds , from utmost heaven to utmost earth .
40024032	" Learn from the fig tree , her parable ; when her branches are become soft , and put forth leaves , you know that summer is near ;
40024033	" so you also , when you see these signs , know that He is near , at the very doors .
40024034	" I tell you in solemn truth , that the present generation shall not pass away till all these things happen .
40024035	" Heaven and earth will pass away , but my words will not pass away .
40024036	" But no one knows about that day and hour , not even the angels in heaven , nor the Son , but only the Father .
40024037	" And as were the days of Noah , so will be the coming of the Son of man .
40024038	" For just as in the days before the deluge they were eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , until the very day when Noah entered the ark ,
40024040	" At that time there will be two men in the field ; one will be taken , and one will be left .
40024041	" Two women will be grinding at the mill ; one will be taken and the other left .
40024042	" Keep guard then , for you do not know the day on which your Master is coming .
40024043	" But know this , that if the master of the house had known in what watch the thief was coming , he would have been on his guard , and would not have allowed his house to be broken into .
40024044	" Therefore you also must be ready , for in an hour when you do not expect him , the Son of man is coming .
40024045	" Who , then , is the faithful and prudent slave , to whom his master has entrusted his household , to give them their food in due season ?
40024046	" Blessed is that slave whom his Master , when he comes , shall find so doing .
40024047	" In solemn truth I tell you that he will set him over all his property .
40024048	" But if , because he is a bad slave , he should say to himself , My Master is a long time in coming ,
40024049	" and if he begins to beat his fellow slaves , and to eat or drink with the drunkards ,
40024050	" on a day when he is not expecting him , and at an hour which he does not know , the Master of that servant will arrive
40024051	" and will scourge him severely , and allot him a place among hypocrites , where will be weeping and gnashing of teeth . "
40025001	" Then will the kingdom of heaven be likened to ten maidens who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom and the bride .
40025002	" And five of them were foolish , and five were wise .
40025003	" The foolish took their lamps , but took no oil with them ;
40025004	" but the wise took oil in their flasks with their lamps .
40025005	" Now because the bridegroom tarried , they all fell to nodding and went on sleeping .
40025006	" But at midnight there arose a cry , " Behold , the bridegroom ! Go out to meet him !
40025007	" Then all those maidens rose and trimmed their lamps ;
40025008	" and the foolish said to the wise , " Give us some of your oil , for our lamps are going out .
40025009	" Not so , answered the wise , for there may not be enough for you and for us . Go to the shops , rather , and buy some for yourselves .
40025010	" And while they were going away to buy , the bridegroom came ; and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding-feast . And the door was shut .
40025011	" Afterwards the other maidens came and cried , " Lord , Lord , open unto us !
40025012	" In solemn truth I tell you , he replied , I know you not .
40025013	" Be watchful then , for you know neither the day nor the hour .
40025014	" For it is like a man going into another country , who summoned his slaves , and committed his property to their care .
40025015	" To one he gave five talents , to another two , and to another , one - to each according to his individual ability - and then set out on his travels .
40025016	" At once the man who had received the five talents went out and traded with them , and made five talents more .
40025017	" In the same way the one who got two talents made another two .
40025018	" But he who had received the one talent went off , and dug a hole in the ground , and hid his masters money .
40025019	" After a long time the master of those slaves came , and demanded a reckoning with them .
40025020	" The man who had received the five talents came , bringing five more , and said . " Master , five talents you entrusted to me ; see , I have gained five more .
40025021	" Well done , good and faithful slave , replied his master ; You have been faithful over many things . Enter into your masters joy .
40025022	" The second , who had received the two talents , came up and said . " Master , it was two talents that you entrusted to me ; see , I have gained two more .
40025023	" Well done , good and faithful slave , his master replied , You have been faithful over many things ; enter into your masters joy .
40025024	" Then the man who had received the one talent came up and said . " Master , I knew you were a hard man , reaping where you had not sown , and gathering where you had not scattered ;
40025025	" so I was afraid ; I went away and buried your talent in the earth . There , you have what belongs to you !
40025026	" You wicked and lazy slave , said his master . You say you knew that I reap where I have not sowed , and gather where I have not scattered ?
40025027	" Then you ought to have deposited my money with the bankers , and at my coming I should have received back my property with interest .
40025028	" So take away the talent from him , and give it to the man who has ten talents .
40025029	" ( For to every one who has , it shall be given , and he shall have abundance ; but from him who has not shall be taken away even what he has . )
40025030	" But cast out the worthless slave into the outer darkness ; there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth .
40025031	" But when the Son of man comes in his glory , and all the angels with him , then will he take his seat on the throne of his glory ;
40025032	" and all the nations will be gathered in his presence . And he will separate them one from another , as a shepherd divides his sheep from the goats ;
40025033	" and he will place the sheep on his right hand , and the goats on his left .
40025034	" Then he , the King will say to those on his right hand . " Come , my Fathers blessed ones , inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world .
40025035	" For I was hungry , and you gave me food ; I was thirsty , and you gave me drink ; I was a stranger , and you took me in ;
40025036	" I was naked , and you clothed me ; I was sick , and you visited me ; I was in prison , and you came to see me .
40025037	" Then shall the righteous answer him , saying . Master , when did we see you hungry and feed you ; or thirsty and give you drink ?
40025038	" When did we see you a stranger and take you in ; or naked and clothe you ?
40025039	" When did we see you sick or in prison , and come to see you ?
40025040	" In solemn truth I tell you , the King will answer them , that inasmuch as you have done it unto one of the least of these , my brothers , you have done it unto me .
40025041	" Then he will say to those also at his left hand . Depart from me , accursed ones , into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels ;
40025042	" for I was hungry , and you gave me no food ; I was thirsty , and you gave me no drink ;
40025043	" I was a stranger , and you took me not in ; naked , and you clothed me not ; sick , or in prison , and you visited me not .
40025044	" Then will they also answer , Master , when did we ever see you hungry , or thirsty , or a stranger , or naked , or sick , or in prison , and did not minister to you ?
40025045	" But he will reply , In solemn truth I tell you that inasmuch as you did not do it unto one of these least , you did not do it unto me .
40025046	" And these will go away into eternal punishment ; but the righteous into eternal life . "
40026001	Now it happened that after Jesus had finished all these discourses , he said to his disciples ,
40026002	" You know that the Passover is coming in two days , and the Son of man will be delivered up to be crucified . "
40026003	Then the chief priests and the elders of the people met together in the court of the palace of the high priest who was called Caiaphas ,
40026004	and they plotted together to get Jesus into their power by a trick , and to put him to death ;
40026005	but said they , " Not during the feast , for fear of causing a riot among the people . "
40026006	While Jesus was staying in Bethany , in the house of Simon the Leper ,
40026007	a woman came up to him who had an alabaster vase of very costly perfume , and poured it over his head , as he reclined at table .
40026008	when the disciples saw it , they were indignant , and exclaimed .
40026009	" Why is this waste ? This perfume could have been sold for a good sum , and the money given to the poor . "
40026010	But when Jesus understood it he said to them . " Why are you annoying the woman ? This is a beautiful deed she has done for me ;
40026011	" for the poor you have with you always , but me you will not always have .
40026012	" In pouring this perfume on my body , she was preparing me for my burial .
40026013	" In solemn truth I tell you that wherever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world , what she has done shall be told about , as her memorial . "
40026014	It was then that one of the Twelve , he who was called Judas Iscariot ,
40026015	went to the chief priests and said , " What are you ready to give me for betraying him to you ? " So they weighed him thirty pieces of silver ;
40026016	and from that time he kept looking for a chance to betray him .
40026017	On the first day of the feast of Unleavened Bread , the disciples came to Jesus and said , " Where do you want us to make preparation for you eat the Passover ? "
40026018	" Go into the city , " he answered , " to a certain man , and tell him . " The Teacher says . " My time is near . I am going to keep the Passover at your house , with my disciples . " "
40026019	The disciples did as Jesus told them , and made ready the Passover .
40026020	When evening came he reclined at table with the Twelve ;
40026021	and as they were eating , he said to them , " In solemn truth I tell you that one of you is going to betray me ! "
40026022	In deep distress they began to ask him , each in turn , " It is not I , is it , Master ? "
40026023	In reply he said . " One who has dipped his hand with me in the dish will betray me .
40026024	" The Son of man is indeed to go as it is written concerning him , but woe to that man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed . It were good for that man if he had never been born . "
40026025	In answer , Judas , who betrayed him , said , " Surely it is not I , Rabbi ? " He said to him , " Is it not ? "
40026026	And as they were eating , Jesus took bread and , when he had blessed it , he broke it and gave to his disciples , saying , " Take , eat , this is my body . "
40026027	And when he had taken the cup and given thanks , he gave it to them , saying .
40026028	" Drink from it , all of you ; for this is my blood of the Covenant , which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins .
40026029	" But I say to you , I will never again drink of this fruit of the vine , until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father . "
40026030	So after singing a hymn , they went out to the Mount of Olives .
40026031	Then Jesus said to them . " This very night even you will all stumble and fall away from me ; for it is written , " I will smite the shepherd , and the sheep of the flock will be scattered .
40026032	But after I am raised up I will go before you into Galilee . "
40026033	" If they all stumble and fall away from you , " answered Peter , " I will never do so ! "
40026034	Jesus said to him , " In solemn truth I tell you that on this very night , before cockcrow , you will deny me three times ! "
40026035	But Peter said to him , " Even if I must die with you , I will never deny you . " And so said all the disciples .
40026036	Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane , and said to his disciples , " Sit down here , while I go and pray yonder . "
40026037	And he took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with him , and began to be in anguish and sore distress ,
40026038	and he said to them . " My soul is an anguish , even unto death ! Stay here , and keep watch with me . "
40026039	Then he went forward a short distance , and fell on his face and prayed . " O , my Father , if it be possible , let this cup pass from me ; nevertheless , not as I will , but as thou wit . "
40026040	Then he came to his disciples , and found them asleep , and said to Peter . " So you were none of you strong enough to watch with me even one hour !
40026041	" Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation . The spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak . "
40026042	Then he went away again a second time and prayed , saying , " O , my Father , if this cup cannot pass except I drink it , Thy will be done . "
40026043	He came again and found them sleeping , for their eyes were heavy .
40026044	So he left them and went away again , and prayed the third time in the same words as before .
40026045	Then he came to the disciples and said . " Sleep on now , and take your rest . Look ! the hour is at hand ; the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of wicked men .
40026046	" Rouse yourselves ! Let us go . My betrayer is close at hand ! "
40026047	Barely had he spoken these words when Judas , one of the Twelve , appeared , accompanied by a great crowd of men with swords and staves , from the chief priests and elders of the people .
40026048	Now his betrayer had given them a sign , saying . " Whoever I kiss is the man ; arrest him . "
40026049	So he came straight up to Jesus and said , " Hail , Rabbi ! " and kissed him eagerly .
40026050	" Friend , do that for which you came , " said Jesus . Then they came forward and laid hands on Jesus , and arrested him .
40026051	And , behold , one of these who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword , and smote the slave of the high priest , and cut off his ear .
40026052	Then Jesus said to him . " Put back your sword into its place ! for all who take the sword will perish by the sword .
40026053	" Do you not suppose that I am able to appeal to my Father to furnish me at this very moment with twelve legions of angels ?
40026054	" But if I did , how could the Scriptures be fulfilled that say that thus it must happen ? "
40026055	Then Jesus said to the crowds . " Are you come out as against a robber , with swords and staves to arrest me ? Day after day , I sat in the temple courts teaching , and you did not apprehend me .
40026056	" But all this has happened in order that the Scriptures might be fulfilled . "
40026057	Then all his disciples forsook him and fled ; but those who had apprehended Jesus led him away to Caiaphas , the high priest , where the scribes and the elders had assembled .
40026058	Now Peter was following him , afar off , as far as the courtyard of the high priest ; and when he got in , he was sitting with the officers , to see the end .
40026059	And the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were trying to get false evidence against Jesus , in order that they might have him executed ;
40026060	but they found none , although many false witnesses came forward .
40026061	However , at last two came forward who said , " This fellow declared , I can destroy the Temple of God and build it in three days . "
40026062	Rising to his feet the high priest asked Jesus . " Do you make no answer ? What is it that these are testifying against you ? "
40026063	But Jesus kept silence . Again the high priest addressed him , " I adjure you by the Living God , tell us if you are the Christ , the Son of God ! "
40026064	" I am He , " Jesus answered ; " yet I tell you that from this time on you will see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of Power , and coming upon the clouds of heaven . "
40026065	Then the high priest tore his garments , saying . " He has spoken blasphemy ! What further need have we of witnesses ? For behold , now you have heard his blasphemy !
40026066	" What is your verdict ? " " He ought to die , " they answered .
40026067	Then did they spit in his face , and buffeted him ; and some struck him with the palms of their hands , and cried .
40026068	" Prophesy to us , you Christ ! Who is it who struck you ? "
40026069	Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard , and one of the maidservants came up to him and said , " You also were with Jesus , the Galilean ! "
40026070	But he denied it before them all ; " I do not know what you mean , " he said .
40026071	Soon afterward he went out into the porch , and another maid saw him , and said to those who were there , " This fellow certainly was with Jesus , the Nazarene ! "
40026072	And again he denied it with an oath , saying , " I never knew the man . "
40026073	A little later the bystanders came up and said to Peter , " You also are certainly one of them , for your speech betrays you . "
40026074	Then he began to curse and swear , saying , " I never knew the man . " Immediately the cock crew !
40026075	Then Peter recalled the word that Jesus had spoken , " Before the cock crow , you shall three times deny me " - and he went out and broke out into bitter weeping .
40027001	And when the morning came , all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus , how they might put him to death .
40027002	After they had bound him , they led him away , and handed him over to Pilate , the Roman Governor .
40027003	Then when Judas , his betrayer , saw that he was condemned , he repented and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders .
40027004	" I have sinned , " he said , " in betraying innocent blood ! " " What is that to us ? " they answered ; " you must see to that . "
40027005	And flinging down the silver into the Sanctuary , he rushed out , and went and hanged himself .
40027006	The chief priests took the money , and said , " It would be wrong to put it into the temple-treasury , because it is the price of blood . "
40027007	So after the consultation they bought the Potters Field with it , for a burial-place for strangers .
40027008	That is the reason why , to this day , the field is called " The Field of Blood . "
40027009	Then was fulfilled the word spoken by the prophet Jeremiah . And I took the thirty pieces of silver , the price of him who had been priced , whom certain of the Children of Israel had priced ;
40027010	and gave them for the Potters Field , as the Lord had appointed me .
40027011	Now Jesus stood before the Governor , and the Governor questioned him . " Are you the King of the Jews ? " he asked .
40027012	" it is as you say , " answered Jesus ; but while he was being accused by the chief priests and elders , he answered nothing .
40027013	Then Pilate said to him , " Do you not hear what they are testifying against you ? "
40027014	But he made no answer , not even to one charge ; insomuch that the Governor was greatly astonished .
40027015	Now it was the Governors custom , during the Passover , to release to the people any one prisoner whom they selected .
40027016	At that time they had a notorious prisoner named Barabbas .
40027017	So when they had assembled , Pilate said to them , " Whom do you want me to release to you , Barabbas , or Jesus who is called Christ ? "
40027018	He knew well that it was because of enmity that they had brought Jesus before him .
40027019	And while he was seated upon the judgment-seat , his wife had sent to him , saying , " Have nothing to do with that innocent man , for I have suffered many things today , in a dream , because of him . "
40027020	But the chief priests and the elders urged the crowds to ask for Barabbas , and to destroy Jesus .
40027021	So when Pilate said to them , " Which of the two do you want me to release unto you ? " they said , " Barabbas . "
40027022	And Pilate asked , " What then shall I do with Jesus , who is called Christ ? " What one voice they shouted , " Let him be crucified ! "
40027023	But Pilate said , " Why , what evil has he done ? " But they kept shouting the more fiercely , " Let him be crucified ! "
40027024	So when Pilate saw that he was accomplishing nothing , but that on the contrary a riot was threatening , he took water and washed his hands in the presence of the crowd , saying . " I am innocent of the blood of this man ; you must answer for it . "
40027025	All the people answered , " His blood be upon us and upon our children . "
40027026	Then he released Barabbas to them , but Jesus he scourged , and delivered to be crucified .
40027027	Then the soldiers of the Governor took Jesus into the Praetorium , and gathered all the battalion together .
40027028	They stripped him and put on him a scarlet robe .
40027029	And they twisted a thorny crown for him , and put it on his head , and placed a reed in his right hand . Then they knelt before him , in mockery , crying , " Hail , King of the Jews ! "
40027030	And they spit upon him , and took the reed and struck him on the head , again and again .
40027031	At last , when they had finished their mocking , they took the robe off , and put his own garments on him , and led him away to crucify him .
40027032	And as they went out they found a man of Cyrene , Simon by name , whom they compelled to go with them to carry his cross .
40027033	And when they came to a place called Golgotha ( the word means " Place of a Skull " ) ,
40027034	they gave Jesus wine to drink , mingled with gall . But after tasting it he refused to drink it .
40027035	After crucifying him , they parted his garments among them by casting lots .
40027036	Then they sat and watched him there .
40027037	They also placed above his head his accusation written , This is Jesus The King of the Jews
40027038	At that time two robbers , also , were crucified with him ; one on his right hand , the other on his left .
40027039	Those who passed by reviled him , wagging their heads saying .
40027040	" You who were going to destroy the Temple and build it in three days , save yourself ! If you are the Son of God , come down from the cross ! "
40027041	In like manner the chief priests , too , with the Scribes and elders , kept taunting him .
40027042	" He saved other , " they said , " himself he cannot save . He , the King of Israel ! Let him now come down from the cross , and we will believe on him !
40027043	He put his trust in God . let Him deliver him now , if He cares for him . For he said , I am the Son of God ! "
40027044	In the same way the robbers also who were being crucified with him , dept reviling him .
40027045	Now from noon darkness fell upon the whole land , until three oclock in the afternoon .
40027046	But at three oclock Jesus cried out in loud voice , " Eli , Eli , Lama Sabachthani ? " ( That is to say , " My God , my God , why hast thou forsaken me ? " )
40027047	When they heard this , some of the bystanders said " He is calling for Elijah ! "
40027048	At once , one of them ran , and took a sponge , and filling it with vinegar , put it on a reed , and gave him to drink .
40027049	But the rest said . " Let be ! Let us see whether Elijah is coming to save him ! "
40027050	And Jesus cried again with a loud voice , and yielded up his spirit .
40027051	And lo , the veil of the sanctuary was torn in two , from the top to the bottom ;
40027052	the earth quaked ; the rocks split ; the tombs were opened , and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised .
40027053	And coming forth out of the tombs , after his resurrection , they went into the holy city and appeared to many .
40027054	When the Roman captain and the soldiers who were with him , guarding Jesus , saw the earthquake and all that happened , they were greatly terrified and said , " Certainly this man must have been Gods Son . "
40027055	And there were present several women who were looking on from a distance ; they had followed Jesus from a Galilee , ministering to him .
40027056	among them being Mary Magdalene , Mary the mother of Jamesand Joses , and the mother of Zebedees sons .
40027057	When it was eventide , there came a rich man of Arimathea , named Josephus , who was himself a disciple of Jesus .
40027058	This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus .
40027059	Pilate then commanded that it be given over to him .
40027060	So Joseph took the body , and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth , and laid it in his own new tomb , which he had cut in the rock ; and after rolling a great stone against the opening of the tomb , he went away .
40027061	And Mary Magdalene was there , and the other Mary , sitting opposite the tomb .
40027062	The day after - that is , the day following the Preparation - the chief priests and Pharisees went in a body to Pilate and said .
40027063	" We recollect , Sir , that when he was living this imposter said , I will rise again after three days .
40027064	Now therefore give order to have the sepulcher securely guarded until the third day , for fear his disciples may come and steal him away , and then tell the people , He is risen from the dead ; and so the last error will be worse than the first . "
40027065	" You can have a guard , " said Pilate . " Go your way , make it as secure as you can . "
40027066	So they went and made the sepulcher secure , by sealing the stone in the presence of the guard .
40028001	At the end of the Sabbath , as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week , Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came down to see the sepulcher , when lo !
40028002	There had been a great earthquake ; for an angel of the Lord had come down from heaven , and gone and rolled away the stone , and was sitting upon it .
40028003	His appearance was like lightning , and his raiment white as snow .
40028004	The guards trembled for fear of him , and became like dead men .
40028005	But to the women the angel said . " You need have no fear , for I know that you are seeking Jesus , the Crucified One .
40028006	He is not here ; for he is risen , even as he said . Come , see the place where the Master was lying !
40028007	And go quickly and tell his disciples . He is risen from the dead ; he goes before you into Galilee ; you will see him there . Remember , I have told you . "
40028008	On this they ran quickly from the sepulcher , in fear and great joy , to tell the news to his disciples .
40028009	And behold ! Jesus himself met them , saying , " All hail ! " And they went up to him and clasped his feet and worshiped him .
40028010	Then Jesus said to them . " Fear not ! Go tell my brothers to depart into Galilee , and they will see men there . "
40028011	Now while they were on their way , some of the guard went into the city and told the high priest all that had happened .
40028012	And when they had met with the elders and conferred together , they heavily bribed the soldiers and told them to say ,
40028013	" His disciples came by night and stole him away , while we were asleep . "
40028014	" If this should reach the Governors ears , " they said , " we will satisfy him and screen you from punishment . "
40028015	So the soldiers took the money , and did as they were told ; and this story has been noised abroad among the Jews , and continues to this day .
40028016	But the eleven disciples went away to Galilee , to the mountain where Jesus had appointed them .
40028017	And when they saw him they worshiped him ; but some doubted .
40028018	And Jesus came forward to them and spoke to them , saying . " All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth .
40028019	Go , therefore , and make disciples of all nations , baptizing them into the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Spirit ;
40028020	teaching them to observe every command which I have given you . and lo ! I am with you alway , even unto the end of the world . "
41001001	Beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ , the Son of God ;
41001002	even as it is written in the prophet Isaiah , Behold , I am sending my messenger before your face to prepare your way .
41001003	The voice of one crying aloud . In the desert make ready a road for the Lord . Make his paths straight .
41001004	In the desert came Johnwho baptized , and preached a baptism of repentance for the remission of sins ;
41001005	and all the land of Judea , and all the people of Jerusalem , kept going out to him , and were baptized by him in the Jordan river , confessing their sins .
41001006	And Johnwas clothed with camels hair , and he had a leather girdle round his loins , and he ate locusts , and " honey of the wood . "
41001007	He made proclamation . " There is One mightier than I coming after me , and I am not worthy to stoop down and unfasten his sandal strap ;
41001008	I have baptized you in water , but he shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit . "
41001009	It was at that time that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee , and was baptized by Johnin the Jordan ;
41001010	and as soon as he rose from the water he saw the sky cleft asunder , and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him ,
41001011	and a voice from the sky . " Thou art my Son , my beloved ; in thee is my delight . "
41001012	Then the Spirit drove him at once into the desert ,
41001013	and he remained in the desert for forty days , tempted by Satan ; and he was among the wild beasts , but the angels were ministering to him .
41001014	After Johnhad been thrown into prison Jesus came into Galilee preaching the gospel of God .
41001015	" The time is now come , " he said , " and the kingdom of God is near ! Repent and believe the gospel . "
41001016	And as he was passing along by the sea of Galilee he saw Simon and Andrew , Simons brother , casting their net into the sea , for they were fishermen ;
41001017	so Jesus said to them , " Come after me , and I will make you to become fishers of men . "
41001018	At once they left their nets and followed him .
41001019	As he went a little farther on he saw James , the son of Zebedee , and Johnhis brother , who also were in their boat mending the nets .
41001020	Straightway he called them , and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants and went after him .
41001021	So they came to Capernaum , and as soon as the Sabbath Day came he went into the synagogue and began to teach .
41001022	They were astonished at his teaching , for he was teaching them with authority , not like the Scribes .
41001023	And at that very moment , there in their synagogue , a man in the grip of an unclean spirit shrieked out .
41001024	" What business have you with us , you Jesus of Nazareth ? Are you come to destroy us ? I know you who you are , the Holy One of God . "
41001025	But Jesus rebuked him , saying . " Be quit ! Come out of him . "
41001026	So the unclean spirit , after tearing him , came out of him with a loud cry ;
41001027	and every one was amazed so that they began questioning among themselves . " What does this mean ? A new teaching with authority ? He lays commands even upon unclean spirits and they obey him . "
41001028	And at once his fame spread everywhere through that part of Galilee .
41001029	On leaving the synagogue they went at once with Jamesand Johnto the house of Simon and Andrew .
41001030	Now Simons mother-in-law lay sick of fever , and without delay they told him about her .
41001031	So he came and took her hand and raised her up . The fever left her at once , and she began to wait upon them .
41001032	At evening when the sun had set , people came and brought to him all the sick and demon-possessed ,
41001033	and the whole town was gathered at the door .
41001034	He cured many who were ill with various diseases , and drove out many demons . But he did not allow the demons to speak , because they knew who he was .
41001035	In the morning he rose a great while before day and went out to a desert place , and there prayed .
41001036	And Simon and his companions hunted him up ,
41001037	and told him , " Every one is looking for you . "
41001038	" Let us go away , " he answered , " to the neighboring country towns , that I may preach there , too ; because for that purpose I came forth . "
41001039	So he went throughout Galilee , preaching in the synagogues and driving out demons .
41001040	One day a leper cane to him and besought him as he knelt down to him , saying , " If you choose , you are able to cleanse me . "
41001041	Jesus , moved with compassion , put out his hand and touched him , saying , " I do choose , be clean ! "
41001042	The leprosy at once left him , and he was made clean .
41001043	Jesus immediately sent him away , charging him sternly and saying .
41001044	" See you say nothing to any one ; but go your way , show yourself to the priest , and offer for your purification what Moses commanded for a testimony to them . "
41001045	But he went out and began to tell every one and to publish it broadcast , so that Jesus could no longer enter any town openly ; but he had to remain outside in lonely places , and people kept coming to him from every quarter .
41002001	Some days later when Jesus entered Capernaum again the news spread , " He is in the house " ;
41002002	and at once such a crowd gathered that there was no longer room for them , even around the door .
41002003	While he was speaking his message , they came bringing to him a paralytic , carried by four men .
41002004	When they could not get him near to Jesus because of the crowd , they removed the roof under which he stood , and after making an opening , they let down the cot on which the paralytic was lying .
41002005	Then Jesus , when he perceived their faith , said to the paralytic , " Son your sins are forgiven . "
41002006	But there were some Scribes sitting there who reasoned in their hearts .
41002007	" Why does this man speak like this ? He blasphemes . Who is able to forgive sins but One , God himself ? "
41002008	Jesus clearly perceived at once be the Spirit that they were thus reasoning in their hearts and said to them .
41002009	" Why do you reason thus in your hearts ? Which is easier , to say to the paralytic , Your sins are forgiven , or to say , Rise , take up your cot and walk ?
41002010	But to let you see that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins " - he said to the paralytic -
41002011	" I bid you rise , take up your cot , and go home . "
41002012	The man rose , at once took up his cot , and went out before them all ; at which they were all astounded , and gave God glory , saying , " We never saw anything like this . "
41002013	Then Jesus went again to the seaside , and the whole crowd kept coming to him , and he taught them .
41002014	As he was passing by he saw Levi , the son of Alphaeus , sitting in the tax-office ; and he said to him , " Follow me . " So he rose and followed him .
41002015	Later on Levi was sitting at table in his house , and together with Jesus and his disciples a number of tax-gatherers and sinners were guests , for there were many of them who used to follow him .
41002016	But when some scribes of the Pharisees saw him eating with the sinners and tax-gatherers , they said to his disciples , " Is he eating and drinking with tax-gatherers and sinners ? "
41002017	On hearing this Jesus said to them . " It is not the healthy who need a physician , but the sick . I did not come to call the righteous , but sinners . "
41002018	Now the disciples of Johnand the Pharisees were keeping a fast , and people came to ask him , " How is it that the disciples of Johnand the Pharisees are fasting , but your disciples are not ? "
41002019	" Can friends of the bridegroom fast while he is still with them ? " asked Jesus . " As long as they have the bridegroom with them , they cannot fast .
41002020	But the days will come when the Bridegroom will be taken away from them ; then , on that day , they will fast .
41002021	No one ever sews a piece of unshrunk cloth onto an old garment , otherwise the patch tears away from it - the new from the old - and a worse tear is made .
41002022	And no one ever pours new wine into old wine-skins , else the wine would burst the skins , and both wine and skins would be lost . New wine is poured into fresh wine-skins .
41002023	One Sabbath he was walking along through the wheat-fields , and his disciples , as they began to make their way across , were pulling the heads of wheat .
41002024	" Look , " said the Pharisees to him , " Why are they doing on the Sabbath Day what is against the law ? "
41002025	He answered them . " Have you never read what David did when he was needy and hungry , he and his men ?
41002026	How he went into the house of God when Abiathar was priest , and ate the consecrated bread , which none but priests may eat , and gave some to his men ?
41002027	" The Sabbath , " he told them , " was made for man , and not man for the Sabbath ;
41002028	so the Son of man is Master even of the Sabbath . "
41003001	Again he went into a synagogue where there was a man with his hand withered .
41003002	And they kept watching Jesus to see whether he would cure him on the Sabbath ; so as to have some charge to bring against him .
41003003	" Stand up , " Jesus said to the man with the withered hand , " and come forward . "
41003004	Then he asked them . " Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath Day , or to do harm ? to save a life , or to destroy it ? "
41003005	They were silent . Then looking around upon them with anger , and deeply grieved by the hardening of their hearts , he said to the man , " Stretch out your hand ! " He stretched it out , and the hand was at once completely restored .
41003006	As soon as they came out , the Pharisees plotted against him with the Herodians , in order to destroy him .
41003007	Then Jesus withdrew to the sea with his disciples ; and a great crowd of people from Galilee followed .
41003008	From Judea , too , and Jerusalem , and Idumea , and from beyond Jordan , and from the district of Tyre and Sidon , they came to him a vast multitude , because they heard what he was doing .
41003009	So he directed his disciples to keep a little boat in readiness for him , because of the crowd , to prevent their crushing him .
41003010	For he had healed so many that all the people who had ailments pressed upon him so as to touch him .
41003011	And whenever the unclean spirits beheld him , they threw themselves down at his feet , screaming out , " You are the Son of God . "
41003012	But over and over , he strictly forbade them to make him known .
41003013	Then he went up the hillside and called to him those whom he chose , and they came to him .
41003014	Twelve of them whom he also called " Apostles , " he appointed to be with him , and also that he might send them out to preach ,
41003015	and to have authority to cast out demons .
41003016	There was Simon , whom he surnamed Peter ,
41003017	and James ( them he surnamed Boanerges , that is , Sons of Thunder ) ,
41003018	and Andrew , and Philip , and Bartholomew , and Matthew , and Thomas , and Jamesthe son of Alphaeus , and Thaddeus , and Simon the Zealot ,
41003019	and Judas Iscariot who betrayed him .
41003020	Then he went into a house , but again such a multitude assembled that they could not get their food .
41003021	When his relatives heard of it , they came to take possession of him , for they said , " He is out of his mind . "
41003022	The Scribes also who had come down from Jerusalem , said , " He is Beelzebub , " and , " He casts out demons by the power of the Prince of the demons . "
41003023	So when he had called them to him he spoke to them in parables . " How , " said he , " can Satan cast out Satan ?
41003024	If a kingdom be divided against itself , that kingdom cannot stand ;
41003025	if a household be divided against itself , that household cannot stand ;
41003026	and if Satan has revolted against himself , and is divided , he cannot stand . Nay , he meets his end !
41003027	" Indeed , no one can enter the strong mans house and carry off his property without first binding the strong man ; then he can plunder his house .
41003028	In solemn truth I tell you that the sons of men shall be forgiven all their sins and all the blasphemies they may utter ,
41003029	but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit is never forgiven . Nay , he is in the grasp of an eternal sin . "
41003030	Because they kept saying , " He has an unclean spirit . "
41003031	Then his mother and his brothers came up , and standing outside , they sent a messenger to him to call him .
41003032	Now a crowd was sitting round him and they told him , " See ! your mother and your brothers and sisters are outside , wanting to see you . "
41003033	" Who are my mother and my brothers ? " he replied .
41003034	Then , with a glance at those who were in the circle sitting around him , he added .
41003035	" Here are my mother and my brothers ! Whoever does the will of God , that one is my brother and sister and mother . "
41004001	Afterwards Jesus began to teach by the seaside , and a vast multitude of people gathered about him , so that he went on board a boat on the sea , and sat there , while all the people stayed on shore , at the waters edge .
41004002	Then he began teaching them in parables many things . In his teaching he said to them .
41004003	" Listen ! the Sower once went out to sow ,
41004004	and as he sowed , it happened that some seed fell on the road , and birds came and picked it up ;
41004005	some other seed fell on stony soil , where it had not much earth ; and it sprang up quickly because it had no depth of soil ,
41004006	but when the sun rose it was scorched and withered away because it had no root .
41004007	Other seed fell among the thorns , and the thorns sprang up and choked it , so that it yielded no crop .
41004008	But some seed fell into good soil and yielded a crop that sprang up and increased , yielding thirty , sixty , or a hundredfold .
41004009	" Any one who has ears to hear , " he added , " let him listen to this . "
41004010	When he was alone his followers and the Twelve began asking about the parables .
41004011	He went on to say to them . " The secret truth concerning the kingdom of God has been given to you , but to those outside everything is told in parables ,
41004012	so that , " for all their looking they may not see , and for all their hearing , they may not understand , lest perchance they should turn and be pardoned .
41004013	" You do not understand this parable , " said Jesus . " Then how will you understand the other parables ?
41004014	" What the Sower sows is the Word . There are those on the wayside where the Word is sown .
41004015	As soon as they hear it , Satan immediately comes and snatches away the Word which has been sown in them .
41004016	And like the sowing upon stony ground are those who , whenever they hear the Word , at once receive it with joy ,
41004017	but because they have no root in themselves they last for a time ; but when suffering or persecution ensues because of the Word , they at once fall away .
41004018	There are others who are sown among thorns .
41004019	When they have heard the Word , the anxieties of life and the snares of wealth , and all sorts of other ambitions , come in to choke the Word , so that it proves unfruitful .
41004020	But those , on the other hand , who were sown on that good soil , are those who listen to the Word , and welcome it , and bear fruit , thirty , sixty , or a hundredfold . "
41004021	He went on to say . " Is the lamp brought in to be put under the bushel or the bed ? Is it not rather to be put on the lamp-stand ?
41004022	There is nothing hidden except what is to be disclosed , and nothing concealed except what is to be revealed .
41004023	If any man has ears to hear , let him hear . "
41004024	And he said to them . " Take heed what you hear . With what measure you measure it will be measured to you , and more will be given to you .
41004025	For he who holds , to him will more be given , and he who holds not , from him will be taken even what he holds . " " It is with the kingdom of God , " he continued , " as if a man should have sown seed in the earth ;
41004027	night and day he sleeps and wakes while the seed is sprouting and growing tall , he knows not how .
41004028	Of its own accord the earth bears its crops ; first the blade , then the ear , then the full grain in the ear .
41004029	Then as soon as the crop is ready the man has the sickle put in at once , because harvest-time is come .
41004030	" To what shall we compare the kingdom of God ? " he said again . " in what parable shall we set it forth ?
41004031	It is like a mustard-seed , which , when sown in the soil , is the smallest seed in the world ;
41004032	yet when sown shoots up and becomes larger than any plant , sending out such branches that the wild birds build their nests under its shadow . "
41004033	With many such illustrations Jesus used to tell his message to people as far as they were able to receive it ;
41004034	and to them it was his practice never to speak except in parables . But he used to explain everything in private to his disciples .
41004035	On the evening of that same day Jesus said to them , " Let us go across to the other side . "
41004036	So , leaving the crowd behind , they took him with them just as he was in the boat ; and the other boats were with him .
41004037	But a great gale of wind came up , and the waves were dashing into the boat so that it began to fill .
41004038	Now he himself was sleeping on the cushion in the stern , so they woke him up , saying , " Master , do you not care if we perish ? "
41004039	And he awoke , rebuked the wind , and said to the sea , " Peace , be still ! "
41004040	The wind fell , and there ensued a great calm . Then he said to them . " Why are you so afraid ? Have you still no faith ? "
41004041	Then they were awestruck , and said one to another , " Who can this be , that even the wind and the sea obey him ! "
41005001	Then they came to the country of the Gadarenes , on the opposite side of the sea ;
41005002	and he had no sooner stepped out of the boat , than a man out of the tombs came to meet him , a man with an unclean spirit ,
41005003	who lived among the tombs .
41005004	Not even with a chain could any man bind him , for he had been bound with fetters and chains again and again , and had snapped the chains , and broken the fetters ; and there was no one strong enough to master him .
41005005	And always , night and day , he remained among the tombs and in the mountains , shrieking and gashing himself with stones .
41005006	As he caught sight of Jesus from afar , he ran and knelt before him ,
41005007	and with a shriek he cried out in a loud voice . " Jesus , son of God most high , what business have you with me ? I adjure you by God , torment me not ! "
41005008	For Jesus was saying , " Foul spirit , come out of the man . "
41005009	He continued asking him , " What is your mane ? " " Legion is my name , for we are many . "
41005010	Over and over he continued to beg Jesus not to send them away out of the country .
41005011	Now there was on the hillside a great drove of swine feeding .
41005012	So the spirits begged him , saying , " Send us into the swine , that we may enter into them . "
41005013	And he gave them leave . And out came the foul spirits and entered the swine ; and the drove rushed down from the steep into the sea , in number about two thousand , and were choked in the sea .
41005014	On this the swineherds ran away and spread the news in town and country . So the people went to see what had happened .
41005015	When they got to Jesus they found the demoniac sitting there clothed and in his right mind - the man who had had the " Legion " - and they were awestruck .
41005016	And those who had been eye-witnesses told them what had happened to the demoniac and to the swine .
41005017	Then they began to beg Jesus to depart from their district .
41005018	As he was getting into the boat the man who had been demon-possessed kept begging to go with him ; but he said ,
41005019	" Go home to your own people , and tell them what great things God has done for you , and has had mercy upon you . "
41005020	So he went and began to publish abroad in the District of the Ten Towns all that Jesus had done for him ; and every one was astonished and all men marveled .
41005021	Then after Jesus had recrossed in a boat to the other side , a vast multitude came crowding around him ; so he stayed on the seashore .
41005022	Then one of the wardens of the synagogue , named Jairus , came up , and as soon as he saw Jesus , fell at his feet , with many entreaties ,
41005023	" My little daughter , " he said , " is dying . I beseech you , come and lay your hands on her , that she may recover and live . "
41005024	So he went with him , and a great crowd followed him and thronged about him .
41005025	Now there was a woman who had had a hemorrhage for twelve years ,
41005026	and had suffered many things of many physicians , and had spent all that she had , but was no better ; on the contrary , rather grew worse .
41005027	She had heard about Jesus , so she came in the crowd behind and touched his cloak .
41005028	" If I can touch even his clothes , " she kept saying to herself , " I shall get well . "
41005029	At once the fountain of her blood was dried up , and she felt in her body that she was cured of her complaint .
41005030	Jesus , instantly conscious that the power within him had gone forth , turned about in the crowd , and said , " Who touched my clothes ? "
41005031	" You see the crowd thronging about you , " said his disciples , " and yet you say , Who touched me ? "
41005032	But he kept looking about to see who had done it ,
41005033	and the woman knowing what had happened to her , came in fear and trembling , and fell down before him , and told him all the truth .
41005034	" Daughter , " he said , " your faith has saved you . Go in peace , and be cured of your complaint . "
41005035	While he was still speaking men came from the house of the warden of the synagogue to tell him , " Your daughter is dead , why trouble the Teacher any further ? "
41005036	But Jesus , paying no attention to the remark , said to the warden of the synagogue , " Have no fear , only believe . "
41005037	He would not permit any one to go with him , except Peter and Jamesand John , the brother of James .
41005038	As they came to the house of the warden of the synagogue , he gazed upon a tumult , many weeping and wailing shrilly .
41005039	" Why all this tumult and loud weeping ? " he asked .
41005040	" The child is not dead , but asleep . " And they began to laugh him to scorn . Then he put them all outside , took the father and mother of the child and those he brought with him , and entered the room where the child was lying .
41005041	Then he took the childs hand and said to her , " Talitha , cumi , " that is to say , " Little girl , I am speaking to you ; arise ! "
41005042	And instantly the little girl stood up , and began to walk , for she was twelve years old , They were at once beside themselves with utter amazement .
41005043	He , however , repeatedly cautioned them not to let any one know about it , and directed them to give her something to eat .
41006001	Jesus left that place , and accompanied by his disciples , came into his own part of the country .
41006002	When it came Sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue ; many , as they listened , were deeply impressed . " Where did he get all this ? " they asked ; " What is the wisdom that is given to this man , and miracles such as these that happen at his hands ?
41006003	Is not this the carpenter , the son of Mary , and the brother of Jamesand Joses and Judas and Simon ? And are not his sisters here with us ? "
41006004	So they disapproved of him . Then Jesus said to them , " A prophet is not without honor except in his native land and among his relatives and in his home . "
41006005	And he was unable to do any miracle there , except that he laid his hands on a few sick folk and healed them .
41006006	And he wondered at their lack of faith . So he went among the neighboring villages , teaching .
41006007	Then summoning the Twelve to him , he began to send them out two by two , giving them authority over unclean spirits .
41006008	He bade them take nothing but a staff for their journey ; no bread , no wallet , no coins in their purse ;
41006009	they were to wear sandals , but not to put on two tunics .
41006010	" Wherever you enter a house , " he told them , " remain there until you leave the place ;
41006011	and if any place does not receive you , or listen to you , as you go out of it shake off the dust under your feet , as a warning to them . "
41006012	So they fared forth and summoned men to repentance .
41006013	They cast out many demons , and anointed many sick people with oil and cured them .
41006014	King Herod heard it , for the name of Jesus had become well known , People were saying , " Johnthe Baptist is risen from the dead , and on that account these powers are working in him . "
41006015	" He is Elijah , " said others . And still others were saying , " He is a prophet , like one of the old prophets . "
41006016	But when Herod heard , he said , " That Johnwhom I beheaded has come back to life . "
41006017	Now this Herod had sent and arrested John , and bound him in prison , for the sake of Herodias , his brother Philips wife , whom he had married .
41006018	For Johnhad often told Herod , " It is not right for you to live with your brothers wife . "
41006019	So Herodias hated him , and wished to put him to death ;
41006020	but she could not , for Herod was afraid of Johnbecause he knew that he was a just and holy man . So he kept him safe . When he listened to Johnhe was much exercised , yet he found pleasure in listening to him .
41006021	Then came a convenient day , when Herod on his birthday held a feast for his lords and generals and the leading men of Galilee ,
41006022	at which the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced . She charmed Herod and his guests . " Ask me whatever you want , " said the king to the young girl , " and I will give it to you . "
41006023	He even swore to her that whatever she asked , he would give it to her , up to half his kingdom .
41006024	So she came out and said to her mother , " What shall I ask for ? " " The head of Johnthe Baptist , " she replied .
41006025	So she at once hurried in to the king and made her request , " I want you , " she said , " to give me , without delay , the head of Johnthe Baptist on a charger . "
41006026	Then the king was exceedingly sorry ; yet on account of his oaths and his guests he was unwilling to disappoint her .
41006027	So he sent at once a soldier of the guard with orders to bring his head .
41006028	And he went and beheaded Johnin prison , brought his head on a platter , and gave it to the young girl , and she gave it to her mother .
41006029	When Johns disciples heard of this , they came , and took his body , and laid it in a tomb .
41006030	When the apostles had come back to Jesus , they told him all the things they had done , and all they had taught .
41006031	Then he said to them , " Come apart , yourselves , to a quiet spot , and rest a while . " For there were many coming and going , and they could not get time even to eat .
41006032	So they sailed away privately to a solitary place .
41006033	However , many saw them going , and recognized them , and ran together by land from all the neighboring towns , and arrived there first .
41006034	So when Jesus landed he saw a vast multitude , and he was moved with compassion for them , because they were like sheep without a shepherd , and he began to teach them many things .
41006035	Then when the day was now far spent , his disciples came to him and said . " This place is desert , and the day is now far spent .
41006036	Send the people away so that they may go to the farms and villages about here , and buy themselves something to eat . "
41006037	In answer he said to them , " You yourselves are to give them food . " " Are we to go and buy fifty dollars worth of bread , " they said , " and give them food ? "
41006038	" How many loaves have you ? " he answered . " Go and see . " When they had found out , they said , " Five , and two fishes . "
41006039	Then he directed them to make all sit down by companies on the green grass .
41006040	And they sat down like beds in a garden , by hundreds and by fifties .
41006041	Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes , and looking up to heaven he blessed , broke the loaves in pieces , and kept giving to the disciples to distribute .
41006042	The two fish also he divided to them all .
41006043	All ate and had enough ; and they carried away broken fragments of bread and of fish , enough to fill twelve baskets .
41006044	Those who ate the bread were five thousand adult men .
41006045	Then he at once compelled the disciples to embark in the boat and go before him to Bethsaida on the other side , while he sent the people away .
41006046	After he had taken leave of them , he went away into the mountain to pray .
41006047	And when evening came , the boat was half-way across the sea , while he was on shore alone ;
41006048	but when he saw them distressed in rowing ( for the wind was against them ) , about the fourth watch of the night he went to them , walking upon the sea ,
41006049	they thought it was an apparition and shrieked aloud , for they all saw him and were terrified .
41006050	But he at once spoke with them , saying . " Courage ! It is I . Do not be afraid ! "
41006051	Then he got into the boat beside them , and the wind ceased , and they were utterly astounded ,
41006052	for they had not understood about the loaves ; on the contrary their heart was hardened .
41006053	When they had crossed over they landed at Gennesaret and moored to the shore .
41006054	As soon as they got out of the boat , the people at once recognized him ,
41006055	and began running over that whole country , and carrying the sick about on their beds , wherever they heard he was .
41006056	And whenever he entered into villages or cities or the fields they would lay the sick in the market-places and beseech him to let them touch even the tassel of his cloak , and all who touched him were made well .
41007001	One day the Pharisees came to him in a body with some Scribes who had come from Jerusalem .
41007002	They had noticed that some of his disciples were eating with " common , " that is to say , unwashed hands .
41007003	For the Pharisees and all of the Jews do not eat until they have ceremoniously washed their hands in obedience to the tradition of the elders ;
41007004	and when they come from the market-place they do not eat without bathing first . and they have many other customs which they have received and observe , such as the washing of cups and jugs and copper pans .
41007005	So the Pharisees and Scribes asked him . " Why do your disciples not follow the traditions of the elders ? Why do they eat with common unwashed hands ? "
41007006	" Well did Isaiah prophesy of you , hypocrites , " he answered . " As it is written , " This people honor me with their lips , While their hearts are far from me ;
41007007	But in vain do they worship me , For their teaching is only human precepts .
41007008	" You neglect the commandment of God , and hold fast the traditions of men . "
41007009	" It is praiseworthy , is it , " he exclaimed , " to reject the command of God that you may keep your tradition !
41007010	For although Moses said , Honor your father and mother , and Let him who curses father or mother suffer death ,
41007011	you say that if a man tells his father or mother , This money which otherwise you would have received from me , is Korban ( that is , a thing devoted to God ) ,
41007012	you exempt him from doing any service for his father or mother .
41007013	Thus by your tradition which you have handed down you set at naught the word of God ; and you do many other things like that . "
41007014	Then again he called the crowd to him and said .
41007015	" Listen to me , all of you , and understand ; there is nothing outside a man which by entering in can defile him ; but it is what comes from him that defiled him . "
41007017	After he had left the crowd and gone indoors his disciples began asking him about the parable .
41007018	" Are even you without understanding ? " he said . " Do you not perceive that nothing whatever from without can defile a man by entering him ,
41007019	because it does not go into his heart , but into his belly , and passes away , ejected from him ? " By these words he pronounced all foods clean .
41007020	" What comes out of a man , " he continued , " is what defiles him .
41007021	From within , from the heart of man , proceed evil purposes -
41007022	fornication , theft , murder , adultery , greed , malice , deceit , wantonness , envy , slander , arrogance , reckless folly -
41007023	all these wicked things issue from within and defile a man . "
41007024	After he rose and left that place , he went away into the region of Tyre and Sidon . Here he went into a house and wished no one to know it but he could not be hid .
41007025	Forthwith a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an unclean spirit , heard of him , and came and fell at his feet
41007026	( the woman was a Greek , a Syro-phoenician by race ) , and again and again she begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter .
41007027	" Let the children be filled first , " he said to her . " It is unseemly to take the childrens bread and throw it to the dogs . "
41007028	" True , Master , " she answered , " but the dogs under the table do pick up the childrens crumbs . "
41007029	" For that saying of yours , go home , " he replied ; " the demon has departed from your daughter . "
41007030	So she went home , and found the child lying in her bed and the demon departed .
41007031	Again he left the region of Tyre , and passed through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee , crossing the District of the Ten Towns .
41007032	And they brought to him a deaf man who stammered , and begged him to lay his hands upon him .
41007033	So Jesus took him aside from the crowd , by himself , and put his finger in the mans ears , and moistened his tongue with saliva ;
41007034	then looking up to heaven with a sigh , he said to him , " Ephphatha ! " ( that is , " Be opened . " )
41007035	And his ears were opened and the bond of his tongue was loosened , and he spoke plainly .
41007036	Then Jesus charged them not to tell any one , but the more he charged them , the more they published it ;
41007037	and people were amazed beyond measure saying . " How successfully he does things ! Even the deaf he makes to hear , and the dumb to speak . "
41008001	In those days when a large crowd had again assembled and had nothing to eat , Jesus called together his disciples and said to them .
41008002	" My heart aches for the crowd , because they have remained with me three days now , and they have nothing to eat ;
41008003	and if I send them away fasting to their homes , they will faint on the way . Moreover , some of them are from a distance . "
41008004	" Where will it be possible , " answered his disciples , " for one to fill these men with bread in a lonely place like this ? "
41008005	He asked them , " How many loaves have you ? " " Seven , " they said .
41008006	So he directed the crowd to sit down on the ground ; and when he had taken the seven loaves , he gave thanks , broke them , and gave to his disciples to distribute to the crowd .
41008007	They had also a few small fish ; after blessing these he told his disciples to distribute them also .
41008008	They ate and were filled and they took up of broken pieces that were left , seven hampers .
41008009	They that had eaten were about four thousand .
41008010	Then he sent them away , got at once into the boat with his disciples . and came into the district of Dalmanutha .
41008011	And the Pharisees came out and began to question him , seeking from him a sign from heaven , by way of testing him .
41008012	At this Jesus sighed deeply in his spirit , and said . " Why does the present generation seek a sign ? In solemn truth I tell you that no sign shall be given this generation . "
41008013	Then he left them , and getting into the boat again , went away to the other side ,
41008014	Now they had forgotten to take bread , and had not in the boat with them more than one loaf .
41008015	So he gave them this warning . " Look out ! Be on the watch against the leaven of the Pharisees , and the leaven of Herod . "
41008016	And they began arguing with one another because they had no bread , He noted this and said to them .
41008017	" Why are you arguing together because you have no bread ? Do you not yet perceive and understand ?
41008018	Are your minds so slow to comprehend ? You have eyes , do you not see ? You have ears , do you not hear ?
41008019	Do you not remember ? When I broke the five loaves among the five thousand , how many baskets of broken pieces did you take up ? " " Twelve , " they said .
41008020	" And when the seven for the four thousand , how many hampers full of fragments did you pick up ? "
41008021	" Do you not yet understand ? " he said .
41008022	Then they came to Bethsaida , where some people brought a blind man to Jesus , and begged him to touch him .
41008023	Taking the blind man by the hand , he led him outside the village ; and , after spitting on his eyes , he laid his hands on him and asked , " Can you make out anything ? "
41008024	The man looked up and said , " I can make out the people , for as they move about , I see them like trees . "
41008025	Then Jesus again put his hands on the mans eyes ; and the man , staring straight ahead , recovered his sight and continued to see everything perfectly .
41008026	Then Jesus sent him home , saying , " Do not even go into the village . "
41008027	From there Jesus and his disciples went to the villages of Caesarea Philippi , and on the way he began to question his disciples saying , " Who do people say I am ? "
41008028	And they told him . " Some say Johnthe Baptist , others , Elijah , and others that you are one of the prophets . "
41008029	And he continued questioning them , " But you yourselves , Who do you say I am ? " Peter in reply said to him , " You are Christ . "
41008030	Then he strictly charged them not to say this about him to any one ;
41008031	and he began to explain to them that the Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests , and the Scribes , and be put to death , and after two days rise again .
41008032	This he told them quite openly . Then Peter took him and began to rebuke him .
41008033	But he turned round , and looked upon his disciples , and rebuked Peter . " Get thee behind me , Satan , " he said , " for your thoughts are not Gods thoughts , but mans . "
41008034	Then summoning the crowd to him , with his disciples . he said . " If any man wishes to follow me , let him renounce self , take up his cross , and so follow me .
41008035	For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it ; but whoever , for my sake and the gospels , loses his life will save it .
41008036	For what shall it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his own life ?
41008037	Or what shall a man give in exchange for his life ?
41008038	Whoever is ashamed of me and my words in this unfaithful and wicked generation , of him shall the Son of man be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels . "
41009001	" In solemn truth I tell you , " he said , " there are some standing here who shall not taste death till they see the kingdom of God , come with power . "
41009002	Six days later Jesus took with him Peter and Jamesand John , and brought them by themselves up a high mountain apart from the rest .
41009003	Here in their presence he was transfigured ; and his clothes also became glistering with a radiant whiteness , such as no bleaching on earth could give .
41009004	Moreover there appeared to them Elijah , with Moses ; and they were talking with Jesus .
41009005	" Master , " said Peter , addressing Jesus , " it is good for us to be here . Let us put up three tents one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . "
41009006	( For he did not know what to say , they were so awestruck . )
41009007	Then there came a cloud overshadowing them ; and there came a voice out of the cloud . " This is my Son , my beloved . Listen to him . "
41009008	And suddenly as they looked around , they saw no one any more beside them , but Jesus alone .
41009009	As they came down the mountain he strictly forbade them to narrate to any one what they had seen , until after the Son of man had risen from the dead .
41009010	This order they faithfully kept , questioning among themselves what " rising again from the dead " meant .
41009011	So they asked him , " How is it that the Scribes say that Elijah must first come ? "
41009012	" Elijah does indeed first come , " he said , " and restores all things , But how is it written about the Son of Man , that he will endure great suffering , and be rejected ?
41009013	" Elijah indeed has already come , " he added , " and they have done to him whatever they pleased , even as it is written of him . "
41009014	When they rejoined the disciples they saw a great crowd surrounding them , and some Scribes disputing with them .
41009015	As soon as they saw him , all the people were astounded and ran up to greet him .
41009016	He asked them , " What are you discussing with them ? "
41009017	" Master , " answered one of the crowd , " I brought my son to you ; he has a dumb spirit in him ;
41009018	and wherever it seizes him it dashes him down ; he foams at the mouth , and grinds his teeth , and is wasting away . I begged your disciples to cast it out , but they could not . "
41009019	" O unbelieving generation ! " replied Jesus ; " how long must I be with you ? How long must I be patient with you ? Bring him to me . "
41009020	So they brought the boy to him , and when he saw Jesus , the spirit at once convulsed him , and he fell to the ground and wallowed , foaming at the mouth .
41009021	Then Jesus asked the father , " How long has he been like this ? "
41009022	" From childhood , " he answered ; " and often it has thrown him into the fire and into the water , to destroy him ; but if you can do anything , take pity on us and help us . "
41009023	Jesus said to him . " If you can ! All things can be for one who believes . "
41009024	The boys father with a cry said instantly . " I do believe ; help my unbelief . "
41009025	And when Jesus saw that a crowd came running together , he rebuked the unclean spirit . " You dumb and deaf spirit , " he said , " come out of him , I command you , and never enter him again . "
41009026	So with a loud shriek it came out , after throwing the boy into convulsion after convulsion . The boy looked like a corpse , so that most of them said that he was dead .
41009027	But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up , and he stood up .
41009028	When Jesus had gone into the house , his disciples asked him in private , " Why could not we cast it out ? "
41009029	" This kind can only be cast out by prayer , " he replied .
41009030	Jesus and his disciples , after leaving that place , passed through Galilee ; but he was unwilling that any one should know it ,
41009031	for he was explaining to his disciples that the Son of man was to be betrayed into the hands of men , and that they would put him to death , but that after he had been put to death , he would rise again after three days ,
41009032	But they did not understand his words , and were afraid to ask him the meaning .
41009033	Then they came to Capernaum ; and when he got into the house he asked them , " What were you discussing on the road ? "
41009034	But they were silent , for on the road they were disputing together which one was greatest .
41009035	So he sat down and called the Twelve , and said to them , " If any one wishes to be first , he must be last of all , and the servant of all . "
41009036	Then Jesus took a little child , set it among them , and folding it in his arms , he said ,
41009037	" Whoever in my name receives one such little child , receives me , and whoever receives me , receives not me , but Him who sent me . "
41009038	" Master , " said John , " we saw a man casting out demons in your name , and we tried to stop him because he did not follow us . "
41009039	" Do not try to stop him , " Jesus answered , " for there is no one who performs a miracle in my name who can soon speak evil of me .
41009040	He who is not against us is for us .
41009041	For whoever gives you even a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christ , in solemn truth I tell you , that he shall certainly not lose his reward .
41009042	" And if any one shall cause one of these little ones who believe on me to stumble , it would be better for him if he were thrown out into the sea with a great millstone about his neck .
41009043	" If your hand cause you to stumble , cut it off ! It is better to be maimed and to enter into life than to have two hands and go away into hell , into the fire that cannot be put out .
41009045	If your foot cause you to stumble , cut it off ! It is better to enter into the life a cripple , than to have two feet and be cast into hell .
41009047	If your eye cause you to stumble , tear it out ! It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God one-eyed that to keep both your eyes and be cast into hell ,
41009048	where their worm never dies and the fire does not go out .
41009049	For by fire every one will be salted ;
41009050	salt is excellent , but if the salt has lost its savor , what will you use to restore its saltness ? Then have salt in yourselves , and be at peace with one another . "
41010001	On leaving that place Jesus came into the borders of Judea , on the other side of the Jordan , Once more the people flocked about him , and again , as usual , he began teaching them .
41010002	Presently some Pharisees came up and tested him , by asking if it was lawful for a man to divorce his wife .
41010003	" What did Moses command you ? " he replied ,
41010004	" Moses , " said they , " permitted a man to draw up a bill of separation and divorce her . "
41010005	But Jesus said to them . " Moses gave you that command because of the hardness of your hearts ;
41010006	but from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female .
41010007	" For this cause a man shall leave his father and his mother , and shall cleave to his wife ; and the two shall become one flesh ;
41010008	so that they are no more two , but one flesh .
41010009	What therefore God has joined together , let not man put asunder . "
41010010	When indoors the disciples began to question Jesus again about this , and he said .
41010011	" Any man who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her ;
41010012	and if she divorces her husband and marries another man , she commits adultery . "
41010013	Now people were bringing little children to Jesus for him to touch them ; but the disciples rebuked them .
41010014	Jesus was indignant when he saw it , and said . " Let the little children come to me . Do not hinder them ; for the kingdom of God belongs to such .
41010015	I tell you true that unless a man receives the kingdom of God as a little child , he shall not even enter it . "
41010016	Then he took them in his arms , and laid his hand upon them in blessing .
41010017	As he started to go forth into the road , a man came running up to him , and knelt down before him . " Good Teacher , " he asked , " what must I do to inherit eternal life ? "
41010018	Jesus said to him . " Why do you call me good ? No one is good save one , God himself .
41010019	You know the commandments . Do not murder , do not commit adultery , do not steal , do not bear false witness , do not cheat , honor your father and mother . "
41010020	" Teacher , " he answered , " I have observed all these from my youth . "
41010021	Jesus loved him as he looked at him , and said . " One thing you lack . Go , sell all you have and give to the poor ; and you shall have wealth in heaven ; and come , follow me . "
41010022	But his face fell at these words , and he went away saddened , for he was one who had great wealth .
41010023	Then Jesus looked round on his disciples and said , " How hard it is for those who have wealth to enter into the kingdom of God ! "
41010024	The disciples were amazed at his words . Jesus looked around and said again to them .
41010025	" My sons , how hard it is for those who trust in money to enter the kingdom of God . It is easier for a camel to get through the eye of a needle , than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven . "
41010026	" Then who can be saved ? " they said to themselves astonished beyond measure .
41010027	When he had looked at them , Jesus said , " With men it is impossible , but not with God , for all things are possible with God . "
41010028	" But we , " Peter began to say , " we have left our all and have followed you . "
41010029	" I tell you solemnly , " said Jesus , " that there is no man who has left house , or brothers , or sisters , or mother , or father , or children , or lands , for my sake and the gospels ,
41010030	but shall receive a hundred times as much , now in this present world , houses , brothers , sisters , mothers , children , lands-and persecutions with them - and in the world to come eternal life .
41010031	But many who are first shall be last , and the last , first . "
41010032	They were still on the road going up to Jerusalem , and Jesus led the way ; and they were amazed , and some , although they followed , were afraid . Then once more he took the Twelve , and began to tell them what was about to befall him .
41010033	" See , " said he , " we are going up to Jerusalem and the Son of man will be betrayed to the high priests and the Scribes . They will condemn him to death , and will hand him over to the Gentiles ,
41010034	who will mock him , spit upon him , flog him , and put him to death ; and after three days he will rise again . "
41010035	Presently there came up to him Jamesand John , the sons of Zebedee , and said , " Teacher , we wish you would do for us whatever we ask you . "
41010036	" What is it you want me to do for you ? " said he .
41010037	They answered , " Allow us to sit , one at your right hand , and the other at your left hand , in your glory . "
41010038	" You know not what you are asking , " said Jesus . " Can you drink the cup that I drink , or be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ? "
41010039	They answered him , " We can . " " You shall indeed drink the cup that I drink , and with the baptism that I am baptized with shall you be baptized ,
41010040	but a seat upon my right hand or my left is not mine to grant , but it is for those for whom it has been reserved . "
41010041	When they heard this the ten began to be indignant at Jamesand John , so Jesus called them to him and said .
41010042	" You know that those who are regarded as rulers among the Gentiles lord it over them , and their great ones make them feel their authority .
41010043	Not so shall it be among you . On the contrary whoever would become great among you shall be your servant ;
41010044	and whoever among you would be first , shall be slave of all ,
41010045	and justly , for even the Son of man came not to be served , but to serve , and to give his life , a ransom for many . "
41010046	Then they reached Jericho ; and as he was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a great crowd , Bartimeus , the son of Timaeus , a blind beggar , was sitting beside the road .
41010047	Hearing that it was Jesus of Nazareth , he began shouting and saying , " Jesus , thou son of David , have mercy on me ! "
41010048	and many kept rebuking him and telling him to be quiet , but he only shouted much louder , " Son of David , have mercy on me ! "
41010049	Then Jesus stood still , saying , " Call him . " So they called the blind man , and said , " Courage , rise , he is calling you . "
41010050	The man threw off his cloak , sprang to his feet , and came to Jesus .
41010051	" What do you want me to do ? " said Jesus , addressing him . And the blind man answered , " O Rabboni , that I might receive my sight ! "
41010052	" Go , " said Jesus , " your own faith has saved you , " and immediately he received his sight , and began to follow Jesus along the road .
41011001	Now when they were approaching Jerusalem , near Bethphage and Bethany , at the Mount of Olives ,
41011002	Jesus sent two of his disciples and told them . " Go to that village in front of you , and immediately on entering it you will find a colt tied , upon which no man has ever sat ; untie him and bring him here .
41011003	And if any man asks you , Why are you doing that ? " answer , The Lord has need of him , and he will immediately send him back . "
41011004	So they went and found a colt tied outside a door , in the open street , and untied it .
41011005	And some of the bystanders began to say to them , " What are you trying to do , untying that colt ? "
41011006	So they answered them just as Jesus had told them , and they let them take it .
41011007	Then they brought the colt to Jesus , and when they had thrown cloaks upon it , Jesus seated himself on it .
41011008	Then many spread their cloaks on the road , and others , soft leafy branches , which they had cut from the fields ;
41011009	and those who went before him and those who came after kept shouting . " Hosanna ! Blessed be He who comes in the name of the Lord !
41011010	Blessed be the coming kingdom of our father David ! Hosanna , in the highest ! "
41011011	Then he entered Jerusalem and went into the Temple , and after he had looked around at everything , as the hour was now late , he went out to Bethany with the Twelve .
41011012	The next day after leaving Bethany he was hungry ,
41011013	and seeing a fig tree in the distance full of leaves , he came to see if he could find anything on it , and found on it nothing but leaves ( for it was not the time of figs ) .
41011014	So , addressing the tree , he said , " Let no man ever more eat fruit from you . " And the disciples heard it .
41011015	Presently they reached Jerusalem , and , after entering the Temple courts , Jesus began to drive out those who were buying and selling there , and to upset the tables of the money-changers , and the stalls of those who sold doves ,
41011016	and he would not allow any one to carry a vessel through the Temple courts , Then he began to teach .
41011017	" Is it not written , " he said , " My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations ? But you have made it a den of robbers . "
41011018	The chief priests and the Scribes heard this , and they began to seek means of destroying him ; for they were afraid of him because all the crowd were greatly struck with his teaching .
41011019	Now every evening he used to go outside the city ;
41011020	and as they ( he and his disciples ) were passing along in the morning , they saw the fig tree already withered from the root .
41011021	Then Peter remembered , and exclaimed , " Look , Rabbi , the fig tree which you cursed is withered up . "
41011022	" Take hold on Gods faithfulness , " said Jesus to them in reply .
41011023	" In solemn truth I tell you that if any one shall say to this mountain , Up and hurl yourself into the sea ! and shall not doubt in his heart , but on the contrary shall believe that what he says will happen , it will be granted him .
41011024	That is why I am telling you that whatever you ask for in prayer , believe that you have received it , and it shall be yours .
41011025	And whenever you stand up to pray , forgive , if you have anything against any one , that so your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses . "
41011027	Once more they came into Jerusalem ; and as he was walking in the Temple courts , there came to him the high priests and Scribes and elders and asked him .
41011028	" By what authority do you do these things ? or who gave you this authority to do these things ? "
41011029	" And I will put one question to you , " replied Jesus . " Answer this , and I will tell you by what authority I do these things .
41011030	The baptism of John , was it from heaven , or from men ? Answer me ! "
41011031	Then they began arguing with one another . " If we say , From heaven , he will ask , Why then did you not believe him ? "
41011032	On the other hand , if we say , From men ! " They were afraid , however , of the people , for every one held that Johnhad been really a prophet .
41011033	So their answer to Jesus was , " We do not know . " " Neither will I tell you , " said Jesus , " by what authority I do these things . "
41012001	Presently Jesus began to speak to them in parables . " There was once a man , " he said , " who planted a vineyard , put a fence around it , dug a pit for the wine-press , built a tower , rented it to tenants , and went abroad .
41012002	At vintage-time he sent a slave to the vine-dressers to collect some of the proceeds of the vineyard ;
41012003	but they seized him , and flogged him , and sent him away empty-handed .
41012004	Then he sent another slave to them ; and this man they knocked over the head and handled shamefully .
41012005	And he sent another ; and him they killed ; and many others ; beating some , and killing some .
41012006	He had still one , a Son beloved , He sent him last to them , saying , " They will reverence my Son .
41012007	" But those tenants said to themselves . Here is the heir ! Come , let us kill him , and the inheritance will be ours .
41012008	" So they took him and killed him , and threw his body out of the vineyard .
41012009	What will the owner of the Vineyard do ? " " He will come and put the tenants to death , " they said , " and will give the vineyard to others . "
41012010	" Have you not read this Scripture ? " ( he continued ) " The very stone which the builders rejected Has now become the corner-stone ;
41012011	This is the Lords doing ; It is marvelous in our eyes . "
41012012	And they kept seeking to lay hold on him , but were afraid of the crowd , for they knew well that he had spoken this parable about them ; so they left him and went away .
41012013	But they sent some of the Pharisees to Jesus afterward , and some of the Herodians to entrap him in conversation .
41012014	So when they came , they said . " Teacher , we know that you are sincere and are not afraid of any one , for you do not regard the face of men ; nay , but you reach the way of God in truth . Is it right to pay poll-tax to Caesar or not ?
41012015	Shall we pay , or not pay ? " But he , knowing well their hypocrisy , said to them . " Why are you testing me ? Bring me a dollar for me to look at . "
41012016	And they brought it . " Whose likeness and inscription is this ? " " Caesars , " they answered .
41012017	And Jesus said , " Render to Caesar the things that are Caesars , and to God , the things that are Gods . " They were amazed at him .
41012018	Then came up some Sadducees , men who say there is no resurrection . They too questioned him , saying .
41012019	" Teacher , Moses taught us that if a mans brother die , and leave a wife behind him , but no child , that his brother is to marry the widow and to raise up a family for his brother .
41012020	There were once seven brothers , the eldest of whom married a wife , and died leaving no family .
41012021	The second married her , and died without offspring ; the third likewise ;
41012022	and the seven had her , and died without issue .
41012023	And last of all the woman too died . In the resurrection whose wife shall she be ? For the seven had her as wife . "
41012024	" Is not this the reason for your error , " Jesus answered them , " that you know not the Scripture nor the power of God ?
41012025	When they rise from the dead men do not marry , and women are not given in marriage , but they are as the angels are in heaven .
41012026	But in regard to the rising again of the dead , have you never read in the Book of Moses , in the passage about the Bush , how God spoke to him , saying , " I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ?
41012027	God is not the God of the dead , but of the living . You are in grave error . "
41012028	Just then up came one of the Scribes who had heard them arguing , and realized that Jesus had answered them admirably . " What commandment , " he asked , " is the first of all ? "
41012029	Jesus replied . " The first is . " Hear , O Israel , the Lord our God is one Lord ;
41012030	and thou shalt love the Lord thy God , with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy mind , and with all thy strength .
41012031	" The second is this , " Thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself . Other command greater than these there is none . "
41012032	" Admirably said , O Teacher , " exclaimed the Scribe . " You have truthfully said that He is one ,
41012033	and that beside him there is none other , and to love him with all ones heart and with all ones understanding and with all ones might , and to love ones neighbor as oneself is far beyond all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices . "
41012034	Jesus saw that he had answered with discrimination , and said to him , " You are not far from the kingdom of God . " After that no one ventured to question him .
41012035	While he was teaching in the Temple courts , Jesus in his turn asked . " How is it that the Scribes say that the Christ is the son of David ?
41012036	David himself said in the Holy Spirit , " The Lord said to my Lord , Sit at my right hand until I make thy foes the footstool of thy feet .
41012037	" David himself then calls him Lord ; so how can he be his son ? " Now the great mass of the people were wont to listen to him with delight ;
41012038	and in his teaching he said . " Look out for the Scribes who like to walk about in long robes , and to receive salutations in the street , and to have prominent places in the synagogues ,
41012039	and seats of honor at dinner-parties ;
41012040	they who consume the property of widows and make long , pretentious prayers . The greater shall their condemnation be . "
41012041	Then Jesus took his seat opposite the treasury and watched the people putting their offerings into the chest . Many rich people were putting in large sums .
41012042	There came also a poor widow who dropped in two little coins , worth a cent .
41012043	On this he called his disciples to him , and said . " I tell you solemnly that this poor widow has put in more than all who have put their offerings into the treasury ;
41012044	for they have all put in what they could spare out of their surplus , but she , out of her penury , has put in all that she possessed , her whole living . "
41013001	As Jesus was walking out of the Temple courts , one of his disciples said to him , " Look , Teacher , what wonderful stones and buildings these are ! "
41013002	" You see these mighty buildings ? There shall not be left here one stone upon another which shall not be thrown down , " he answered .
41013003	When he had seated himself on the Mount of Olives , facing the Temple , Peter and Jamesand Johnand Andrew asked him privately ,
41013004	" Tell us when these things shall be , and what shall be the sign that all these predictions are about to be fulfilled . "
41013005	So Jesus began to tell them .
41013006	" Be ye watchful lest any one mislead you . Many will come in my name , saying , I am he , and will mislead many .
41013007	But when you hear of wars and rumors of wars do not be dismayed , such things must come , but the end is not yet .
41013008	For nation shall rise in arms against nation , and kingdom against kingdom . There will be earthquakes in various places , and famines ; these are the beginning of birth-pangs .
41013009	" You yourselves must be on your guard . They will hand you over to the courts , and you will be flogged on the synagogues ; and you will stand before rulers and kings for my sake , to witness to them for me .
41013010	But the gospel must first be proclaimed to all the nations .
41013011	When , however , they are leading you all to trial , do not worry beforehand about what you are to say , but whatever is given you in that hour , that say , for it is not you who speak , but the Holy Spirit .
41013012	" And brother will betray brother to death , and a father his child , and children will rise up against their parents , and have them put to death .
41013013	You will be hated by all men for my names sake , but he that endures to the end shall be saved .
41013014	" But when you see the Abomination of Desolation standing where he ought not ( let the reader ponder this ) , then let those in Judea flee to the mountains ;
41013015	let him who is on the housetop not go down , nor go in to get anything out of his house ;
41013016	and he who is in the field , let him not turn back to get his cloak .
41013017	And alas for the pregnant women , and for those that are nursing their infants in those days !
41013018	Pray that it may not come in the winter .
41013019	For those will be days of suffering the like of which has never been from the beginning of Gods creation until now , and never shall be .
41013020	And had not the Lord cut short those days , not a single person would escape ; but for the elects sake whom he has chosen , he has cut them short .
41013021	" At that time if any one tell you , See , here is Christ , or See , there he is , do not believe it ;
41013022	for false Christs and false prophets will arise and will show signs and wonders , to lead astray the very chosen , if they can .
41013023	Be on your guard ! I have told you it all beforehand .
41013024	" But when the tribulation is past , in those days the sun will be darkened and the moon will not shed her light ,
41013025	and the stars will be falling from the sky , and the powers in the heavens will be shaken .
41013026	Then will they see the Son of man coming in clouds , with great power and glory .
41013027	Then he will send forth the angels and gather his chosen from the four winds , from uttermost earth to uttermost sky .
41013028	" From the fig tree learn now her parable ; as soon as ever her branches are full of sap and bursting into leaf , you know that summer is near .
41013029	So also do you , whenever you see these things happening , know that He is near , at your very door .
41013030	I tell you truly that the present generation shall not pass until all these things begin to happen .
41013031	Earth and sky shall pass away , but my words shall not pass away .
41013032	But concerning that day or that hour no one knows , not even the angels in heaven ,
41013033	nor the Son , but only the Father .
41013034	Take heed ! Awake ! for you never know the time . As a man gone abroad and leaving his house gives authority to his slaves , to each his task ;
41013035	and orders the porter to keep watch ; keep watch then , for you do not know when the master of the house is coming - in the evening , at midnight , at cockcrow , or in the morning -
41013036	lest he should come unexpectedly and find you sleeping ;
41013037	and what I say to you , I say to all . Be awake and on guard . "
41014001	Now two days later was the feast of the Passover and of Unleavened Bread . Both the chief priests and the Scribes were continually seeking how they might arrest him by a stratagem and kill him ;
41014002	but , " Not on a feast-day , " they said , " for fear there should be a riot among the people . "
41014003	And while he was in Bethany , in the house of Simon the Leper , while he was dining , a woman came with an alabaster vase of very costly , pure spikenard perfume , and , breaking the vase , she poured the perfume on his head .
41014004	Some of those who were present said among themselves indignantly . " Why has the perfume been wasted like this ?
41014005	That perfume could have been sold for more than one hundred and fifty dollars , and given to the poor . "
41014006	So they began upbraiding her , but Jesus said . " Let her alone . Why are you troubling her ?
41014007	She has done a beautiful thing to me . For you always have the poor among you , and can show them kindness whenever you wish , but me you will not always have .
41014008	She has done what she could . she has before time anointed my body for my burial .
41014009	I tell you in solemn truth that wherever the gospel is preached throughout the whole world , there what she has done shall be told in remembrance of her . "
41014010	Now Judas Iscariot , one of the Twelve , went away to the high priests to betray Jesus to them ;
41014011	and they were glad when they heard it , and promised to pay him money . So he kept looking for an opportunity to betray him .
41014012	And the first day of the feast of Unleavened Bread , the day for killing the paschal lamb , his disciples asked him , " Where do you want us to go and make preparation for you to eat the Passover ? "
41014013	Then he sent two of his disciples , and told them . " Go into the city , and you will meet a man carrying a jar of water .
41014014	Follow him ; and whatever house he enters , say to the master of the house , The Teacher asks , " Where is your guest-chamber , where I may eat the Passover with my disciples ? "
41014015	He will himself show you a large , upper room , furnished and ready . there make preparation for us . "
41014016	So the disciples went off , and came into the city , and found everything as he had told them .
41014017	So they made ready the Passover , and as night fell he came , with the Twelve .
41014018	While they were at the table , eating , Jesus said solemnly . " It is one of you who will betray me - one who is eating with me . "
41014019	They began to be sorrowful and to say to him , one after another , " Surely , not I ? "
41014020	" It is one of the Twelve , " said Jesus , " one who is dipping into the same dish with me .
41014021	For the Son of man is going his way , as the Scripture says , but woe to that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed ! It were good for that man if he had never been born . "
41014022	And as they were eating he took bread , and after the blessing , broke it , and gave it to them , saying , " Take it , this is my body . "
41014023	Then he took a cup , and when he had given thanks , he gave it to them , and they all drank of it ,
41014024	and he said . " This is my covenant blood , which is poured out for many .
41014025	Solemnly I tell you I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine , until that day I drink it new in the kingdom of God . "
41014026	Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives .
41014027	And Jesus said to them . " All of you are about to stumble , for it is written , " I will smite the shepherd , and the sheep shall be scattered abroad .
41014028	" But after my resurrection I will go before you into Galilee . "
41014029	" Although they all stumble and fall , yet will not I , " answered Peter .
41014030	Jesus said to him , " I tell you in solemn truth that you yourself , today on this very night , before the cock crow twice , shall three times disown me . "
41014031	But Peter kept protesting passionately , " Though I must die with you , I will not disown you ! " And they all kept saying the same .
41014032	So they came to a place named Gethsemane , and he said to his disciples , " Sit down here while I pray . "
41014033	Then he took Peter and Jamesand Johnwith him , and began to be full of terror and distress ;
41014034	and he said to them . " My soul is full of anguish , even unto death ; wait here , and keep watch . "
41014035	So he went a little farther , and throwing himself upon the ground , he prayed repeatedly that , if it were possible , the hour might pass away from him .
41014036	" Abba , Father , " he said , " all things are possible with thee . Take this cup away from me . Yet not what I will , but what thou wilt . "
41014037	Then he came and found them asleep , and he said to Peter . " Are you sleeping , Simon ? Could you not keep watch one hour ?
41014038	Keep watch , all of you , and pray that you may not come into temptation ; the spirit is willing , but the flesh is weak .
41014039	Then he went away again and prayed , saying the same words ;
41014040	and when he returned he found them once more asleep , for their eyes were heavy with sleep , and they knew not what to say to him .
41014041	Then he came the third time , and said . " Sleep on now , and take your rest ! It is over . My hour is come . Look ! the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
41014042	Rouse yourselves , let us go . See ! my betrayer is at hand . "
41014043	At that instant , while he was yet speaking , Judas , one of the Twelve , came up , and with him a mob armed with swords and clubs , sent by the high priests and Scribes and elders .
41014044	Now the betrayer had given them a sign . " The one I kiss , " he said , " is the man . Arrest him , and take him away safely . "
41014045	So he came and going straight up to Jesus he said .
41014046	" Rabbi , " and kissed him . Then they laid hands on him and took him .
41014047	But one of the bystanders drew his sword , and struck the slave of the high priest , and cut off his ear .
41014048	But Jesus interposed , saying . " Are you come out to arrest me with swords and clubs , as if I were a robber ?
41014049	Day after day I was face to face with you in the Temple courts , teaching , and you did not seize me . But this is done that the Scriptures might be fulfilled . "
41014050	Then they all forsook him and fled .
41014051	One young man , however , began following him , with only a linen sheet thrown round his naked body .
41014052	They seized him , but he left the linen sheet and fled away naked .
41014053	Then they took Jesus to the high priest , and all the chief priests and elders and Scribes came with him .
41014054	Peter also had followed Jesus at a distance , until he was inside the court of the high priest . There he was sitting among the officers , warming himself in the light of the fire .
41014055	Meanwhile the high priests and all of the Sanhedrin were trying to get evidence against Jesus , so as to have him put to death , but they found none ;
41014056	for though many gave false witness against him , their testimony did not agree .
41014057	Some came forward and swore falsely , saying ,
41014058	" We heard him say , I will tear down this temple made by hands , and in three days I will build another temple not made by hands . "
41014059	But even their evidence did not agree .
41014060	Then the high priest rose and stood forth among them . " Have you no answer to make ? " he asked Jesus ; " What is it that these testify against you ? "
41014061	But he remained silent , and answered nothing . Again the high priest questioned him . " Are you the Christ , " he said , " the Son of the Blessed ? "
41014062	" I am , " Jesus answered , " and you all shall see the Son of man seated on the right hand of Power , and coming with the clouds of heaven . "
41014063	Then the high priest tore his vestments . " Why do we need any further witness ? " he exclaimed .
41014064	" Did you hear his blasphemy ? What is your verdict ? "
41014065	Then they all condemn him to be worthy of death . Some began to spit on him , and to blindfold him while striking him and saying , " Prophesy . " The officers , too , received him into custody with blows .
41014066	Now while Peter was below in the courtyard , there came one of the maid servants of the high priest , and saw Peter warming himself .
41014067	She looked at him , and said , " You too were with the Nazarene , Jesus . "
41014068	But he denied it . He said . " I dont know , I dont understand what you are saying . " Then he went out into the porch , and the cock crew .
41014069	Again the maid servant saw him , and began again to tell the bystanders , " He is one of them . "
41014070	A second time he continued to deny it . After a little the by-standers began to say to Peter again , " Surely you are one of them , for you are a Galilean . "
41014071	But he began with curses an solemn oaths to say , " I do not know the man you are talking about . "
41014072	At that instant for the second time a cock crew . Then Peter recalled the word which Jesus had spoken to him , " Before the cock crows twice you will disown me thrice . " And as he thought of it , he began to weep aloud .
41015001	As soon as it was down , after the high priests had conferred with the elders and the whole Sanhedrin , they bound Jesus , and took him away , and handed him over to Pilate .
41015002	Pilate questioned him , " Are you the King of the Jews ? " In reply Jesus said , " It is as you say . "
41015003	When the chief priests continued making many accusations against him , Pilate repeatedly questioned him .
41015004	" Do you make no answer ? " he said ,
41015005	" See , how many accusations they are making . " But Jesus no longer made any answer , at which Pilate wondered .
41015006	Now at the time of the feast it was customary to release to them a prisoner , whatever one they asked for .
41015007	A man named Barabbas was there in prison , with some rioters who had committed murder during an uprising .
41015008	So when the crowd went up and began asking Pilate to follow his usual custom ,
41015009	he asked them , " Do you wish me to release the King of the Jews ? "
41015010	For he recognized that it was through spite that the high priests had handed him over .
41015011	But the chief priests incited the crowds to have Barabbas released to them , instead .
41015012	So Pilate spoke to them once more , " What them shall I do to him you call King of the Jews ? "
41015013	Then they shouted again , " Crucify him ! "
41015014	" Why , what wrong has he done ? " Pilate kept saying . But they shouted furiously , " Crucify him ! "
41015015	So Pilate , who wished to make himself strong with the crowd , released Barabbas to them , and gave Jesus over for crucifixion , after he had scourged him .
41015016	The soldiers then led him away into the courtyard ( Praetorium ) , and called together the whole battalion .
41015017	They clothed Jesus in purple , and plaited a crown of thorns , and placed it on his head .
41015018	Then they began to salute him . " Hail , King of the Jews , " they said .
41015019	They kept striking him on the head with a rod , and spitting upon him ; and on bended knee they did him homage .
41015020	And after their sport with him , they stripped off the purple robe , and put on his own clothes , and led him out to crucify him .
41015021	Simon a Cyrenian , a passer-by , who was coming from the country ( the father of Alexander and Rufus ) , they commandeered to carry the cross of Jesus .
41015022	So they led him to the place called Golgotha - a name which means " the place of a skull . "
41015023	There they attempted to give him wine mingled with myrrh ; but he refused it . Then they crucified him , and divided his garments among them , casting lots upon them to see what each should take .
41015025	It was nine oclock in the morning when they crucified him .
41015026	Over his head there was written the words of the charge against him . " The King of the Jews "
41015027	Now with him they crucified two robbers , one on his right hand and one on his left .
41015029	And the passers-by kept jeering at him , wagging their heads and saying . " Ah ! you who were to destroy the sanctuary and rebuild it in three days , save yourself !
41015030	Come down from the cross !
41015031	In the same way the high priests also , as well as the Scribes , kept on mocking him to themselves . " He saved others , " they said , " but himself he cannot save .
41015032	The Christ ! The King of Israel ! Let him now come down from the cross , that we may see and believe . " They also who had been crucified with Jesus kept reviling him .
41015033	At noon a darkness came over the whole country , lasting until three in the afternoon .
41015034	At three oclock Jesus cried in a loud voice , " Eloi , Eloi , lama sabachthani ? " which means , " My God , my God , why hast thou forsaken me ? "
41015035	When they heard this , some of the bystanders said , " Listen , he is calling for Elijah . "
41015036	Then a man ran and filled a sponge full of sour wine , and put it on a stick , and offered it to him to drink , saying , " Wait , let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down ! "
41015037	But Jesus uttered a loud cry and expired .
41015038	And the curtain of the Sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom .
41015039	Then the army captain , who was standing facing Jesus when he thus died , said , " in truth this man was a Son of God . "
41015040	There were some women also watching from a distance . Among them were both Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of Jamesthe younger and of Joses , and Salome ,
41015041	women who used to follow him when he was in Galilee , and minister to him ; and many other women who had come up to Jerusalem with him .
41015042	Toward sunset , as it was the preparation ( that is the day preceding the Sabbath ) ,
41015043	there came Joseph of Arimathea , a Councilor , honorable in rank , who was himself also looking for the kingdom of God . He boldly went in to Pilate to ask for the body of Jesus .
41015044	But Pilate wondered whether he were already dead . So he summoned the army captain , and inquired if he had been any time dead ;
41015045	and when he learned the fact from the army captain he gave the body to Joseph .
41015046	So Joseph bought him a sheet , and took Jesus down , wound him in the sheet , and laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out of a rock , and then rolled a stone against the opening of the tomb ;
41015047	and Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses were watching to see where he was laid .
41016001	When the Sabbath was past , Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James , and Salome brought spices in order to go and anoint him .
41016002	And very early in the morning , on the first day of the week , they came to the tomb as the sun was rising ;
41016003	and they kept saying to one another , " Who will roll away the stone for us from the door of the tomb ? "
41016004	But then as they looked up they saw that the stone , which was a very large one , was already rolled away ;
41016005	and upon entering the tomb they saw a young man sitting on the right side , clothed in a white robe .
41016006	They were terrified , but he said to them . " Do not be terrified ! You are seeking Jesus the Nazarene , who was crucified ? He is risen ; he is not here . See , the place where they laid him !
41016007	But go , tell his disciples and Peter , " He is going before you into Galilee , where you will see him , as he told you . "
41016008	So they went out , and ran from the tomb , for they were trembling and amazed ; and they said nothing to any one , for they were afraid -
41016009	Now after his resurrection , early on the first day of the week he appeared first to Mary Magdalene , from whom he had driven out seven demons .
41016010	She went and told those who had been with him , as they mourned and wept .
41016011	But they , although they heard that he was living and had been seen by her did not believe it .
41016012	After this he appeared in another form to two of them as they were walking on their way into the country .
41016013	They too went , and told the others ; but they did not believe them , either .
41016014	Afterward he appeared to the Eleven themselves , as they were eating , and reproached them for their lack of faith , and stubborn hearts , because they disbelieved those who had seen him risen .
41016015	And he said to them . " Go into all the world and preach the gospel to the whole creation .
41016016	He who believes and is baptized shall be saved , but he who disbelieves shall be condemned .
41016017	Moreover these signs shall follow those who believe . They shall drive out demons in my name ; they shall speak with new tongues in foreign languages ;
41016018	they shall pick up serpents , and if they drink any poison it shall not hurt them ; they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover . "
41016019	So then the Lord Jesus , after he had spoken to them , was taken up into heaven , and sat down at the right hand of God .
41016020	But they went forth and preached everywhere , the Lord working with them , and confirming the message by the miracles which followed .
42001001	Seeing that many have taken it in hand to draw up an account of those matters which have been fully established among us ,
42001002	just as they reported them to us , who were from beginning eye-witnesses and ministers of the word ,
42001003	it seemed good to me also accurately , from the very beginning , to write them to you in order , most excellent Theophilus ,
42001004	so that you may know the certainty of the story which you have been taught by the word of mouth .
42001005	In the reign of Herod , King of Judea , there was a certain priest , named Zachariah , belonging to the class of Abijah . He had a wife named Elizabeth ,
42001006	who was a descendant of Aaron . They were both righteous in the sight of the Lord , walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the law , blameless .
42001007	Now they had no child , for Elizabeth was barren , and both were far advanced in years .
42001008	Now while Zachariah was acting as priest before God in the due course of his class , it fell to his lot , according to the custom of priesthood ,
42001009	to enter into the sanctuary of the Lord and to burn incense .
42001010	And the whole multitude of the people were without , praying at the hour of incense .
42001011	Then there appeared to him an angel of the Lord , standing on the right side of the altar of incense .
42001012	And as he saw him Zachariah was troubled , and fear fell upon him .
42001013	But the Angel said to him . " Do not be afraid , Zachariah , because your petition has been heard , and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son , and you are to call him John .
42001014	" And he shall be to you a joy and an exultation , and many shall rejoice over his birth .
42001015	" For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord , " He shall drink neither wine nor strong drink , " He shall be filled with the Holy Spirit from the hour of his birth ,
42001016	" And shall win many of the sons of Israel to the Lord , their God .
42001017	" He shall go before Him in the wisdom and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous , and so to make ready for the Lord a people prepared for him . "
42001018	" How shall I be sure of this ? " said Zachariah to the Angel . " For I am an old man and my wife is advanced in years . "
42001019	" I am Gabriel , " answered the angel , " who stand in the presence of God ; and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring and to bring you this good news .
42001020	" And now you shall be silent and unable to speak until the day the day when this has taken place ; because you did not believe my words - Words which will be fulfilled at their appointed time . "
42001021	Meanwhile the people were waiting for Zachariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the sanctuary .
42001022	And when he came out he could not speak to them , and then they knew that he had seen a vision in the sanctuary . He kept making signs to them and remained dumb .
42001023	As soon as his term of priestly service was ended he went home ;
42001024	and after those days Elizabeth , his wife , Conceived , and she hid herself five months , saying .
42001025	" This has the Lord done for me . He has now deigned to take the away my reproach among men . "
42001026	Six months later the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a town in Galilee , called Nazareth ,
42001027	to a maiden betrothed to a man named Joseph , a descendant of David . Her name was Mary .
42001028	The angel went in and said to her . " Joy to you , highly favored one ! " The Lord is with you . "
42001029	Mary was greatly agitated at his word , and was revolving in her mind what this salutation could mean .
42001030	when the angel said to her . " Fear not Mary , for you have found grace with God .
42001031	" And behold , you shall conceive in your womb and bear a son ; and you shall call his name Jesus .
42001032	" He shall be great , and shall be called the Son of the Most High . " And the Lord God will give him the throne of his forefather David ,
42001033	" and he shall reign over the House of Jacob forever ; and of his kingdom there shall be no end . "
42001034	And Mary said to the angel . " How can this be ? For I have no husband ? "
42001035	" The Holy Spirit shall come upon you , " said the angel , " and the power of the most High shall overshadow you , and therefore the holy offspring which is born , shall be called the son of God .
42001036	" And behold your kinswoman , Elizabeth , she also has conceived a son in her old age , and this was the sixth month with her that was called barren .
42001037	" For no word of God shall be void of power . "
42001038	Then Mary said . " Behold I am Lords slave . Let it be to me as you have said . " Then the angel departed from her .
42001039	Soon after this Mary set out and hastened unto the hill-country to a town in Judah ;
42001040	and there she came into the house of Zachariah , and greeted Elizabeth .
42001041	And when Elizabeth heard her salutation , the babe leaped in her womb , and Elizabeth herself was filled with the Holy Spirit ,
42001042	and called out with a loud cry . " Blessed are you among women , and blessed is your unborn child !
42001043	" But why is this honor done me , that the mother of my Lord should come me ?
42001044	" For behold when the sound of your salutation reached my ears , the babe leaped with joy within my womb .
42001045	" And blessed is she who believed that the Lords words spoken to her would be fulfilled . "
42001046	And Mary said . " My soul doth magnify the Lord ,
42001047	" My spirit exults in the God , who is my Saviour ,
42001048	" For he has regarded the humiliation of his slave , And from this hour all ages will count me blessed .
42001049	" For he who is mighty has done great things for me ; And holy is his name .
42001050	" His mercy is unto generations and generations on those who reverence him .
42001051	" He has showed strength with his arm . " He has scattered proud in the imagination of their hearts ;
42001052	" he has put down princes from their thrones , and has exalted those of low degree .
42001053	" The hungry he has filled with good things , But the rich he has sent empty away .
42001054	" He has helped Israel , his servant , that he might remember mercy ,
42001055	" As he spoke to our forefathers , to Abraham and his offspring forever . "
42001056	So Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months and returned home .
42001057	Now when the time of Elizabeths delivery was come , she gave birth to a son ;
42001058	and her neighbors and kinsfolk heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy toward her ; and they rejoiced with her ,
42001059	and came on the eighth day to circumcise the child . They were about to call him " Zachariah , " after his father ,
42001060	when his mother said , " No , he is to be called John . "
42001061	Said they , " You have no relatives of that name ! "
42001062	Then they asked his father by signs what he wished to call the child .
42001063	So he asked for a writing tablet and wrote down , " His name is John . "
42001064	Every one was surprised , and at once his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed , and he spoke , blessing God .
42001065	And there came a great fear upon all in the neighborhood ; and throughout the hill country of Judea all these sayings were much talked about .
42001066	All the story laid it up in their hearts , saying " What , then , will this child be ? " For the Lords hands was with him .
42001067	And his father , Zachariah , was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied , saying .
42001068	" Blessed be the Lord , the God of Israel , For he has visited and redeemed his people ,
42001069	" And has raised up a mighty Deliverer for us In the house of his servant David ,
42001070	" As he spake by the mouth of his holy Prophets Which have been since the world began
42001071	To deliver us from our enemies , and from the power Of all who hate us .
42001072	" He showed mercy to our forefathers , He remembered his holy covenant ,
42001073	" The oath which he swore to Abraham , our forefather ,
42001074	" That he we should be delivered out of the Hand of our enemies , And should serve him without fear ,
42001075	" In holiness and righteousness before him All our days .
42001076	" And thou , child , shalt be called the Prophet of the Most High , For thou shalt go before the Lord to prepare the way
42001077	" To give to his people a knowledge of salvation Through the remission of their sins ,
42001078	" Through the heart of mercy of our God , Whereby the Dayspring from on high shall visit us ,
42001079	" To give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death , And to guide our feet into the paths of peace . "
42001080	And the child grew , and became strong in the Spirit , and remained in the desert till the day of his showing to Israel .
42002001	In those days Augustus Caesar issued an edict for a census of the whole inhabited world .
42002002	This was the first census , When Quirinius was governor of Syria .
42002003	And every one went to be registered , each to the town to which he belonged .
42002004	And Joseph also went up from Galilee , out of the city if Nazareth , into Judea , to Davids town of Bethlehem , because he was of the house and family of David .
42002005	He went to be registered along with Mary , who was espoused to him , and was pregnant .
42002006	But while they were there the days were fulfilled for her delivery .
42002007	And she gave birth to her firstborn son ; and she wrapped him in swaddling clothes , and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn .
42002008	And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the fields , keeping watch over their flocks by night .
42002009	When suddenly an angel of the Lord stood by them , and the glory of the Lord shone round them ; and they feared with a great fear . The angel said to them .
42002010	" Have no fear , for behold , I bring you good tidings of great joy , which shall be for all the people .
42002011	" For unto you born this day in there is born in Davids town a Saviour , who is the Anointed Lord .
42002012	" And this is a sign to you ; You shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling-clothes lying in a manger . "
42002013	And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the Heavenly army praising God and saying ,
42002014	" Glory to God in the highest , And in earth peace among men who please him "
42002015	Now when the angels had left them , and gone away to heaven , the shepherds said to one to another , " Let us go now even to Bethlehem , and see this saying which has come to pass , which the Lord has made known to us . "
42002016	so they made haste , and came and found Mary and Joseph , and the babe lying in the manger .
42002017	When they had seen , they made known about the words which had been spoken to them concerning the child .
42002018	And all who heard it were astonished at the things which were told to them by the shepherds .
42002019	But Mary treasured up all those words , Often pondering on on them in her heart .
42002020	And the shepherds returned , glorifying God and praising him for all those things that they had seen and heard , even as it was told to them .
42002021	When eight days had passed , and the time had come to circumcise him , he was called Jesus , the name given him by the angel before his conception in the womb .
42002022	And when the days for purification according to the law of Moses had passed , they took him up to Jerusalem , to present him to the Lord ,
42002023	as it is written in the law of Moses , Every firstborn male shall be called holy to the Lord .
42002024	And they also offered a sacrifice as commanded in the Law of the Lord A pair of turtle-doves or two young pigeons .
42002025	Now there was in Jerusalem a man whose name was Simeon . He was righteous and devout , and was waiting for the consolation of Israel . The Holy Spirit was upon him .
42002026	Now it has been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death , before he had seen the Lords Christ .
42002027	And he came into the Temple , led by the Spirit . and when his parents brought in the child Jesus , to do for him according to the custom of the law ,
42002028	he took him up in his arms and blessed God and said ,
42002029	" Now lettest thou thy slave depart , O Master ; according to thy word in peace ,
42002030	" Because my eyes had seen the salvation ,
42002031	" Which thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples ;
42002032	" A light for the unveiling of the Gentiles And the glory of thy people Israel . "
42002033	And while his father and mother were marveling at the words that were spoken concerning him , Simeon blessed them and said to Mary , his mother .
42002034	" Behold this child is set for the falling and rising up of many in Israel , and for a sign which is spoken against .
42002035	Yea , and a sword shall pierce through your own soul also , that the thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed . "
42002036	There was one Anna , a prophetess , the daughter of Phanuel , of the tribe of Asher . She was advanced in age , having lived with her husband seven years , after her girlhood ,
42002037	and then being a widow even for fourscore and four years . She departed not from the temple , but worshiped with the fasting and prayer , night and day .
42002038	She came up at that very hour , and gave thanks to God , and spoke of the child to all who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem .
42002039	As soon as all that the law required had been done , they returned to Galilee to their own town , Nazareth .
42002040	And the child grew and became strong , becoming full of wisdom , and the grace of God was upon him .
42002041	Now his parents were accustomed to go up to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the Passover .
42002042	And when he was twelve years old they went up , as was customary , at the time of the feast
42002043	After spending the full number of days they started home , but the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem . Joseph and his mother did not know this ,
42002044	but supposed that he was in the company , and went a days journey . Then they hunted for him among his kinsfolk and acquaintance ;
42002045	and when they did not find him they returned to Jerusalem , making anxious inquiry for him .
42002046	On the third day they found him sitting in the Temple , among the Rabbis , both listening to them and asking questions .
42002047	All that heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers .
42002048	When they saw him they were astonished , and his mother said to him " Child , why have you treated us so ? Behold your father and I have been looking for you in anguish . "
42002049	He answered , " Why is it that you have been looking for me , did you not realize that I had to be in my Fathers house ? "
42002050	But they did not understand the words that he spoke to them .
42002051	Then he went down with them , and came to Nazareth , and he was always obedient to them . But his mother kept treasuring up all these incidents in her hearts .
42002052	And Jesus was ever advancing in wisdom and in status and in favor with God and man .
42003001	Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar , when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea , and Herod was tetrarch of Galilee , his brother Philip , tetrarch of Ituraea and Trachonitis , and Lysanias , tetrarch of Abilene ;
42003002	during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas , the word of God came to John , the son of Zachariah , in the Desert .
42003003	And Johnwent into all the region about the Jordan , preaching a baptism of repentance for the remission of sins .
42003004	As it is written in the book of the prophet Isaiah . The voice of one crying in the desert , Prepare the way for God , make straight paths for him .
42003005	Every ravine shall be filled up , Every hill and mountain shall be laid low , The crooked shall be made straight , And the rough roads smooth ;
42003006	And all flesh shall see the salvation of God .
42003007	So Johnused to say to the crowd of those who were going out to be baptized by him . " You breed of vipers , who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
42003008	Then bring forth fruit befitting your penitence , and do not begin to say to yourselves , " We have Abraham as our father . " I tell you that God is able to raise up sons to Abraham out of these stones .
42003009	And now truly the axe is already laid at the root of the trees . So every tree which is not bearing good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire . "
42003010	And the crowd began to ask him questions . " What shall we do then ? " they asked . In reply he said to them .
42003011	" If you have two shirts share with him who has none ; and let him who has food do the same . "
42003012	There came to him publicans also to be baptized , and they said to him , " Master , what must we do ? "
42003013	And he said to them , " Exact no more than the sum allowed you . "
42003014	The soldiers also repeatedly questioned him , saying , " And we , what shall we do ? " " Do not intimidate any one , " he replied , " nor lay false charges , and be content with your pay . "
42003015	And while the people were in expectation , and all men were debating in their hearts about John ,
42003016	whether perhaps he were the Christ , Johnanswered , saying to all of them . " I indeed am baptizing you in water , but One is coming after me , mightier than I , whose shoe-latchet I am not worthy to unloose . He shall baptize you in the Holy Ghost and in fire .
42003017	He has his fan in his hand to cleanse his threshing-floor thoroughly , and to gather the wheat into his storehouse , but the chaff will he burn with unquenchable fire . "
42003018	With many other exhortations then Johndeclared the gospel to the people ;
42003019	but Herod , the Tetrarch , when reproved by him because of Herodias , his brothers wife , and because of all the wicked deeds that he had done ,
42003020	added yet this above them all that he shut up Johnin prison .
42003021	Now after all the people had been baptized , and Jesus himself had been baptized and was praying ,
42003022	heaven opened , and the Holy Spirit , in bodily form like a dove , descended upon him . and a voice came out of heaven , saying . " Thou art my Son , dearly beloved ; in thee is my delight . "
42003023	And Jesus himself when he began to teach was about thirty years of age . He was the son ( as it was supposed ) of Joseph , the son of Heli ,
42003024	son of Matthat , son of Levi , son of Melchi ,
42003025	son of Matthias , son of Nahum , son of Esli ,
42003026	son of Mahath , son of Matthias , son of Semein , son of Joseph , son of Joda ,
42003027	son of Johann , son of Resa , son of Zerubbabel , son of Shealtiel , son of Neri ,
42003028	son of Melchi , son of Addi , son of Cosam , son of Elmadam , son of Er ,
42003029	son of Joshua , son of Eliezar , son of Jorim , son of Mathat , son of Levi ,
42003030	son of Symeon , son of Judah , son of Joseph , son of Jonan , son of Eliakim ,
42003031	son of Melea , son of Menna , son of Mattatha , son of Nathan , son of David ,
42003032	son of Jesse , son of Obed , son of Boaz , son of Salmon , son of Nahshon ,
42003033	son of Amminadab , son of Admin , son of Arni , son of Hezron , son of Perez , son of Judah ,
42003034	son of Jacob , son of Isaac , son of Abraham , son of Terah , son of Nahor ,
42003035	son of Serug , son of Reu , son of Peleg , son of Eber , son of Shelah ,
42003036	son of Cainan , son of Arpachshad , son of Shem , son of Noah , son of Lamech ,
42003037	son of Methuselah , son of Enoch , son of Jared , son of Mahalel , son of Kenan ,
42003038	son of Enos , son of Seth , son of Adam , son of God .
42004001	Then Jesus , full of the Holy Spirit , came back from the Jordan , and was led by the Spirit into the desert for forty days , all the time tempted by the devil .
42004002	He ate nothing during these days , and at the close of them he was hungry .
42004003	The devil said to him , " If you are the Son of God tell this stone to become bread . "
42004004	And Jesus answered him , saying , " It is written that not by bread alone shall man live . "
42004005	And the devil led him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth in an instant of time , and the devil said to him .
42004006	" To you will I give all this authority and this glory ; for it has been handed over to me , and I give it to whomever I wish .
42004007	" If then you will worship me , it shall all be yours . "
42004008	" It is written , " answered Jesus , " Thou shalt worship the Lord , thy God , and him only shalt thou serve . "
42004009	Then he brought him to Jerusalem , and caused him to stand upon the Temple roof , and said to him . " If you really are the Son of God throw yourself down here ;
42004010	for it is written , " He shall give his angels charge of thee , to guard thee safely ;
42004011	" They will bear thee up in their hands , Lest thou dash thy food against a stone . "
42004012	" It has been said , " replied Jesus , " Thou shalt not tempt the Lord , thy God . "
42004013	So , after exhausting on him every kind of temptation , the devil left him for a time .
42004014	Then Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee , and his fame spread throughout all the surrounding country ,
42004015	and he began to teach in their synagogues , and was glorified by all .
42004016	Then he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up . and , as was his custom , he entered into the synagogue on the Sabbath Day , and stood up to read .
42004017	And there was handed him the roll of the prophet Isaiah ; and unrolling it he found the place where it was written ,
42004018	The Spirit of the Lord is upon me Because He has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor , He has sent me to proclaim release to the prisoners , And recovery of sight to the blind ; To set at liberty those that are bruised ,
42004019	To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord .
42004020	Then rolling up the papyrus , he gave it back to the attendant and sat down .
42004021	The eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him , and he began to say to them , " Today is this scripture fulfilled in your hearing . "
42004022	And they all spoke well of him , and marveled at the words of charm that fell from his lips . " Is not this the son of Joseph ? " they asked .
42004023	Jesus answered . " Doubtless you will quote the proverb to me , " Physician , heal thyself ! Do also here in your own country all that we hear that you have done in Capernaum . "
42004024	" I tell you in solemn truth , " he added , " that no prophet is acceptable in his own country .
42004025	In very truth I tell you there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah , when the heavens were closed for three years and six months , when a great famine came over all the land ;
42004026	" yet Elijah was not sent to any one of them , but only to a widow in Zarephath in Sidon .
42004027	" And there were many lepers in Israel in the days of the prophet Elisha , yet none of them was cleansed but only Naaman the Syrian . "
42004028	When they had heard these words , those in the synagogue were filled with fury ;
42004029	they rose , hurried him outside the town , and brought him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built , intending to cast him down headlong .
42004030	But he , passing through the midst of them , took his departure .
42004031	Then he went down to Capernaum , a city of Galilee , and continued to teach the people on the Sabbath Days .
42004032	They were deeply impressed by his teaching because his speech was with authority .
42004033	And there was in the synagogue a man possessed by the spirit of a foul demon . He cried out , in a loud voice , saying .
42004034	" Ha ! Jesus of Nazareth , what business have you with us ? Are you come to destroy us ? I know you who you are , you holy one of God ! "
42004035	And Jesus rebuked him , saying . " Be quiet ! Come out of him . " And when the demon had thrown the man down before them , he came out of him without doing him any harm .
42004036	All were amazed , and began to ask one another , saying . " What is this word ? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits and they come out . "
42004037	And the talk about him spread into every locality in the surrounding country .
42004038	Now when he rose and left the synagogue , he entered into the house of Simon , where Simons mother-in-law lay sick of a great fever . And they kept entreating him for her .
42004039	And he stood over her and rebuked the fever , and it left her ; and at once she arose and ministered unto them .
42004040	At sunset all they who had any sick with any sort of disease brought them to him ; and he laid his hands on every one of them and healed them .
42004041	Demons also came out of many , screaming and saying , " You are the Son of God . " But he rebuked them , and did not permit them to speak , because they knew that he was the Christ .
42004042	And when it was daybreak he left the town , and went away to a solitary place ; and the crowd kept seeking him . Coming at length upon him , they attempted to detain him so that he should not leave them .
42004043	But he said to them . " I must preach the gospel of the kingdom of God to the other towns also ; for that is what I was sent to do . "
42004044	So he continued to preach in the synagogues of Galilee .
42005001	On one occasion when he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret , the crowd pressed upon him to listen to the word of God .
42005002	But he saw two fishing-boats on the shore of the lake ; the fishermen had disembarked and were washing their nets .
42005003	He went on board one of the boats which belonged to Simon , and asked him to push out a little way from land . Then he sat down and continued to teach the crowd from the boat .
42005004	When he had finished speaking , he said to Simon , " Push out into deep water , and let down your nets for a haul . "
42005005	" Master , " answered Simon , " although we toiled all night , we took nothing ; but at your bidding I will let down the nets . "
42005006	And when they had done this they enclosed a great multitude of fish ; and their nets began to break .
42005007	So they motioned to their partners in the other boat to come and help them . They came and filled both boats , so that they began to sink .
42005008	When Simon Peter saw this he fell down at the knees of Jesus , exclaiming , " Depart from me , O Lord , for I am a sinful man ! "
42005009	( For he was amazed , and all who were with him , at the haul of fish which they had made ;
42005010	and so were Simons partners , Jamesand John , sons of Zebedee . ) But Jesus answered Simon . " Fear not ; from this time on , you will be catching men . "
42005011	So when they had brought their boats to land they left everything and followed him .
42005012	Another time when he was in one of their cities , there was a man there full of leprosy . And he , upon seeing Jesus , fell on his face and implored him . " Lord , " he said , " if only you choose you can make me clean . "
42005013	And he stretched out his hand and touching him , said . " I do choose ; be made clean . "
42005014	And instantly the leprosy left him . Jesus ordered him to tell no one , " But be off , " he said , " show yourself to the priest , and make the offering for your cleansing , as Moses commanded , for a testimony to them . "
42005015	But all the more the report about him continued to spread ; and great crowds began to come together to hear him , and to be healed of their infirmities .
42005016	But Jesus himself habitually withdrew into solitary places , and there used to pray .
42005017	One day he was teaching , and near to him were seated Pharisees and teachers of the Law , who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem ; and the power of the Lord was with him to heal .
42005018	And behold there came men carrying a paralytic on a bed ; and they tried to bring him and lay him before Jesus , but they could not because of the crowd .
42005019	So they went up on the roof , and let him down through the tiling , with his bed , into the crowd , before Jesus .
42005020	When Jesus saw their faith , he said to him , " Man , your sins are forgiven you ! "
42005021	And the Scribes and Pharisees began to cavil . " Who is this ? " they asked , " speaking blasphemies ? Who can forgive sins but God alone ? "
42005022	Conscious of their cavilings , Jesus answered , saying .
42005023	" What is this caviling in your hearts ? Which is easier to say , " Your sins are forgiven , " or to say , " Rise and walk ? "
42005024	But that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins ( he said to the paralytic ) , " I bid you rise , take up your bed , and go to your house . "
42005025	And instantly he arose up before them , took up what he had been lying on , and went away to his house , glorifying God .
42005026	Astonishment fell upon them all , and they began to glorify God , and they were filled with awe , and they said , " We have seen strange things today . "
42005027	After this he went forth and noticed a tax-gatherer , named Levi , sitting at the tax-office , and said to him , " Follow me . "
42005028	He rose , left everything , and followed him .
42005029	Levi also made him a great reception at his house . There was a large party of tax-gatherers and others who were dining with them .
42005030	And the Pharisees and their scribes began complaining to his disciples , saying , " Why are you eating and drinking with tax-gatherers and sinners ? "
42005031	Jesus answered them saying . " They who are well have no need of a physician , but they who are ill .
42005032	I am not come to call the righteous but sinners , to repentance . "
42005033	Again they said unto him . " Why do the disciples of Johnfast frequently , and make supplications , as also do the disciples of the Pharisees , but your disciples are eating and drinking ? "
42005034	" Can you make the bridal party fast , " he asked , while the bridegroom is still with them ?
42005035	" But there is coming a day when the Bridegroom will have been taken away from them ; then at that time they will fast . "
42005036	He also told them a parable . " No one , " he said , " tears a piece from a new garment , and patches it upon an old one ; otherwise he will tear the new garment , and the patch from the new will not mend the old .
42005037	" Nor does any one pour new wine into old wine-skins ; otherwise the new wine will burst the skins , and will itself be spilled , and the skins be destroyed
42005038	" But new wine must be put into fresh wine-skins
42005039	" And no man after drinking old wine , wishes for new ; for he says , " The old is better . " "
42006001	It happened that on a Sabbath he was going through the wheat-fields . His disciples were picking the ears and eating the wheat , rubbing it out with their hands .
42006002	And some of the Pharisees asked , " Why are you doing what it is not lawful to do on the Sabbath ? "
42006003	" Have you never read , " answered Jesus , " what David did when he and his followers were hungry ?
42006004	" How he entered into Gods house and took and ate the Presented Loaves , and gave some to his followers , loaves which none must eat but the priests ?
42006005	" THE SON OF MAN , " he told them , " IS LORD EVEN OVER THE SABBATH . "
42006006	On another Sabbath he went into a synagogue and was teaching ; and there was there a man whose right hand was withered .
42006007	Now the Scribes and Pharisees kept watching to see if he would heal on the Sabbath , so that they might be able to bring on accusations to him .
42006008	He was all along aware of their thoughts ; and he said to the man with the withered hand , " Rise , and stand there in the midst . "
42006009	So he rose and stood . Then Jesus said to them . " I ask you whether it is lawful on the Sabbath Day to do good or to do harm ? To save a life or to destroy it ? "
42006010	Then he looked round about on them in anger , and said to him , " Stretch out your hand ! "
42006011	He did so ; and his hand was restored . But they were filled with fury , and they began to talk over together what they could do to Jesus .
42006012	It happened about that time that he went out into the mountain to pray . He continued all night in prayer to God .
42006013	And when day dawned he called his disciples , and from among them he selected twelve , whom also he called Apostles missionaries .
42006014	They were Simon , whom he had also called Peter , and Andrew his brother ; James and John ;
42006015	Philip and Bartholomew ; Mathew and Thomas , James the son of Alphaeus , Simon called the Zealot ;
42006016	Jude the son of James , and Judas Iscariot who was the traitor .
42006017	With these he came down till he reached a level place , where there was a great crowd of his disciples and a great many people from all Judea and Jerusalem and from the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon . These came to hear him , and to be healed of their diseases .
42006018	Those who were tormented by unclean spirits were healed also .
42006019	The whole crowd were trying to touch him , because power emanated from him and cured them all .
42006020	Then raising his eyes upon his disciples he began to say to them . " Blessed are you poor , For the kingdom of God is yours .
42006021	" Blessed are you who are hungry now , For you shall be filled . " Blessed are you who are wailing now , For you shall laugh .
42006022	" Blessed are you when men shall hate you , And excommunicate you and reproach you , and cast out your name as evil because of the Son of man .
42006023	" Rejoice in that day and exult , For your reward is great in heaven ; For even so did their fathers to the prophets .
42006024	" But woe to you rich ! For you already have received your consolation .
42006025	" Woe unto you who are full now ! For you shall suffer hunger . " Woe to you who are laughing now ! For you shall wail and weep .
42006026	" Woe to you when all men shall speak well of you ! For even so did their fathers to the false prophets .
42006027	" But to you who are listening to me I say , Love your enemies , do good to those who hate you ,
42006028	Bless those who curse you , pray for those who calumniate you .
42006029	To him who gives you a blow on the jaw Turn the other jaw also ; And from him who is robbing you of your cloak Withhold not your coat also .
42006030	Give to every one who asks you ; And do not demand your goods back from him who is taking them away .
42006031	And as you would like men to do to you , So do you also to them .
42006032	" If you love those who love you what credit is it to you ? Why even sinners love those who love them .
42006033	" And if you are kind to those who are kind to you , what credit is it to you ? Even sinners do the same .
42006034	" And if you lend to those from whom you are hoping to receive , what credit is that to you ? Even sinners lend to sinners , so as to get as much back .
42006035	" But you must love even your enemies and be kind to them , And lend , despairing of no man . Then your reward will be great , And you will be the sons of the Most High ; For he is kind even to the ungrateful and to the evil .
42006036	" Do you therefore be merciful , As your Father is merciful .
42006037	" Do not judge , and you shall not be judged ; Do not condemn , and you shall not be condemned ;
42006038	" Pardon , and you shall be pardoned ; Give , and gifts shall be given to you ; Full measure , pressed down , shaken together , running over , they shall pour into your bosom . For with what measure you measure , they will measure back to you . "
42006039	He also told them a parable . " Can a blind man lead a blind man ? Will they not both fall into a pit ?
42006040	" There is no disciple who is above his master ; But every one when he is completely trained will be like his master .
42006041	" And why do you look at the splinter that is in your brothers eye , but never consider the beam that is in your own eye ?
42006042	" Or how can you say to your brother . " Brother , allow me to pull that splinter out of your eye , " when you do not see the beam in your own eye ? Hypocrite ! Take out first the beam from your own eye , and then you will see clearly to take out the splinter from your brothers eye .
42006043	" For there is not good tree which bears worthless fruit , nor again any worthless tree which bears good fruit ; for each tree is known by its own fruit .
42006044	" You do not gather figs from thorns , and grapes are not plucked from a bramble-bush .
42006045	" The good man out of the good treasure-house of his heart brings forth good ; and the evil man out of the evil treasure-house of his heart brings forth evil ; for the mouth speaks out of the abundance of the heart .
42006046	" And why are you calling me Lord , Lord , and not doing what I tell you ?
42006047	" I will show whom the man that comes to me , and listens to my works , and does them , is like .
42006048	" He is like a man who is building a house who digged and went deep and laid a foundation upon rock . And , when a flood came , the torrent dashed against that house , but could not move , because it had been founded upon rock .
42006049	" But he who listens but does not do , is like a man who built a house upon the soil , without foundations , against which the torrent burst , and at once it fell in , and the ruin of that house was great . "
42007001	After he had ended all his sayings in the hearing of the people , he went to Capernaum .
42007002	Here the slave of a certain Roman captain , a man dear to his master , was ill , and at the point of death .
42007003	So when the captain heard about Jesus , he sent elders of the Jews to ask him to come and save his slave .
42007004	And they , when they reached Jesus , asked him earnestly to do this . " He deserves that you should do this , " they said ,
42007005	" for he loves our nation , and himself has built a synagogue for us . "
42007006	So Jesus started to go with them , but while he was not far from the house , the captain sent friends to him with a message . " Lord do not trouble yourself , for I am not fit that you should come under my roof ,
42007007	" and so I did not think myself worthy to come to you ; but speak the word , and let my man be cured .
42007008	" For I also am a man obedient to authority , and have soldiers under me . And I say to one come , and he comes , and to my slave do this or that , and he does it . "
42007009	But when Jesus heard this he was astonished and he turned and said to the crowd that was following him , " I tell you that not even in Israel have I found faith like that . "
42007010	And those who had been sent , on returning to the house , found the slave well .
42007011	Soon afterward he went to a city called Nain , accompanied by his disciples , and a great crowd of people .
42007012	Now when he drew near the gate of the city , behold , they were there carrying out one who was dead , the only son of his mother , and she was a widow .
42007013	A great crowd accompanied her . And when the Lord saw her , he had compassion on her and said to her , " Do not weep . "
42007014	And he came near and touched the bier ; the bearer stopped and he said , " Young man , I bid you to rise . "
42007015	And he who was dead sat up and began to speak ; and he gave him to his mother .
42007016	And awe took hold on them all , and they began to glorify God saying . " A great prophet has risen among us ; " and , " God has visited his people . "
42007017	And the report of what Jesus had done went forth throughout Judea and the surrounding regions .
42007018	Johns disciples brought him word of all these things
42007019	and , calling a certain two disciples to him , he sent them to Jesus , to say , " Are you the coming one , or if we are to expect another ? "
42007020	So the men came to Jesus and said , " Johnthe Baptist has sent us to ask you if you are the coming one , or if we are to expect another . "
42007021	At that moment Jesus was healing many people of diseases and plagues and evil spirits , and to many that were blind he was freely giving their sight .
42007022	So he answered them . " Go your way , tell Johnwhat you have seen and heard . How the blind are seeing , the lame are walking , the lepers are being cleansed , the deaf are hearing , the dead are being raised , and the poor are hearing the proclamations of glad tidings .
42007023	" And blessed is he who finds no cause of stumbling in me . "
42007024	When Johns messengers were gone he began to speak to the crowds about John , saying , " What went out you out to the desert to behold ? A reed shaken by the wind ?
42007025	" But what you went out to behold ? A man clothed in soft robes ? Behold , men who are gorgeously dressed and live in luxury are in kings palaces .
42007026	" But what went you to see ? A prophet ?
42007027	" Yes , I tell you and more than a prophet . This is he who it is written . " Behold I send a messenger before thy face , Who shall prepare thy way before thee .
42007028	" I tell you that among all that are born of women not one is greater than John ; yet he that is little in the kingdom of God is greater than he . "
42007029	On hearing this all the people and the tax-gatherers acknowledged the justice of God by being baptized with the baptism of John ;
42007030	but the Pharisees and lawyers who had refused his baptism , frustrated Gods purpose for themselves .
42007031	" To what then shall I compare the men of this generation ?
42007032	" To What are they like , they are like children sitting in the market-place and calling to one another . " We have piped to you , they say , and you have not danced ; we have wailed , and you did not cry .
42007033	" For Johnthe Baptist has come eating no bread and drinking no wine , and you say , He has a demon !
42007034	" The son of man has come eating and drinking , and you say , Behold a gluttonous man and a winebibber , a friend of publicans and sinners !
42007035	" Nevertheless , wisdom is justified by all her children . "
42007036	One of the Pharisees kept urging him to dine , so he entered the house and reclined at table .
42007037	Now there was a woman who was in the city , a sinner and when she knew that that Jesus was reclining at meat in the Pharisees house , she brought an alabaster vase of perfume ,
42007038	and standing behind , at his feet , weeping , she began to wet his feet with her tears , and to wipe them with her hair , while she tenderly kissed his feet , and poured the perfume over them .
42007039	When he noticed this the Pharisee , who had invited him , said to himself , " If this man were really a prophet he would have perceived who and what sort of woman this is who is touching him , and would know that she is a sinner . "
42007040	Jesus then spoke to him . " Simon , I have a word to say to you . " " Rabbi , say on , " he replied .
42007041	" There were once to men , " said Jesus , " in debt to one money-lender . One owed him fifty pounds ; the other five .
42007042	" When they had nothing pay he forgave them with such charm . " Tell me , then , which of these will love him most ? "
42007043	" I take it , " said Simon , " the one he forgave the most . "
42007044	" You have rightly judged . " answered Jesus , and turning to the woman , he said to Simon . " Do you see this woman ? When I came into your house you gave me no water for my feet ; but she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair .
42007045	" You gave me no kiss ; but she , since she came in , has never ceased tenderly kissing my feet ;
42007046	" you never anointed my head with oil ; but she has anointed my feet with my feet with perfume .
42007047	" This is why I tell you that her sins , many as they are , are forgiven , for her love is great ; but he who is forgiven little , loves but little .
42007048	" Your sins are forgiven , " he said to her .
42007049	Then the other guest began to say among themselves , " Who is this even to forgive sins ? "
42007050	But he said to the woman . " Your faith has saved you . Go in peace . "
42008001	It happened shortly afterwards that he began to go from town to town and village to village , preaching and telling the good news of the kingdom of God .
42008002	The twelve were with him , and certain women whom he had delivered from evil spirits and various diseases . Mary of Magdala , out of whom seven demons have been driven ,
42008003	and Joanna , the wife of Chuza , Herods steward , and Susanna , and many other women , who used to minister to him out of their substance .
42008004	As a great crowd was gathering , and men of town after town kept restoring to him , he spoke a parable to them .
42008005	" A sower went out to sow his seed , and as he sowed some fell by the wayside , and was trodden under foot , and the wild birds ate it up .
42008006	" Some other seed dropped on the rock , as soon as it grew it withered away , because it had no moisture .
42008007	" Another part fell among the thorns ; and the thorns grew with it and choked it .
42008008	" But some fell on good soil , and grew up , and brought forth fruit , a hundredfold . " When he said this , he called out , " Whoever has ears to hear with , let him listen . "
42008009	Then his disciples began to interrupt him , saying , " What does this parable mean ? "
42008010	He answered . " To you it is given to understand the mysteries of the kingdom of God ; But all others are taught in parables so that seeing they shall not see , and hearing they shall not hear .
42008011	" This is the meaning of the parable . The seed is the word of God .
42008012	" Those by the wayside are people who hear , but then comes the devil and carries off the word from their heart , so that they may not believe and not be saved .
42008013	" Those on the rock are people who , upon hearing , receive the word with joy ; but they have no root . For a time indeed they all believe , but in time of temptation they fall away .
42008014	" And that which fell upon thorns is those who have heard , but as they go on their way of word is choked with the cares and riches and pleasures of life ; so they bring no fruit of perfection .
42008015	" And that in the good soil is those who have listened to the message and , in an honest and good heart , hold fast , and bring forth fruit with patience .
42008016	" When he lights a lamp no one covers it with a vase or hides it under a bed ; he puts it on a lamp-stand so whoever may behold the light .
42008017	" For is nothing hidden that shall not be disclosed ; there is nothing secret which shall not be made known and come to the light .
42008018	" Take heed , then , how you listen . for he who has , to him shall it be given , but from him who has not , shall be taken away even what he has . "
42008019	There came to him his mother and his brothers , and they could not reach him because of the crowd .
42008020	But some one told him , " Your mother and brothers are standing outside , desiring to see you . "
42008021	" My mother and brothers , " he answered , " are those who listen to the word of God and obey it . "
42008022	Now it happened that one of these days he got into a boat , And him his disciples , and he said to them , " Let us cross to the other side of the lake . "
42008023	So they set sail . While they were sailing he fell asleep . And there fell on the lake a squall of wind , so that the boat began to fill , and they to be in deadly peril .
42008024	Then they came to him and woke him , saying , " Master , Master , we are lost ! " Then he awoke , and rebuked the winds and the raging of the sea . They ceased , and there was a calm .
42008025	" Where is your faith ? " he asked them , In their terror they were filled with amazement , and said to one another , " Who is this who commands even the winds and the sea , and they obey him ? "
42008026	Then they put in at the country of Gadarenes , which is across from Galilee .
42008027	When he landed here he was met by a certain townsman who was possessed by demons . For a long time he had worn no clothes and nor lived in any house , but in tombs .
42008028	When he saw Jesus he cried out , and fell down before him , and in a loud voice exclaimed . " What have we to do with you , Jesus , you son of God Most High ? I implore you to torment me not ! "
42008029	For Jesus was already commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man . For many times it had seized him and held him , and they again and again kept him under guard , and put him in chains and fetters . But he would break his bonds asunder , as he was driven by the demon in to the desert .
42008030	So Jesus asked him , " What is your name ? " And he answered , " Legion " ( for many demons had entered into him ) .
42008031	So they besought Jesus not to command them to go away into the abyss .
42008032	Now there was a great herd of swine feeding on the hillside , and the demons begged him to give them leave to enter them . He gave them leave .
42008033	The demons came out of the man , and entered into the swine ; the herd rushed violently down over the cliff into the lake .
42008034	And those who saw what had happened fled and reported it in the town and the villages .
42008035	Then the people came out to see what had happened , and came to Jesus , and found the man out of whom the demons had gone sitting clothed and in his right mind , at the feet of Jesus . And they were terrified .
42008036	Then those who had seen it told them how the demon-possessed man had been saved .
42008037	And the whole populace of Gadarenes and the surrounding territory besought Jesus to go away from them ; for they were terror-stricken . So he entered a boat and returned .
42008038	But the man out of whom the demons had gone kept begging him that he might be with him . But Jesus sent him away saying ,
42008039	" Return to your home , and tell them all that God has done for you . " So he went away and throughout the whole city he published how much Jesus had done for him .
42008040	And as Jesus returned the crowd welcomed him ;
42008041	for they were all waiting for him . Just then there came a man named Jarius , and he was ruler in the synagogue . He fell down at Jesus feet and begged him to come into his house ;
42008042	for he had only one daughter , about twelve years of age , and she lay dying . But as he went the crowds continued to press in on him .
42008043	And a woman who for twelve years had had a hemorrhage , and had spent on doctors all that she had , but none had cured her ,
42008044	came close behind him , and touched the hem of his garment ; and instantly the hemorrhage ceased .
42008045	" Who is that touched me ? " said Jesus and when everybody denied it , Peter said , " Master , the crowds are hemming you in and pressing upon you . "
42008046	But Jesus said . " Some one did touch me ; for I perceived that the power was proceeding out of me . "
42008047	Then the woman , who saw that she had not escaped notice , came trembling , and falling down before him , stated before the people for what reason she had touched him , and how she had been instantly healed .
42008048	" Daughter , " he said " your faith has made you well , go on into peace . "
42008049	As he was speaking some one came from the house of the synagogue , saying . " Your daughter is dead ! Do not trouble the Master . "
42008050	But Jesus heard and answered . " Have no fear . Only believe , and she shall be restored . "
42008051	So he came to the house , and would not permit anyone to go in with him except Peter and Johnand James , and the father and Mother of the little girl .
42008052	The people were weeping and bewailing her , but he said . " Stop your wailing ; for she is not dead , but asleep . "
42008053	They began to laugh him to scorn , because they knew well that she was dead .
42008054	But he took her by the hand and called to her , " Little daughter , rise ! "
42008055	And her spirit returned and instantly she stood up .
42008056	He bade them to get her some food . Her parents were amazed ; but he forbade them to tell any one what had been done .
42009001	Then he called the Twelve together , and gave them power and authority over all demons , and to heal ;
42009002	and sent them out to preach the kingdom of God , and heal the sick .
42009003	And he said to them . " Take nothing for your journey , neither staff , nor bag , nor bread , nor money , and do not have two tunics .
42009004	" Into whatever house you enter , there stay , and thence depart .
42009005	" If any one will not receive you , shake off the dust from your feet as you leave this town , as a testimony against them . "
42009006	So they went forth , and walked from village to village , preaching the gospel and healing everywhere .
42009007	Now Herod , the Tetrarch , heard of all that was happening ; and he was perplexed because of its being said by someone that Johnwas risen from the dead ;
42009008	and by some that Elijah had appeared ; and by others that one of the ancient prophets was risen again .
42009009	So Herod said , " I beheaded John , but who is this of whom I am hearing such reports , " And he kept seeking to see him .
42009010	On their return the apostles told him what they had done . and he took them and withdrew in private to a town called Bethsaida .
42009011	But when the crowd learned this they followed him . He received them kindly and spoke to them concerning the kingdom of God , and healed those who needed restored to good health .
42009012	But now the day began to decline , and the twelve came to him and said . " Send away the crowd so that they may go into the villages and surrounding the country to lodge and buy provisions ; for here we are on a solitary place . "
42009013	" Do you yourselves give them food , " he answered . " We have nothing , " they replied " Except five loaves , and a couple fish , unless you mean for us to go and buy provisions for all the crowd . "
42009014	( For there were about five thousand men . ) " Make them sit down in table-companies , of about fifty each , " he said to his disciples .
42009015	This they did , and made them all sit down .
42009016	Then he took the five loaves and the two fish , and looking up in heaven , he blessed them , broke them in pieces , and began to giving to his disciples to apportion among the crowd .
42009017	So they ate and were filled , all of them . And there was picked up that which remained over to them , of broken pieces , twelve basketfuls .
42009018	Now it happened that while he was praying by himself , the disciples were with him , and he asked them a question . " Who do the crowd think I am ? "
42009019	" Johnthe Baptist , " they answered , " But others say Elijah , and others that one of the ancient prophets is risen again . "
42009020	Then he said to them , " But who do you say I am ? Then Peter answered saying , " The Christ of God .
42009021	Then he strictly forbade them to tell this to any one ;
42009022	and he said , " The Son of man must suffer much , and be restricted by the elders and high priests and scribes and be put to death , and on the third day be raised again . "
42009023	And he said to all . " If any man wills to follow me , Let him renounce self and take up his cross daily and follow me .
42009024	" For whoever wills to save his life shall lose it ; and whoever loses his life for my sake shall save it .
42009025	" For what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose or forfeit himself ?
42009026	" For whoever is ashamed of me and of my teachings , of him shall the Son of man be ashamed when he comes in his own and in his Fathers glory , and in that of the holy angels .
42009027	" But I tell you truly there are some of those standing here who will not taste death till they see the kingdom of God . "
42009028	About eight days after this it happened that Jesus took Peter , James , and John , and went up on the mountain to pray .
42009029	And as he was praying the appearances of his countenance became different , and his clothing became white and dazzling .
42009030	And suddenly there were two men talking with him , who were Moses and Elijah .
42009031	These appeared in glory and talked about his departure which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem .
42009032	Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep ; but when they were fully awake they saw his glory , and the two men were standing beside him .
42009033	And when they were preparing to depart from him Peter said to Jesus . " Master , it is good for us to be here ; and let us make three tents , one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah " - not knowing what he was saying .
42009034	And while he was saying this , there came a cloud and began to overshadow them ; and they were awestruck as they entered into the cloud .
42009035	And a voice came out of the cloud , saying . " This is my Son , my chosen one ; listen to him . "
42009036	When the voice ceased Jesus was found alone . And they held their peace , and told no one at that time about what they had seen .
42009037	It happened the next day , when they were come down from the mountain , that a large crowd came to meet him ;
42009038	and a man called out of the crowd saying . " Teacher , I beg you to look upon my son ; for he is my only boy ,
42009039	" and behold a spirit seizes hold of him , and rudely he shouts out , It convulses him till he foams ; indeed it will hardly leave off bruising him sorely .
42009040	" I begged your disciples to cast it out , but they could not . "
42009041	" O faithless and perverse generation , " said Jesus , " how long shall I be with you and bear with you ? Bring your son to me . "
42009042	But while he was yet coming the demon dashed him down , and cruelly convulsed him . Then Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and cured the boy , and gave him back to his father .
42009043	And they were all awestruck at the mighty power of God . But while everyone was marveling at what he was doing , he said to his disciples .
42009044	" Let these words sink into your ears ; for the son of man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men . "
42009045	But they did not understand this saying ; it was hidden from them so that they perceived it not , and they were sore afraid to ask him about his saying .
42009046	Now there arose a dispute among them as to which one of them was the greatest .
42009047	And Jesus who knew the dispute that was in their hearts , took a young child , and placed him by his side ;
42009048	then he said to them . " Whoever shall receive this little child in my name receives me ; and whoever shall receive me receives him that sent me . For it is the lowliest among you all who is great . "
42009049	" Master , " said John , " we saw a man who was casting out demons in your name , and we forbade him , because he was not following us . "
42009050	But Jesus said , " Forbid him not , for he who is not against you is for you . "
42009051	When now when the time drew near for him to be received up , he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem ,
42009052	and sent messengers before him . These went and entered into a Samaritan village to make ready for him .
42009053	But they did not receive him because his face was set to go to Jerusalem .
42009054	And when his disciples , Jamesand John , saw this they said , " Lord , are you willing for us to bid fire come down from heaven and destroy them ? " As Elijah did .
42009055	But he turned and rebuked them and said ,
42009056	" You know not what kind of spirit you share , for the Son of man came not to destroy mens lives , but to save them . " And they went to another village .
42009057	As they were going on their way , a man came to him and said , " I will follow wherever you go . "
42009058	" The foxes have their holes , " Jesus answered , " and the wild birds have their nest , but the Son of man has not where to lay his head . "
42009059	To another he said , " Follow me ! " But he replied , " Permit me first to go and bury my father . "
42009060	" Leave the dead to bury their own dead , " said Jesus to him , " go you and announce , far and wide the kingdom of God . "
42009061	And another man also said to him . " I will follow you , Lord ; but first permit me to bid farewell to those who are in my house . "
42009062	But Jesus answered him , " No man who puts his hand to the plow and then looks back , is fit for the kingdom of God . "
42010001	After this the appointed seventy others , and sent them two by two before his face , into every city and place into which he himself intended to go .
42010002	And he thus addressed them . " The harvest is abundant , but the harvesters are few . do you therefore pray the lord of the harvest to send forth harvesters into his harvest .
42010003	" Go your way ; behold , I am sending you forth like lambs among wolves .
42010004	" Carry no purse , no bag , no shoes ; and do not salute any one on your journey .
42010005	" Into whatever you first enter , say , Peace be to this house !
42010006	" And if there be any son of peace there , your peace shall rest upon him ; but if not it shall return to you .
42010007	" Stay in that same house , eating and drinking what they give . for the laborer is worthy of his hire . Do not go from house to house .
42010008	" And whatever town you come to , and they receive you , eat whatever they put before you .
42010009	" Heal the sick in that town and tell them , The kingdom of God draws near to you .
42010010	" But whatever town you enter , and they do not receive you , Go out into the streets and cry ,
42010011	" The very dust of your town which clings to your feet we wipe off as protest ; but know this , that the kingdom of God is drawing near to you .
42010012	" For I tell you that it will be mare tolerable for Sodom in that day than for that town .
42010013	" Woe unto you , Chorazin ! Woe unto you , Bethsaida ! For had the mighty been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you , they would have repented long ago , sitting in sackcloth and ashes .
42010014	" However , it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you .
42010015	" And you Capernaum , shall you be exalted to heaven ? No ! you shall be brought down to Hades !
42010016	" He who listens to you listens to me . and he who rejects you , rejects me ; he who rejects me , rejects him who sent me . "
42010017	Then the Seventy returned with joy , saying , " Lord even the demons are subject to us in your name . "
42010018	And he said to them . " I watched Satan fall from heaven like a lightning flash .
42010019	" Behold , I give you the power to tread upon serpents and scorpions , and to trample on all the power of the enemy . In no case shall anything do you harm .
42010020	" Nevertheless , do not rejoice at this , that the spirits are subject to you ; but rejoice that your names are written in Heaven . "
42010021	In the same hour he thrilled with joy in the Holy Ghost . " I praise thee , Father , Lord of Heaven and Earth , " he said " for hiding these things from the wise and prudent , and for revealing them to babes . Yea , Father , for so it was well pleasing in thy sight !
42010022	" All things have been delivered to me by my Father , and no one knows who the Son is except the Father ; and who the Father is except the Son , and he the Son wishes to reveal him . "
42010023	And turning to his disciples he said privately . " Blessed are the eyes that see what you see !
42010024	" For I tell you that many prophets and kings have longed to see what you see , and have seen it ; and to hear what you hear , and have heard it not .
42010025	Then a certain lawyer stood up and tempted him . " Master , " he said " what shall I do to inherit eternal life ? "
42010026	And he said to him . " What is written in the Law ? What do you read there ? "
42010027	" You must love the Lord your God , " he answered , with all your heart , and with all your soul , and with all your strength , and with all your with all your mind ; and your neighbor as yourself . "
42010028	" You have answered right , " said Jesus " do that and you shall live . "
42010029	But he , determined to justify himself , said to Jesus , " But who is my neighbor ? " Jesus answered .
42010030	" A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho , when he fell among bandits who both stripped him and beat him , and went off leaving him half dead .
42010031	" Now a certain priest chanced to be going down that way , but on seeing him he passed on the other side .
42010032	" In like manner also a Levite who came to the spot , came and looked at him , and passed on the other side .
42010033	" But a certain Samaritan , as he journeyed , came where he was , and when he saw him was moved with compassion .
42010034	" He went to him bound up his wounds , pouring on them oil and wine . He set him on his own beast , and took him to an inn , and took care of him .
42010035	" The next day he took two silver pieces and gave them to the landlord and said , " Take care of him , and whatever more you spend I will repay it to you on my way back .
42010036	" Which then of these three seems to you to have behaved like a neighbor to the man who fell among bandits ? "
42010037	He replied , " The one who showed mercy on him . " " Go , then , " said Jesus , " and do likewise . "
42010038	It happened as they went on their way that he entered into a certain village were a woman named Martha received him into her house .
42010039	She had a sister named Mary , who after seating herself at the Lords feet was listening to his teaching .
42010040	But Martha meanwhile was growing distracted about much serving . She came up to him and said . " Lord do you not care that my sister has left me alone to do the serving ? Come tell her to take hold of her end of the work along with me . "
42010041	" Martha , Martha , " said Jesus , " you are anxious and worried about many things ,
42010042	" only one thing is really necessary . Mary , moreover , has chosen that good part which shall not be taken away from her . "
42011001	It happened he was praying in a certain place , and when he stopped , one of his disciples said to him , " Master , teach us how to pray , just as Johntaught his disciples . "
42011002	So he said to them . " When you pray , say , " Father , hallowed be thy name ; May thy kingdom come ,
42011003	" Give us day by day our bread for the coming day ;
42011004	" Forgive us our sins ; for we also forgive everyone who has offended us ; " And bring us not into temptation . "
42011005	He also said to them . " Suppose you have a friend and you go to him , My friend , lend me three loaves of bread ,
42011006	" for a friend of mine is come to me from a journey , and I have nothing to set before him .
42011007	" and he from indoors shall answer . Do not pester me . The door is now closed , and my children are with me in bed . I cannot rise and give to you .
42011008	" I tell you that , though he will not rise and give to him because he is his friend , yet because of his importunate persistence he will rise and give him whatever he needs .
42011009	" So I say to you . " Ask , and it shall be given to you ; seek , and ye shall find ; knock and it shall be opened to you .
42011010	" For he that asks receives , and he who seeks finds , and to him who knocks the door shall be opened .
42011011	" What father is there among you who , if his son asks for a loaf , will give him a stone ? Or if he asks for a fish will give him instead a serpent ?
42011012	" Or if he asks for an egg , will offer him a scorpion ?
42011013	" If you give good gifts to your children , how much more shall the Father who is in heaven give the Holy spirit to those that ask him ! "
42011014	Once he was casting out a dumb demon , and when the demon was gone out , the dumb man spoke , and the people wondered .
42011015	But some of them said , " It is by Beelzebub , the prince of demons , that he cast out demons . "
42011016	Others , tempting him , kept seeking from him a sign from heaven .
42011017	He knew their intentions and said to them . " Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste and house falls upon house .
42011018	" And if Satan also is divided against himself , how shall his kingdom stand ?
42011019	" Do you say that I am casting out demons by the power of Beelzebub ? If I then am casting out demons by Beelzebub , by whom are your sons casting them out ? They therefore shall be your judges .
42011020	" But if it is by the finger of God that I am casting out demons , then the kingdom of God is come upon you .
42011021	" When the strong man fully aroused keeps guard over his homestead , his property is undisturbed ;
42011022	" but when the stronger man attacks him , he takes away from the strong armor in which he was trusting and divides up the spoil .
42011023	" He who is not for me is against me , and he who is not gathering with me is scattering .
42011024	" Whenever a foul spirit is gone out of a man , it roams through waterless places , in search of rest ; but when it can find none , it says , I will go back to the house which I have left .
42011025	When it comes and finds the house completely swept and garnished .
42011026	" Then it goes off and fetches seven other spirits more wicked than itself , and they go in and live there . And the last state of that man is worse than the first . "
42011027	It happened while he was saying this , that a certain woman out of the crowd shouted to him , saying , " Blessed is the womb that bore you , and the breast that you have sucked . "
42011028	" No , rather , " he answered , " blessed are those who listen to the word of God , and keep it . "
42011029	When the crowd were beginning to throng about him he proceeded to say . " This is an evil generation ! It seeks a sign , and there shall be no sign be given to it except the sign of Jonah ;
42011030	" for as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites , so shall the Son of man be to this generation .
42011031	" The queen of the South shall rise up in Judgement with the men of this generation , and shall condemn them ; because she came from the ends of the earth to listen to the wisdom of Solomon , and lo , one greater than Solomon is here !
42011032	" The men of the Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with his generation and shall condemn it , for they repented at the preaching of Jonah , and lo ! one greater than Jonah is here !
42011033	" When one lights a lamp he does not put it in a cellar nor under the bushel , but on a lamp-stand that those who enter may see the light .
42011034	" The lamp of the body is your eye ; when your eye is single then your whole body is full of light ; but when it is evil your whole body is full of darkness .
42011035	" Look carefully ! Perhaps that very light of yours is darkness .
42011036	" If , however , your whole body is full of light , without having any part dark , it will be wholly radiant with light , as when the lamp illumines you with its bright rays . "
42011037	When he had finished speaking a Pharisee asked him to dine with him ; so he went in with him and reclined .
42011038	And the Pharisee noticed , to his amazement , that he did not wash his hands before eating ,
42011039	but the Lord said to him . " You Pharisee do cleanse the outside of your cup or plate , but your secret heart is full of extortion and wickedness .
42011040	" Foolish men ! Did not He who made the outside make the inside also ?
42011041	" Better cleanse what is within , and nothing will be unclean for you .
42011042	" But woe unto you Pharisee ! for you tithe mint and rue and every herb , and disregard justice and the love of God ; but these you ought to have done , and not leave the other undone .
42011043	" Woe unto you Pharisee ! for you delight in the best seats in the synagogue , and in the salutation in the market-places .
42011044	" Woe unto you ! for you are like the tombs which are hidden , and men walk over them unsuspecting . "
42011045	Hereupon one of the lawyers exclaimed , " But teacher , in saying such things you are also reproaching us also . "
42011046	" Woe unto you lawyers also ! " said Jesus , " for you load men with irksome burdens , and you yourselves will not touch the burdens with one of your fingers .
42011047	" Woe to you ! for you are building the tombs of the prophets whom you ancestors killed .
42011048	" So you are witnesses , and you consent to the actions of your ancestors . for they killed them , and you build their tombs .
42011049	" For this reason also said the Wisdom of God . I will send them prophets and apostles ; some of them they will kill and some they will persecute ;
42011050	" so that the blood of all the prophets which was shed from the foundation of the world may be required from this generation ,
42011051	" from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah , who perished between the alter and the sanctuary ; yes ; I tell you , it shall be required of this generation !
42011052	" Woe to you lawyers , for you have taken away the key of knowledge ! You yourselves have not entered , and you have hindered those who are trying to enter . "
42011053	After he had gone away , the Scribes and the Pharisee began to set themselves vehemently against him , and to cross-question him upon many points ,
42011054	laying in wait for him , in order to catch a word from his lips .
42012001	Meanwhile when myriads of the multitudes were thronging around him so that they trod one upon another , he began to say to his disciples , first of all . " Beware of the leaven of the Pharisee , which is hypocrisy .
42012002	" There is nothing hidden which shall not be revealed ; nothing concealed that shall not be known .
42012003	" So that what you have said in the dark shall be heard in the light ; and what you have whispered in the inner chambers shall be proclaimed from the housetops .
42012004	" But I say to you who are my friends , do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that have no more that they can do .
42012005	" I will warn you whom you ought to fear . Fear him who , after he was after he has killed , has power to throw you into Gehenna . Yes , I tell you , fear him .
42012006	" Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings ? Yet not one of them is forgotten in the sight of God !
42012007	" But the very hairs of your head are all numbered . Fear not ! You are of more value than many sparrow !
42012008	" And I tell you that whoever confesses me before men , the Son of man will confess him before the angels of God ;
42012009	" and whoever disowns me before men , shall be disowned before the angels of God .
42012010	" If any one shall speak a word against the Son of man it shall be forgiven him ; but he who is blasphemes against the Holy Spirit shall not be forgiven .
42012011	" And when they are bringing you before the synagogues and the rulers and authorities , do not worry about how or what you shall answer ; or what you shall say ;
42012012	" for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that hour what you ought to say . "
42012013	Then one of the crowd said to him , " Master , tell my brother to give me my share of our inheritance . "
42012014	" Man , " said he , " who made me a judge or arbitrator over you ? "
42012015	And to the people he said , " Take heed and guard yourselves from all covetousness , for a mans life does not consist in the abundance of the things which he possesses . "
42012016	Then he spoke to them in a parable . " The ground of a certain rich man bore heavy crops .
42012017	" So he debated with himself saying , What shall I do ? for I have no place in which to store my crops .
42012018	" And he said to himself . This is what I will do . I will pull down my barns and build larger ones in which I will store all my wheat and my goods .
42012019	" And I will say to my soul , " Soul , you have many goods laid up for many years ! Take your ease , eat , drink , and be merry .
42012020	" But God said to him . Foolish man ! This very night your soul is wanted ! And these things you have prepared , whose shall they be ?
42012021	" So is he that lays up treasures for himself and is not rich toward God . "
42012022	Then he said to his disciples . " For this is the reason I say to you . Be not anxious for your life , what you shall eat ; nor yet your body what shall you wear .
42012023	" For the life is more than food , and the body is more than clothes .
42012024	" Consider the ravens ; they neither sow nor reap ; they have no storehouse nor barn . And yet God feeds them . How much more are you worth than the birds ?
42012025	" And which of you by taking anxious thought can add a cubit to his height ?
42012026	" If then you cannot do even that which is least , why are you anxious concerning the rest ?
42012027	" Consider the lilies how they grow ! They toil not , neither do they spin , yet I say to you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these .
42012028	" Now if God so clothe the grass in the field , which today is , and tomorrow is cast into the oven , will he not much more clothe you , O you of little faith ?
42012029	" So do not be asking what ye shall eat , or what ye shall drink , and be not of doubtful mind .
42012030	" For all these things the nations of the world are seeking ; but your Father knows that you have need of these things .
42012031	" But seek his kingdom , and these things shall be added to you .
42012032	" Fear not , little flock , for it is your Fathers good pleasure to give you the kingdom .
42012033	" Sell what you have and give alms . Provide yourselves with purses which do not grow old , a treasure inexhaustible in the heavens , where no thief draws near , nor does moth destroy .
42012034	" For where your treasure is there will your heart be also .
42012035	" Let your loins be girded about and your lamps burning ;
42012036	" and be yourselves like men who are looking for the Lord , on his return from a wedding banquet , so that when he comes and knocks they may at once open the door for him .
42012037	" Happy are those slaves whom their master shall find watching when he comes . I tell you truly that will gird himself , and make them sit down to meat , and come and serve them .
42012038	" And whether it be in the second watch , or in the third , that he comes , and so finds them , happy are those slaves .
42012039	" However , you know this , that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief would come , he would have watched and not have allowed his house to be broken into .
42012040	" Do you also be ready , for in an hour that you think not the Son of man is coming . "
42012041	" Master , " said Peter , " are you speaking this parable to us or to all alike ? "
42012042	The Lord answered . " Who then is that faithful steward , the wise man whom his Lord will put in charge of the rations in due time ?
42012043	" Blessed is that slave whom his master on his coming shall find so doing .
42012044	" Of a truth I tell you that he will put him in charge of his possessions .
42012045	" But if that slave should say to himself , My master delays his coming , and should begin to beat the men and the maids , and to eat and drink and to get drunk ,
42012046	" that slaves master will arrive on a day when he is not expecting him , and at an hour when he knows not , and will surely scourge him , and appoint him his portion with the unfaithful .
42012047	" The slave who knew his Lords will , and made not ready , nor did according to his will , will be beaten with many lashes ,
42012048	" but he who did not know , but did things worthy of a beating , will receive few lashes . To whom much has been given , from him much will be required , and to whom much is entrusted , of him they will ask the more .
42012049	" I came to build a fire upon the earth ; what is my desire ?
42012050	" Would it were already kindled ! But I have a baptism to be baptized with , and how am I straitened till it is accomplished !
42012051	" Do you think that I am come to make peace on the earth ? No , I tell you , but rather dissension .
42012052	" From this time there will be five in one house divided , three against two and two against three ;
42012053	" father against son and son against father ; mother against daughter and daughter against her mother ; mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law . "
42012054	Then he said to the crowd also . " When you see a cloud rising in the west you at once say , There is going to be a shower , and it comes to pass .
42012055	" And when you feel the south winds blowing you say , There will be a hot wind , and it comes to pass .
42012056	" Hypocrites ! you know how to read the face of the earth and of the sky ; but how is it that you do not know how to read the signs of the present time ?
42012057	" And why do you not , even yourselves , judge what is right ?
42012058	" For as you go before the magistrate with your opponent do your utmost to get quit of him , lest he drag you before the judge , and the judge delivers you over to the officer , and the officer cast you into prison .
42012059	" You shall by no means come out of there until you have paid the very last farthing . "
42013001	Now there were some present at that very season who told him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifies .
42013002	" Do you suppose , " he answered them , " that those Galileans were worse sinners than the rest of the Galileans because they have suffered thus ?
42013003	" I tell you no ; but unless you repent , you will all likewise perish .
42013004	" Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them , do you suppose that they were worse offenders than the rest of those who lived in Jerusalem ?
42013005	" I tell you no ; but unless you repent , you will all perish as they did . "
42013006	Then he gave them this parable . " A man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard , and he came to look for fruit on it , but found none .
42013007	So he said to the gardener . " See , for years I have come looking for fruit on this tree , and found none . Cut it down . Why should it actually cumber the ground ?
42013008	" But the gardener answered him . Lord , let it alone this year also , till I have dug around it , and fertilized it .
42013009	" If after that it bears fruit , well and good ; but if not you shall cut it down . "
42013010	Once he was teaching in one of the synagogues , on the Sabbath ,
42013011	a woman was present who had a spirit of infirmity for eighteen years . she was bent double , and could not lift herself up at all .
42013012	Jesus noticed her and called to him and said , " Woman , you are free from your weakness . "
42013013	Then he placed his hand on her , and she instantly stood upright and began to give glory to God .
42013014	But the ruler of the synagogue was indignant at Jesus for healing her on the Sabbath , and said to the crowd . " There are six days of the week on which men ought to work . Therefore come during those , and get cured , but not on the Sabbath Day . "
42013015	But the Lord answered him . " Hypocrites ! " he said , " does not each one of you loose his ox or his ass from the stall on the Sabbath Day , and lead it to water ,
42013016	" and this woman , who is the daughter of Abraham , whom Satan has bound these eighteen years , ought she not have been loosened from bondage , though the day be the Sabbath ? "
42013017	As he said this , all adversaries were put to shame ; and all the crowd rejoiced for the glorious things that he continually did .
42013018	This led him to say . " What is the kingdom of God like ? And to what shall I compare it ?
42013019	" It is like a grain of mustardseed , which a man took and cast into his own garden . It grew and became a tree , and the wild birds nested in its branches . "
42013020	And again he said . " To what shall I liken the kingdom of God ?
42013021	" It is like leaven which a took and hid in three measures of flour until the whole was leavened . "
42013022	So he went on his way through cities and villages ,
42013023	teaching as he journeyed toward Jerusalem . And a man came behind him and said , " Lord are there but few that are saved ? "
42013024	" Struggle to enter in by the narrow door , " he answered , " for I tell you that many will try to enter and not be able ,
42013025	" when once the master of the house is risen up and has shut the door . You will begin to stand outside , and to knock at the door , crying , " Lord , open to us . " I do not know were you came from , he will reply .
42013026	" Then you will begin saying , But we have eaten and drunk in your presence , and you have taught in our streets .
42013027	" But he will answer . " I tell you I do not know were you came from ;
42013028	" depart from me , all of you , you evil-doers . There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you shall see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God , and you yourselves cast out .
42013029	" And people shall come from the Orient and from the Occident , from the north and from the south , and sit down in the kingdom of God .
42013030	" And lo , there are last which shall be first , and there are first which shall be last . "
42013031	That very day there came some Pharisees to him , saying , " Get out of here and go away , for Herod wishes to kill you . "
42013032	" Go , tell that fox , " he answered , " Lo , today and tomorrow I am continuing to cast out demons and perform cures , and on the third day I finish my course .
42013033	" Yet I must continue my journey today , tomorrow , and the day following ; for it would never do for a prophet to perish outside of Jerusalem !
42013034	" O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , you who kill the prophets and stone those who are sent to you ! How often would I have gathered your children , as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings , and you would not !
42013035	" Behold ! Your house is left to you , desolate ! I tell you that you shall never see me again until you say , Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord , "
42014001	It happened on the Sabbath Day when he went into the house of a certain ruler among Pharisees to take a meal , that they were watching him .
42014002	And lo ! there was in front of him a man who had dropsy .
42014003	So Jesus questioned the lawyers and the Pharisees , " Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath Day or not ? "
42014004	They kept silent . Then Jesus took him and healed him and let him go .
42014005	And to them he said , " Which of you when an ox or ass has fallen into a well , will at once pull him out on the Sabbath Day ? "
42014006	They could not answer this .
42014007	He told a parable to the guests when he noticed how they began choosing the best seats . He said to them .
42014008	" When you are invited by any one to a marriage-feast , do not sit down in the best seat , lest a guest more distinguished than yourself has been invited , and your host come to you and say ,
42014009	" Give place to this man , and then with mortification you proceed to take the lowest place .
42014010	" But when you are invited , go and sit down in the lowest place , so that when your host arrives he may say to you , My friend , come up higher . Then you will be honored before the other guest .
42014011	" For every one who exalts himself shall be humbled , and he who humbles himself shall be exalted . "
42014012	Also to his host who had invited him , he continued , saying . " When you are making a dinner-party or a supper , do not invite your friends , or your brothers , or your relatives , or your rich neighbors , lest it chance that they invite you in return , and a recompense be made by you .
42014013	" But when you make a reception , invite the poor , the maimed , the lame , the blind .
42014014	" Then you will be blessed , because they have no means to repay you , but you shall be paid in the Resurrection of the Just . "
42014015	One of his fellow guest who was listening to him , said to him , " Blessed are those who eat bread in the kingdom of God . "
42014016	Jesus answered . " A certain man was making a great feast to which he invited many guests .
42014017	" At dinnertime he sent his slave to say to those who had been invited , Come , for all things are now ready .
42014018	" And they all , without exception , proceeded to excuse themselves . The first told him . I have bought a field , and must needs go and see it . Pray have me excused .
42014019	" The second said . I have bought five yolk of oxen and am on my way to try them . I pray that you will have me excused .
42014020	" I have taken a wife , said the another , and for that reason I am unable to come .
42014021	" So the slave came and presented all these answers to his master . Then the master of the house was indignant , and said to his slave . Go out , quickly , into the streets and alleys of the city , and bring in hither the poor , the maimed , the blind , the lame .
42014022	" And the slave said , My master , your orders have been carried out , but yet there is room .
42014023	" Said the master to his slave . Go out into the roads and the hedges , and make them come in , so that my house may be filled .
42014024	" For I tell you that not one of those invited guests shall taste my supper . "
42014025	Great crowds were along with him , and he turned to them and said .
42014026	" If any one comes to me and does not hate father and his mother , his wife and children , his brothers and sisters , yes , and his own very life also , he cannot be a disciple of mine .
42014027	" Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after me , cannot be a disciple of mine .
42014028	" Which of you who is desirous of building a tower , does not sit down first and count the cost , to see if he has the means to complete it ?
42014029	" Lest it happen that after he has laid the foundations and is unable to complete it , all who see it shall begin to jeer at him saying ,
42014030	" This fellow began to build and could not finish .
42014031	" Or what king as he goes forth to join battle with another king in war does not sit down first and deliberate whether he can meet with ten thousand men the one who is advancing against him with twenty thousand ?
42014032	" If he cannot , while the other king is yet a great way off , he sends an embassy to ask conditions of peace .
42014033	" Just so any one of you who does not renounce all that he has cannot be my disciple .
42014034	" Salt is good , but if even the salt have lost its flavor , with what shall it be seasoned ?
42014035	" It is fit neither for the land nor the dung-hill ; men cast it out . He who has ears to hear let him listen to this ! "
42015001	Now all the tax-gatherers and sinners continued to draw near him , and to listen to him .
42015002	And the Pharisees and Scribes began to complain , saying , " He is welcoming sinners and eating with them ! "
42015003	And he told them a parable .
42015004	" Which one of you men , if he has a hundred sheep , and has lost one of them , does not leave the ninety and nine in the desert and go after the lost one until he finds it ?
42015005	" And after he has found it , he lays it on his shoulder , rejoicing .
42015006	" When he gets home he calls together his friends and his neighbors , saying , " Rejoice with me , for I have found my sheep that was lost .
42015007	" I say to you that even so there shall be joy in heaven over one sinner who repents , more than over ninety and nine just persons who need no repentance .
42015008	" Or , again , suppose a woman has ten coins . If she loses one , does she not light a lamp and sweep the house , and search anxiously until she finds it ?
42015009	" And when she has found it , she calls together her woman friends and neighbors and say , Rejoice with me , for I have found the coin which I had lost .
42015010	" Even so I tell you there is joy in the presence of the angels for God over one sinner who repents . "
42015011	And he said . " There was a man who had two sons .
42015012	" The younger of them said to his father , Father , give me the share of your property which is coming to me . So he divided his means among them .
42015013	" Not many days after that the younger son gathered everything together and took his journey into a distant country ; and there he wasted his money on living unsavingly .
42015014	" After he had spent everything there came a terrible famine in the land , and he began to be in want .
42015015	" So he went and hired to one of the citizens of that land , who sent him out into the fields to feed swine .
42015016	" And he was longing to be filled with the husks which the swine were eating , but no one gave him any .
42015017	" When he came to himself he said . " How many of my fathers hired men have bread enough and to spare , while I am perishing of hunger !
42015018	" I will rise and go to my father , and say to him . " Father , I have sinned against Heaven and in your sight ,
42015019	" " I am no more worthy to be called your son ; only make me like one of your hired men . "
42015020	" So he arose and went to his father ; but while he was yet a great way off , his father saw him and was moved with compassion , and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him .
42015021	" The son said to him , Father , I have sinned against heaven and in your sight and am no more worthy to be called your son .
42015022	" Fetch the best robe , quick , said the father to his slaves , and put it on him , and give him a ring on his finger , and shoes on his feet .
42015023	" Bring that fatted calf and kill it , and let us eat and make merry ,
42015024	" for this son of mine was dead and is alive again - he was lost and is found .
42015025	" So they began to make merry . But his elder son was in the field , and as he drew near to the house he heard music and dancing ,
42015026	" and he summoned one of the slaves , and began to inquire of him what all this meant .
42015027	" Your brother is come , he replied , and your father has killed the fatted calf , because he has him safe and sound .
42015028	" But he was angry and would not go in ; so his father came out , and attempted to plead with him ; but he said to his father .
42015029	" All these years I have been slaving for you and never disobeyed a command of yours . Yet you never gave me even a kid so that I might make merry with my friends .
42015030	" But when this son of yours came , who has devoured your property with harlots , you have killed him the fatted calf .
42015031	" My dear son , answered his father , you are always with me and all that is mine is yours .
42015032	" But it was fitting that we should make merry and rejoice , for this brother of yours was dead and is alive ; he was lost and is found . "
42016001	To his disciples he said . " There was a certain rich man who had a steward , and this steward was accused to him of wasting his property .
42016002	" He called to him to him and said . " What is this that I hear about you ? Render an account of your stewardship ; for you can no longer be steward .
42016003	" Now the steward said to himself . What shall I do , now that my master is taking away my stewardship ? I am not strong enough to dig , to beg I am ashamed .
42016004	" I know what I will do , so that when I am put out of my stewardship , they may receive me into their houses .
42016005	" So he called to him each of his masters debtors and said to the first , How much money do you owe my master ?
42016006	" A hundred measures of oil , he answered . " He said to him , Take your bill and sit down quickly and write fifty . "
42016007	" To a second he said , How much do you owe ? " The man answered , A hundred measures of wheat . " Here is you bill , he said , change it to eighty measures .
42016008	" And the master praised the unjust steward because he had acted shrewdly ; for the sons of this world are in relation to their own generation wiser than the sons of the light .
42016009	" And to you I say , Use mammon , dishonest as it is , to make yourselves friends , so that when it shall fail they will welcome you to the eternal tabernacles .
42016010	" The man who is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much , and he who is unjust in a very little , is unjust also as much .
42016011	" If therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon , who will trust to you the true riches ?
42016012	" And if you are not faithful with what belongs to another , who will give you what is your own ?
42016013	" No one can be a household servants to two masters ; for either he will hate the one and love the other , or he will cling to the one and despise the other . You cannot be the slave of God and of Mammon . "
42016014	Now the Pharisees who loved money listened to all this and they jeered at him .
42016015	He said to them . " You are those that justify themselves in the eyes of men ; but God knows you hearts ; for that which is lofty in the eyes of men is abomination in the eyes of God .
42016016	" The Law and the Prophet lasted until John ; since then the gospel of the kingdom of God is preached , and any one presses in .
42016017	" Yet it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away then for one title of the law to fail .
42016018	" Every man who divorces his wife and marries some one else , commits adultery ; and he who marries one who is put away by her husband commits adultery .
42016019	" Now there was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen , and made merry every day in splendor .
42016020	" And a certain beggar named Lazarus was thrown at his door .
42016021	" He was full of sores , and longingly desired to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich mans table . Yes ! even the dogs came and licked his sores .
42016022	" But in the course of time the beggar died ; and he was carried by angels into Abrahams bosom .
42016023	" The rich man also died , and was buried . And as he was tormented in Hades , he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham afar off and Lazarus in his bosom .
42016024	" And he cried out and said , Father Abraham have mercy on me ; and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue , for I am in anguish in this flame .
42016025	" Remember my son . said Abraham , that you had in your lifetime all your good things , and in the same way Lazarus his evil things ; but now here he is comforted , and you are in anguish .
42016026	" But besides all this , between us and you there is a great chasm fixed , so that those who want to cross from here to you cannot , nor can those who would cross from you to us .
42016027	" I beg you then , father , he said , send him to my fathers house . For I have five brothers .
42016028	" Let him earnestly warn them , lest they too come to this place of torment .
42016029	" But Abraham said , They have Moses and the Prophets , let them listen to them .
42016030	" Nay , Father Abraham , he said but if some one went to them from the dead they would repent .
42016031	" If they will not listen to Moses and the prophets , said Father Abraham , neither will they be persuaded if one should rise from the dead . "
42017001	Jesus said to his disciples . " It is not possible but that occasions of stumbling should occur , but woe to him through whom they come !
42017002	" It were well for him if a millstone were tied about his neck , and he were hurled into the sea , rather than he should cause one of these little ones to stumble .
42017003	" Be on you guard ! " If your brother sins , rebuke him , and if he repents forgive him .
42017004	" And if he sins against you seven times a day , and seven times a day turns to you saying I repent , you shall forgive him . "
42017005	The apostles said to the Lord , " Increase our faith ! "
42017006	" If your faith , " answered Jesus , " were like a grain of mustard-seed , you would say to this tree , Tear yourself up and be planted in the sea , and it would obey you .
42017007	" But who of you who has a slave plowing or keeping sheep , will say to him , when he is come in from the field , Come at once , sit down to dinner ,
42017008	" and will not rather tell him , Get ready something for me to eat , and gird yourself to wait on me until I have eaten and drunken . Then you shall eat and drink .
42017009	" Does he think the slave because he did the things that were commanded ?
42017010	" Even so , you also , after you have done all the things that are commanded you , should say , We are but slaves , we have only done what it was our duty to do . "
42017011	Now it happened that as he went his way to Jerusalem , he passed between Samaria and Galilee .
42017012	And as he was going certain village ten lepers met him .
42017013	They stood at a distance and lifted up their voices , saying , " Jesus , Master , take pity on us . "
42017014	Perceiving this he said to them , " Go and show yourselves to the priest . " And as they went they were made clean .
42017015	Now one of them , as he saw that he was cured , came back , glorifying God in a loud voice ,
42017016	and he fell on his face at the feet of Jesus and thanked him . He was a Samaritan .
42017017	" Were there not ten cleansed ? " asked Jesus , " but where are the nine ?
42017018	" Are there none found to return and give glory to God except this foreigner ? "
42017019	And he said unto him , " Rise and go , your faith has healed you . "
42017020	The Pharisees asked him when the kingdom of God was coming . He answered . " The kingdom of God does not come so that you can catch sight of it ,
42017021	" nor will they say , Look here it is ! or See there ! - for the kingdom of God is now in your midst . "
42017022	Then he said turning to his disciples . " The days will come when you shall long to see one of the days of the Son of man , you shall not see it .
42017023	" And they shall say to you , Lo there ! Lo there ! But do not go away or follow them .
42017024	" For as the lightning when it lightens out of the one part under heaven shines to the other part under heaven , so shall the Son of man be in his day .
42017025	" But first he must suffer many things , and be rejected buy his generation .
42017026	" And this was in the time of Noah , so will it be in the time of the Son of man .
42017027	" Men were eating and drinking ; they were marrying and being married , until the day that Noah entered into the ark , and the flood came and destroyed them all .
42017028	" The same was true in the time of Lot ; they were eating and drinking , buying and selling , planting and building ;
42017029	" but on the day that Lot left Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all .
42017030	" In the same manner it shall be in the day that the Son of man shall be revealed .
42017031	" On that day , if a man is on the housetop and his goods inside , let him not go down to take them away ; nor should a man in the field turn back .
42017032	" Remember Lots wife !
42017033	" Whoever seeks to keep his life shall lose it ; but whoever loses it shall preserve it .
42017034	" I tell you that in one night there shall be two men in one bed ; one shall be taken and the other left .
42017035	" There shall be two women grinding together ; the one shall be taken and the other left . "
42017036	( wanting in the most ancient manuscripts )
42017037	" Where , Master ? " they asked him . " Where the dead body is , " he answered , " there will the vultures be gathered together . "
42018001	He also taught them by a parable how they ought always to pray and never to lose heart .
42018002	" There was a certain town , " he said , " a judge who had neither reverence for God , nor respect for man .
42018003	" In that same town there was a widow who came again and again before him , saying , " Do for me the justice of my adversary .
42018004	" For a while he would not , but afterwards he said to himself , Though I have neither reverence for God nor regard for man ,
42018005	" yet because this woman annoys me I will give her justice , lest by her continual coming she wear me out .
42018006	" Listen " said the Lord , " to what this unjust judge says .
42018007	" And will not God see justice done to his elect who are crying unto him day and night , even if he seems to delay helping them ?
42018008	" I tell you that he will quickly see justice done to his elect ! Nevertheless , when the Son of man comes , will he find faith upon the earth ? "
42018009	Moreover he spoke this parable to some who trusted in themselves because they were righteous , and looked down upon the rest .
42018010	" Two men are going up to the temple to pray ; the one a Pharisee , the other a tax-gatherer .
42018011	" The Pharisee stood apart and thus began to pray by himself . " O God , I thank thee that I am not like the rest of men , extortioners , rogues , adulterers , or even like this tax gatherer ;
42018012	" I fast twice a week , I pay tithes of all my possessions .
42018013	" But the tax-gatherer , standing far back , would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven , but kept beating his breast and saying , " O God be merciful to me , the sinner !
42018014	" I tell you that this man went down to his house justified rather than the other ; for every one who exalts himself shall be humbled ; but he who humbles himself shall be exalted . "
42018015	And they kept bringing their babies for him to touch them ; but when his disciples saw it they began to rebuke them .
42018016	But Jesus called for the babies . " Let the little children come to me , " he said , " do not hinder them ; for of such is the kingdom of heaven .
42018017	" I tell you in solemn truth that whoever will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child , he will never get into it . "
42018018	A ruler put this question to him . " Good teacher , what shall I do to inherit eternal life ? "
42018019	" Why are you calling me good ? " said Jesus to him ; " no one is good but God .
42018020	" You know the commandments . " Do not commit adultery , Do not murder , Do not steal , Do not bear false witness , Honor your father and mother . "
42018021	" All of these , " he replied , " I have kept from my youth up . "
42018022	And receiving this reply , Jesus said to him . " One thing you are still lacking . Sell all that you have and give it to the poor , and you shall have treasure in heaven . Then come and follow me . "
42018023	But when he heard these words he became deeply grieved , for he was exceedingly rich .
42018024	Jesus looked at him and said . " How hard it is for those who have money to enter into the kingdom of God !
42018025	Why , it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God . "
42018026	" Who then can be saved ? " exclaimed his hearers .
42018027	" Things that are impossible with men , " he answered them , " are possible with God . "
42018028	Then Peter said , " Look ! we have left our homes and followed you . "
42018029	And he said to them , " In Solemn truth I tell you that there is no one who , for the sake of the kingdom of God , has left houses , or wife , or brother , or parents , or children ,
42018030	" who shall not certainly receive many times as much in this time , and in the age to come eternal . "
42018031	Then he took the twelve aside and told them . " See , we are on our way to Jerusalem , and all prophets regarding the son of Man will be fulfilled .
42018032	" He will be betrayed to the Gentiles , and be mocked , and shamefully treated , and spit upon ;
42018033	" and they will scourge and kill him ; and the third day he will rise again . "
42018034	But they understood none of these sayings . His words were a mystery to them , and they did not know what he meant .
42018035	As Jesus drew near to Jericho , there was a blind man who sat by the wayside begging .
42018036	He heard the crowd passing and asked what the matter was .
42018037	They told him , " Jesus of Nazareth is passing by . "
42018038	Then he shouted out , saying , " Jesus , son of David , take pity on me ! "
42018039	Those who went ahead began to reprove him and to tell him to be still ; but he kept clamorously shouting all the more , " Son of David , take pity on me ! "
42018040	So Jesus stopped and ordered him to be brought to him . When he was come near to him he asked him
42018041	" What do you want me to do for you ? " " Lord , " he answered , " that I might see again . "
42018042	" Receive your sight , " said Jesus , " your faith has saved you . "
42018043	Instantly he regained his sight and followed Jesus , giving glory to God ; and all the people who saw it gave praise to God .
42019001	So he entered Jericho and was passing through the town .
42019002	There was a man there , called Zaccheus , who was a chief of the tax-gatherers , and was wealthy .
42019003	And he kept trying to see what sort of a man Jesus was ; but he could not see because he was short .
42019004	So he ran on before him and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him ; for he was about to pass that way .
42019005	As soon as Jesus came to the place , he looked up and said to him , " Come down quickly , Zaccheus , for today I must stay at your house . "
42019006	He made haste to climb down , and receive him joyfully .
42019007	When they all saw it , they began to complain , saying " He has gone in to lodge with a man who is a sinner . "
42019008	But Zaccheus stood up and said to the Lord , " I give half my property to the poor , Lord , and if I have defrauded any man of anything I am restoring it to him fourfold . "
42019009	" Today is salvation come to this house , " said Jesus " since Zaccheus here is a son of Abraham .
42019010	" For the Son of man is come to seek and to save the lost . "
42019011	As they were listening to his words he added this parable , because he was near Jerusalem and they thought that the kingdom of God was immediately to appear .
42019012	So he said . " A certain nobleman went abroad to receive for himself royal power and to return .
42019013	" And he summoned ten slaves of his , and gave them ten pounds , and said to them , " Trade with these until I come .
42019014	" But this fellow citizens hated him , and sent a deputation after him to say , We do not wish this man to become our king .
42019015	" And upon his return after he had secured the royal power , he ordered the slaves to whom he had given the money to be called in , so that he might know what they had gained by trading .
42019016	" And the first came before him , saying , Master , your pound has made ten pounds .
42019017	" And he said to him , Well done , good slave ! Because you have been faithful in a very little , have authority over ten cities .
42019018	" And the second came and said , Master , your pound has made five pounds .
42019019	" Then he said to him also , You shall be over five cities .
42019020	" And the next came to him and said , Here master is your pound which I was keeping safe in a napkin .
42019021	" For I was afraid of you , because you are a hard man . You take what you did not sow .
42019022	" He said to him , " By your own words I will Judge you , you wicked slave . You knew , did you , that I was a hard man taking up what I did not lay down , reaping what I did not sow .
42019023	" Then why did you not put my money into the bank , so that at my coming I might I might have gotten it back with interest ?
42019024	" Then to those who stood by , he said , Take the pounds from him and give it to him who has ten pounds .
42019025	" Master , they said to him , he already has ten pounds .
42019026	" I tell you that to every one who has it shall be given ; and from him who has not shall be taken away even what he has .
42019027	" Howbeit these enemies of mine who were not willing for me to become their King , bring them here , and slay them in my presence . "
42019028	When he had so spoken he went on before , going up to Jerusalem .
42019029	When he was come near Bethphage and Bethany at the mount called The Olive Orchard ,
42019030	he sent two of his disciples saying . " Go into the village in the front , and on entering it you will find an asss colt tied , on which no one has ever ridden .
42019031	" Untie it and bring it here . And if any one asks you , Why are you untying the colt ? Simply say , The Master needs it . "
42019032	Then those who were sent out and found it as he had told them .
42019033	For as they were untying the colt , the owners said to them , " Why are you untying the colt ? "
42019034	They answered , " The Master needs it . "
42019035	So they led it to Jesus , and , after throwing their outer garments on the colt , they placed Jesus on it .
42019036	So he rode on , while they kept throwing their garments in the way .
42019037	And when now he was coming near Jerusalem , and descending the Mount of Olives , the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice , and to praise God with a loud voice for the almighty works they had seen .
42019038	They cried , " Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord ! Peace in Heaven and glory in the Highest "
42019039	And some of the Pharisees said to them out of the crowd , " Teacher reprove your disciples ! "
42019040	" I tell you , " he answered , " that if these should hold their peace , the very stones would cry out . "
42019041	And when he came into view of the city , as he approached it he broke into loud weeping ,
42019042	exclaiming . " Oh that at this time you knew , yes , even you , on what your peace depends ! But now it is hidden from your eyes .
42019043	" The time will come for you when your enemies will throw ramparts around you , and encompass you , and shut you in on every side , and raze you to the ground ,
42019044	" you and your children within you . And they will not leave in you one stone upon the another . Because you knew not the time of your visitation . "
42019045	Then Jesus went into the Temple and began to drive out dealers ,
42019046	saying , " It is written , " The house of God shall be called a house of prayer , but you have made it a den of robbers . "
42019047	Day after day he continued to teach in the Temple . The high priests and scribes tried to have him put to death , so did the rulers of the people .
42019048	But they could not find how to do it , for the people all hung upon him , listening to him .
42020001	On one of the days while he was teaching the people in the Temple and preaching the gospel , there came up the priest and the Scribes with the elders .
42020002	They spoke to him saying . " Tell us by what authority you are doing these things ? Who is it that gave you this authority ? "
42020003	" I will also ask you a question , " he replied .
42020004	" Was Johns baptism from heaven or from man ? "
42020005	So they reasoned among themselves . " If we say , From heaven , he will ask us , Why did you not believe in him ?
42020006	" And if we say , From man , all the people will stone us , for they were persuaded that Johnwas a prophet . "
42020007	So they answered that they did not know whence it was .
42020008	" Nor will I tell you , " Jesus answered , " by whose authority I do these things . "
42020009	Then he began to tell the people this parable . " There was a man who planted a vineyard , and let it out to vine-dressers , and went to another country for a long time .
42020010	" At harvest-time he sent a slave to the vine-dressers , to ask them to give him a share of the crop ; but the vine-dresser beat him and sent him away empty-handed .
42020011	" Then he sent another slave ; and him also they flogged and handled shamefully and sent him away empty-handed .
42020012	" Then he sent yet a third , and him to they wounded and threw him out .
42020013	" Then the master of the vineyard said . " What shall I do ? I will send my beloved Son ; it may be that they will reverence him .
42020014	" But when the vine-dressers saw him , they reasoned together , saying . This is the heir . Let us kill him so that the inheritance may be ours .
42020015	" So they turned him out of the vineyard and killed him . " What will the master of the vineyard do to them ?
42020016	" He will come and destroy those vine-dressers , and will give the vineyard to others . "
42020017	He looked at them and said . " Then what does this scripture mean . " The stone which the builders rejected , the same was made the head of the corner ?
42020018	" Every one who falls on that stone will be broken in pieces ; but whoever it falls upon will be scattered as dust . "
42020019	At this the Scribes and the high priests were seeking to arrest him ; only they were afraid of the people . For they perceived that he had referred to them in this parable .
42020020	So they watched him , and sent spies who pretended to be honest men , in order to seize on his speech , and to deliver him up to authority and jurisdiction of the governor .
42020021	So they put a question to him saying . " Rabbi , we know that you speak and teach what is right , and that you do not regard any mans person , but teach the way of God honestly .
42020022	" Is it lawful for us to pay tribute to Caesar or not ? "
42020023	But he perceived their knavery and answered .
42020024	" Show me a shilling . Whose image and superscription does it bear ? " " Caesars , " they replied .
42020025	" Then give to Caesar what belongs to him , " he said , " to God give what is Gods . "
42020026	So they could not lay hold of his sayings before the people ; and marveling at his answer , they held their peace .
42020027	Next came some of the Sadducees who deny that there is resurrection , and they asked him .
42020028	" Teacher , Moses wrote a law for us that if a mans brother should die , but leave no children , his brother should take up his wife and raise up his children for his brother .
42020029	" Now there were seven brothers . the first took a wife and died childless ,
42020030	" and the second and third took her ,
42020031	" and likewise all the seven , but left no children when they died .
42020032	" Last of all the woman died too .
42020033	" In the resurrection whose wife shall she be ? For they all seven had her as wife . "
42020034	" People in this world marry and are given in marriage , " said Jesus ,
42020035	" but those who are counted worthy to reach that world and the resurrection from the dead , neither marry , nor are given in marriage .
42020036	" For indeed they cannot die any more ; they are equal to the angels , and through being sons of the resurrection are sons of God .
42020037	" But that the dead are raised , even Moses clearly implied in the passage about the Bush , when he calls the Lord . " The God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , the God of Jacob .
42020038	" Now he is not the God of the dead , but of the living ; for to him all are alive .
42020039	Then some of the Scribes said , " Teacher , that was nobly said , "
42020040	for they no longer dared to ask him any questions .
42020041	" How is it , " he asked them , " that they say that Christ is Davids son ?
42020042	" for David himself says in the book of the Psalms , " The Lord said to my Lord . Sit at my right hand ,
42020043	Until I make thy enemies the footstool at thy feet .
42020044	" David therefore himself calls him Lord , and how can he be his son ? "
42020045	Then , in the hearing of all the people , he said to his disciples .
42020046	" Beware of the Scribes who like to walk about in long robes , and dote on salutations in the marketplaces , and on securing the front seats in the synagogues and the best places at banquets ;
42020047	" but they devour widows houses and for a pretense make long prayers . These shall receive severer condemnation . "
42021001	And he looked up and saw people casting their offerings into the treasury , and they were rich .
42021002	And he saw a certain poor widow casting in two mites
42021003	And he said . " Of truth I tell you that this poor widow has put in more than than they all ;
42021004	" for these men have all contributed to the offering out of their surplus , but she , out of her want , contributed all she had to live on . "
42021005	And to some who were about the Temple , how it was adorned with beautiful stones votive offerings , he said ,
42021006	" As for what you are looking at , the time is coming when not one stone will be left upon another , that shall not be thrown down . "
42021007	" Teacher , when will this be ? " they asked him , " and what shall be the sign that these things are about to happen ? "
42021008	" Take heed , " he answered , " that you are not led astray , for many will come in my name , saying , I am he , and The time is close at hand . Do not go and follow them .
42021009	" And when you shall hear of wars and tumults , do not be frightened ; for these things must happen first , but the end does not come immediately . "
42021010	Then he said to them . " Nation shall rise against nation , kingdom against kingdom .
42021011	" and there shall be great earthquakes , and , in many places , famines and pestilences ; and there shall be terror and great portents from heaven .
42021012	" But before all these things happen , they will apprehend you and persecute you and deliver you to the synagogues and to prisons , and bring you before kings and governors for the sake of my name .
42021013	" It shall turn out for a testimony to you .
42021014	" So settle it in your hearts not to prepare a defense beforehand ,
42021015	" for I will give you utterance and a wisdom which none of your adversaries will be able to answer or withstand .
42021016	" You will be betrayed even by parents or brothers and kinsfolk , and friends .
42021017	" Some of you they will put to death . And you shall be hated by all men for the sake of my name .
42021018	" And not a hair on your head shall perish .
42021019	" In your patience you shall purchase your souls .
42021020	" But when you see Jerusalem encompassed with armies , then know that her desolation is at hand .
42021021	" Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains ; and let those who are in the country enter not in .
42021022	" For these are the days of vengeance and of fulfilment of all that is written .
42021023	" Woe to women with child and to those who are nursing infants in those days ! For sore anguish will come upon the land , and wrath upon all his people .
42021024	" They shall fall by the edge of the sword , and shall be led captive among the Gentiles , and Jerusalem shall be trampled under foot by the Gentiles , until the appointed times of the Gentiles be fulfilled .
42021025	" And there will be signs in the sun and the moon and the stars ; and on the earth distress of nations in perplexity at the roar of the sea and the billows ;
42021026	" men lifeless through fear , and foreboding of that which is about to come upon the habitable earth . For the powers of the heavens shall be shaken ,
42021027	" and then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud , with power and great glory .
42021028	" But when these things begin to come to pass , look up , lift your heads ! for your redemption is drawing near . "
42021029	And he told them a parable .
42021030	" Look at the fig tree and all the trees ! When they put out their leaves you can see for yourselves that summer is coming .
42021031	" So whenever you see all these things comings to pass , you know that the kingdom of God is near .
42021032	" In solemn truth I tell you that this generation shall not pass away until all this happens .
42021033	" Heaven and earth will pass away , but my words shall never pass away .
42021034	" But take heed to yourselves lest your hearts be surcharged with self-indulgence and drunkenness and worldly cares , and that day catches you suddenly like a trap .
42021035	" For it will come upon all the dwellers on the face of the earth .
42021036	" So be on your guard at all times , praying that you may be worthy to escape these things that shall come to pass , and to take your stand in the presence of the Son of man . "
42021037	And each day he was habitually in the Temple teaching , and at night he used to go out and lodge on the mount called the Olives Orchards .
42021038	And all the people used to come him early in the morning in the Temple , to listen to him .
42022001	Now the festival of Unleavened Bread , which is called the Passover , was drawing near .
42022002	The high priest and the Scribes continually sought means to put him to death .
42022003	Satan however , entered into Judas ( the man called Iscariot ) , who was one of the twelve .
42022004	And he went out and conferred with the chief priests and commanders
42022005	They were delighted , and agreed to give him money .
42022006	He consented to this , and looked for an opportunity to betray him , when the people were not present .
42022007	Then came the day of Unleavened Bread , on which the paschal lamb must be sacrificed .
42022008	So Jesus went to Peter and Johnsaying , " Go and prepare for us the Passover , that we may eat it . "
42022009	" Where shall we get it ready ? " they asked .
42022010	He answered . " No sooner will you have entered the city than you will meet a man carrying a water-jug . Follow him into the house were he is going .
42022011	" And to the good man of the house say , The teacher asks you , " Where is the room in which I can eat the Passover with my disciples ? "
42022012	" Then he will show you a large upper room furnished . There make your preparations . "
42022013	So they went and found everything as he had told them , they prepared the Passover .
42022014	And when the hour was come he sat down , and the twelve apostles with him ,
42022015	and he said to them . " With desire have I longed to eat this Passover with you before I suffer .
42022016	For I tell you that I certainly will not eat again until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God . "
42022017	Then he had received a cup and given thanks , he said ,
42022018	" Take this , and divide it among yourselves ; for I tell you that I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God is come . "
42022019	And he took a loaf , and after giving thanks , he broke it and gave it to them saying . " This is my body , which is given for you ; this do in remembrance of me .
42022020	He gave them a cup in like manner , after supper saying . " This cup is the new covenant in my blood , poured out for your sake .
42022021	" But behold , the hand of my betrayer is at the table with me !
42022022	" The Son of man indeed goes on his way , as it has been determined ; but woe to that man by who he is betrayed . "
42022023	And they began to question among themselves which of them it could be who was going to do such a thing .
42022024	And there arose also a dispute among them as to which of them could be considered the greatest ,
42022025	and he said to them . " The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them , and those who have who have authority over them are called Benefactors .
42022026	" But you shall not be so . But he who is greater among you let him become like the younger ; and he who is leader like him who serves .
42022027	" For which is greater , he who sits at table , or he who serves ? Is it not he who sits at table ? But I am in your midst as one who serves .
42022028	" You , however , are those who have stood by me in my trials .
42022029	" And I promise you a kingdom , even as my Father has promised me a kingdom ;
42022030	" so that you shall eat and drink in my kingdom , and you shall sit on thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
42022031	" Simon , Simon , " said the Lord , " behold , Satan has asked to have you all that he might sift you like wheat .
42022032	" But I made supplication for you that your own faith may not fail . And you , when you have turned again , must strengthen your brothers . "
42022033	" Lord , " Simon said to him , " I am ready to go with you , both to prison and to death . "
42022034	" I tell you , Peter , " he answered . " the cock will not crow this day until you will three times deny that you know me . "
42022035	Moreover , he said to them , " When I sent you out without purse or wallet or sandals , did you lack anything ? " They answered him , " We lacked nothing .
42022036	Then he said to them . " But now let him who has a purse take it , and he who has a wallet , let him the do the same . And he who has no sword , let him sell his cloak and buy one .
42022037	" For I say to you that this word of Scripture must find its fulfilment in me . " And he was numbered among the transgressors , For that which concerns me has its accomplishment . "
42022038	" Master " they said , " here are two swords ! " " That is enough , " he answered .
42022039	Then he went out , and began to go to the Mount of Olives , as was his wont ; and his disciples followed him .
42022040	But he arrived at the place he said to them , " Pray that you enter not into temptation . "
42022041	But he himself withdrew from them about a stones throw , kneeling down he prayed repeatedly , saying .
42022042	" Father , if thou art willing , take away this cup from me ; but thy will , not mine , be done ! "
42022043	( And there appeared to him an angel from heaven , strengthening him .
42022044	( And being in agony he kept praying more earnestly ; and his sweat became as if it were great drops of blood falling down upon the ground . )
42022045	When he arose from his prayers , and came to his disciples , he found them sleeping for sorrow ,
42022046	and said to them . " Why are you asleep ? Get up , and pray that you enter not into temptation . "
42022047	While he was still speaking there came a crowd , and he who was called Judas , one of the Twelve , was leading them . He came near to Jesus in order to kiss him ,
42022048	but Jesus said to him , " Judas , you are betraying the Son of man with a kiss ? "
42022049	Those who were around him , when they saw what was about to happen , said to him , " Lord , shall we strike with our swords ? "
42022050	Then one of them did strike a blow at the high priests slave , and cut off his right ear .
42022051	" Permit me to do this at least , " said Jesus , as he touched his ear and healed him .
42022052	Then Jesus said to the corps of priests and captains of the temple and elders who had come out to arrest him . " Have ye come for me with swords and clubs to arrest me like a robber ?
42022053	" When daily I was with you in the temple you did not stretch out your hands to take me ; but this is your hour and the power of darkness . "
42022054	So they seized him and led him away , and took him to the house of the high priest ; while Peter was following him a long way off .
42022055	And when they had lighted a fire in the center of the court , and had sat down together , Peter was taking his seat among them .
42022056	But a certain maid servant saw him taking his seat near the fire and , with a sharp glance at him , she said , " This fellow was with him , too ! "
42022057	But he denied it , saying , " Woman , I know nothing about him . "
42022058	A little later a man saw him , and said , " You too are one of them " But Peter declared , " Man , I am not . "
42022059	But an hour afterwards another man kept insisting , saying . " Really , this fellow was with him . Why , he is a Galilean . "
42022060	" Man , " said Peter , " I do not know what you mean . " And immediately , while he was still speaking , the cock crew .
42022061	Then the Lord turned and looked at Peter , and Peter recollected the word of the Lord , how he had said to him , " This very day , before the cock crows , you will deny me three times . "
42022062	And Peter went outside and wept with bitter crying .
42022063	Meanwhile the men who were holding Jesus in custody kept mocking and striking him .
42022064	They would blindfold him and ask him . " Prophesy ! Tell who struck you ! "
42022065	And they said many other insulting things against him .
42022066	When it became the day the elders if the people met with the high priests and the Scribes and had brought before the Sanhedrin , saying .
42022067	" Are you the Christ ? Tell us ! " " If I tell you , " he answered , " you will not believe ;
42022068	" And if I ask you , you will not answer .
42022069	" But from henceforth the Son of man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God . "
42022070	Then they all said , " Are you then the Son of God . "
42022071	" What need we of further evidence ? for we ourselves have heard it from his own lips . "
42023001	Then the whole company rose up and brought him to Pilate ,
42023002	and began to accuse him . " We have found this fellow perverting our nation , and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar , and proclaiming that he is the Messiah and King . "
42023003	Then Pilate asked him , " Are you the King of the Jews ? " And he answered him saying , " Certainly I am . "
42023004	And Pilate said to the chief priest and the crowd , " I find no harm in this man . "
42023005	But they repeatedly insisted , " He is stirring up the people throughout all Judea with his teaching which started from Galilee . "
42023006	When Pilate heard the word " Galilee " he asked if the man were a Galilean ,
42023007	and when he learned that he belonged to Herods jurisdiction he sent him to Herod , who himself happened to be in Jerusalem during those days .
42023008	Now when Herod saw Jesus he was exceedingly glad . He had long been wanting to see him , because he had heard so much about him , and was hoping to see some miracles performed by him .
42023009	So he had been asking him many questions , but Jesus made no answers .
42023010	Meanwhile the high priests and Scribes were standing around , and continually making accusations to him against him .
42023011	Then Herod and his soldiers set him at naught , and mocked him , and throwing about him a gorgeous robe , sent him back to Pilate .
42023012	Herod and Pilate became friends again from that very day ; for before they had been at enmity between themselves .
42023013	So Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people ,
42023014	and said to them . " You brought before me this man as one who incited the people to rebellion . I have examined him in your presence , and I find no fault in this man regarding the charges that you brought against him .
42023015	Neither does Herod ; for he sent him back to us . You see that he has done nothing worthy of death .
42023016	I will therefore , after flogging him , release him . "
42023017	" Now he had to release to them at the feast one prisoner . "
42023018	Then the whole crowd shouted out , " Away with this man , and release to us Barabbas . "
42023019	( This was a man who had been thrown in prison on account of a riot which had occurred in the city , and for murder . )
42023020	Then Pilate spoke to them again , because he wished to release Jesus ;
42023021	but they continued to shout out and say , " Crucify ! Crucify him ! "
42023022	For the third time he appealed to them . " But what crime has he committed ? I have found in him nothing that deserves death . I will therefore flog him , and let him go . "
42023023	But they kept shouting the more insistently , demanding that he should be crucified , and their shouts won the day .
42023024	So Pilate gave sentence what they wished should be done .
42023025	He released the man who had been put in prison for riot and murder , the man whom they asked for ; but Jesus he handed over to their will .
42023026	And when they led him away they took hold of Simon , a Cyrenean , who was coming in from the country , and laid the cross on him to carry it behind Jesus .
42023027	He was also followed by a great crowd of people , and of women too , who were beating their breast and lamenting him .
42023028	But Jesus turned to and said . " Daughters of Jerusalem , do not weep for me ;
42023029	" but weep for yourselves and for your children . For behold , the days are coming when they shall say , Blessed are the barren , and the wombs that have never bore children , and the breasts that never suckled .
42023030	" Then they will begin to say to the mountains , Fall on us ! and to the hills , Cover us !
42023031	" For if this is what they do in the green tree , what will they do in the dry ? "
42023032	And there were led out with him to be executed , two criminals also .
42023033	When they came to the place called " The Skull , " there they crucified him and the criminals also , one upon his right hand , and one upon his left .
42023034	Jesus kept saying , " Father forgive them , for they do not know what they are doing . " And they divided his garments among them , casting lots for them ,
42023035	and the people stood looking on . Even the rulers repeatedly taunted him , saying , " He saved others , let him save himself , if this fellow is indeed the Christ of God , His Chosen One ! "
42023036	Even the soldiers made sport of him by coming up and offering him sour wine ,
42023037	saying , " If you are the King of the Jews , save yourself . "
42023038	For there was an inscription over his head , THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS .
42023039	And one of the criminals who had been hung there kept reviling him , saying . " Are you not the Christ ? Save yourself and us . "
42023040	But the other , answering , reproved him , saying . " Have you no fear of God even ? When you are suffering the same punishment as he ?
42023041	" We indeed justly , for we are receiving due retribution for what we have done . But he has done no wrong . "
42023042	Then he added , " Jesus , remember me when you come in your kingdom . "
42023043	" In solemn truth I tell you , " said Jesus , " that this day you shall be with me in Paradise . "
42023044	It was now about the sixth hour , and a darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour .
42023045	And the sun was darkened , and the curtain of the sanctuary was torn in two in the Temple .
42023046	Then with a loud cry , Jesus said , " Father , into thy hands I commend my spirit ! " And after uttering these words , he yielded up his spirit .
42023047	When the army captain saw what had happened , he glorified God , saying , " This man was really innocent ! "
42023048	And all the crowds who had assembled to see this spectacle , after witnessing what had been done , were returning beating upon their breast .
42023049	But all his acquaintances and the women who had been his followers continued to stand at a distance , looking on .
42023050	Now there was a man named Joseph , a member of the Council , a good man and a righteous ,
42023051	he who came from the Jewish town of Arimathea , and who was on the watch for the kingdom of God . He had not concurred in the designs and deed of the council .
42023052	This man went to Pilate , and begged for the body of Jesus .
42023053	Then taking it down , he wrapped it in linen , and placed it in a tomb hewn in the rock , where no man has ever been laid .
42023054	And it was the day of preparation and the Sabbath was near at hand .
42023055	Then the women who had accompanied him out of Galilee followed after , and noted the tomb , and how his body was placed .
42023056	Then they returned and prepared spices and perfumes .
42024001	On the Sabbath Day they rested in obedience to the commandment , but in the deep dawn of the first day of the week they took the spices which they had prepared , and came to the tomb .
42024002	And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb ,
42024003	and on entering they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus .
42024004	While they were still perplexed over this , it happened that the two men stood near them in dazzling raiment .
42024005	They were terrified , and bowed down their faces to the ground , but the men said to them . " Why are you seeking him who lives among the dead ?
42024006	" He is not here ; he is risen . Do you remember how he told you when he was still in Galilee
42024007	that the Son of man had to be betrayed into the hands of sinful men , and to be crucified , and to rise on the third day ? "
42024008	Then they recollected his words ,
42024009	and turning away from the tomb they told all this to the eleven , and to all the rest .
42024010	It was Mary Magdalene , Joanna , and Mary , the mother of James , and the rest of the women who were telling all this to the apostles .
42024011	But the whole story seemed to them but an idle tale ; and they disbelieved the women .
42024012	Peter , however , got up and ran to the tomb , but when he stooped and looked in he saw the linen wrappings by themselves , and he departed to his home , wondering at that which was come to pass .
42024013	On that same day two of his disciples were walking to Emmaus , a village about seven miles from Jerusalem .
42024014	They were talking together about all these events ,
42024015	and as they talked and discussed matter , Jesus himself drew near and began walking beside them .
42024016	But their eyes continued to be held that they should not recognize him even for an instant ,
42024017	And he said to them , " What words are these that you are exchanging one with another , as you walk along ? "
42024018	They stood still , looking sad . And one of them named Cleopas , answered him , " Do you sojourn alone in Jerusalem , that you do not know what things have been happening there these days ? "
42024019	" What kind of things ? " he answered . And they said . " The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth , who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people ;
42024020	" and how our high priest and ruler delivered him to be condemned to death and crucified him .
42024021	" But we were hoping that it was he who should redeem Israel . Yes , and besides all this is the third day since these things happened .
42024022	" Moreover , some women of our company amazed us . They went to his tomb at daybreak ,
42024023	" and found that his body was not there ; then they came and told us that besides they had seen a vision of angels , who said that he was alive .
42024024	" Thereupon some of our own party to the tomb , and found it even so as the women had said , but him they did not see . "
42024025	" O foolish men , " said Jesus , " slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken !
42024026	" Behooved it not the Christ to suffer thus , and then to enter into his glory ? "
42024027	And beginning with Moses and the Prophets , he interpreted all the passages concerning himself .
42024028	When they drew near to the village to which they are were going , he appeared to be going farther .
42024029	But they urged him to stay with them , saying , " Abide with us , for it is toward evening , and the day is now far spent . "
42024030	So he went in to stay with them . But as he sat down with them , and took bread , and had blessed and broken it , and was handing it to them ,
42024031	their eyes were opened , and they recognized him , and he vanished out of their sight .
42024032	" Were not our hearts burning within us , " they said to each other , " while we were talking with him on the way , and he was opening to us the scriptures ? "
42024033	So they rose and returned to Jerusalem that very hour , and found the Eleven and the others all met together ,
42024034	saying , " The Lord is really risen , and has appeared to Simon ! "
42024035	Then they began to tell what happened on the road , and he was known to them when he broke the bread .
42024036	While they were yet speaking he stood among them and said , " Peace be to you ! "
42024037	They were startled and terrified and thought that they were seeing a ghost .
42024038	And he said to them . " Why are you disturbed ? And why do questions rise in your hearts ?
42024039	" Look at my hands and my feet . It is I ! Feel me and see ; for a ghost has not flesh and blood as I have . "
42024040	Then he showed them his hands and feet .
42024041	But while they still did not believe it for joy , and were filled with wonder , he asked them , " Have you anything here to eat ? "
42024042	So they gave him a piece of broiled fish ,
42024043	and he took it and ate it in their presence .
42024044	Then he said to them , " These are my words which I spoke to you while I was still with you , how all things must be fulfilled which are written in the Law of Moses , and the prophets , and the Psalms concerning me . "
42024045	Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures ,
42024046	and he said . " Thus it is written that the Christ should suffer and rise again from the dead , the third day ;
42024047	" and that repentance unto remission of sins should be preached in his name unto all the nations , beginning from Jerusalem .
42024048	" You must bear testimony to this .
42024049	" And I will send forth the promise of my Father upon you . But tarry in Jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high . "
42024050	And he led them out until they were over against Bethany ; and he lifted up his hands and blessed them .
42024051	And it happened that while he was blessing them , that he parted from them and was carried into heaven .
42024052	And they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy ,
42024053	and were continually in the temple , blessing God .
43001001	In the beginning was the Word , and the Word was face to face with God , and the Word was God .
43001002	He was face to face with God in the Beginning .
43001003	All things came into being through him , and apart from him nothing that exists came into being .
43001004	In him was life , and the life was the light of men .
43001005	And the light is shining in the darkness , and the darkness has not overwhelmed it
43001006	A man came into being , sent from God , whose name was John .
43001007	He came as a witness , that he might bear testimony concerning the Light - so that all men might believe through him .
43001008	He was not the Light ; it was to bear testimony concerning the Light that he came into being .
43001009	The true Light , which enlightens every man , was then coming into the world .
43001010	He was in the world , and through him the world came into being , yet the world knew him not .
43001011	He came to his own creation , and his own folk welcomed him not .
43001012	But to all who receive him , to them he has given the right to become children of God , even to those who trust in his name ;
43001013	who were born , not of blood , nor of the will of the flesh , nor of the will of man , but of God .
43001014	And the Word became flesh and tented with us . And we gazed on his glory - glory as of the Fathers only Son - full of grace and truth .
43001015	John bore witness concerning him , and cried aloud , saying , " This is he of whom I said , He who is coming after me has been put before me , for he was before me . "
43001016	For out of his fulness we have all received , yes , grace upon grace .
43001017	For the Law was given by Moses , but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ .
43001018	No man has ever seen God ; God , only begotten , who is in the bosom of the Father - he has interpreted him .
43001019	Now this is the testimony of John , when the Jews sent some priests and Levites to him from Jerusalem to ask him , " Who are you ? "
43001020	He acknowledged - he did not deny it - but acknowledged , " I am not the Christ . "
43001021	" What then ? " they questioned ; " Are you Elijah ? " He said , " I am not . " " Are you the Prophet ? " " No , " he replied .
43001022	Then said they to him . " Who are you ? That we may give some answer to those who sent us . What account do you give of yourself ? "
43001023	He said , " I am a voice of one who cries aloud in the desert , Make straight the way of the Lord , as said the prophet Isaiah . "
43001024	Now it was some of the Pharisees who had been sent to him ;
43001025	so they questioned him , saying , " Why then are you baptizing , if you are not the Christ , nor Elijah , nor the Prophet ? "
43001026	" I indeed am baptizing in water , " John said in reply , " but in your midst stands One whom you do not recognize ,
43001027	One who is to come after me , whose sandal-strap I am not worthy to untie . "
43001028	This happened in Bethany , beyond Jordan , where John was baptizing .
43001029	The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him , and said . " Behold , that is Gods Lamb , who takes and bears away the sin of the world .
43001030	This is he of whom I said , After me comes One who has been put before me , for he was before me .
43001031	I myself did not recognize him ; I only came baptizing in water , in order that he might be openly shown to Israel . "
43001032	John also bore this testimony , saying . " I saw the Spirit like a dove descend from heaven and rest upon him .
43001033	And I did not recognize him , but He who sent me to baptize in water said to me , The one on whom you see the Spirit descending and resting upon him , is he who baptizes in the Holy Spirit .
43001034	This I have seen , and I am become a witness to the fact that he is the Son of God . "
43001035	Next day again , John was standing with two of his disciples .
43001036	After gazing intently on Jesus as he walked about , he said , " Look ! that is the Lamb of God ! "
43001037	The two disciples heard his exclamation , and they followed Jesus .
43001038	Then Jesus turned and saw them following him , and said , " What do you want ? " They replied , " Rabbi " ( which may be translated Teacher ) , " where are you staying ? "
43001039	He said to them , " Come , and you shall see . " So they went and saw where he was staying , and spent that day with him . It was then about four oclock in the afternoon .
43001040	One of the two men who heard what John said and followed Jesus , was Andrew , the brother of Simon Peter .
43001041	In the morning he found his brother Simon , and said to him , " We have found the Messiah " ( a word which means Christ , the Anointed One ) .
43001042	He brought him to Jesus . Jesus looked intently at him and said . " You are Simon , son of John ; you shall be called Cephas " ( or Peter , which means Rock ) .
43001043	Next day Jesus decided to go into Galilee ; and he found Philip and said to him , " Follow me . "
43001044	Now Philip belonged to Bethsaida , the same town as Andrew and Peter .
43001045	Then Philip found Nathanael and told him , " We have found him about whom Moses wrote in the Law , as did the prophets - Jesus of Nazareth , Josephs son . "
43001046	And Nathanael said to him , " Can anything good come out of Nazareth ? " Philip said to him , " Come and see . "
43001047	Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him , and said , " Behold a true Israelite in whom there is no deceit . "
43001048	" How do you know me ? " asked Nathanael . " Before Philip called you , " replied Jesus , " when you were under the fig tree , I saw you . "
43001049	" Rabbi , " answered Nathanael , " you are the Son of God ; you are King of Israel . "
43001050	Jesus said in reply . " Do you believe because I said to you , I saw you under the fig tree ?
43001051	You shall see greater things than that ! Believe me , " he added , " you all shall see heaven opened wide , and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man . "
43002001	Now two days after this there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee , and the mother of Jesus was there ;
43002002	Jesus also was invited to the wedding , and his disciples .
43002003	And when the wine ran short , Jesus mother said to him , " They have no wine . "
43002004	" Woman , " said Jesus , " what have you to do with me ? My time is not yet come . "
43002005	His mother said to the attendants , " Whatever he may tell you to do , do it . "
43002006	Now there were six stone water - jars standing there , according to the Jewish rites of purification , each holding about twenty gallons .
43002007	Jesus said , " Fill up the jars with water . "
43002008	So they filled them brimful . Then he said , " Draw some out now , and carry it to the master of the feast . "
43002009	So they carried it . And when the master of the feast had tasted of the water which had been made wine , not knowing where it came from , though the attendants who had drawn it knew , he called the bridegroom and said to him .
43002010	" Everybody serves first the good wine , and when people have drunk freely , the poor wine ; but you have kept the good wine until now . "
43002011	This beginning of signs Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee , and showed forth his glory ; and his disciples believed on him there .
43002012	Afterward he went down to Capernaum , he and his mother and his brothers and his disciples , and remained there a few days .
43002013	Now the Passover of the Jews was near , so Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
43002014	There he found in the temple those who were selling cattle and sheep and doves , and the money-changers sitting there .
43002015	So he plaited a scourge of rushes , and drove all out of the temple - both the sheep and oxen . He began to pour out the coins of the money-changers , and to overturn their tables ,
43002016	and said to those who were selling doves . " Take these things away ! Make not my Fathers house a house of trade !
43002017	His disciples recalled that it is written , The zeal of thine house will devour me .
43002018	Then the Jews asked Jesus , " What sign are you going to show us , seeing that you do these things ? "
43002019	" Destroy this temple , " answered Jesus , " and in three days I will raise it up . "
43002020	The Jews retorted , " This Temple took forty-six years to build , and will you raise it in three days ? "
43002021	But he was speaking about the temple of his body ; and when the disciples recalled what he had said ,
43002022	after he had been raised from the dead , they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had said .
43002023	Now when he was in Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover , many believed in his name , when they beheld the signs which he did ;
43002024	but for his part Jesus was not trusting himself to them , because he knew all men ,
43002025	and did not need any ones testimony concerning man , for he himself knew what was in man .
43003001	Now there was one of the Pharisees named Nicodemus , a ruler among the Jews .
43003002	This man came to Jesus by night , and said to him . " Rabbi , we know that you are a teacher sent from God ; for no man can do these signs which you are continually doing , unless God is with him . "
43003003	" In very truth I tell you , " answered Jesus , " that unless a man is born from above , he cannot see the kingdom of God . "
43003004	" How can a man be born when he is old ? " Nicodemus replied ; " Can he enter a second time into his mothers womb , and be born ? "
43003005	" I tell you solemnly , " Jesus answered , " that unless a man is born of water and the Spirit , he cannot enter the kingdom of God .
43003006	What is born of the flesh is flesh ; and what is born of the Spirit is spirit .
43003007	Marvel not at my telling you , You must all be born again from above .
43003008	The wind blows where it wills , and you hear its voice , but you do not know where it comes from or where it is going . So it is with every one who has been born of the Spirit . "
43003009	" How can this be ? " said Nicodemus in reply .
43003010	" Are you the Teacher of Israel , and yet you do not understand these things ? " said Jesus .
43003011	" Most solemnly I tell you we are speaking of what we know , and it is about that of which we were eyewitnesses that we give testimony . Yet all of you reject our testimony .
43003012	If I have told you earthly things and yet none of you believe me , how will you believe if I tell you concerning heavenly things ?
43003013	There is no one gone up to heaven , except the One who came down from heaven - the Son of man himself .
43003014	And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness , so must the Son of man be lifted up ,
43003015	in order that every one who believes in him may have eternal life .
43003016	" For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son , that whoever trusts in him should not perish , but have eternal life .
43003017	For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world , but that the world through him might be saved .
43003018	He who trusts in him is not condemned , but he who does not trust has already been condemned , because he has not put his trust in the name of the only begotten Son of God .
43003019	And this is the condemnation , that Light is come into the world , and men loved darkness rather than light , because their deeds were evil .
43003020	For every one who practises wrong hates light , and does not come to the light , lest his actions be exposed ;
43003021	but he who does what is true , comes to the light , in order that his actions may be shown to have been wrought in God . "
43003022	After this Jesus and his disciples went into the countryside of Judea , and there he was staying with them and baptizing .
43003023	John also was baptizing in Aenon , near Salim , because there were many streams there , and people kept coming to receive baptism .
43003024	( For John had not yet been thrown into prison . )
43003025	Then some of Johns disciples got into a controversy with a Jew in regard to purification ; so they came to John and said to him .
43003026	" Rabbi , see ! The man who was with you on the other side of Jordan , and to whom you yourself have borne testimony , is now baptizing , and everybody is coming to him . "
43003027	In reply John said . " A man cannot obtain anything unless it has been granted to him from heaven .
43003028	You yourselves are my witnesses that I said , I am not the Christ , but have been sent before him .
43003029	He who has the bride is the bridegroom , but the friend of the bridegroom , who stands and hears him , rejoices greatly because of the bridegrooms voice . So then this joy of mine has now complete fulfilment .
43003030	He must increase , but I must decrease .
43003031	" He that comes from above is above all ; but one who is of the earth , of the earth he is , and of the earth he speaks . He who comes from heaven is above all .
43003032	He bears testimony to what he has heard and seen , yet no one receives his testimony .
43003033	Whoever does receive it has set his seal that God is true .
43003034	For he whom God sent utters the words of God ; for God does not give the Spirit sparingly .
43003035	the Father loves the Son and has committed everything into his hands .
43003036	Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life , but he who disobeys the Son shall not see life , but he who disobeys the Son shall not see life , but the wrath of God abides upon him . "
43004001	Accordingly when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard it said , " Jesus is making and baptizing more disciples than John , "
43004002	( though Jesus himself was not accustomed to baptize , but his disciples ) ,
43004003	he left Judea and returned to Galilee .
43004004	Now he had to pass through Samaria ;
43004005	so he came to a city of Samaria called Sychar , near the piece of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph .
43004006	Jacobs Spring was there . So Jesus , tired out with his journey , was sitting thus by the spring .
43004007	It was about noon , and a woman of Samaria came to draw water .
43004008	Jesus said to her , " Give me a drink " ( for his disciples were gone away into the city to buy food . )
43004009	" How is it , " answered the Samaritan woman , " that you who are a Jew ask a drink from me , a woman , and a Samaritan ? " ( For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans . )
43004010	" If you had known the free gift of God , " Jesus answered , " and who it is that says to you , Give me a drink , you would have asked of him , and he would have given you living water . "
43004011	" Sir , " said the woman , " you have nothing to draw with , and the well is deep ; whence have you that living water ?
43004012	Surely you are not greater than our Father Jacob , who gave us the well , and used to drink from it himself , and his sons , and his cattle , too ? "
43004013	" All who drink of this water , " Jesus answered , " will thirst again ;
43004014	but whoever once drinks of the water that I will give him , shall never thirst any more , but the water that I will give him shall become a living spring of water within him , welling up into eternal life . "
43004015	" Sir ! " exclaimed the woman , " give me this water , so that I may not be thirsty , nor come all this way to draw water . "
43004016	Jesus said to her , " Go , call your husband , and then come here . "
43004017	" I have no husband , " answered the woman . " You are right in saying I have no husband , " Jesus said to her ,
43004018	" for you have had five husbands , and the man you now have is not your husband ; in this you have spoken truly . "
43004019	" I see , Sir , that you are a prophet , " replied the woman .
43004020	" Our forefathers worshiped in this mountain , yet you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where one must worship . "
43004021	" Woman , believe me , " said Jesus , " that the hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father .
43004022	You are worshiping something you do not know . we know what we worship , for salvation comes from the Jews .
43004023	But an hour is coming , and is now here , when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth . For the Father is seeking such as his worshipers .
43004024	God is spirit , and those who worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth . "
43004025	" I know , " said the woman , " that Messiah is coming , who is called the Christ ; when he has come he will tell us everything . "
43004026	Jesus said to her , " I who am now talking to you , am he . "
43004027	Just then his disciples came up , and were astonished that he was talking with a woman ; yet not one of them asked him , " What do you want ? " or " Why are you talking with her ? "
43004028	Then the woman left her water-jar , and went away into the city and began saying to the people .
43004029	" Come ! see a man who has told me everything that I ever did . He cant be the Christ , can he ? "
43004030	They left the city and set out to go to him .
43004031	Meanwhile the disciples kept urging him .
43004032	" Rabbi , " they said , " eat something . " But he answered , " I have food to eat of which you know nothing . "
43004033	So the disciples began to say to one another , " Can any one have brought him something to eat ? "
43004034	Jesus said to them . " My food is to do the will of Him who sent me , and to accomplish his work .
43004035	Do you not say , It wants yet four months , and then comes the harvest ? Look , I tell you ! Lift up your eyes and behold the fields , that they are already white for harvest .
43004036	The reaper is already receiving wages and gathering a crop for eternal life , so that the sower and the reaper may rejoice together .
43004037	For in this respect the saying is true , One sows , another reaps .
43004038	I sent you to reap a crop on which you have not toiled . Others have toiled , and you have reaped the benefit of their toil . "
43004039	Many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him because of the word of the woman when she declared , " He told me everything that I ever did . "
43004040	So when the Samaritans arrived , they began asking him to remain with them ; and he stayed there two days .
43004041	Then many more believed because of what he said , himself ; and they told the woman .
43004042	" We no longer believe because of what you said . for we ourselves have heard him , and we know that this is certainly the Saviour of the world . "
43004043	After these two days Jesus went away from there into Galilee .
43004044	For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country .
43004045	When he reached Galilee , however , the Galileans welcomed him , for they had seen all that he did in Jerusalem at the feast ; for they , too , had been at the feast .
43004046	So he came back again to Cana of Galilee , where he made the water wine . Now there was one of the kings officers whose son was lying ill at Capernaum .
43004047	When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea into Galilee , he went to him , and begged him to come down and heal his son who was lying at the point of death .
43004048	Then Jesus said to him , " Unless you all see signs and wonders , you will not believe . "
43004049	" Sir , " said the kings officer , " come down before my little boy dies . "
43004050	Jesus answered . " Go your way . Your son lives . " And the man believed the word which Jesus spoke to him , and started to go home .
43004051	And when he was already on his way down , his slaves met him , saying that his boy was living .
43004052	So he asked them at what hour he had begun mend . They answered , " Yesterday , about one oclock , the fever left him . "
43004053	Then the father realized that it had left him at the very hour when Jesus had said to him , " Your son lives , " and he himself believed , and his whole household .
43004054	This is the second sign which Jesus performed , on returning from Judea to Galilee .
43005001	After this there was a feast of the Jews , and Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
43005002	Now there is in Jerusalem a pool near the Sheep-gate , called in the Hebrew , Bethesda .
43005003	It has five colonnades . In these there used to lie a great crowd of sick people - blind , lame , paralyzed .
43005005	And there was one man there for thirty-eight years in his infirmity .
43005006	When Jesus saw him lying there , and knew that he had been there a long time , he said to him , " Do you want to get well ? "
43005007	" Sir , " answered the sick man , " I have no man to put me into the pool whenever the water is troubled ; and while I am trying to come , some one else steps down before me . "
43005008	" Rise , " said Jesus , " take up your bed and go walking away . "
43005009	Instantly the man became well , and he took up his bed and started to walk . Now it was Sabbath on that day ;
43005010	so the Jews kept saying to the man who had been cured . " It is the Sabbath Day ; it is not lawful for you to carry your bed . "
43005011	He replied , " The man who healed me told me to take up my bed and walk . "
43005012	" Who is it , " they asked , " that said to you , take up your bed and go walking away ? "
43005013	But he who had been healed did not know who it was , for Jesus had moved away , as there was a crowd in that place .
43005014	Afterward Jesus found him in the Temple , and said to him . " Look ! You have become well . Do not go on sinning , lest a worse thing befall you . "
43005015	The man went to and told the Jews that it was Jesus who made him well ;
43005016	and because of this the Jews began to persecute Jesus , because he had done it on the Sabbath .
43005017	But he answered them , " My Father has continued working until now , and I am working too . "
43005018	For this reason the Jews continued to seek the more eagerly to put him to death , because not only was he breaking the Sabbath , but he was actually speaking of God as his own Father , thus making himself of Gods equal .
43005019	So Jesus answered them in these words . " In solemn truth I tell that the Son cannot do anything of himself , except what he sees the Father doing ; for whatever he does , that the Son does also .
43005020	" For the Father loves the Son , and shows him every thing that he himself is doing . And greater deeds than these will he show him , that you may wonder .
43005021	" For just as the Father raises the dead and makes them alive , even so the Son makes whom he will alive .
43005022	" The Father indeed does not judge any one , but has given all judgment to the Son ,
43005023	" in order that all may honor the Son even as they honor the Father . He who does not honor Son , does not honor the Father who sent him .
43005024	" I tell you solemnly that he who listens to my messages and believes Him who sent me , has eternal life . He will not come under condemnation , but has passed out of death into life .
43005025	" Solemnly I tell you that the hour is coming , and now is , when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God , and those who hear shall live .
43005026	" For as the Father has life in himself , so also has he granted to the Son to have life in himself .
43005027	" And he has given him authority to pronounce judgment , because he is Son of man .
43005028	" Do not wonder at this , because an hour is coming in which all who are in their graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth again ;
43005029	" those who have done good into a resurrection of life , and those who have practised evil to a resurrection of condemnation .
43005030	" I can of my own self do nothing . As I listen , I judge , and my own judgment is just , because I am not seeking my own will , but the will of Him who sent me .
43005031	" If I bear testimony concerning myself , my testimony is not valid .
43005032	" Another bears testimony to me , and I know that the testimony which he bears concerning me is valid .
43005033	" You yourselves sent to John , and he has been and is a witness to the truth .
43005034	" ( Though for myself I accept no witness from man ; I only mention that you may be saved . )
43005035	" That man was the Lamp-burning and shining - and you were willing for a time rejoice in his light .
43005036	" But I have testimony greater than that of John ; for the work which the Father has given me to bring to completion - the work which I am doing - bears testimony concerning me , that the Father has sent me .
43005037	" And the Father who sent me has himself borne testimony concerning me . None of you has heard his at any time or seen him ,
43005038	nor had his word dwelling within you , because you do not believe him whom he sent .
43005039	" You are searching the Scriptures because you suppose that in tem you have eternal life ; and though these are they that bear witness concerning me ,
43005040	" you will not come to me that you may have life .
43005041	" I am not receiving honor from men , but I know you ,
43005042	" that you have not the love of God in yourselves .
43005043	" I am come in the name of my Father and you do not receive me . If another comes in his own name , him you will receive .
43005044	" How can you believe when you receive glory from , one another , and have no desire for the glory which comes from the only God ?
43005045	" Do not imagine that I shall accuse you to the Father . Moses is your accuser , on whom you build your hopes .
43005046	" For if you believed Moses you would believe me , for he wrote about me .
43005047	And if you do not believe his writings , how will you ever believe my words ? "
43006001	After this Jesus went away across the Sea of Galilee ( that is the lake of Tiberias ) .
43006002	A great crowd were following him , because they witnessed the signs which he was continually performing among those who were ill .
43006003	Then Jesus walked up the hills and sat down there with his disciples . Now the Jewish feast , the Passover , was at hand .
43006004	Accordingly when he looked up , and perceived a great crowd was coming unto him ,
43006005	he said to Philip , " Where shall we buy bread for these people to eat ? "
43006006	He said this to test him , for he himself knew what he intended to do .
43006007	" Thirty-five dollars worth of bread , " answered Philip , " is not enough for them , so that each can take a morsel . "
43006008	One of his disciples , Andrew , the brother of Simon , said to him .
43006009	" There is a lad who has five barley loaves and a couple of fish ; but what is that among so many ? "
43006010	" Make the men sit down , " said Jesus . The ground was covered with thick grass ; so the men sat down , in numbers about five thousand . " of righteousness , because I am going to my Father , and you will no longer see me ;
43006011	Then Jesus took the loaves , and when he had given thanks he distributed them among those who were seated ; in like manner also of the fish , as much as they wished ,
43006012	and when they were satisfied , he said to his disciples , " Gather up the fragments that are left , so that nothing may be wasted . "
43006013	So they gathered them up , and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves - the broken pieces that were left after they had eaten .
43006014	So when the people saw the sign which he had performed , they said , " This is in the truth the Prophet who is to come into the world . "
43006015	When Jesus perceived that they intended to seize him in order to make him a king , he retired again to the hill all by himself .
43006016	When evening came on , his disciples went down to the sea .
43006017	There they got in a boat , and started across the sea for Capernaum . The darkness had already fallen ,
43006018	Jesus had not yet come to them , and the sea began to rise , because a strong wind was blowing .
43006019	After they had rowed three or four miles , they saw Jesus walking upon the sea , and drawing near to the boat , and they were terrified ;
43006020	but he said to them , " It is I , be not afraid . "
43006021	Then they were willing to take him on board , and immediately the boat reached the shore they were making for .
43006022	The crowd that remained on the other side of the sea had seen that there was only one small boat there , and that Jesus had not gone aboard with his disciples , but that his disciples had gone away by themselves .
43006023	So , on the following day , when boats came from Tiberias near the place were they had eaten bread , after the Lord had given thanks , they got into the boats themselves ,
43006024	when they saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there , and went to Capernaum to look for Jesus .
43006025	When they found him on the other side of the sea , they said to him , " Rabbi , when did you get here ? "
43006026	Jesus answered . " In solemn truth I tell you that you are looking for me , not because you saw miracles signs , but because you ate of the bread and were filled .
43006027	" Labor not for food which perishes , but for the food that endures eternal life - that which the Son of man will give you ; for on the Father - God - has set his seal . "
43006028	" What are we to do habitually , " they asked him , " that we may keep working the words of God ? "
43006029	" This is the work of God , " answered Jesus , " that you believe on him whom He has sent you . "
43006030	The they said to him . " What sign , then , are you performing , so that we may see it and believe in you ? What work are you doing ?
43006031	" Our fathers ate manna in the wilderness , as it is written , He gave them bread out of heaven to eat . "
43006032	" In solemn truth I tell you , " said Jesus in reply , " Moses did not give you the bread out of heaven , but my Father does give you the true bread out of heaven ;
43006033	" for the bread of God is what come down from heaven , and gives life to the world . "
43006034	" Ah , Sir , " said they , " evermore give us this bread . "
43006035	" I myself am the bread of life , " answered Jesus ; " he who comes to me shall never hunger , and he that believes on me shall never thirst again .
43006036	" But as I told you , you have seen me , and yet you do not believe .
43006037	" Everyone whom the Father gives me will come to me ; and him who comes to me I will never reject .
43006038	" For I am come down from heaven , not to do my own will , but the will of him who sent me .
43006039	" And this is the will of him who sent me , that I should not lose one of all those whom he has given me , but should raise them up at the last day .
43006040	" For this is my Fathers will , that every one who beholds the Son and believes on him , shall have eternal life . and I will raise him up at the last day . "
43006041	Then the Jews began to find fault with Jesus , because he said , " I am the bread which comes down out of heaven , " and they kept asking .
43006042	" Is not this Jesus , the son of Joseph ? Do we not know his father and mother ? How is it that he now says , I have come down from heaven ? "
43006043	" Do not find fault with me among yourselves , "
43006044	answered Jesus ; " no one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draw him ; then I will raise him up on the last day .
43006045	" It is written in the Prophets , " And they shall all of them be taught of God . Every one who has listened to the father and learns from him , comes to me .
43006046	" Not that any one has seen the Father , except the one who is from God ; he has seen the Father .
43006047	" I tell you solemnly that he who believes has eternal life .
43006048	" I am the bread of life .
43006049	" Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness ; yet they died .
43006050	" This is the bread that comes down from heaven , that one may eat thereof and never die .
43006051	" I myself am the living bread that has come down from heaven . Any one who eats this bread will live forever ; and moreover , the bread which I will give is my flesh , given for the life of the world . "
43006052	Then the Jews began to dispute among themselves , saying , " How can this man give us his flesh to eat ? "
43006053	" I tell you solemnly , " said Jesus , " that unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man , and drink his blood , you have no life in you .
43006054	" He who feeds upon my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life , and I will raise him up on the last day .
43006055	" For my flesh is true food , and my blood is true drink .
43006056	" He who feeds upon my flesh abides in me and I in him .
43006057	" Just as the living Father has sent me , and I live by the Father , so also that man who feeds on me shall live by me .
43006058	" This is the bread which came down from heaven ; not such as your fathers ate and died , for he who feeds upon this bread shall live forever . "
43006059	He spoke these words while in the synagogue , while he was teaching in Capernaum .
43006060	So many of his disciples , when they heard it , said . " This teaching is unbelievable ! Who can listen to him ? "
43006061	Jesus , conscious within himself that his disciples were finding fault with him about his teaching , said to them .
43006062	" Does this displease you ? What then if you were to behold the Son of man ascending to where he was before ?
43006063	" The spirit is what gives life ; the flesh is of no avail . The words which I have been speaking to you , are spirit and are life .
43006064	" Yet there are some of you who do not believe . " For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe , and who it was who should betray him .
43006065	So he added , " This is why I told you that no on can come to me unless it be given from the Father . "
43006066	Therefore many of his disciples drew back and no longer companied with him .
43006067	So Jesus appealed to the Twelve . " You also do not wish to leave me , do you ? "
43006068	Simon Peter answered . " To whom shall we go Master ? You have words of eternal life ;
43006069	" and we have learned to believe and we know that you are the holy one of God . "
43006070	In reply Jesus said to them . " Have I not chosen you , the Twelve ? And yet even of you one is an enemy . "
43006071	Now Jesus was speaking of Judas , the son of Simon Iscariot ; for Judas was to betray him , although he was one of the Twelve .
43007001	After these things Jesus continued to travel about in Galilee , for he did not wish to go about in Judea , because the Jews kept trying to kill him .
43007002	When the time of the Jewish feast of Tabernacles drew near ,
43007003	his brothers said to him . " Leave here and go into Judea , so that your disciples also may behold the works which you are doing .
43007004	" For no one ever does anything in secret if he himself seeks to be known publicly . If you are performing these signs , show yourself openly to the world . "
43007005	For even his own brothers did not believe in him .
43007006	" My time is not yet come , " said Jesus , " but your time is always at hand .
43007007	" The world cannot hate you , but me it does hate , because I am bearing testimony against it , that its ways are wicked .
43007008	Do you go up to the feast . I am not yet going up to this feast , because my time is not yet fully come . "
43007009	After saying this , he remained in Galilee ; but after his brothers had gone up to feast ,
43007010	then he went too - not openly , but as it were a secret .
43007011	The Jews meanwhile kept looking for him at feast , and saying , " Where is he ? " " I am no longer in the world , but these are in the world , and I come to thee . Holy Father , keep through thine own Name these whom thou hast given me , that they may be one as we are one .
43007012	and there was much disputing about him among the crowd . Some would say , " He is a good man . " Others . " No ! he is misleading the people . " " While I was with them I kept them by the power of thy name which thou hast given me . I guarded them , and none of them was lost except the son of perdition , that the Scripture might be fulfilled .
43007013	No one , however , was speaking openly about him , for fear of the Jews . " But now I am coming to thee , and I am speaking these things while I am in the world , so that they may have my joy in all its fulness in themselves .
43007014	But when it was already the middle of the feast , Jesus went up to the Temple and began to teach . " I have given them thy word ; and the world has hated them because they are not of the world , even as I am not of the world .
43007015	The Jews were amazed . They said , " How does this fellow know the sacred writings when he has never learned them ? " " I am not asking that thou wilt take them out of the world , but that thou wilt protect them from the Evil One .
43007016	In reply Jesus said to them ; " My teaching is not mine , but is his who sent me . " They are not of the world , even as I am not of the world .
43007017	" If any one wills to do Gods will he shall know concerning my teaching , whether it is from God , or I speak my own authority . " Dedicate them in thy truth ; thy word is truth .
43007018	" The man who speaks on his own authority is always seeking his own glory . But one who is eager for the glory of Him who sent him , he is true , and therefore is nothing false about him .
43007019	" Did not Moses give you the Law ? Yet none of you is keeping the Law . Why are you seeking to kill me ? "
43007020	The crowd answered . " You have a demon ! Who is trying kill you ? "
43007021	Jesus answered them . " There was one thing I did , and you are all amazed .
43007022	" Consider , therefore , Moses has given you circumcision - not that Moses originated it , but the fathers - and you are accustomed to circumcise a child even on the Sabbath .
43007023	" If a child receives circumcision on the Sabbath , in order that the Law of Moses may not be broken , how can you be angry with me because I made a man sound and well on the Sabbath ?
43007024	" Do not judge according to appearance . Judge justly . "
43007025	Then some of the men of Jerusalem were saying . " Is not this the man they are seeking to kill ?
43007026	" And look ! he is speaking boldly and they are saying nothing to him . Can it possibly be that the rulers have really discovered that he is the Christ ?
43007027	" But we know this man and where he is from ; but when the Christ comes no one will know where he comes from . "
43007028	So Jesus cried aloud as he was teaching in the Temple , and said . " You both know me and you know where I am from ; and I am not come on my own authority , but he who sent me is trustworthy , and him you do not know .
43007029	" But I now him , because I am from him and he sent me . "
43007030	Then they kept seeking to arrest him , but no man laid hands on him , because his hour was not yet come .
43007031	But many of the crowd believed on him and began to say , " The Christ , when he comes , will he do more signs than this man has done ? "
43007032	The Pharisees heard the crowd muttering these things about him , and the high priest and Pharisees sent officers to arrest him .
43007033	Then Jesus said to them . " Still for a little longer I am with you , and then I am going my way to him who sent me .
43007034	" You will search for me and will not find me , and where I am you cannot come . "
43007035	Then the Jews said to one another . " Where does this fellow intend to go , so that we shall not find him ? He is not intending to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and to teach the Greeks , is he ?
43007036	" What does he mean saying , You shall seek me and you shall not find me , and Where I am you cannot come ? "
43007037	Now the last day , that the great day of the feast , Jesus stood up and cried in a loud voice .
43007038	" If any man thirst let him come to me and drink . From the heart of him who believes in me will flow , as the Scripture said , rivers of living water . "
43007039	Now he said this concerning the Spirit whom those who believed in him should receive . For the Spirit was not yet given , because Jesus had not yet been glorified .
43007040	Some of the crowd who had been listening to these discourses began to say , " Without a doubt this man is a Prophet . "
43007041	Other said , " He is the Christ . " But others were saying . " Surely the Christ is not to come out of Galilee , is he ?
43007042	" Does not the Scripture say that the Christ is coming of the descendants of David , and from Bethlehem , Davids town ? "
43007043	So a division arose in the crowd concerning him . Some of them wished to apprehend him , but no one laid hands on him .
43007044	Then the officers returned to the chief priest and Pharisees ,
43007045	and they asked them , " Why have you not brought him ? "
43007046	The officers answered , " Never yet did a man speak like this man . "
43007047	" Surely you have not been led astray , have you ? answered the Pharisees .
43007048	" Has any one of the rulers believed on him , or of the Pharisees ?
43007049	" As for this mob who do not understand the Law , they are accursed ! "
43007050	Nicodemus , one of their number , he who had formerly visited Jesus , said to them ,
43007051	" Our law does not condemn the accused , does it , before hearing his defense , and finding out what he is doing ? "
43007052	In answer they said to him . " You are not from Galilee , are you ? Search for yourself , and see that from Galilee arises no prophet . "
43007053	Then they departed each to his own house .
43008001	Jesus went to the Mount of Olives .
43008002	At dawn , however , he came back to the Temple , where the people came to him in crowds . He had taken his seat and was teaching them ,
43008003	when the Scribes and Pharisees had brought a woman who had been caught in the act of adultery . They made her stand in the middle of the court , and said to him .
43008004	" Rabbi , this woman has been found in the very act of adultery .
43008005	" Now Moses , in the Law , has commanded us to stone such creatures . But you , what do you say ? "
43008006	( This they said to tempt him , so that they could bring a charge against him . )
43008007	But Jesus stooped down , and began to write on the ground with his finger . When they continued to question him , he raised himself and said to them , " Let the innocent man among you be the first to throw the stone at her . "
43008008	Then he stooped down again , and again began to write on the ground .
43008009	When they heard that , they went out one by one , beginning with the eldest . And Jesus was left behind alone - and the woman in the middle of the court .
43008010	Then Jesus raised himself up and said to her . " Woman , where are they ? Has no man condemn you , "
43008011	" No one , Sir , " she answered . " Neither do I condemned you , " said Jesus . " Go , and never sin again . "
43008012	Once more Jesus addressed them . " I am the light of the world , " he said ; " He who follows me shall not walk in the darkness , but he shall have the Light of life . "
43008013	Then said the Pharisees to him . " You are bearing testimony to yourself ; your testimony is not true . "
43008014	In reply Jesus said to them . " Even if I do bear testimony to concerning myself , my testimony is true , because I know where I have come from and where I am going . But you do not know where I have come from , or where I am going .
43008015	" For you are judging according to the flesh . I am judging no man .
43008016	" Though even if I do judge , my judgment is trustworthy , because I am not alone , but the Father who sent me is with me .
43008017	" And in your Law it is written that the testimony of two men is true .
43008018	" I am one who gives testimony concerning myself , and the Father who sent me gives testimony concerning me . "
43008019	" Where is your Father ? " they asked him . " You have neither known me nor my Father , " answered Jesus . " If you had known me , you would have known my father also . "
43008020	He said these words in the Treasury , while he was teaching in the Temple ; yet no one arrested him , because his hour was not yet come .
43008021	Then again he said them . " I am going away , and you will seek me , and you will die in your sins . Where I am going , you cannot come . "
43008022	Then the Jews said . " He will not kill himself , will he ? Is that why he says , Where I am going you cannot come ? "
43008023	And he said to them . " You are from below . I am from above ; you are of this world , I am not of this world .
43008024	" That is why I said that you would die in your sins . For if you do not believe that I am He , you will die in your sins . "
43008025	" Who are you ? " then they asked him . " What I am telling you from the beginning , " Jesus answered .
43008026	" I have many things to say and to judge concerning you . But he who sent me is true , and I speak to the world only those things which I have heard from him . "
43008027	They did not understand that he meant the Father ,
43008028	so Jesus added . " When you lifted up the Son of man , then you will know that I am He ; and that I do nothing on my own authority , but that I speak just as the Father has taught me ,
43008029	" and he who sent me is with me . He has not left me alone , for I do always the things that please him . "
43008030	When he spoke in this way , many of the Jews believed in him .
43008031	So Jesus spoke to the Jews that believed him , saying . " If you abide in my teaching , you are my true disciples ;
43008032	" and you shall know the truth , and the truth will make you free . "
43008033	" We are descendants of Abraham , " they replied , " and have never been in slavery to any man . What do you mean by saying , You shall become free ? "
43008034	" In solemn truth I tell you , " Jesus replied , " every one who commits sin is a slave
43008035	" Now the slave does not remain permanently in the household , but the son does remain .
43008036	" So then , if the Son shall set you free , you will be free indeed .
43008037	" I know you are Abrahams descendants ; but you are seeking to kill me , Because my teaching has no place in you .
43008038	" I am declaring what I have seen with the Father , and you are acting as you have learned from your father . "
43008039	" Abraham is our father , " they answered . " If you are indeed Abrahams children , " said Jesus " do the deeds of Abraham .
43008040	" But now you are seeking to kill me - a man who has told you the truth which I heard from God . Abraham did not do that .
43008041	" You are doing the deeds of your father . " " We were not born of adultery , " they said ; " we have one Father , God . "
43008042	Jesus said to them . " If God were your Father , you would love me , for I proceeded forth and am now come from God . I did not come on my own authority , but God himself sent me .
43008043	" How is it that you do not understand what I say ? It is because you cannot listen to my message .
43008044	" You are of your father , the devil , and you want to do what your father desires . He was a man-slayer from the very beginning ; and he has no standing place in the truth , because truth is not in him . Whenever he utters a lie , he speaks from his nature , for he is a liar and the father of lying .
43008045	" But as for me , it is because I speak the truth to you that you do not believe me .
43008046	" Which one of you convicts me of sin ? Why then , if I am speaking the truth , do you not believe me ?
43008047	" He who is from God listens to Gods words . For this reason you do not listen , because you are not from God . "
43008048	In reply the Jews said to him , " Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan , and you also have a demon ? "
43008049	" I do not have a demon , " said Jesus , " but I am honoring my Father , and you are dishonoring me .
43008050	" Yet I am not seeking my own honor . There is One who is seeking it , and He is judge .
43008051	" In solemn truth I tell you that if any one obeys my teaching he shall never behold death . "
43008052	" Now we know that you have a demon , " exclaimed the Jews . Abraham died , and so did the prophets ; and yet you say , If any man obeys my teaching he shall never taste death .
43008053	" You are not greater than our father Abraham , are you ? And he died , and the prophets died . Who are you making yourself out to be ? "
43008054	" If I glorify myself . " said Jesus , " my glory is nothing . It is my Father that glorifies me , and you say , He is our God .
43008055	" You are not acquainted with him ; I know him . Were I to say , I do not know him , I should be like you , a liar . But I do know him , and I obey his teaching .
43008056	" Your father Abraham rejoiced that he should see my day ; and he saw it and was glad . "
43008057	" You are not yet fifty years old , " said the Jews to him , " and you have seen Abraham ? "
43008058	" In solemn truth I tell you , " answered Jesus , " that before Abraham came into existence , I am . "
43008059	Then they picked up stones to throw at him , but Jesus hid himself and went out of the Temple .
43009001	Now as he was passing along he saw a man , blind from birth .
43009002	" Rabbi , " his disciples asked him , " who sinned , this man or his parents , that he was born blind ? "
43009003	" Neither he nor his parents sinned . " replied Jesus ; " it happened that the works of God might be made manifest in him .
43009004	" I must work the works of him that sent me while it is day ; night is coming , when no man can work .
43009005	" While I am in the world , I am the Light of the world . "
43009006	When he had thus spoken he spat on the ground , and made clay with the spittle , and smeared the clay on the mans eyes .
43009007	Then he said to him , " Go , wash in the pool of Siloam " ( a word which means " sent " ) . So the man went and washed his eyes , and came back seeing .
43009008	Upon this the neighbors and those who used to know him by sight as a beggar , began asking , " Is not this the man who used to sit and beg ? "
43009009	Some said , " It is he . " Others said , " No , but he looks like him . " " I am the man , " he said .
43009010	So they asked him , " How then were your eyes opened ? "
43009011	He answered . " The man who is called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes , and said to me , Go to Siloam and wash ; so I went and washed and received my sight . "
43009012	" Where is he ? " they asked . " I do not know , " answered the man .
43009013	Then they brought the man who had been blind to the Pharisees .
43009014	Now it was on the Sabbath that Jesus had made clay and opened his eyes ;
43009015	so the Pharisees again began to ask him questions about how he had regained his sight ; and he said to them , " He put clay on my eyes , and I washed them , and now I see . "
43009016	Then some of the Pharisees began to say , " This man in not from God , because he does not keep the Sabbath . " But others said , " How can a man who is a sinner perform such signs ? "
43009017	So there was a difference of opinion among them . Accordingly they said to the blind man , " What have you to say about him , now that he has opened your eyes ? " " He is a prophet , " he answered .
43009018	The Jews , however , did not believe about him that he was blind and had received his sight , until they called the parents of the man whose sight had been restored ,
43009019	and questioned them . " Is this your son , " they said , " who you say was born blind ? How then does he now see ? "
43009020	Then in reply his parents said . " We know that this is our son , and that he was born blind ;
43009021	" but how he now sees we do not know , nor do we know who has opened his eyes . Ask him , himself . He is of age . He will speak for himself . "
43009022	This his parents said because they were afraid of the Jews , for the Jews had already agreed that if any one should confess that he was the Christ , he should be expelled from the synagogue .
43009023	It was because this that his parents said . " He is of age . Ask him , himself . "
43009024	So the Jews a second time summoned the man who had been blind , and said to him .
43009025	" Give glory to God ! we know that this man is a sinner . " Upon this the blind man answered . " I do not know if he is a sinner . One thing I do know , that once I was blind , and know I can see . "
43009026	" What was it he did to you ? " they asked him ; " How did he open your eyes ? "
43009027	He answered . " I have told you already , and you did not listen . Why do you wish to hear it again ? Can it be that you , too , wish to become his disciples ? "
43009028	Then they stormed at him . " You are his disciple . We are Moses disciples .
43009029	" We know that God spoke to Moses . But this fellow ! We do not know where he comes from . "
43009030	" This is truly astonishing , " said the man in reply , " that you do not know where he is from , and yet he has opened my eyes .
43009031	" We know that God does not listen to sinners , but if any one is God-fearing and does his will , to such he listens .
43009032	" Since the beginning of the world such a thing as opening the eyes of one who was born blind was never heard of .
43009033	" If this man had not come of God he could have done nothing . "
43009034	They answered , " You were wholly born in sins , and do you teach us ? " Then they cast him out .
43009035	Jesus heard that they had cast him out ; and when he had found him , he said , " Do you believe in the Son of man ? "
43009036	" Who is he , Sir , " he replied , " that I may believe on him . "
43009037	" You have already seen him , " Jesus answered , " and it is he who now speaks to you . "
43009038	" I do believe , Sir , " said the man , and he prostrated himself at his feet . And Jesus said ,
43009039	" For judgment am I come into the world , to make the sightless see , and to make the seeing blind . "
43009040	Some of the Pharisees who were with him heard this and asked , " We are not blind , are we ? "
43009041	" If you were blind , " Jesus answered them , " you would have no sin . But now you are declaring , We see ; so your sin remains .
43010001	" In solemn truth I tell you that whoever does not enter the sheepfold by the door , but climbs up some other way , that man is a thief and a robber ;
43010002	" but he who comes in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep .
43010003	" The porter opens the door for him ; the sheep listen to his voice ; and he calls his own sheep by name , and leads them out .
43010004	" When he has brought all his own sheep , he walks before them and the sheep follow him because they know his voice .
43010005	" But a stranger they will not follow , but flee from him , because they do not know the voice of strangers . "
43010006	Jesus told them this parable , but they did not understand what he was talking about ; so he said to them again .
43010007	" In solemn truth I tell you that I am the Door of the sheep .
43010008	" All that came before me are thieves and robbers , but the sheep did not listen to them .
43010009	" I am the Door . Whoever enters by me shall be saved , and he shall go in and come out and find pasture .
43010010	" The thief never comes except to steal and kill and destroy . I am come that they may have life , and may have it in abundance .
43010011	" I am the good shepherd . The good shepherd lays down his very life for the sheep .
43010012	" The hired servant , since he is not a shepherd and does not own his sheep , leaves the sheep and flees when he sees a wolf coming - and the wolf worries them and scatters them .
43010013	" He is only a hired servant , and the sheep are no care to him .
43010014	" I am the good shepherd . I know my sheep , and my sheep know me ;
43010015	just as the Father knows me , I know the Father , and I lay down my life for the sheep .
43010016	" I have other sheep also , which do not belong to this fold . I must bring them too , and they will listen to my voice , and they will become one flock , one shepherd .
43010017	" The Father loves me for this , because I am laying down my life that I may take it again .
43010018	" No man is taking it away from me . I am laying it down on my own accord . I have authority to lay it down , and I have authority to take it again . I received this commandment from my Father . "
43010019	The Jews were again divided over these words .
43010020	Many of them kept saying . " He has a demon and is mad ! Why do you listen to him ? "
43010021	Others were saying . " These are not the words of one demon-possessed . Can a demoniac open the eyes of the blind ? "
43010022	Then came the feast of the Dedication at Jerusalem .
43010023	It was winter , and Jesus used to walk in the Temple , in Solomons Portico .
43010024	Then all the Jews encircled him and kept asking him . " How long are you going to keep us in suspense ? If you are the Christ , tell us plainly . "
43010025	Jesus answered them . " I have told you , and you do not believe . The works which I am doing in my Fathers name , these bear witness concerning me .
43010026	" But you do not believe , because you are not of my sheep .
43010027	" My sheep listen to my voice , and I know them and they follow me .
43010028	" I am giving them eternal life , and they shall never perish , nor shall any one snatch them out of my hand .
43010029	" My Father who has given them to me is stronger than all , and no one can snatch them out of my Fathers hand .
43010030	" I and my Father are one . "
43010031	The Jews again took stones with which to stone him . Jesus said to them .
43010032	" I have shown you many good deeds from my Father . For which of these are you going to stone me ? "
43010033	" We are not going to stone you for a good deed , " answered the Jews , " but for blasphemy , because you , a mere man , are making yourself God . "
43010034	" Is it written in your law , " replied Jesus , " I said , You are gods ?
43010035	" If those to whom the word of God came are called gods ( and the Scripture cannot be annulled ) ,
43010036	do you mean to tell me , whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world , You are blaspheming , because I said , I am the Son of God ?
43010037	" If I am not doing the deeds of my Father , do not believe me .
43010038	" But if I am doing them , then though you believe not me , believe the deeds , in order that you may come to know and keep on clearly understanding that the Father is in me and I am in the Father . "
43010039	Then again they attempted to seize him , but he escaped out of their hands ,
43010040	and went away again across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing at first , and there he remained .
43010041	Many who came to him said , " John did not perform any signs , but everything he said about this man was true . "
43010042	And many believed on him there .
43011001	Now a man named Lazarus was ill . He was from Bethany , the village of Mary and her sister Martha
43011002	- it was Mary who anointed the Lord with perfume and wiped his feet with her hair , whose brother Lazarus was ill .
43011003	So the sisters sent to him , saying . " Master , see who you hold dear is ill . "
43011004	When Jesus heard it he said , " This illness is not unto death , but for the glory of God , that through it the Son of God may be glorified . "
43011005	Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus .
43011006	However , when he heard that he was ill ,
43011007	he still remained where he was for two days ; then after that he said to his disciples , " Let us go back again to Judea . "
43011008	" Rabbi , " answered his disciples , " it was but just now that the Jews were trying to stone you , and are you going there again ? "
43011009	Jesus replied . " Are there not twelve hours in the daytime ? If any one walks in the daytime he does not stumble , because he beholds the light of this world ;
43011010	but if any one walks during the night he does stumble , because the light is not in him . "
43011011	This he said , then told them , " Lazarus , our friend , has fallen asleep , but I am going to wake him . "
43011012	" Master , if he has fallen asleep , he will get well , " replied the disciples .
43011013	Now Jesus had been speaking concerning his death , but they thought that he was talking about natural sleep .
43011014	So then he told them plainly .
43011015	" Lazarus is dead ; and for your sakes I am glad I was not there , in order that you may believe . Come , let us go to him . "
43011016	Upon this Thomas , who was called " The Twin , " said to his fellow disciples , " Let us go too , that we may die with him . "
43011017	so when Jesus arrived , he found that Lazarus had already been four days in the tomb .
43011018	Now Bethany was near Jerusalem , only about two miles away ;
43011019	so a number of the Jews had gone to Martha and Mary to sympathize with them concerning their brother .
43011020	So when Martha learned that Jesus was coming , she went to meet him , but Mary remained sitting in the house .
43011021	Then Martha said to Jesus . " Master , had you been here my brother would not have died ;
43011022	but even now I know that whatever you ask of God , God will give you . "
43011023	Jesus said to her , " Your brother will rise again . "
43011024	Martha answered , " I know that he will rise in the resurrection , at the Last Day . "
43011025	" I am the resurrection and the life , " said Jesus . " He who believes in me , even if he has died , shall live .
43011026	And every one who is living and believes in me shall never die . Do you believe this ? "
43011027	" Yes , Master , " she answered , " I have come to believe that you are the Christ , the Son of God , who was to come into the world . "
43011028	With these words she went away to call her sister Mary , saying privately , " The Teacher is here and is asking for you . "
43011029	So when Mary heard this , she rose quickly and went to meet him .
43011030	Jesus had not yet arrived in the village , but was still at the place where Martha met him .
43011031	Then the Jews who were in the house trying to console her , when they saw that Mary rose quickly and went out , followed her , because they thought she was going to the tomb to weep there .
43011032	When Mary came to the place where Jesus was , and saw him , she fell at his feet , saying , " Master had you been here , my brother would not have died . "
43011033	Then when Jesus saw her sobbing , and the Jews likewise who accompanied her , sobbing , he shuddered with indignation in his spirit , and was deeply agitated .
43011034	" Where have you laid him ? " he said . " Master , come and see , " they answered .
43011035	Jesus burst into tears .
43011036	" See how he loved him , " said the Jews . But some of them said ,
43011037	" Could not this man , who has opened the eyes of the blind man , have prevented this man also from dying ? "
43011038	Jesus therefore , again shuddering in himself with indignation , came to the tomb , which was a cave with a stone lying upon it .
43011039	" Roll away the stone , " said Jesus . " Master , " said Martha , the sister of the dead man " he is offensive by this time , for he has been four days in the tomb . "
43011040	Jesus answered her , " Did I not tell you that if you would believe you should see the glory of God ? "
43011041	Then they rolled the stone away ; and Jesus lifted up his eyes and said .
43011042	" Father , I thank thee that thou hast listened to me . And I knew that thou art ever listening to me , but for the sake of the crowd who are standing about , I said it , in order that they may believe that thou hast sent me . "
43011043	When he had said this he cried with a great voice , " Lazarus , come forth ! "
43011044	Out came the dead man , wrapped hand and foot with grave-clothes , and his face bound up in a napkin . Jesus said to them , " Untie him , and let him go . "
43011045	Many of the Jews , therefore , who had come with Mary , and had seen what he did , believed on him ;
43011046	but some of them went away to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done .
43011047	So the chief priests and Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin .
43011048	" What are we going to do ? " they said , " now that this man is performing many signs ? " If we leave him alone , this way , every one will believe on him , and the Romans will come and rob us of both our sacred place and of our people . "
43011049	But one of their number , Caiaphas by name , who was high priest that year , said to them ,
43011050	" You know nothing at all , nor do you consider that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people , rather than the whole nation be destroyed . "
43011051	now he did not say this of his own accord ; but as high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus was about to die in behalf of the nation ,
43011052	and not in behalf of the nation alone , but in order that he might gather into one the widely scattered children of God .
43011053	So from that day they plotted to kill him .
43011054	Jesus therefore no longer went about publicly among the Jews , but went away from there into the region near the desert to a town called Ephraim ,
43011055	and there remained with his disciples . Now the Jewish Passover was near , and many people went up from the country to Jerusalem for purification before the Passover .
43011056	So they kept looking for Jesus and saying to one another , as they stood in the Temple , " What do you think - that he will not come to the feast at all ? "
43011057	Now the chief priests and Pharisees had given orders that if any one knew where he was . he should give information , so that they might arrest him .
43012001	So then Jesus came six days before the Passover , to Bethany , where Lazarus was whom Jesus had raised from the dead .
43012002	So they gave a dinner for him there , and Martha served it ; but Lazarus was one of those who reclined with him at table .
43012003	Then Mary took a pound of pure spikenard , very costly , and poured it over his feet , and wiped his feet with her hair , and the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume .
43012004	Then said Judas Iscariot , one of his disciples , who was about to betray him ,
43012005	" Why was not this perfume sold for fifty dollars , and the proceeds given to the poor ? "
43012006	This he said not because he cared for the poor , but because he was a thief , and , carrying the purse ,
43012007	used to purloin what was put in it . Then said Jesus . " Let her alone . Against the day of my burial has she kept this ;
43012008	for the poor you have with you always , but me you have not always . "
43012009	When the great mass of the Jews learned that Jesus was there , they came not alone because of Jesus , but to see Lazarus also , whom he had raised from the dead .
43012010	And the chief priests plotted to kill Lazarus too ,
43012011	because it was on his account that many of the Jews were leaving them , and beginning to believe on Jesus .
43012012	Next day the big crowd who had come up for the Passover heard that Jesus was coming into Jerusalem ,
43012013	and taking branches from the palm trees went out to meet him , shouting , " Hosanna ! Blessed is he who cometh in the name of the Lord . Even Israels King ! "
43012014	And Jesus found a young ass and seated himself on it , as it is written ,
43012015	Fear not , daughter of Zion , Behold thy King cometh seated upon an asss colt .
43012016	His disciples did not understand these things at first ; but when Jesus had been glorified , then they remembered that these things had been written concerning him , and what they had done to him .
43012017	Meanwhile the crowd which was with him when he summoned Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead , kept witnessing .
43012018	For this reason , too , the crowd came to meet him , because they had heard about this sign which he had done .
43012019	Then the Pharisees said among themselves . " You see ! You can do nothing ! Look ! The world is gone after him ! "
43012020	Now there were certain Greeks among those who had come up to worship during the Passover feast ;
43012021	these came to Philip of Bethsaida in Galilee , with a request . " Sir , " they said , " we want to see Jesus . "
43012022	Philip went and told Andrew . Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus . Jesus answered .
43012023	" The hour is come that the Son of man should be glorified .
43012024	In solemn truth I tell you that except a kernel of wheat fall into the ground and die , it remains a single kernel ; but if it die it bears a great crop .
43012025	He who loves his life loses it ; and he who regards not his life in this world shall keep it for eternal life .
43012026	If any one is ready to serve me , let him follow me ; and where I am there shall my servant be also . If any man is ready to serve me , him will my Father honor .
43012027	Now is my soul disquieted . What shall I say ? Father , save me from this hour ? Nay , for this very cause I am come to this hour .
43012028	Father , glorify thy name ! " Whereupon there came a voice from heaven , saying , " I have both glorified it , and will glorify it again . "
43012029	Then the crowd who stood around and heard it , said , " It thundered ! " But others said , " An angel has spoken to him . "
43012030	" It is not for my sake , " answered Jesus , " that the voice came , but for your sakes .
43012031	Now is a judgment of this world ; now will the ruler of this world be driven out .
43012032	" AND I , IF I BE LIFTED UP FROM THE EARTH , WILL DRAW ALL MEN UNTO MYSELF . "
43012033	( In saying this he was signifying by what kind of death he was to die . )
43012034	Then the people answered . " We have heard out of the Law that the Christ abides forever . What do you mean by The Son of man must be lifted up ? Who is this Son of man ? "
43012035	" The Light is among you a little longer , " answered Jesus . " Walk while you have the Light , lest darkness overtake you . He who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going .
43012036	While you have the Light , believe in the Light , so that you may become Sons of Light . "
43012037	With these words Jesus went away and hid himself from them . But although he had wrought such signs in their presence , still they did not believe in him .
43012038	So the words spoken by Isaiah , the prophet , were fulfilled . Lord , who hath believed our message , And to whom hath the Arm of the Lord been revealed ?
43012039	This was why they could not believe , because Isaiah said again .
43012040	He hath blinded their eyes and make their hearts hard , Lest they should see with their eyes , perceive with their minds , And should turn , and I should heal them .
43012041	Isaiah uttered these words because he saw his glory , and he spoke of him .
43012042	Nevertheless , even among the rulers many believed on him , but did not confess in on account of the Pharisees , for fear lest they be put out of the Synagogue .
43012043	For they loved the approval of men rather than the approval of God .
43012044	Now Jesus , speaking in a loud voice , had said .
43012045	" He who believes in me believes not in me , but in Him who sent me ; and he who sees me sees him who sent me .
43012046	Like light am I come into the world , so that no one who believes in me may remain in darkness .
43012047	And if any one hears my words and does not keep them , it is not I who judge him ; for I am not come to judge the world , but to save the world .
43012048	He who rejects me , and does not receive my words , has indeed a judge . The message which I have spoken , that shall judge him in the Last Day ,
43012049	because I have never spoken on my own authority , but the Father himself who sent me gave me commandment what to say and what words to speak .
43012050	And I know that his commandment is eternal life . So whatever I speak , I speak as the Father has told me . "
43013001	Now just before the feast of the Passover , Jesus , knowing that his hour was come when he should leave this world to go to the Father , having loved his own who were in the world , showed forth his love to the end . " Your life you will lay down for me ? In solemn truth I tell you , the cock shall not crow before you have three times disowned me . "
43013002	So while supper was proceeding , and the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot , the son of Simon , to betray him ,
43013003	Jesus , knowing that the Father had given everything into his hands , and that he was come from God ,
43013004	and was now going to God , rose from supper , laid aside his upper garments , and took a towel and girded himself .
43013005	Then he poured water into the basin , and began to wash the feet of his disciples and to wipe them with the towel with which he had girded himself .
43013006	Then he came to Simon Peter , who said to him , " Lord , are you going to wash my feet ? "
43013007	Jesus answered him , " What I am doing you do not understand now , but you will understand it later . "
43013008	Peter answered , " No , never shall you wash my feet . " " If I do not wash you , " said Jesus , " you have no part in me . "
43013009	" Lord , " said Simon Peter , " not my feet only , but also my hands and my head . "
43013010	Jesus said . " He who has bathed needs only to have his feet washed , and he is altogether clean ; and you are clean , but not all of you . "
43013011	( For he knew who should betray him , for that reason he said that they were not every one of them clean . )
43013012	So after he had washed their feet , and had put on his upper garments again , and taken his place , he said to them .
43013013	" Do you understand what I have been doing to you ? You call me Teacher and Master , and you say well , for such I am .
43013014	If then I have washed your feet , I the Master and the Teacher , you also ought to wash one anothers feet ,
43013015	for I have given you an example , that you also should do what I have done to you .
43013016	In solemn truth I tell you that a slave is not greater than his master , neither is a messenger greater than the one who sends him .
43013017	If you know these things , happy are you if you do them .
43013018	I do not speak concerning all of you . I know whom I have chosen , but it is that the Scripture may be fulfilled , which says . " He who eats my bread has lifted up his heel against me .
43013019	" From this time forward , I tell you before it comes to pass , that when it is come to pass you may believe who I am .
43013020	In solemn truth I tell you , he who receives any one that I send is receiving me ; and he who receives me is receiving Him who sent me . "
43013021	When he had spoken thus , Jesus was deeply moved . He testified and said , " In solemn truth I tell you that one of you will betray me . "
43013022	Then the disciples began looking at one another , wondering which one of them he meant .
43013023	There was reclining upon Jesus breast one of the disciples whom he loved .
43013024	So Simon Peter beckoned to him , saying , " Ask who it is about whom he is speaking . "
43013025	So that disciples just leaned back against Jesus breast and said to him , " Lord , who is it ? "
43013026	" It is that one , " answered Jesus , " to whom I am going to give a piece of bread , after dipping it . "
43013027	So when he had dipped the bread , he took it and gave it to Judas Iscariot , son of Simon . And after he had received the piece of bread , Satan entered into him . " What you do , do quickly , " said Jesus .
43013028	Now no one at the table understood why he said this to him ,
43013029	for some were thinking , as Judas kept the purse , that Jesus meant to tell him , " Buy the things that we need for the feast , " or that he should give something to the poor .
43013030	When he had taken the piece of bread , Judas went out immediately ; and it was night .
43013031	So when he was gone , Jesus said . " Now has the Son of man been glorified , and God has been glorified in him .
43013032	If God has been glorified in him , God will also glorify him in himself , and straightway will he glorify him .
43013033	" My little children , I am only to be with you a little longer . You will seek me ; just as I said to the Jews , Where I go you cannot come , so now I say to you .
43013034	I give you a new commandment , Love one another !
43013035	By this shall all men know that you are my disciples , if you have love one for another . "
43013036	Simon Peter asked him , " Lord , where are you going ? " " Where I am going , " answered Jesus , " you cannot follow me now ; but you shall follow me later . "
43013037	" Why cannot I follow you now , Master ? " said Peter . " I will lay down my life for you . " Jesus answered him .
43013038	" Your life you will lay down for me ? In solemn truth I tell you , the cock shall not crow before you have three times disowned me . "
43014001	" Let not your hearts be troubled . You trust in God , trust in me also .
43014002	In my Fathers house there are many rooms If it were not so , would I have told you that I went to prepare a place for you ?
43014003	I will return and will take you to be with me , so that where I am you may be also .
43014004	And the way is known to you all , where I am going . "
43014005	" We do not know where you are going Lord , " said Thomas , " so how can we know the way ? "
43014006	Jesus answered him . " I am the Way , the Truth and the Life . No man ever comes to the Father but by me .
43014007	If you had known me , you would have known my Father too ; from now on you know him and have seen him . "
43014008	" Lord , " said Philip , " cause us to see the Father , and we shall be satisfied . "
43014009	" Have I been so long among you , and yet you , Philip , have you not recognized me ? He who has seen me has seen the Father . How can you say , Cause us to see the Father ?
43014010	" Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father in me ? The words that I speak to you I speak not of myself ; but the Father , who ever dwells in me , is doing his own work .
43014011	" Believe me , all of you , that I am in the Father and the Father in me , or else believe me for the very words sake .
43014012	" I tell you solemnly that he who trusts in me shall himself do the works that I am doing ; and still greater works than these , because I am going to my Father .
43014013	" And whatever you ask in my name I will do ; that the Father may be glorified in the Son .
43014014	" If you ask anything in my name , I will do it .
43014015	" If you love me , you will obey my commandments ,
43014016	" and I will pray the Father ,
43014017	" and he will give you another Comforter to be with you forever , the Spirit of Truth . The world cannot receive him because it does not see him nor know him , but you know him , for he is ever with you and within you .
43014018	" I will not leave you comfortless ; I will come to you .
43014019	" Yet a little while and the world shall see me no more , but you shall see me ; because I live , you , too , shall live .
43014020	" At that day you shall understand that I am in my Father , and you in me , and I in you .
43014021	" It is he who has my commands and obeys them that loves me ; and he who loves me shall be loved by my Father , and I will love him and will manifest myself to him . "
43014022	" How is it , Lord , " said Judas ( not Iscariot ) " that you will manifest yourself to us and not to the world ? "
43014023	Jesus replied . " If any loves me he will obey my word , and my Father will love him , and we will come to him and make our home with him .
43014024	" He that loves me not does not obey words , and yet the words to which you are listening are not mine , but the Fathers who sent me .
43014025	" All this I told you while still with you .
43014026	" But the Comforter , the Holy Spirit , whom the Father will send in my name , will teach you everything , and bring to your remembrance everything that I have told you .
43014027	" Peace I leave with you . My own peace I give to you . It is not the worlds Peace I give you . Let not your heart be troubled , neither let it be afraid .
43014028	" You heard me tell you , I am going away , and yet I am coming to you . If you loved me you would have been glad because I said I am going to the Father , for my Father is greater than I .
43014029	" And now I tell you this before it happens , so that when it does happen you may believe .
43014030	" I shall not talk with you much more , for the Prince of this world is coming .
43014031	" He has nothing in me , but in his coming the world may know that I love the Father , and that I do just as the Father commanded . Rise , let us be going ! "
43015001	" I am the vine , and my Father the vine-grower .
43015002	" He cuts back any of my branches that bear no fruit , and prunes every fruit-bearing branch , that it may bear more .
43015003	" Now you are clean through the word which I have spoken to you .
43015004	" Abide in me , and I in you . Just as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine , no more can you , unless you abide in me .
43015005	" I am the Vine you are the branches . He who abides in me and I in him , bears abundant fruit ; because apart from me you can do nothing .
43015006	" If any one does not abide in me he is thrown away like a branch and withers . Such branches are gathered up and thrown into the fire and burned .
43015007	" If you abide in me and my words abide in you , ask whatever your will is , and it shall be yours .
43015008	" By this is my Father glorified , by your bearing abundant fruit , and so being my disciples .
43015009	" As the Father has loved me , so have I loved you ; abide in my love .
43015010	" If you obey my commands you will abide in my love , just as I have obeyed my Fathers commands and abide in his love .
43015011	" I have told you these things that my joy might remain in you , and that your joy might be full .
43015012	" This is my command , Love one another as I have loved you .
43015013	" Greater love has no man than this , that a man lay down his life for his friends .
43015014	" You are my friends if you do what I command you .
43015015	" I no longer call you slaves , because a slave does not know what his master is doing ; but I have called you friends , because I have made known to you everything that I have learned from my Father .
43015016	" You did not choose me , but I chose you and appointed you , that you should go and bear fruit , and that your fruit should remain ; so that whatever you ask the Father in my name , he may give it to you .
43015017	" This is my command . to love one another . If the worlds hates you ,
43015018	" do not forget that it hated me first .
43015019	" If you belonged to the world , the world would love its own ; but because you do not belong to the world , but I have chosen you out of the world , for that reason the world hates you .
43015020	" Remember what I told you , A slave is not better than his master . If they persecuted me , they will persecute you . If they have obeyed my word , they will obey yours also .
43015021	" But they will do all these things to you for my names sake , because they know not Him who sent me .
43015022	" If I had not come and spoken to them , they would have no sin ; but now they have no excuse for their sin .
43015023	" He who hates me hates my Father also .
43015024	" If I had not done among them such works as none ever did , they would have had no sin ; but now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father .
43015025	" And so is fulfilled the word written in their Law , They hate me without cause .
43015026	" When the Comforter is come whom I will send to you from the Father , the Spirit of Truth who comes forth from the Father , he will bear witness of me ;
43015027	" and you to shall bear witness because you have been with me from the first .
43016001	" I have told you all this so that you may not stumble .
43016002	" They will excommunicate you from their synagogues ; indeed the time is coming when any one who kills you will suppose that he is doing Gods service .
43016003	" And they will do these things because they have not known my Father , nor me .
43016004	" But I have told you these things , that when the time comes you may remember that I told you about them , myself . I did not , however , speak of these things at first , because I was with you .
43016005	" But now I go my way to Him who sent me , yet none of you asks me , Where are you going ?
43016006	" but sorrow has filled your hearts because I have told you these things .
43016007	" Yet - I am telling you the truth - my going is for your good . For unless I go away the Comforter will not come to you ; but if I depart I will send him unto you .
43016008	" And he , when he comes , will convict the world of sins and of righteousness and of judgment ;
43016009	" of sin , because they do not believe in me ;
43016011	" because the Prince of this world has been judged .
43016012	" I have yet many things to say to you , but you cannot bear them just now .
43016013	" But when he is come , that Spirit of Truth , he will guide you into the whole truth . For he will not speak on his own authority , but all that he hears he will speak , and will make known to you that which is to come .
43016014	" He will glorify me ; for he will take of what is mine and will make known to you .
43016015	" Everything that the Father has is mine ; that is why I said that he will take of what is mine and make it known to you .
43016016	" In a little while you shall behold me no more ; and again in a little while you shall see me , because I am going to the Father . "
43016017	At this some of his disciples said among themselves . " What does he mean by telling us , In a little while you shall behold me no more ; and again in a little while you shall see me , and because I am going to the Father ? "
43016018	So they kept asking . " What does that little while mean of which he speaks ? We do not know what he is talking about . "
43016019	Jesus perceived that they wanted to ask him , and said . " Are you questioning one another about my saying , A little while and you shall behold me no more , and again a little while you shall see me ?
43016020	" I tell you solemnly that you will be weeping and wailing while the world is rejoicing ; you will be grief-stricken , but your grief shall be turned into gladness .
43016021	" A woman in labor has grief because her hour is come ; but when she has given birth to the babe she no longer remembers her anguish , because of joy that a child has been born into the world .
43016022	" So you also have sorrow now , but I will see you again and your heart will rejoice , and your joy shall no man snatch away from you .
43016023	" And in that day you will ask me no questions . Most solemnly I tell you that whatever you ask the Father in my name , he will give you .
43016024	" Hitherto you have asked nothing in my name ; ask , and you shall receive , that your joy may be full .
43016025	" I have told you these things in figures ; but the time is coming when I shall no longer speak in figures , but will tell you about the Father in plain words .
43016026	" In that day you shall pray in my name ; and I do not tell you that I will ask the Father on your behalf ;
43016027	" for the Father himself loves you , because you have loved me and believed that I came forth from the God .
43016028	" I came forth from the Father , and am come into the world . again , I am leaving the world , and am going to the Father . "
43016029	" Ah , " said the disciples , " now you are speaking plain language , and not using figures . Now we are sure that you know all things , and have no need for any one to question you ; by this we believe that you came forth from God . "
43016031	" Do you now believe ? " said Jesus ;
43016032	" behold the hour approaches and is already come when you will be scattered , each man to his home , and will leave me alone ; and yet I am not alone , because the Father is with me .
43016033	" I have said all this to you that in me you might have peace . In the world you will have tribulation , but be courageous ; I have overcome the world . "
43017001	When he had thus spoken , Jesus raised his eyes to heaven and said . " Father , the hour is come . Glorify the Son , that thy Son may glorify thee ;
43017002	" since thou hast given him authority over all mankind , to give eternal life to all whom thou hast given him .
43017003	" And this is eternal life , to know thee , the only true God , and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent .
43017004	" I have glorified thee on the earth ; I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do .
43017005	" And now , O Father , glorify thou me with own self , with the glory I had with thee before the world began .
43017006	" I have made known thy name to the men whom thou gavest me out of the world . Thine they were , and thou gavest them to me , and they have kept thy word .
43017007	" They know now that whatever thou hast given me was from thee ;
43017008	" for I have given them the words which thou gavest me ; and they have received them , and they have believed that thou didst send me .
43017009	" I am praying for them ; I am not praying for the world , but for those whom thou hast given me ; for they are thine ,
43017010	" and all thine are mine , and mine are thine ; and I am glorified in them .
43017011	I am no longer in the world , but these are in the world , and I come to thee . Holy Father , keep through thine own Name these whom thou hast given me , that they may be one as we are one .
43017012	While I was with them I kept them by the power of thy name which thou hast given me . I guarded them , and none of them was lost except the son of perdition , that the Scripture might be fulfilled .
43017013	" But now I am coming to thee , and I am speaking these things while I am in the world , so that they may have my joy in all its fulness in themselves .
43017014	I have given them thy word ; and the world has hated them because they are not of the world , even as I am not of the world .
43017015	I am not asking that thou wilt take them out of the world , but that thou wilt protect them from the Evil One .
43017016	They are not of the world , even as I am not of the world .
43017017	Dedicate them in thy truth ;  thy word is truth .
43017018	" As thou hast sent me into the world , even so I also have sent them into the world .
43017019	" And for their sakes I dedicate myself , that they also may be thoroughly dedicated in the truth .
43017020	" Nor do I pray for them alone , but for those also who believe in me through their word ,
43017021	" that they may all be one , even as thou , Father , art in me and I in thee ; that they also may be in us ; in order that the world may believe that thou hast sent me .
43017022	" And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them ; that they may be one even as we are one ,
43017023	" I in them and thou in me ; that they may be made perfectly one , so that the world may recognize that thou didst send me , and hast loved them as thou hast loved me .
43017024	" Father , it is my will that wherever I am these also , thy gift to me , may be with me , that they may see the glory , my glory which thou hast given me , because thou didst love me before the foundations of the world .
43017025	" O righteous Father , though the world knew thee not , I have known thee , and these have known that though didst send me .
43017026	" And I have declared - and will declare - thy name unto them , that the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them , and that I may be in them . "
43018001	After he had spoken these words Jesus went forth with his disciples to a place across the Ravine of the Cedars , where there was a garden into which he and his disciples went .
43018002	Judas the Traitor also knew this place ; for Jesus and his disciples often met there .
43018003	So after getting troops and some Temple police from the chief priests and Pharisees , Judas came there with lanterns and torches and weapons .
43018004	Then Jesus , knowing all that was coming upon him , went forth to meet them , and asked them , " Who is it that you are looking for ? "
43018005	" For Jesus of Nazareth , " they answered . He said to them , " I am he . " ( Now Judas also , the betrayer , was standing with them . )
43018006	When Jesus said " I am he , " they drew back and fell to the ground ;
43018007	so he asked them once more , " Whom are you looking for ? " and they replied , " Jesus of Nazareth . "
43018008	" I have already told you that I am he , " said Jesus . " If , then , you are looking for me , let these go their way . "
43018009	" ( In order that the word which he had spoken might be fulfilled , " Of those whom thou hast given me I have not lost one . " )
43018010	Then Simon Peter , who had a sword , drew it , and striking at the high priests slave , cut off his right ear .
43018011	( The slaves name was Malchus . ) Then Jesus said to Peter . " Put up your sword in its sheath . the cup which my Father has given me , shall I not drink it ? "
43018012	So the troops and their commandant and the Jewish police took Jesus , and bound him ,
43018013	and led him to Annas first . ( For Annas was the Father-in-law of Caiaphas , who was the high priest that year -
43018014	the Caiaphas who had advised the Jews that it was for their advantage that one man should die for the people . )
43018015	Meanwhile Simon Peter was following Jesus , and so was another disciple who was known to the high priest , and they went in with Jesus into the court of the high priests palace .
43018016	But Peter took his stand outside , near the door . So the other disciple who was known to the high priest came out and spoke to the doorkeeper and brought Peter in .
43018017	The doorkeeper ( a maid servant ) then said to Peter , " Are not you also one of this mans disciples ? " " No I am not , " he answered .
43018018	Now the slaves and the attendants were standing and warming themselves about a charcoal fire , which they had made because it was cold ; and Peter also stood with them , and was warming himself .
43018019	Then the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching .
43018020	Jesus answered him . " I have spoken to all the world openly . I always taught in a synagogue and in the temple , places where all the Jews are wont to assemble , and in secret I have spoken nothing .
43018021	" Why do you question me ? Ask those who heard what I have said to them ; these witnesses here know what I said . "
43018022	When he had spoken these words , one of the police standing by gave him a blow with his hand , saying as he did so , " Is that the way you answer the high priest ? "
43018023	Jesus replied " If I have said anything wrong , give evidence concerning the wrong ; but if I said what was true , why do you strike me ? "
43018024	Then Annas sent him in chains to Caiaphas , the high priest .
43018025	Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself . They said therefore to him , " You are not also one of his disciples , are you not ? " He denied it , saying " I am not . "
43018026	One of the slaves of the high priest , a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off , said , " Did not I myself see you with him in the garden . "
43018027	Peter again denied it ; and at that very moment a cock crew .
43018028	From the house of Caiaphas they took Jesus to the Praetorium , and it was dawn . They themselves would not enter the Praetorium , in order that they might not be ceremonially defiled , but might be able to eat the Passover .
43018029	So Pilate came outside to them and asked , " What charge do you bring against this man ? "
43018030	In reply they said , " If he had not been a criminal , we should not have handed him over you . "
43018031	" Take him yourselves , " answered Pilate , " and judge him according to your law . "
43018032	The Jews answered him , " We are not allowed to put anyone to death " ( that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled in which he predicted the kind of death he was to die ) .
43018033	So Pilate went into the Praetorium again , and summoned Jesus . " Are you the King of the Jews ? " he said .
43018034	Jesus answered , " Are you saying this of your own accord , or did others say it to you about me ? "
43018035	" I am not a Jew , am I ? " replied Pilate ; " It is your own nation and the high priests who have handed you over to me . What have you done ? "
43018036	Jesus answered him . " My kingdom is not of this world . If my kingdom were of this world , then would my servants have fought hard that I should not be handed the Jews ; but in reality my kingdom is not of such origins . "
43018037	" You are a king , then ? You ! " said Pilate . " You say truly that I am a king . " answered Jesus , " for this purpose I was born , and to this end came I into the world , that I should bear witness to the truth . Every man who is of the truth listens to my voice . "
43018038	Pilate said to him , " What is truth ? " As he said this , he went outside again to the Jews and said to them .
43018039	" I find no crime in this man . Now it is a custom of yours that I release one prisoner to you at the time of the Passover feast . Do you wish me to release to you the King of the Jews ? "
43018040	Then they all shouted again . " No , not him ! Barabbas ! " Now Barabbas was a robber .
43019001	After that Pilate took Jesus and had him scourged ;
43019002	and the soldiers plaited a crown of thorns , placed it on his head , and threw a purple cloak about him , and kept marching up to him ,
43019003	saying , " Hail ! King of the Jews ! " They also gave him blow after blow with their hands .
43019004	Pilate again came forth and said to the people , " See , I am going to bring his out to you , that you may clearly know that I find no crime in him , "
43019005	Then as Jesus came out , wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe , Pilate said to them , " BEHOLD , THE MAN ! "
43019006	So when the chief priests and the police saw him , they shouted . " Crucify him ! Crucify him ! " " Take him yourselves and crucify him , " said Pilate , " for I find no crime in him . "
43019007	The Jews answered him , " We have a law , and by that law he ought to die , because he made himself out to be Gods Son , "
43019008	Now when Pilate heard these words he was more alarmed than ever ,
43019009	and entering the Praetorium again , he said to Jesus , " What is your origin ? "
43019010	Jesus made no answer . So Pilate said to him . " Do you not speak to me ? Do you not know that I have power to release you , or power to crucify you ? "
43019011	" You would have no power over me , " answered Jesus , " unless it had been given you from above . For this reason he who has betrayed me to you has the greater sin . "
43019012	After that Pilate began to seek to release him , but the Jews shouted out . " If you release this man you are no friend of the Emperor . Any man who makes himself out to be king is a rebel against the Emperor . "
43019013	On hearing what they said , Pilate brought Jesus out and made him sit on the judges seat in a place called the Mosaic Pavement ( the Hebrew name is Gabbatha ) .
43019014	And it was the day of Preparation for the Passover , about six oclock in the morning . Then he said to the Jews , " Behold your King ! "
43019015	Then they shouted . " Away with him ! Away with him ! Crucify him ! " " Crucify your King ? " said Pilate . The chief priests answered , " We have no king but Caesar ! "
43019016	So then he gave him over to them to be crucified .
43019017	So they took Jesus , who went forth bearing his own cross , to a place called The Place of a Skull - in the Hebrew tongue , Golgotha .
43019018	There they crucified him ; and with him two others , one on either side , and Jesus between them .
43019019	And Pilate moreover wrote an inscription and placed it above the cross . What he wrote was , " JESUS , THE NAZARENE , KING OF THE JEWS "
43019020	This inscription was read by many of the Jews , because the place where they crucified Jesus was near the city , and the inscription was written in Hebrew , Latin , and Greek .
43019021	So the high priests of the Jews said to Pilate , " Do not write King of the Jews , but He said , I am King of the Jews . "
43019022	Pilate answered , " What I have written , I have written ! "
43019023	After the soldiers had crucified Jesus , they took his garments and divided them into four parts , to each soldier a part , and the tunic . Now the tunic was seamless , woven in one piece from top to bottom ;
43019024	so the soldiers said one to another . " Let us not tear it . Let us draw lots , to see whose it shall be " - that the Scripture might be fulfilled . They divided my garments among them , For my raiment did they cast lots . This was what the soldiers did .
43019025	Now there stood near the cross of Jesus , his mother and his mothers sister , Mary the wife of Clopas , and Mary Magdalene .
43019026	When Jesus saw his mother , and standing near her the disciple whom he loved , he said to his mother , " Woman behold your son . "
43019027	Then he said to the disciple , " Behold your mother . " And from that hour the disciple took her to his home .
43019028	After that , when Jesus knew that everything was now accomplished , he said in fulfilment of the words of Scripture , " I am thirsty . "
43019029	There was a jar full of vinegar standing there ; and they filled a sponge with vinegar , and put it upon a stalk of hyssop , and put it to his lips .
43019030	Then after he had taken the vinegar , Jesus said , " IT IS FINISHED ! " And bowing his head , he yielded up his spirit .
43019031	It was Preparation Day , so in order to prevent the bodies hanging on the cross during the Sabbath ( for the Sabbath was a great day ) the Jews begged Pilate to have the legs broken , and the bodies taken away .
43019032	So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man and of the other who had been crucified with him .
43019033	But upon coming to Jesus they saw that he was already dead , and did not break his legs .
43019034	One of the soldiers , however , pierced his side with a lance , and immediately blood and water flowed out .
43019035	And he who saw it has borne testimony , and his testimony is trustworthy , and he knows that he is telling the truth in order that you may believe .
43019036	For this happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled , Not one of his bones shall be broken .
43019037	And again another Scripture says , They shall look on him whom they have pierced .
43019038	After these things Joseph of Arimathea , who was a disciple of Jesus , but in secret because of fear of the Jews , asked Pilate for permission to take the body of Jesus , and Pilate gave him leave . So he came and took the body .
43019039	Nicodemus also ( the one who visited Jesus by night , at first ) came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes , weighing nearly a hundred pounds .
43019040	So they took the body of Jesus and wound it in linen with the spices , according to the Jewish mode of burial .
43019041	There was a garden near the place where Jesus had been crucified , and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid .
43019042	Here , because of its being Preparation Day , and as the tomb was near by , they placed Jesus .
43020001	On the first day of the week , very early in the morning , while it was yet dark , Mary Magdalene came to the tomb and discovered that the stone had been removed from the tomb .
43020002	So she came running to Simon Peter and that other disciple whom Jesus loved , saying , " They have taken the Master out of the tomb , and we do not know where they have laid him ! "
43020003	So Peter and the other disciples set out at once to go to the tomb .
43020004	They both began to run ; and the other disciple ran faster than Peter , and came first to the tomb .
43020005	Stooping down he glanced in and saw the linen wrapping lying on the ground ; but he did not go in .
43020006	Then Peter also came following him , and he went inside the tomb ; and he gazed at the linen wrapping as they lay ,
43020007	and the napkin which had been about his head not lying with the wrappings , but rolled up in its own place .
43020008	Then the other disciple also who arrived first at the tomb went inside , and he perceived and believed .
43020009	For not yet had they understood the Scripture , that he must rise again from the dead .
43020010	Then the disciples went back again to their home .
43020011	Meanwhile , outside , Mary stood sobbing near the tomb . Still sobbing she stooped and looked into the tomb ,
43020012	and gazed at two angels in glistening white sitting , one at the head the other at the feet , where the body of Jesus had lain .
43020013	They said to her , " Woman , why are you weeping ? " She answered , " Because they have taken away my Master , and I do not know where they have laid him . "
43020014	When she had said this she turned around and saw Jesus standing there , but did not know that it was Jesus .
43020015	Jesus said to her . " Woman , why are you weeping ? Whom are you seeking ? She , supposing that he was the gardener , said to him , " Sir , if you have borne him away , tell me where you have put him , and I will take him away , myself . "
43020016	" Mary , " said Jesus . She turned to him . " Rabboni ! " she cried in Hebrew . That is to say , " Teacher . "
43020017	" Do not cling to me , " said Jesus , " for I am not yet ascended to the Father . But go to my brothers and say to them , " I am ascending to my Father and your Father , to my God and your God . "
43020018	Away went Mary Magdalene to the disciples with the tidings , " I have seen the Master ! " and that he said these things to her .
43020019	On the evening of that same day , the first day of the week , although the doors of the room where the disciples gathered had been locked for fear of the Jews , Jesus came , and there he stood among them , saying . " Peace to you ! "
43020020	As he said this he showed them his hands and his side . Then were the disciple glad , when they saw the Lord .
43020021	Then Jesus said to them again . " Peace to you . As my Father has sent me forth , I also now am sending you . "
43020022	When he had said this he breathed upon them and said .
43020023	" Receive the Holy Spirit . If you remit any ones sins , they are remitted ; if you retain them they are retained . "
43020024	But Thomas , one of the Twelve , who was called " The Twin . " was not with them when Jesus came .
43020025	Accordingly the other disciples kept telling him , " We have seen the Lord . " But he told them , " Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails , and thrust my finger into the print of the nails , and thrust my hand into his side , I will not believe it . "
43020026	A week later his disciples were again in the house , and Thomas was with them . Jesus came , although the doors were locked , and stood there among and said . " Peace to you ! "
43020027	Then to Thomas he said . " Place your finger here , and see my hands ; and place your hand here , and thrust it into my side , and become not unbelieving , but believing . "
43020028	Thomas answered him , " My Lord and my God ! "
43020029	" Because you have seen me , Thomas , you have believed , " Jesus told him . " Blessed are those who , without seeing , yet believed . "
43020030	There were then many other signs which Jesus performed in the presence of his disciples , which have not been written in this book ;
43020031	but these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ , the Son of God , and that by believing you may have life in his name .
43021001	After this Jesus showed himself again to his disciples by the Sea of Tiberias . He showed himself as follows .
43021002	There were together Simon Peter and Thomas , called " The Twin , " and Nathanael , from Cana of Galilee , and the two sons of Zebedee , and two others of his disciples .
43021003	Simon Peter said to them , " I am going fishing . " They answered him , " And we are going with you . " So they went out and got into the boat , and throughout the night they caught nothing .
43021004	But when day was dawning Jesus stood on the beach . The disciples , however , did not recognize that it was Jesus .
43021005	So Jesus said to them , " Lads , you havent any fish , have you ? " They answered him , " No . "
43021006	And he said to them , " Cast your net on the right side of the boat , and you will find . " So they cast it , and now they could not haul it in for the multitude of fishes .
43021007	Then that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter , " It is the Lord ! " On hearing that it was the Lord , Simon Peter girt his fishers coat about him ( for he was naked ) , and threw himself into the water .
43021008	The rest of the disciples came in the boat , for they were not far from shore - only about a hundred yards - dragging in the net full of fish .
43021009	When they got to the shore they beheld a charcoal fire ready laid , with fish on it , and some bread .
43021010	" Bring some of the fish you have just caught , " Jesus told them .
43021011	So Simon Peter went and dragged the net to shore , full of large fish , a hundred and fifty-three of them ; but for all this number the net was not torn .
43021012	" Come and have breakfast , " said Jesus to them . Not one of the disciples dared ask him , " Who are you ? " Knowing that it was the Lord .
43021013	Jesus went and took bread and gave it to them , and the fish also .
43021014	This was the third time that Jesus showed himself to the disciples after he had risen from among the dead .
43021015	When they were through breakfast , Jesus said to Simon Peter , " Simon , son of John , do you love me more than these others do ? " " Yes , Lord , you know that you are dear to me . " he answered . Jesus said to him , " Feed my lambs . "
43021016	He said to him a second time , " Simon , son of John , do you love me ? " He answered , " Yes , Lord , you know that you are dear to me . " " Be a shepherd to my sheep , " said Jesus .
43021017	The third time Jesus asked him , " Am I really dear to you ? " Peter was grieved because the third time he asked , " Am I really dear to you ? " and he answered , " Master , you know all things , you know that you are dear to me . "
43021018	" Feed my sheep , " said Jesus . " In solemn truth I tell you that when you were young , you used to put on your own girdle , and walk wherever you wished ; but when you grow old you will stretch out your hands for some one to gird you , and carry you where you do not wish to go . "
43021019	This he said to show by what kind of death Peter was to glorify God . After speaking thus , he said to him , " Follow me . "
43021020	Peter turned around and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following - he who at the supper leaned back upon his breast and said , " Lord , who is to betray you ? "
43021021	On catching sight of him , Peter said to Jesus , " Lord , what about him ? "
43021022	" If I choose that he remain until I come , " said Jesus , " what is that to you ? Do you follow me . "
43021023	Accordingly the report spread among the brothers that this disciple should not die ; but Jesus did not say that he was not to die , but said , " If I choose that he remain until I come , what is that to you ? "
43021024	It is this disciple who bears testimony to these facts and who recorded them ; and we know that his testimony is true .
43021025	But there are also many other things which Jesus did ; if every one of them were to be recorded in detail I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would have to be written .
44001001	My first account , O Theophilus , dealt with all that Jesus began doing and teaching from the beginning down to the day when ,
44001002	after giving instructions through the Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen , he was taken up to heaven .
44001003	After his sufferings he had also shown himself alive to them in many convincing manifestations , revealing himself to them during forty days , and speaking of the kingdom of God .
44001004	And once when he was eating with them he charged them not to depart from Jerusalem , but to wait for the promise of the Father . " Of this , " he said , " you have heard from me .
44001005	" For John indeed baptized in water , but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days hence . "
44001006	So , when they came together , they began to ask him , " Master , are you at this time about to restore the kingdom of Israel ? "
44001007	He answered . " It is not for you to know times and occasions which the Father has fixed in his own authority ;
44001008	" yet you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you , and you are to be my witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea , and in Samaria , and to the very ends of the earth . "
44001009	When he had said this , and while they were looking at him , he was lifted up , and a cloud received him up out of their sight .
44001010	While they were gazing into the sky as he was going up , suddenly there were two men in white garments standing by them ,
44001011	and they said . " Men of Galilee , why do you stand gazing into the sky ? This same Jesus who has been taken up from you into the sky will come back in just the same way as you have seen him going into the sky . "
44001012	Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called Olivet , which is near Jerusalem , about a Sabbath Days journey distant .
44001013	On entering the city they went to the upper room where they were accustomed to meet . They were Peter and John and James and Andrew , Philip and Thomas , Bartholomew and Matthew , James , son of Alphaeus , and Simon the Zealot , and Judas the son of James .
44001014	These all with one mind gave their constant attention to prayer , together with some women , and with Mary the mother of Jesus , and his brothers .
44001015	It was during these days that Peter stood up among the brothers - the whole number of persons present was about one hundred and twenty - and said .
44001016	" Men and brothers , it was necessary for the Scripture to be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit uttered beforehand by the lips of David in regard to Judas who acted as guide to those who arrested Jesus .
44001017	" For he was numbered among us , and he did get his allotted share of this ministry .
44001018	" Now this man bought a plot of ground with the price of his treachery , and falling there headlong he burst asunder and all his bowels gushed out .
44001019	" This fact became known to the people of Jerusalem so that the place was called in their language , Acheldamach , The Field of Blood .
44001020	" For it is written in the Book of Psalms , Let his dwelling-place be desolate ; Let no man dwell there , also , Let another take his work .
44001021	" It is necessary then that , of the men who have been associated with us during the whole time in which the Lord Jesus went in and out among us ,
44001022	from his baptism by John down to the day on which he was taken up from us , one should join us a witness to his resurrection . "
44001023	So they placed two in nomination , Joseph called Bar-Sabbas ( surnamed Justas ) and Matthias ;
44001024	and they prayed , saying . " Thou , O Lord , who knowest the hearts of all men , show clearly which of these two men thou hast chosen to fill the place
44001025	" in this ministry of this apostles from which Judas went out to go to his own place . "
44001026	Then they cast lots for them , and the lot fell upon Matthias , and he was numbered with the eleven apostles .
44002001	When the day of Pentecost was fully come , and they were all together in the same place ,
44002002	there came suddenly from the sky a sound like the onrush of a mighty wind , and it filled all the house where they were sitting .
44002003	There appeared to them tongues , like flame , distributing themselves , one resting upon the head of each one ,
44002004	and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit , and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit was giving them utterance .
44002005	Now there were , staying in Jerusalem . devout Jews from many and distant lands .
44002006	So when this noise was heard , the crowd gathered in bewilderment because each man heard them speaking in his own language .
44002007	The were beside themselves with wonder . " Are not these Galileans who are speaking ? " they exclaimed .
44002008	" Then how is it that each one of us hears them speak his own mother tongue ?
44002009	Parthians , Medes , Elamites , dwellers in Mesopotamia , in Judea , in Cappadocia , in Pontus and Asia ,
44002010	in Phrygia , Pamphylia , Egypt , and the district of Lybia around Cretans and Arabians ,
44002011	we all hear these men telling in our own tongue what great things God has done . "
44002012	All were astonished and bewildered and kept saying to one another , " What can this mean ? "
44002013	But others were saying with jeer , " These men are full of sweet wine . "
44002014	Then Peter , with the Eleven , stood up and addresses them in a loud voice . " Men of Judea and dwellers in Jerusalem , have no doubt about this matter , but listen to what I say .
44002015	" These men are not drunk , as you suppose , since it is only nine oclock in the morning .
44002016	" No , this is what the prophet Joel predicted .
44002017	" In the last days , God says , it shall come to pass that I will pour out my Spirit upon all mankind ; " Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy , your young men shall see visions , your old men shall dream dreams ;
44002018	upon my slaves , both men and women , in those days , will I pour out my Spirit , and they shall prophesy .
44002019	In the sky above I will show marvels , And signs in the earth beneath ; Blood and fire , and vapor of smoke .
44002020	Into darkness shall the sun be turned , And into blood the moon , Ere the day of the Lord come , that great and terrible day .
44002021	And every one who calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved .
44002022	" Men of Israel , listen to these words . Jesus the Nazarene , a man accredited to you by God , through mighty works and wonders and signs which God did by him among you , as you yourselves know ;
44002023	him , delivered up by the settled purpose and fore-knowledge of God , you crucified and killed at the hands of lawless men ;
44002024	but God has raised him to life , having loosed the pangs of death , because it was not possible for death to hold him .
44002025	For David says of him . " I beheld the Lord always before my face ; For he is at my right hand lest I be shaken .
44002026	" Therefore my heart is glad , my tongue exults , my very body also shall pitch its tent in hope .
44002027	" For thou wilt not leave my soul in Hades , Nor give up thy Holy One to see corruption .
44002028	" Thou hast made known to me the paths of life , Thou wilt fill me with gladness in thy presence .
44002029	" Men and brothers , I can speak plainly to you concerning the patriarch David , because he not only died and was buried , but his tomb is among us even to this very day .
44002030	" Because he was a prophet and knew that God had sworn to him with an oath that of the fruit of his loins he would set one on his throne ,
44002031	" he , foreseeing this , spoke of the resurrection of Christ that neither was he left in Hades , nor did his flesh see corruption .
44002032	This Jesus God has raised up , of this we are all witnesses .
44002033	Since he is by the mighty hand of God exalted , and has received from his Father the promise of the Holy Spirit , he has poured forth this which you now see and hear .
44002034	For David did not ascend into heaven ; but he himself said , " The Lord said to my Lord Sit thou on my right hand
44002035	" Until I make thine enemies A footstool under thy feet .
44002036	" Therefore let the whole House of Israel know assuredly that Gods has made him both Lord and Christ , this Jesus whom you have crucified . "
44002037	When they heard these words they were stung to the heart , and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles . " Men and brothers , what shall we do ? "
44002038	" Repent , " answered Peter , " and be baptized , every one of you , in the name of Jesus Christ , for the remission of your sins , and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit .
44002039	" For the promise belongs to you and to your children and to all who are afar off , whomever the Lord may call . "
44002040	With many other words he continued to bear testimony , and kept entreating them , saying , " Save yourselves from this perverse generation . "
44002041	Then those who welcomed his message were baptized , and in that day about three thousand souls were added to them ;
44002042	and they stedfastly continued in the teaching of the apostles , and in the fellowship , in the breaking of the bread , and in the prayers .
44002043	And awe came upon every soul , and many wonders and signs were wrought by the apostles .
44002044	And all the believers were together , and had all things in common .
44002045	They would sell their lands and other property , and distribute the proceeds among all , just as any one from time had need .
44002046	Day after day they continued stedfastly with one accord in the Temple ; and breaking bread together in their own homes , they continued to eat their food with gladness and an undivided heart ,
44002047	praising God , and looked on with favor by all the people . Meanwhile the Lord kept adding to them daily those that were being saved .
44003001	One day Peter and John were going up together for the hour of prayer , at three in the afternoon ,
44003002	when a man lame from his birth was carried along , who was wont to be laid each day near the gate of the Temple called the Beautiful Gate , to ask alms of those who were going into the Temple .
44003003	When he saw Peter and John about to go into the Temple , he kept asking them for alms ;
44003004	Peter fixed his eyes upon him , as did John , and said , " Look at us . "
44003005	So he waited , expecting to get something from them . Then Peter said .
44003006	" I have neither silver nor gold , but what I do have , this I am going to give to you ; in the name of Jesus Christ , the Nazarene , walk ! "
44003007	Then taking his right hand he lifted him up . Instantly his feet and ankle-bones were strengthened ;
44003008	and leaping forth he stood on his feet , and began to walk , and went with them into the Temple , walking , and leaping , and praising God .
44003009	When all the people saw him walking and praising God ,
44003010	and recognized that this was the man who used to sit and beg at the Beautiful Gate of the Temple , they were filled with awe and amazement at what had happened to him .
44003011	While he was clinging to Peter and John , all the people crowded awe-struck around them , in what was known as Solomons Portico .
44003012	When he saw this , Peter said to the people . " Men of Israel , why are you wondering at this ? Why do you stare at us , as if by our own power or piety we had made this man to walk ?
44003013	" The God of Abram , Isaac , and Jacob , the God of our fathers , has glorified his Servant Jesus , whom you betrayed and disowned before Pilate , when he had decided to let him go ;
44003014	" but you disowned the holy and righteous One , and asked as a favor the release of a murderer .
44003015	" The Pioneer of Life you put to death . But God has raised him from the dead , and we are witnesses of that fact .
44003016	" And his name , on the ground of faith in his name , has made strong this man , whom you now see and know ; yes , the faith that is through him has made this man sound and strong again , in the presence of you all .
44003017	" And now , brothers , I know that you did it in ignorance , as did also your rulers .
44003018	" But God has thus fulfilled what he foretold by the mouth of all the prophets , that his Christ should suffer .
44003019	" Repent then ! and reform , from the blotting out of your sins , so that there may come times of refreshing from the presence of the Lord ;
44003020	" and that he may send Jesus , your appointed Messiah ,
44003021	" whom the heavens must receive until the time of restoration of all things . " God spoke of this ages ago , through the mouth of his holy prophets .
44003022	" Moses , for example , said . " The Lord your God will raise up a Prophet for you from among your brothers , as he raised up me ; you must listen to whatever he may tell you ;
44003023	" and it shall be that every soul who will not listen to that Prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people .
44003024	" Yes , and all the prophets from Samuel and his successors , all that have spoken , have also told of those days .
44003025	" You are the sons of the prophets , and of the covenant which God made with your fathers , saying to Abraham , " And in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed .
44003026	" It was for you first that God raised up his Servant , and sent him to bless you in turning every one of you away from your wicked ways . "
44004001	While they were addressing the people the priests , the commander of the Temple , and the Sadducees came upon them ,
44004002	incensed at their teaching the people , and proclaiming , in the case of Jesus , the resurrection from the dead .
44004003	They arrested them , and put them in prison till the next day , for it was already evening .
44004004	But many of those who had heard the message believed , and the number of the men came to be about five thousand .
44004005	There was held in Jerusalem , next morning , a meeting of their rulers , the elders and scribes ,
44004006	and Annas , the high priest , Caiaphas , John , Alexander , and all the members of the high priests family were present .
44004007	Then they made the men stand before them and demanded , " By what power , or in what name , have you fellows done this ? "
44004008	Then Peter , filled with the Holy Spirit , answered them .
44004009	" Rulers and elders of the people , if we are being examined today concerning a benefit conferred upon a cripple , as to how has this man been cured ,
44004010	" be it known to all of you , and to all the people of Israel , that in the name of Jesus Christ , the Nazarene , whom you crucified , whom God raised from the dead , in him does this man stand before you strong and well .
44004011	" For he is the Stone , cast aside by you builders , which has become the head stone of the corner .
44004012	" There is no salvation in any other , for there is no other name under heaven given among men , in which we must be saved . "
44004013	Now when they beheld the glad fearlessness of Peter and John and had perceived that they were amazed ; and they began to recognize them , that they were companions of Jesus .
44004014	But since they saw the man standing with them who had been healed , they had nothing to answer .
44004015	So they bade them withdraw from the Sanhedrin , while they conferred together .
44004016	" What , " said they , " shall we do with these men ? For it is well known throughout Jerusalem that a notable miracle has been performed by them , and we cannot deny it .
44004017	" But that the matter may spread no further among the people , let us threaten them not to speak to any one hereafter about this name . "
44004018	So they summoned them , and ordered them not to speak at all , nor to teach in the name of Jesus .
44004019	But Peter and John said in reply . " Do you decide whether in the sight of God it is right to obey you rather than God ;
44004020	but for our part , we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard . "
44004021	So when they had further threatened them they let the apostles go , being quite unable to find any way of punishing them because of the people , for everybody was glorifying God over what had happened .
44004022	For the man on whom this miracle of healing had been wrought was over forty years old .
44004023	As soon as the apostles were released , they went to their friends , and told what the high priests and elders had said .
44004024	And when they heard it they all lifted up their voices in prayer to God , saying . " O Sovereign Lord , who madest heaven and earth and sea , and all that in them is ,
44004025	" who saidest through the Holy Spirit , by the lips of thy servant David , our forefather . " Why did the Gentiles rage , And the peoples form futile plans ?
44004026	" The kings of the earth set themselves in array , And the rulers were gathered together Against the Lord and against his Christ .
44004027	" In this very city they did gather together against thy holy Servant , Jesus whom thou hast anointed - Herod and Pontius Pilate , with the Gentiles and also the tribes of Israel -
44004028	" to do all that thy power and thy will had predetermined should be done .
44004029	" And now Lord , listen to their threats , and grant to thy slaves to proclaim thy message with all boldness ,
44004030	" whilst thou stretchest forth thy hand to heal ; grant too , that signs and wonders may be done through the name of thy holy Servant , Jesus . "
44004031	When they had prayed , the place where they were gathered was shaken ; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit , and began to speak the message of the Lord with boldness .
44004032	Now the multitude of the believers was of one heart and one soul , nor did any one of them say that any of his possessions was his own ; but they had all things common .
44004033	And the apostles continued with great power to give their witness concerning the resurrection of the Lord Jesus , and great grace was upon them all .
44004034	Nor was there any one of them in want , for all who owned houses or lands would sell them and bring the price of the things that were sold , and lay it at the apostles feet ;
44004035	and distribution would be made to each according to his need .
44004036	In this way Joseph , whom the apostles called Barnabas ( " Son of Encouragement " is what it means ) , who was a native Cyprus ,
44004037	sold a farm which he had , and brought the price , and laid it at the apostles feet .
44005001	But a man named Ananias who , with his wife Sapphira , sold a farm of his ,
44005002	kept back some of the purchase price , with the connivance of his wife . He brought only a part and laid it at the apostles feet .
44005003	" Ananias , " said Peter , " why has Satan so filled your heart that you are lying to the Holy Spirit , and keeping back part of the price of the land ?
44005004	" While it remained unsold , was it not your own ? And after it was sold , was not the price at your own disposal ? How could you conceive this act in your heart ? You have not lied unto men , but unto God . "
44005005	As Ananias heard these words he fell down and expired , and all who heard were awe-struck .
44005006	But the younger men rose , wrapped the body up , and carried it out to bury it .
44005007	About three hours later his wife came in , not knowing what had happened ;
44005008	and Peter said to her , " Tell me if you got so much for the land . " " Yes , " she said , " so much . "
44005009	" Why was it , " said Peter , " that you both agreed to tempt the Spirit of the Lord ? Lo , the feet of those who buried your husband are at the door , and they shall carry you out . "
44005010	Instantly she fell down at his feet and expired , and when the young men came in they found her dead , and carried her out and buried her husband .
44005011	And great fear fell on all the church and upon all who had heard it .
44005012	Many signs and wonders continued to be wrought among the people by the hands of the apostles , and by common consent they all would meet in Solomons Porch ,
44005013	but none of the rest dared to associate with them .
44005014	Yet the people continued to hold them in high honor , and more and more believers in the Lord were joining them , both men and women .
44005015	In consequence people would even bring out their sick into the streets , and place them upon beds and pallets as Peter was passing , that at least his shadow might fall upon some of them .
44005016	The people of the towns near Jerusalem also continued to come in crowds , bringing their sick and those who were harried by unclean spirits , and all of them were healed .
44005017	This aroused bitter indignation among the high priest and his followers who were of the sect of the Sadducees ,
44005018	and they apprehended the apostles , and threw them into the public prison .
44005019	But an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors during the night , and let them out .
44005020	He said to them , " Go take your stand in the Temple , and continue to tell the people all the words of this Life . "
44005021	When they heard this they went at early dawn to the Temple , and began to teach . Meantime when the high priest and his followers arrived , they summoned the Sanhedrin and all the Council of the Elders of the sons of Israel , and sent to the prison to fetch the apostles .
44005022	But the officers who went did not find them in the prison ; so they came back and reported ,
44005023	" The prison we found locked fast , with the guards stationed at the doors , but when they were opened we found no one inside . "
44005024	When the officer in charge of the Temple and the high priest heard these words , they were perplexed concerning them , wondering what would come of it .
44005025	And some one came and told them that the very men whom they had put in prison were standing in the Temple , and teaching to the people .
44005026	On this the officer went off with his men and fetched them , not , however , by force , for they were afraid that the people would stone them .
44005027	So they brought them , and stood them before the Sanhedrin . Then the high priest questioned them .
44005028	" We strictly forbade you , did we not , to teach about this Name , and here you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching , and intend to bring this mans blood upon us . "
44005029	But Peter and the apostles said in reply .
44005030	" We must obey God rather than man . The God of our fathers has raised up Jesus , whom you slew by hanging him on a tree .
44005031	" Him God has exalted at his right hand as Prince and Saviour , to give Israel repentance and forgiveness of sins .
44005032	" And we are witnesses of these things , and so is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey him . "
44005033	When they heard this they were infuriated , and were minded to kill the apostles ;
44005034	but Gamaliel , a Pharisee , a teacher of the law , and held in honor by all the people , rose from his seat , and ordered the apostles to be put outside for a little while .
44005035	He said . " Men of Israel , take care what you are about to do with these men .
44005036	" Years ago Theudas arose , claiming to be somebody , and was joined by about four hundred men . He was killed , and all of his followers dispersed and annihilated .
44005037	" After him Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the enrollment , and drew away some of the people after him . He also perished , and all his followers were scattered .
44005038	" And now , I say to you , hold aloof from these men . Let them alone ; for if this scheme or work be of human origin it will come to nothing ;
44005039	" but if it is from God , you cannot put it down ; you may even find yourselves fighting against God . "
44005040	They gave in to him ; and called the apostles in , and after flogging them , released them , with instructions not to speak about the name of Jesus .
44005041	So they left Sanhedrin , rejoicing that they had been deemed worthy to suffer disgrace for the sake of the Name ;
44005042	but not for a single day did they desist from teaching and preaching in the Temple , and in private houses , the Gospel of Jesus , the Messiah .
44006001	Now in these days while the number of the disciples was multiplying , the Grecian Jews began to murmur against the Hebrews , because their widows were habitually overlooked in the distribution of alms .
44006002	Then the Twelve called the general body of the disciples together , and said to them . " It is not fitting for us to leave off preaching the Word of God , and minister at tables .
44006003	" So , brothers , find from among your own number seven men of good reputation who are full of the Spirit and of wisdom , and we will appoint them over this business .
44006004	" But we will give ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the Word . "
44006005	This plan commended itself to the whole body , and they selected Stephen , a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit , and Philip , Prochorus , Nicanor , Timon , Parmenas , and Nicolas , a proselyte of Antioch .
44006006	These men they presented to the apostles who , when they had prayed , laid their hands upon them .
44006007	And the word of the Lord continued to spread ; and the number of the disciples in Jerusalem was increasing exceedingly , and a large number of priests became obedient to the faith .
44006008	Meanwhile Stephen , full of grace and power , wrought great wonders and signs among the people .
44006009	But certain men from the so-called " Synagogue of the Freedmen " and certain Cyrenians , and Alexandrians , Cilicians , and men from Roman Asia , started to dispute with Stephen ,
44006010	but were unable to withstand the wisdom and spirit with which he used to speak .
44006011	Then they instigated some to say , " We have heard him speaking blasphemy against Moses and against God ; " and in this way they excited the people .
44006012	The elders and the scribes rushed upon him , and seized him , and brought him into the Sanhedrin .
44006013	They also set up false witnesses who testified . " This fellow is continually talking against the Holy Place and against the law .
44006014	" For we have heard him say that Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place , and will change the customs which were handed down to us by Moses . "
44006015	Then all who were sitting in the council at once fixed their eyes upon him , and saw his face like the face of an angel .
44007001	And the high priest said , " Are these things so ? "
44007002	Stephen answered . " Listen , brothers and fathers . The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham , when he was in Mesopotamia , before he dwelt in Haran ,
44007003	and said to him , " Leave your country and your kindred , and come to whatever land I will show you .
44007004	" So he left Chaldea and settled in Haran , and from there , after his fathers death , God moved him to this land which you inhabit .
44007005	" But he gave him no inheritance in it , no , not a single square yard of ground ; yet he promised to bestow the land as a permanent possession on him and his posterity - he at that time being childless .
44007006	" What God said was this . " His offspring will sojourn in a foreign land where they will be enslaved and oppressed for four hundred years .
44007007	" And the nation , whichever it is , that enslaves them I will judge , said God , and after ward they shall come out , and they shall worship me in this place .
44007008	" Then he gave him a covenant of circumcision , and under this covenant he became the father of Isaac , whom he circumcised on the eighth day , and Isaac became the father of Jacob , and Jacob became the father of the twelve Patriarchs .
44007009	" The patriarchs out of jealousy sold Joseph into Egypt .
44007010	" But God was with him , and delivered him out of all his afflictions , and gave him grace and wisdom , when he stood before Pharaoh , king of Egypt , who appointed him Governor over Egypt , and over all the royal household .
44007011	" Then there came a famine over the whole of Egypt and Canaan , and great distress , so that our ancestors could not find food .
44007012	" But Jacob heard that there was food in Egypt , and sent our ancestors there on their first visit .
44007013	" On their second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers , and Pharaoh was informed of Josephs parentage .
44007014	" Then Joseph sent and invited Jacob his father and all his family , numbering seventy-five souls , to come to him ;
44007015	" and Jacob went down into Egypt .
44007016	" There he died , and our ancestors also , and they were carried across to Shechem , and laid in the tomb which Abraham had purchased for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor in Shechem .
44007017	" but as the time drew near for the fulfilment of the promise which God made to Abraham , the people multiplied and increased in Egypt ;
44007018	" until there arose a king who knew not Joseph .
44007019	" He dealt craftily with our race , and oppressed our forefathers , by making them expose their infants so that they should not live .
44007020	" In this time Moses was born , a divinely beautiful child , who was brought up for three months in his fathers house .
44007021	" When he was exposed , Pharaohs daughter took him up , and brought him up as her own son .
44007022	" So Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians , and was mighty in his words and works .
44007023	" And when he was forty years old it came into his heart to visit his brothers , the children of Israel ;
44007024	" and when he saw one of them wronged he wrought redress for the one overpowered , by striking down the Egyptian .
44007025	" ( Now he supposed that his brothers would understand how God by his hand was bringing them deliverance ; but they did not . )
44007026	" Next day he came upon two of them fighting , and tried to make peace between them . " Sirs , he said , you are brothers . Why are you wronging each other ?
44007027	" But the man who was ill-treating his neighbor thrust him aside , saying , " Who made you a magistrate and ruler over us ?
44007028	" Do you want to kill me , as you killed the Egyptian yesterday ?
44007029	" Alarmed at this question , Moses fled from the land , and went to live in the land of Midian . There he became the father of two sons .
44007030	" But at the end of forty years there appeared to him , in the desert of Mt . Sinai , an angel in a flame of fire , in a bush .
44007031	" When Moses saw it he was astonished at the sight . But when he drew near to look , the voice of the Lord said ,
44007032	" I am the God of your fathers , the God of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . " And Moses trembled and dared not gaze .
44007033	" And the Lord said . " Take off your sandals , for the place on which you are standing is holy ground .
44007034	" Truly I have seen the oppression of my people in Egypt , and I have heard their groans , and am come down to rescue them ; and now , come , I will send you into Egypt .
44007035	" This Moses whom they refused when they said , Who made you to be a ruler and a judge ? that same Moses we find God sending as a ruler and a redeemer by the hand in the bush .
44007036	" This was he who brought them out , after he had shown signs and wonders in the wilderness , for forty years .
44007037	" It was this Moses who said to the Children of Israel , " God will raise up a Prophet for you from among your brothers , as he did me .
44007038	" This is the one who was in the congregation in the wilderness along with the angel who spoke to him in Mt . Sinai , and with our ancestors to whom he gave living words to hand down to us .
44007039	" To him our ancestors would not be obedient , but thrust him aside , and in their hearts turned back into Egypt .
44007040	" Said they to Aaron . " Make Gods for us who shall march in front of us ! As for this Moses who led us forth out of the land of Egypt , we know not what has happened to him .
44007041	" And they made a calf in those days , and offered a sacrifice to this idol , and began to rejoice over what they had made with their hands .
44007042	" So God turned from them , and gave them up to the worship of the heavenly host , as it is written in the book of the Prophets . " Did you offer unto me slain beasts as sacrifices during the forty years in the wilderness , O House of Israel ?
44007043	No , it was the Tabernacle of Moloch and the star-symbol of the god Rempha that you lifted up - the images which you made in order to worship them ; so I will carry you away beyond Babylon .
44007044	" In the wilderness our ancestors had the Tabernacle of Testimony built , as he appointed who told Moses to make it according to the pattern he had seen .
44007045	" That tabernacle was brought in by our ancestors , in their turn , when they under Joshua entered on the possession of the nations whom God thrust out before them , until the days of David .
44007046	" David obtained favor with God , and asked permission to find a dwelling-place for the God of Jacob .
44007047	" But it was Solomon who built him a house .
44007048	" Yet the Most High does not dwell in houses made with hands ; as said the prophet .
44007049	" The heaven is my throne , And the earth the footstool of my feet ; What kind of house will you build for me ? saith the Lord . Or what resting-place shall I have ?
44007050	Did not my hand make this universe ?
44007051	" Stiff-necked , uncircumcised in heart and ears ! You are always resisting the Holy Ghost ! As your fathers did , so do you .
44007052	" Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute ? They killed those who foretold the coming of the Righteous One , whose betrayers and murderers you have now become -
44007053	" you who received the law , given through angels , and obeyed it not . "
44007054	As they heard these words they became furious and gnashed their teeth at him .
44007055	But he , full of the Holy Spirit , looked up stedfastly into heaven , and saw the glory of God , and Jesus standing at the right hand of God .
44007056	" Look , I see heaven open , " he said , " And the Son of man standing at the right hand of God . "
44007057	With a loud outcry they stopped their ears , and rushed upon Stephen in a body ,
44007058	dragged him outside the city , and stoned him , the witnesses throwing off their outer garments at the feet of a young man named Saul .
44007059	So they stoned Stephen while he prayed , " Lord Jesus , receive my spirit . "
44007060	Then he knelt down and cried aloud , " Lord , lay not this sin to their charge . "
44008001	With these words he fell asleep . And Saul fully approved of his murder . On this very day there broke out a great persecution against the church in Jerusalem , and all except the apostle were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria .
44008002	Devout men buried Stephen , and made loud lamentations over him .
44008003	But Saul was laying waste the church . He was wont to enter into every house , and to drag off men and women , and to commit them to prison .
44008004	So those who were scattered abroad were going everywhere preaching the word .
44008005	Philip went down to the city of Samaria , and began to preach Christ there .
44008006	The crowd with one accord were giving heed to what he said , when they heard and saw the signs that he did .
44008007	For with a loud cry unclean spirits would come out of many possessed by them , and many that were palsied and lame were healed .
44008008	There began to be great joy in that city .
44008009	Now for some time a man named Simon had been practising sorcery in that city , and had amazed the people of Samaria . He gave himself out to be some great person .
44008010	Many from all classes would give heed to him , declaring , " This man is the Power of God , known as the Great Power . "
44008011	They were giving heed to him because , for a long time , he had amazed them with his sorceries .
44008012	But when they believed Philip , who was preaching glad tidings about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ , they began to be baptized , both men and women .
44008013	And Simon himself also believed , and after his baptism he remained with Philip , and was full of amazement as he beheld the signs and striking miracles which were performed .
44008014	The apostle at Jerusalem , when they heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God , sent to them Peter and John .
44008015	Who came down and prayed for them , that they might receive the Holy Spirit ,
44008016	For he had not yet fallen upon any of them ; they had simply been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus .
44008017	Then the apostles laid their hands upon them , and they received the Holy Spirit .
44008018	But when Simon perceived that , by the laying on of the apostles hands , the Spirit was given , he offered them money saying ,
44008019	" Give me , too , this power , so that on whomever I lay my hands , he may receive the Holy Spirit . "
44008020	But Peter said to him . " Your money perish with you , because you have supposed that with money you can obtain Gods free gift ! "
44008021	" You have no part or lot in this matter . " Your heart is not right in the sight of God .
44008022	Repent then of this your wickedness , and beseech the Lord to forgive you this purpose of your heart .
44008023	" For I perceive that you still stand in the gall of bitterness and in the bondage of unrighteousness . "
44008024	And Simon answered , " Pray to the Lord for me , both of you , that nothing which you have said may happen to me . "
44008025	So the apostles , after bearing solemn witness , and declaring the message of the Lord , returned to Jerusalem , evangelizing many Samaritan villages as they went .
44008026	And an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip , saying , " Arise and go on your way south , along the road that runs down from Jerusalem to Gaza , the desert way . "
44008027	So he arose and went . And behold an Ethiopian man , a eunuch , who was a high official ( a chief treasurer ) of Candace , the queen of Ethiopia , who had come to Jerusalem to worship
44008028	Was now on his way home , and was reading the Prophet Isaiah as he sat in his chariot .
44008029	And the Spirit said to Philip , " Go up and join that chariot . "
44008030	So Philip ran up , and heard him reading Isaiah the Prophet , and said to him . " Do you understand what you are reading ? "
44008031	The eunuch answered , " Why , how can I unless someone shall show me the way ? " And he begged Philip to get up and sit with him .
44008032	Now the portion of Scripture which he was reading was as follows . He was led a sheep to the slaughter ; And as a lamb before its shearer is dumb , So he opened not his mouth .
44008033	In his humiliation justice was denied him . Who will declare his posterity ? For his life is cut off from the earth .
44008034	" Pray , " asked the eunuch of Philip , " of whom is the prophet speaking ? Of himself , or of some one else ? "
44008035	Then Philip opened his lips , and beginning from that same scripture , he preached the gospel of Jesus to him .
44008036	And as they were going on their way they came to a certain water , and the eunuch said . " See , here is water ! What hinders my being baptized ? "
44008037	And Philip said , " If you believe with your whole heart , you may . " The eunuch answered , " I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God . "
44008038	And he ordered the chariot to stop ; and both of them , Philip and the eunuch , went down into the water , and Philip baptized him .
44008039	And when they had come up out of the water , the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away , and the eunuch saw him no more , but continued on his way rejoicing .
44008040	Philip found himself at Ashdod . Then visiting town after town , he kept preaching the good news in all the cities until he reached Caesarea .
44009001	Meanwhile Saul , still breathing out threats of murder against the disciples of the Lord , went to the high priest
44009002	and begged of him letters addressed to the synagogues in Damascus , so that if he found any that were of the Way , either men or women , he could bind them and bring them to Jerusalem .
44009003	And as he journeyed , when he was approaching Damascus , suddenly a light from heaven flashed round him .
44009004	He fell to the ground , and heard a voice which said to him , " Saul , Saul , why are you persecuting me ? "
44009005	And he said , " Who are you Lord ? "
44009006	" I am Jesus , whom you are persecuting , " he said . " Stand up and go into the city , and there you shall be told what you must do . "
44009007	Meanwhile the men who were his fellow travelers stood speechless , hearing indeed the voice , but beholding no one .
44009008	And Saul got up from the ground , but although his eyes were open , he continued to perceive nothing ; so they took him by the hand and led him into Damascus .
44009009	And he remained there three days , seeing nothing , and without eating or drinking .
44009010	Now there was in Damascus a disciple named Ananias , and the Lord spoke to him in a vision , saying , " Ananias ! " And he answered , " Lo , I am here , Lord . "
44009011	And the Lord said to him . " Arise , go into the street named Straight , and make inquiries in the house of Judas for a man of Tarsus , one Saul .
44009012	He is now praying , and has seen a man named Ananias enter and lay his hands on him to restore his sight . "
44009013	" But , Lord , " said Ananias , " I have heard from many about that man , and how much evil he did to the saints at Jerusalem !
44009014	" In this city , too , he has authority from the chief priests to arrest all those who call upon thy name . "
44009015	" Go , " answered the Lord , " this man is chosen instrument of mine to bear my name before the nations and their kings , and before the Children of Israel also ;
44009016	" for I am going to show him all he has to suffer for the sake of my name . "
44009017	And so Ananias went and entered into the house , and laying his hands on him , said , " Brother Saul , the Lord , even Jesus , who appeared to you on your journey , has sent me that you may receive your sight , and be filled with the Holy Spirit . "
44009018	Instantly something like scales fell from his eyes , and he received his sight . He arose and was baptized .
44009019	Afterward he took food and was strengthened . And he remained for some time with the disciples at Damascus .
44009020	And he began at once to proclaim in the synagogues Jesus as the Son of God .
44009021	His hearers were all astonished , and began to say . " Is not this the very man who in Jerusalem made havoc of those who called upon the Name ? Did he not come hither for the express purpose of carrying them all in chains to the high priests ? "
44009022	But Saul gained more and more influence , and kept putting the Jews who lived in Damascus to confusion by his proof that Jesus was the Christ .
44009023	And when many days were fulfilled the Jews made a plot to kill Saul ;
44009024	but information of their plot was given Saul , and although they kept watch day and night on the gates , in order to make away with him ,
44009025	his disciples took him by night , and let him down over the wall , lowering him in a basket .
44009026	So he came to Jerusalem , and attempted to join the disciples , but they were all afraid of him , because they did not believe that he was a disciple .
44009027	But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles , and told them how Saul had seen the Lord in the way , and that he had spoken to him ; and also how he had preached the Name of the Lord Jesus boldly at Damascus .
44009028	Henceforth Saul was one of them , going in and out of the city , and speaking fearlessly in the Name of the Lord .
44009029	He also used to hold conversations and debates with the Grecian Jews , but they kept trying to kill him .
44009030	When they learned this the brothers took him down to Caesarea , and then sent him forth to Tarsus .
44009031	Now throughout the whole of Judea , Galilee , and Samaria the Church continued to enjoy peace and to be spiritually built up . It was increasing in members also , as it kept walking in the fear of the Lord , and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit .
44009032	Now Peter , as he was going from town to town , came down also to the saints who lived in Lydda .
44009033	Here he found a man named Aeneas , bedridden for eight years , a paralytic .
44009034	Peter said to him . " Aeneas , Jesus Christ cures you ! Rise and make your own bed ! "
44009035	At once he rose to his feet . All the people of Lydda and Sharon saw him , and they turned to the Lord .
44009036	Among the disciples at Joppa was a woman named Tabitha - which may be translated Dorcas or " Gazelle " - a woman whose life was full of good works and almsgiving , which she was doing continually .
44009037	She , as it happened , was taken ill just at that time , and died . After washing her body , they laid it in an upper room .
44009038	And as Lydda was near Joppa , the disciples , when they heard that Peter was there , sent two men to him with the entreaty , " Delay not to come to us . "
44009039	So Peter arose and went with them . On his arrival they took him up-stairs , and all the widows stood near him , weeping , and showing him the cloaks and garments which Dorcas used to make , while she was still with them .
44009040	But Peter put them all out , and kneeled down , and prayed ; and then turning to the body , he said , " Tabitha , rise ! " She opened her eyes , and on seeing Peter she sat up .
44009041	Then he gave her his hand and raised her up , and after calling the saints and the widows , he gave her back to them alive .
44009042	This incident became known throughout Joppa , and many believed in the Lord .
44009043	Peter stayed for some time in Joppa , lodging in the house of Simon , the tanner .
44010001	Now there was at Caesarea a man named Cornelius , a captain in the Italian regiment .
44010002	He was a devout man and God-fearing , and so were all his household . He gave many alms to the people , and constantly prayed to God .
44010003	About three oclock one afternoon he had a vision , and distinctly saw an angel of God enter his house and say to him , " Cornelius . "
44010004	He stared at him in terror , and said , " What is it , Lord ? " " Your prayers and your alms have risen for a memorial before God , " answered the angel ;
44010005	" and now send men to Joppa and fetch one Simon , who is called Peter .
44010006	" He is staying as a guest with Simon , a tanner , whose house is near the sea . "
44010007	And after the angel who was speaking to him was gone , he called two of his household servants and a devout soldier who was in constant attendance upon him ,
44010008	and after telling them everything , he sent them to Joppa .
44010009	The next day , while they were still on their way and were approaching the town , about noon , Peter went up to the housetop to pray .
44010010	He had become very hungry and longed for food ; but while they were preparing it , he fell into a trance .
44010011	He beheld the sky opened , and a vessel descending like an enormous sail let down to earth by four corners .
44010012	In it were all kinds of quadrupeds and creeping things of the earth , and wild birds .
44010013	A voice came to him , saying , " Rise , Peter , kill and eat . "
44010014	" Not so , my Lord , " answered Peter , " for I have never yet eaten anything common and unclean . "
44010015	And again a second time came to him a voice , saying , " What God has cleansed you must not call common . "
44010016	This happened three times ; and immediately the sail was drawn up into the sky .
44010017	Now while Peter was greatly perplexed to know what the vision which he had been sent by Cornelius , and had made inquiries for the house of Simon , stood at the gate ,
44010018	and called and asked whether Simon who was called Peter was lodging there .
44010019	So the Spirit said to Peter , who was still pondering over the vision .
44010020	" Three men are now looking for you . Rise , go down and go with them , nothing doubting ; for it is I who have sent them . "
44010021	So Peter went down to the men and said . " I am the man you are looking for . What is the reason of your coming ? "
44010022	" Cornelius , " they answered , " a captain , a devout man , and God-fearing , of whom the whole , Jewish nation speaks well , was instructed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house , and to listen to your message . "
44010023	So he invited them in and gave them lodging . The next day he rose , and went off with them , and some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied them ;
44010024	and the day after that they reached Caesarea . There Cornelius was waiting for them , and had brought together all his relatives and intimate friends .
44010025	When Peter entered the house Cornelius met him , fell at his feet , and worshiped him ;
44010026	but Peter lifted him up . " Stand up , " he said , " I am only a man , myself . "
44010027	And as he talked with him , he went in and found a large company assembled .
44010028	To them he said . " You know , yourselves , that it is illegal for a Jew to associate with or to visit one of another nation ; but God has taught me that I should not call any man common or unclean . For this reason , when sent for , I came without demur .
44010029	" I ask therefore why you sent for me . "
44010030	Cornelius answered . " Three days ago , at this very hour , I was praying in my house at three oclock in the afternoon , when suddenly a man in a shining robe stood by me ,
44010031	and said . " Cornelius , your prayer is heard , and your alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God .
44010032	" So send to Joppa and summon Simon , who is called Peter . He is lodging with Simon the tanner , in a house by the seaside .
44010033	" So I sent for you without delay , and you have been kind enough to come . Now therefore we are all here present in the sight of God , to listen to what the Lord has commanded you to speak . "
44010034	Then Peter began to speak . " Of a truth I begin to see quite plainly that God is no respecter of persons ;
44010035	" but in every nation he who fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him .
44010036	" You cannot but know the message which he sent to the descendants of Israel , when he preached the gospel of peace by Jesus Christ who is Lord of all ;
44010037	" you know the message spread throughout all Judea , beginning in Galilee , after the baptism which John preached ;
44010038	" how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power , and how he went about everywhere doing good , and curing all who were oppressed by the devil ; for God was with him .
44010039	" And we were witnesses of all that he did , both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem . They killed him , hanging him on a tree .
44010040	" But him God raised up on the third day , and permitted him to be made manifest ,
44010041	" not to all the people , but to witnesses - men previously chosen by God - that is , to us , who ate and drank with him after he had risen from the dead ;
44010042	" when he charged us to preach to the people , and to testify that this was he whom God ordained to be the judge of the living and of the dead .
44010043	" To him all the prophets bear witness , testifying that through his name every one that believes on him will receive remission of sins . "
44010044	While Peter was still speaking , the Holy Spirit fell on all who were listening to the message .
44010045	And all the Jewish believers who had accompanied Peter were amazed , because the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out upon the Gentiles also .
44010046	For they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God .
44010047	Then Peter said , " Can any one refuse water for the baptism of these men who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we ? "
44010048	And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ . Then they begged him to remain with them for a time .
44011001	Now the apostles and the brothers that were in Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God ;
44011002	so , when Peter came up to Jerusalem , the circumcision party disputed with him ,
44011003	saying , " You went into the houses of the uncircumcised and ate with them ! "
44011004	Then Peter began and explained the whole matter to them in order , saying .
44011005	" I was in the city of Joppa , praying , and while in a trance I saw a vision ; a certain vessel descending , what seemed to be an enormous sail let down to me ,
44011006	and while I gazed at it , I examined it carefully , and saw the quadrupeds of the earth and the wild beasts and creeping things and the wild birds .
44011007	I also heard a voice saying to me , Rise , Peter , kill and eat .
44011008	" Not so , my Lord said I , for nothing common or unclean has ever gone into my mouth .
44011009	" But for the second time a voice spoke from the sky , What God has cleansed , you must not call common .
44011010	" This was said three times , and then everything was drawn up again into the sky .
44011011	" And lo ! at that very moment , three men who had been sent for me from Caesarea stood before the house in which I was .
44011012	" And the Spirit bade me accompany them without misgiving . There also accompanied me these six brothers , and we went into the mans house .
44011013	" Then he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying . " Send to Joppa and fetch Simon who is also called Peter .
44011014	" He will speak words to you by which you and all your family will be saved .
44011015	" And , " said Peter , " as soon as I began to speak , the Holy Spirit fell upon them , just as he fell upon us at the beginning .
44011016	" Then I remembered the words of the Lord , how he used to say , " John indeed baptized in water , but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit .
44011017	" So if God gave them the same gift as he gave to us , when we first believed on the Lord Jesus Christ , who was I that I could withstand God ? "
44011018	On hearing this they held their peace and glorified God , saying , " Forsooth then , to the Gentiles also God has granted repentance unto life . "
44011019	Then those who had been scattered by the trouble that arose over Stephen , traveled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch ; but they preached the word to none except Jews .
44011020	Some of them , however , were Cyprians and Cyrenaeans , who , on reaching Antioch , began to tell the Greeks also the Good News concerning the Lord Jesus .
44011021	The hand of the Lord was with them , and a great number who believed turned to the Lord .
44011022	When news of this reached the ears of the church at Jerusalem , they sent Barnabas as far as Antioch .
44011023	When he arrived , and saw the grace of God , he was glad , and he encouraged them all to remain faithful to the Lord , with full purpose of heart ;
44011024	for he was a good man , and full of faith and the Holy Spirit . And a great multitude was added to the Lord .
44011025	Then Barnabas visited Tarsus , to try to find Saul ,
44011026	and when he had found him he brought him to Antioch , where for a whole year they were guests of the church , and taught many people . And it was in Antioch that the disciples first received the name of " Christians . "
44011027	At that time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch .
44011028	One of them , who was Agabus , rose up , and being instructed by the Spirit , predicted that a great famine was about to come upon the whole inhabited earth . ( It came in the reign of Claudius . )
44011029	So the disciples decided to send relief , every man according to his means , to the brothers in Judea .
44011030	This they did , forwarding their contributions to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul .
44012001	Now , at about that time , Herod the king put forth his hands to ill-treat certain members of the church ;
44012002	and beheaded James , the brother of John , with the sword .
44012003	And when he saw that it pleased the Jews , he proceeded to seize Peter also . ( This was during the days of unleavened bread . )
44012004	He had him arrested and thrown in prison , and put under guard of sixteen soldiers . He intended , after the Passover , to bring him forth to the people .
44012005	So Peter was kept in prison , but earnest prayer to God was made by the church for him .
44012006	Now when Herod was about to bring him forth , on that very night , while Peter was sleeping between two soldiers , bound with chains , and sentries before the door were guarding the prison ,
44012007	suddenly an angel of the Lord stood by him , and a light shone in the cell . Striking Peter on the side , he woke him saying , " Rise up quickly . " At once the chains dropped from his hands .
44012008	" Gird yourself , " said the angel , " and put on your sandals . " He did so . Then he said unto him , " Throw your cloak about you , and follow me . "
44012009	So Peter went out , following him , but did not realize that what the angel was doing was real , but supposed that he was seeing a vision .
44012010	And when they had passed the first guard and the second , they came to the iron gate that led to the city . This opened to them of its own accord ; and they went out passed on through one street ; and suddenly the angel left him .
44012011	Peter , coming to himself , said , " Now I know for a certainty that the Lord has sent his angel and released me from the hand of Herod , and from all that the Jewish people were anticipating . "
44012012	So , after he had thought things over , he went to the house of Mary , the mother of John , surnamed Mark , where a large number of people were assembled , praying .
44012013	When he knocked at the door of the gate , a maid servant named Rhoda came to answer .
44012014	And when she recognized Peters voice , for very joy she did not open the door , but ran in and told them that Peter was standing in front of the gate .
44012015	" You are mad , " they said . But she confidently insisted that it was so . " It is his angel , " they said .
44012016	Meanwhile Peter continued to knock , until at last they opened the door , and were amazed to see that it was really he .
44012017	He motioned to them to keep quiet , and told them how the Lord had brought him out of prison . " Tell all this to James , " he said , " and to the brothers , " and away he went to another place .
44012018	When morning came there was no small stir among the soldiers as to what could possibly have become of Peter .
44012019	Then Herod had search made for him , and could not find him . After sharply questioning the guards , he ordered them off to execution . He then went down from Judea to Caesarea , where he stayed for some time .
44012020	Now Herod was violently displeased with the people of Tyre and Sidon . So they came to him , with one accord , and after conciliating Blastus , the royal chamberlain , they begged for peace because their country depended upon the kings country for its food supply .
44012021	So on the appointed day , Herod put on his royal robes , and after taking his seat upon the throne , began to harangue them .
44012022	" The voice of a god , and not of a man , " the people kept shouting .
44012023	Instantly an angel of the Lord smote him , because he had not given God the glory , and being eaten up by worms , he died .
44012024	But the word of God grew and multiplied ;
44012025	and after discharging their mission , Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem , bringing with them John , surnamed Mark .
44013001	Now there were in the church in Antioch prophets and teachers ; Barnabas and Symeon , surnamed " the Black , " Lucius of Cyrene , Manaen , the foster-brother of Herod the Tetrarch , and Saul .
44013002	And as they were worshiping the Lord , and fasting , the Holy Spirit said to them , " Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them . "
44013003	So after fasting and praying , they laid their hands on them , and let them go .
44013004	So they , sent forth by the Holy Spirit , went down to Seleucia , and from thence they sailed to Cyprus .
44013005	And while they were in Salamis , they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews .
44013006	They had John Mark as an assistant ; and after going through the whole island as far as Paphos , they found a certain Jewish sorcerer and false prophet , named Bar-Jesus ,
44013007	who belonged to the suite of the proconsul , Sergius Paulus , an intelligent man . He summoned Barnabas and Saul , and sought to hear the word of God .
44013008	But Elymas , " the sorcerer , " for that is the translation of his name , opposed them , and tried to divert the proconsul from the faith .
44013009	So Saul , who is also called Paul , filled with the Holy Spirit , gazed steadily at him , and said .
44013010	" O full of all craft and cunning , you son of the devil ! You enemy of all goodness ! Will you never stop perverting the right ways of the Lord ?
44013011	" The Lords hand is now upon you , and you shall be blind , not seeing the sun for a season . " Instantly there fell on him a mist and a darkness , and groping about , he sought some one to lead him by the hand .
44013012	Then the proconsul , seeing what had happened , believed . He was astounded at the teaching of the Lord .
44013013	From Paphos Paul and his party set sail for Perga in Pamphylia ; but John Mark left them and went back to Jerusalem .
44013014	Then they themselves , passing through from Perga , came to Antioch in Pisidia . Here they went into the synagogue on the Sabbath Day and sat down .
44013015	And , after the reading of the Law and the Prophets , the wardens of the synagogue sent word to them . " Brothers , " they said , " if you have any word of encouragement to the people , say it . "
44013016	So Paul stood up , and motioning with his hand , said . " Men of Israel , and you who fear God , listen .
44013017	" The God of this people of Israel chose our forefathers and made this people great , while they sojourned in the land of Egypt . And with an uplifted arm he led them out of it .
44013018	" For about forty years he bore with them in the desert ,
44013019	" and when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan , he gave them their land as an inheritance for about four hundred and fifty years .
44013020	" And afterwards he gave them Judges , until Samuel , the prophet .
44013021	" Then they asked for a king , and he gave them Saul , the son of Kish , a Benjamite for forty years .
44013022	After deposing him , he raised up David to be their king , to whom he also bore witness , when he said , " I have found David , the son of Jesse , a man after my own heart , and who will obey all my will .
44013023	" Of this mans descendants God has brought unto Israel , according to his promise , a Savior , Jesus ;
44013024	" before whose coming John had already preached a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel .
44013025	" And John , when he was finishing his race , repeatedly asked the people . " Who do you suppose that I am ? I am not He . But behold there comes One after me , whose sandal I am not worthy to unfasten .
44013026	" Brothers , sons of Abrahams race , and all among you who reverence God , to us has the word of this salvation been sent .
44013027	" For those who dwell in Jerusalem , and their rulers , because they knew him not , nor the utterances of the prophets which are read every Sabbath , fulfilled them by condemning him .
44013028	" Though they found no cause of death in him , yet they asked Pilate to put him to death .
44013029	" And when they had fulfilled everything which had been written concerning him , they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb .
44013030	" But God raised him from the dead .
44013031	" For many days he was seen by those that came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem , and are now his witnesses to the people .
44013032	" And we bring you glad tidings of the promise made to our forefathers ,
44013033	" how that God fulfilled it for us their children in raising up Jesus ; as it is also written in the second Psalm , " Thou art my son , today have I become thy Father .
44013034	" And as to his having raised him from among the dead , now no more to return to corruption , he has said this , " I will give thee the holy and sure blessings of David .
44013035	" Because in another psalm he says , " Thou wilt not give thy Holy One to see corruption .
44013036	" For David , after he had served his own generation according to the will of God , fell on sleep , and was gathered to his forefathers , and did see corruption ;
44013037	but he whom God raised up saw no corruption .
44013038	" Be it known unto you therefore , brothers , that remission of sins is proclaimed to you through this man ;
44013039	" and that by him every one that believes is justified from all things from which you could never be justified by the law of Moses .
44013040	" Beware , then , lest that spoken of in the prophets come upon you .
44013041	" Behold , ye despisers , and wonder , and perish , For in your days I will do a deed , A deed which you will never believe , Though one should declare it unto you . "
44013042	As Paul and Barnabas left the synagogue , the people earnestly begged that these words might be repeated to them on the following Sabbath .
44013043	When the congregation broke up , many of the Jews , and of the devout proselytes , followed Paul and Barnabas , who talked to them , and urged them to continue in the grace of God .
44013044	On the next Sabbath almost the entire city was gathered together to know the word of God .
44013045	When they saw the crowds , the Jews were filled with jealousy , and began to contradict Pauls statements , and to abuse him .
44013046	So Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly . " It was necessary , " they said , " first to proclaim the word of God to you . But since you push it away from you , and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life , lo , we turn to the Gentiles .
44013047	" For such is Gods command to us , saying , " I have set thee for a light to the Gentiles , That thou shouldest be for salvation to the uttermost part of the earth . "
44013048	When the Gentiles heard this , they were glad , and glorified the word of the Lord , and all who had been ordained to eternal life , believed .
44013049	So the Lords message went far and wide , through the whole district .
44013050	But the Jews urged on the devout women of high rank , and the leading citizens , and stirred up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas , and drove them out of the district ,
44013051	But they shook off the dust of their feet against them , and came to Iconium .
44013052	As for the disciples , they were continually filled with joy , and with the Holy Spirit .
44014001	In Iconium it happened that they went together to the synagogue of the Jews , and so spoke that a great number both of Jews and of Gentiles believed .
44014002	But the disobedient Jews stirred up the souls of the Gentiles , and embittered them against them against the brothers .
44014003	Long time , therefore , they tarried there , speaking fearlessly in the Lord , who attested the word of his grace by permitting signs and wonders to be performed by their hands .
44014004	But the mass of the citys people was divided ; part held with the Jews , and part with the apostles .
44014005	And when both the Gentiles and the Jews with their ruler made a hostile move to maltreat and to stone them ,
44014006	the apostles got wind of it , and made their escape to the Lycaonian towns of Derbe and Lystra and the neighboring country .
44014007	And there they continued to proclaim the gospel .
44014008	Now at Lystra there used to sit a certain man , lame in his feet , a cripple from birth , who had never walked .
44014009	He was listening while Paul was preaching , and Paul , looking intently at him , and perceiving that he had faith to be made whole ,
44014010	said in a loud voice , " Stand upright on your feet ! "
44014011	And he sprang up and began to walk about . Then the crowds , when they saw what Paul had done , shouted in the Lycaonian tongue , saying , " The gods are come down to us in human form . "
44014012	And they began to call Barnabas " Zeus , " and Paul , since he was the principal speaker , " Hermes " ;
44014013	and the priest of Zeus , whose temple was at the entrance to the city , brought oxen and garlands to the gates , and along with the crowds was about to offer sacrifices .
44014014	But when the apostles , Paul and Barnabas , heard of it , they rent their garments and rushed out among the crowd , shouting and crying .
44014015	" Men , why are you doing all this ? We also are men , with natures like your own ! We are bringing you good tidings , that you are to turn from these empty things to the living God , who made heaven and earth and the sea and all that in them is .
44014016	In bygone generations he allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways ,
44014017	and yet he left not himself without witness , in that he did good , and gave you rain from heaven and fruitful seasons , filling your hearts with food and gladness . "
44014018	Even with saying this they with difficulty restrained the crowds from sacrificing to them .
44014019	And now a party of Jews came down form Antioch and Iconium , and after persuading the crowds , they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city , supposing him to be dead .
44014020	But as the disciples collected around him , he rose and went back into the city . The next day he went off with Barnabas into Derbe ;
44014021	and after preaching the gospel to that town , and winning many converts , they went back to Lystra and Iconium and Antioch ,
44014022	Everywhere they strengthened the souls of the disciples , encouraging them to hold to the faith . " It is through many tribulations , " they said , " that we must enter into the kingdom of God . "
44014023	They chose elders for them in every church , after prayer and fasting , and commended them to the Lord in whom they had believed .
44014024	Then passing through Pisidia they came to Pamphylia and ,
44014025	after preaching the word in Perga , they came down to Attaleia .
44014026	Thence they sailed to Antioch , from whence they had been commended to the grace of God , for the work which they had now completed .
44014027	On their arrival they assembled the church and reported all things that God had done through them , and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles .
44014028	And they tarried no little time with the disciples .
44015001	But some men came down from Judea and attempted to teach the brethren , saying , " Unless you are circumcised according to Moses custom , you cannot be saved . "
44015002	Now when dispute and controversy sprang up between them and Paul and Barnabas , the brethren appointed Paul and Barnabas , and certain others , to go up to Jerusalem to see the apostles and elders about this question .
44015003	So the church saw them off on their journey , and they passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria . Here they set forth the conversion of the Gentiles , and brought great joy to all the brothers .
44015004	Upon their arrival in Jerusalem they were received by the church and the apostles and elders , and they told them all things that God had done with them .
44015005	But certain men who had belonged to the sect of the Pharisees , but were now believers , stood up and said , " It is necessary to circumcise Gentile , and to order them to keep the Law of Moses . "
44015006	The apostles and elders met to consider the matter ;
44015007	and after there had been a long discussion , Peter rose and said . " Brothers , you know how a good while ago God made choice among you , that from my lips the Gentiles were to hear the message of the gospel and believe .
44015008	" And God , who knows the hearts of all , gave this testimony in their behalf , by bestowing upon them the Holy Spirit just as he did upon us ;
44015009	" and he made no distinction between us and them , in cleansing their hearts by faith .
44015010	" Now then , why are you tempting God by laying on the necks of these disciples a yoke which neither our forefathers nor we have been able to bear ?
44015011	" On the contrary we believe that it is by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ that we and they shall be saved . "
44015012	Then the whole assembly remained silent , and listened to Barnabas and Saul as they told the signs and wonders which God had wrought among the Gentiles through them .
44015013	When they had finished speaking , James said .
44015014	" Brothers , listen to me . Symeon has told how God first looked graciously upon the Gentiles , to take out from among them a people to be called by his name .
44015015	" And this is in harmony with the language of the prophets , which says .
44015016	" After these things I will return , And I will rebuild Davids fallen tent ; And I will build again its ruins , And I will set it up ;
44015017	" So that the rest of men may seek after the Lord , Even all the Gentiles , who are called by my name ,
44015018	" Says the Lord , who has been making this known from the beginning of the world .
44015019	" My judgment therefore , is against troubling those who turn to God from among the Gentiles ;
44015020	" but that we should write to them to abstain from the pollution of idols and from fornication , from meat killed by strangling , and from blood .
44015021	" For Moses from the earliest times has had his preachers in every town where he is read aloud , Sabbath after Sabbath , in the synagogues . "
44015022	Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders , together with the whole church , to select some of their number , and to send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas . The men chosen were Judas called Bar-Sabbas , and Silas , leading men among the brethren .
44015023	They took with them the following letter . " The apostles and older brothers send greeting to the Gentile Brotherhood throughout Antioch and Syria and Cilicia ;
44015024	" as we have heard that some of your number who went out from us have troubled you with words and upset your souls , without having received any such instruction from us ;
44015025	" we have unanimously decided to select certain men , and to send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul ;
44015026	" men who have risked their very lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ .
44015027	" So we have sent Judas and Silas to tell you the same things by word of mouth .
44015028	" For it has seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us , to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things ;
44015029	" that you abstain from food that has been sacrificed to idols , and from tasting blood , and from things strangled , and from fornication . Keep yourselves clear from these things and it will be well with you . Farewell . "
44015030	So they , when they had been despatched , went down to Antioch , and after gathering the whole multitude together , they handed them the letter ,
44015031	and when they had read it they rejoiced at the comfort it brought .
44015032	And Judas and Silas , who were themselves prophets , encouraged and strengthened the brothers with many a good counsel .
44015033	After spending some time there the brothers let them go with a greeting of peace to those who had sent them .
44015034	Silas , however , stayed with them .
44015035	Paul and Barnabas also stayed in Antioch teaching and proclaiming the word of the Lord , in company with others .
44015036	And after some days Paul said to Barnabas , " Let is go back and visit the brothers in every city in which we have proclaimed the word of the Lord . Let us see how they fare . "
44015037	Now Barnabas wanted to take with them John , who was called Mark .
44015038	But Paul thought it unwise to take with them one who had deserted them to the Pamphylia , and had not gone on with them to the work .
44015039	So there arose a sharp irritation , so that they parted company ; Barnabas taking Mark with him , sailed away to Cyprus ;
44015040	while Paul chose Silas , and set forth commended by the brothers to the grace of God .
44015041	He went through Syria and Cilicia , strengthening the churches .
44016001	And he came also to Derbe and Lystra , where there was a certain disciple named Timothy , the son of a believing Jewess , and of a Greek father .
44016002	He was well spoken of by the brothers in Lystra and Iconiun .
44016003	Now Paul , wishing that this man should accompany him on his journey , took him and circumcised him because of the local Jews , who all knew that his father was a Greek .
44016004	And as they went on their way through the cities they handed them the resolutions which the apostles and the elders in Jerusalem had ordained for them to keep .
44016005	So the churches were strengthened in the faith and continued to increase in number daily .
44016006	Then they went through Phrygia and Galatia , the Holy Spirit having forbidden them to proclaim the message in Asia .
44016007	When they got as far as Mysia , they attempted to enter Bithynia , but the Spirit of Jesus would not permit it ;
44016008	and so they passed by Mysia and went on down to Troas .
44016009	Here a vision appeared to Paul in the night . There stood a man of Macedonia , entreating him and saying , " Come over into Macedonia and help us ! "
44016010	So when he had seen the vision , we sought at once to go forth into Macedonia , because we concluded that God had called us to preach the gospel to them .
44016011	So we set sail from Troas and ran a straight course to Samothrace . The next day we arrived in Neapolis ,
44016012	and thence came to Philippi , a city of Macedonia , the fore most in its district , a Roman colony . There we stayed for some time .
44016013	On the Sabbath Day we went outside the city gate , to a riverside , where we supposed there was a place of prayer ; and we sat down and talked to the women who had gathered there .
44016014	Among them was a certain woman named Lydia , a seller of purple , who belonged to the town of Thyatira . She , since she was a worshiper of God , listened to us , and the Lord opened her heart to attend to what Paul said .
44016015	When she was baptized , and her household , she urged us , saying , " If in your judgment I am a believer in the Lord , come and stay at my house . " And she compelled us to come .
44016016	Now as we were going to the place of prayer , a certain slave girl met us , who had a spirit of divination , and who brought her masters great gain by fortune-telling .
44016017	She used to follow after Paul and us , crying out again and again , " These men are servants of the most high God , who proclaimed to you the way of salvation . "
44016018	She persisted in this for many days , until Paul , worn out , turned round and said to the spirit , " I charge you , in the name of Jesus Christ , to come out of her . " In that very hour it came out of her .
44016019	But when her owners saw that their hopes of gain were gone , they seized Paul and Silas , and dragged them before the magistrates , into the market-place .
44016020	Then they brought them before the praetors , saying . " These fellows are Jews , who are making a great disturbance in our city .
44016021	" They are teaching customs which it is not lawful for us as Romans to adopt or practise . "
44016022	The crowd , too , rose up together against them , and the praetors , after having them stripped , and after ordering them to be flogged ,
44016023	had many lashes inflicted upon them , and put them in prison , with a charge to the jailer to keep them safe .
44016024	On receiving so strict an order he cast them into the inner prison , and made their feet fast in the stocks .
44016025	But at midnight , while Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God , and the prisoners were listening to them ,
44016026	suddenly there was a great earthquake , so that the very foundations of the prison-house were shaken ; and instantly all the doors were opened , and every ones chains fell off .
44016027	The jailer , roused from sleep , and seeing the doors wide open , drew his sword and was about to kill himself , because he thought that the prisoners had escaped .
44016028	But Paul shouted loudly to him . " Do yourself no harm ; for we are all here ! "
44016029	So he called for lights , and sprang in , and , trembling for fear , fell down before Paul and Silas ,
44016030	and brought them out , saying , " Sirs , what must I do to be saved ? "
44016031	" Believe on the Lord Jesus , " they answered , " and you will be saved , you and all your household . "
44016032	Then they spoke the message of the Lord to him , as well as to all who were in his house .
44016033	And he took them , the same hour of the night , and washed their wounds , and he was baptized at once , he and all his .
44016034	And after bringing them up into his house , he set food before them , overjoyed with all his household in having believed in God .
44016035	But in the morning the praetors sent their lictors with the order , " Let these men go . "
44016036	The jailer reported the words to Paul , saying . " The praetors have sent to release you ; so come out , and go in peace . "
44016037	But Paul said . " They have flogged us publicly , uncondemned , men that are Roman citizens ; and have thrown us into prison . Are they now going to get rid of us secretly ? No , indeed ! Let them come here , themselves and take us out . "
44016038	The lictors reported these words to the praetors , who were frightened when they heard that they were Romans .
44016039	So they came and conciliated them , and after taking them out of prison , begged them to leave the town .
44016040	So Paul and Silas came out of the prison , and went to Lydias house ; and after they had seen the brethren and encouraged them , they left Philippi .
44017001	Now when they had gone through Amphipolis and Apollonia , they came to Thessalonica . Here there was a Jewish synagogue ,
44017002	and Paul , according to his usual custom , went in to them and , for three Sabbath Days , he reasoned with them out of the Scriptures ,
44017003	explaining and quoting passages to prove that the Messiah had to suffer and to rise again from the dead and that " This Jesus whom I am proclaiming unto you is the Messiah . "
44017004	Some were persuaded and attached themselves to Paul and Silas , including a number of devout Greeks , and a large number of the leading women .
44017005	But the Jews , moved with jealousy , called to their aid certain ill-favored and idle fellows , formed a mob , and began to set the town in an uproar . Assaulting the house of Jason , they sought to bring them out to the people .
44017006	And when they had failed to find Paul and Silas , they began to drag Jason and some of the brethren before the politarchs , shouting . " These fellows who have upset the habitable earth are come hither also .
44017007	" Jason has received them , and they all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar , saying that there is another king , one Jesus . "
44017008	Both the crowd and the politarchs were disturbed when they heard this ,
44017009	but when they had taken security from Jason and the rest , they let them go .
44017010	Now the brothers sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea . When they got there they betook themselves to the Jewish synagogue .
44017011	The Jews of Berea were more noble than those in Thessalonica , in that they very readily received the message with all readiness of mind , and day after day searched the Scriptures to see whether these things were so .
44017012	So many of them became believers , and so did not a few Greeks , women of honorable estate , and men .
44017013	As soon as the Jews in Thessalonica learned that the word of God was preached by Paul in Berea also , they came there , and stirred up and troubled the crowds .
44017014	Then the brothers at once sent Paul down to the sea , but Silas and Timothy remained behind .
44017015	Those who were caring for Paul brought him as far as Athens , and there left him , with instructions to Silas and Timothy to come to him with all speed .
44017016	While Paul was waiting for them at Athens , his spirit was stirred within him , when he noticed that the city was full of idols .
44017017	He argued in the synagogues with the Jews and the devout proselytes , and also daily in the market-place with those that met him there .
44017018	A few of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also encountered him again and again . Some were saying , " What has this beggarly fellow to say ? " Others said , " He seems to be a setter forth of strange gods , " because he preached Jesus and the resurrection .
44017019	Then they laid hold of him and brought him up to Mars Hill , saying . " May we be told what this new teaching of yours is ?
44017020	" For you are bringing certain strange things to our ears . We want to know , therefore , what these things mean . "
44017021	( Now all the Athenians and the strangers sojourning there spent their time in nothing else , but to tell or to hear some new thing . )
44017022	So Paul stood up in the center of Mars Hill , and said . " Men of Athens , I perceive that in all respects you are remarkably religious .
44017023	" For as I was passing along and observing your objects of worship , I found also an altar with this inscription , TO AN UNKNOWN GOD . What you are worshiping in ignorance , this I am proclaiming to you .
44017024	" The God who made the universe and all things in it , he , being Lord of heaven and earth , does not dwell in temples made with hands ,
44017025	" neither is he served by mens hands , as though he needed anything , since he himself gives to all life and breath and all things .
44017026	" He has made of one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth , having determined their appointed seasons and the bounds of their habitation ,
44017027	" so that they might seek God , if perhaps they might feel after him and find him , though he is not far from every on of us ;
44017028	" for in him we live and move and have our being ; as certain even of your own poets have said , " For we also are his offspring .
44017029	" Since then we are Gods offspring , we ought not to imagine that the Godhead is like to gold , or silver , or stone , graven by art and device of man .
44017030	" The times of ignorance God overlooked , but he now commands all men that they should all , everywhere , repent ;
44017031	inasmuch as he has fixed a day in which he will judge the world justly , by the Man whom he has ordained , and he has given proof of all this by raising him from the dead . "
44017032	But on hearing of the resurrection of the dead , some began to mock ; but others said , " We will hear you again on that subject . "
44017033	So Paul withdrew from them .
44017034	A few , however , attached themselves to him and believed , among whom was Dionysius the Areopagite , and a woman named Damaris , and some others .
44018001	After this Paul left Athens and went to Corinth .
44018002	Here he found a certain Jew named Aquila , a native of Pontus , who had recently come from Italy with his wife , Priscilla , because Claudius had ordered all Jews to leave Rome .
44018003	Paul came to them , and because he was of the same trade with them , he lodged with them , and worked with them - for by trade they were tentmakers .
44018004	Every Sabbath he used to preach in the synagogue , and tried to persuade both Jews and Greeks .
44018005	And when Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia , Paul was engrossed in his message , earnestly testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah .
44018006	But as they opposed him and abused him , he shook out his garments in protest , and said . " Your blood be upon your own hands . I am clean . From now on I will go to the Gentiles . "
44018007	So he left the place , and went into the house of a man named Titus Justus , a worshiper of God , whose house adjoined the synagogue .
44018008	And Crispus , the warden of the synagogue , believed on the Lord , with all his household ; and many of the Corinthians from time to time listened , believed , and were baptized .
44018009	And the Lord said to Paul in a vision , by night . " Have no fear ; go on speaking , and do not keep silent ;
44018010	" for I am with you , and no one shall set upon you to injure you ; for I have very many people in this city . "
44018011	So he lived there a year and six months and continued to teach them the word of God .
44018012	But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia , the Jews with one accord rose against Paul , and brought him before the tribunal .
44018013	" This fellow , " they said , " is persuading men to offer unlawful worship to God . "
44018014	Paul was about to open his mouth , when Gallio said to the Jews . " If it had been some misdemeanor or wicked villainy , it would have been within reason for me to listen to you Jews ;
44018015	but as these are merely questions about words and names and your own law , you yourselves must see to it . I am not willing to be a judge of these matters . "
44018016	And he drove them from the tribunal .
44018017	Then they all laid hold of Sosthenes , the warden of the synagogue , and beat him in front of the tribunal ; but Gallio took no notice .
44018018	And Paul after remaining in Corinth some time longer , took leave of the brothers , and sailed away to Syria , accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila . As Paul was under a vow , he had his head shaved at Cenchrea .
44018019	When they came to Ephesus he left them there ; but he himself entered into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews .
44018020	When they begged him to stay longer , he would not consent ,
44018021	but said , as he took leave of them , " I will return again to you , if God will . "
44018022	Then , setting sail from Ephesus , he landed at Caesarea ; he went up to Jerusalem and saluted the church , and came down to Antioch .
44018023	After spending some time there , he set out and went through the region of Galatia and Phrygia , in order , and strengthened all the disciples .
44018024	Now a certain Jew named Apollos , a native of Alexandria , a learned man and mighty in the Scriptures , came to Ephesus .
44018025	He had been instructed in the ways of the Lord , and being full of zeal , he used to speak and to teach accurately the facts about Jesus , although he knew only the baptism of John .
44018026	He began to speak boldly in the synagogue ; and when Priscilla and Aquila heard him they took him home and explained to him more accurately the way of God .
44018027	When he wished to cross over into Achaia , the brothers encouraged him , and wrote to the disciples in Corinth to receive him . On his arrival he mightily helped those who through grace had believed ,
44018028	for he powerfully refuted the Jews in public argument , proving to them from the Scriptures that Jesus is the Messiah .
44019001	Now it happened that while Apollos was in Corinth , Paul , after passing through the hinterland , came to Ephesus , where he found a few disciples .
44019002	" Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed ? " he asked them . " No " said they , " we did not even hear that there is a Holy Spirit . "
44019003	" Into what , then , were you baptized ? " he asked . And they said , " Into the baptism of John . "
44019004	" John indeed baptized with the baptism of repentance , " answered Paul , " telling the people to believe on One who was coming after him , namely , on Jesus . "
44019005	When they heard this they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus ;
44019006	and after Paul had laid his hands on them , the Holy Spirit came upon them , and they began to speak with tongues , and to prophesy .
44019007	They were in all about twelve men .
44019008	Then Paul went into the synagogue , and there continued to preach fearlessly for about three months , reasoning and persuading them about the kingdom of God .
44019009	But when some grew hardened and disobedient , and spoke evil of the Way before the crowd , he left them , withdrew the disciples , and continued to hold discussions daily in the lecture-hall of Tyrannus .
44019010	This went on for two years , so that all the inhabitants of Asia heard the Lords message , Jews as well as Greeks .
44019011	God also wrought extraordinary miracles by the hand of Paul ;
44019012	so much so , that handkerchiefs or aprons were carried away from his body to the sick ; and their diseases departed from them , and the evil spirits went out .
44019013	But there were also some strolling Jewish exorcists , who took it upon them to invoke the name of Jesus over those who had evil spirits , saying , " I adjure you by that Jesus whom Paul preaches . "
44019014	There were seven sons of one Sceva , a Jewish high priest who used to do this .
44019015	But the evil spirit answered , " Jesus I know , and Paul I have heard of , but who are you ? "
44019016	And the man in whom the evil spirit was sprang on two of them , overpowered them and prevailed against them , so that they fled out of the house naked and wounded .
44019017	And this became known to all the people of Ephesus , both Jews and Greeks . Awe fell on them all , and the name of the Lord Jesus began to be held in honor .
44019018	Many also of those who became believers used to come to confess and to declare their deeds .
44019019	And some of them who had practised magic arts , collected their books , and burned them in the presence of all . And they counted the price of them , and found it to be fifty thousand silver coins .
44019020	So mightily the word of the Lord continued to grow and to prevail .
44019021	Now after these things were ended , Paul resolved in his spirit to travel through Macedonia and Achaia on his way to Jerusalem . " After I get there , " he said , " I must see Rome , too . "
44019022	So he sent two of his assistants , Timothy and Erastus , into Macedonia , while he himself kept back for a time on his way into Asia .
44019023	Now just at this time , there arose no small commotion concerning the Way .
44019024	There was a man named Demetrius , a silversmith , who made silver shrines of Diana , and brought rich profit to his workmen .
44019025	He gathered them together with others of like occupation , and said . " Men , you know that by this business we make our money .
44019026	" And you see and hear that not only in Ephesus , but almost throughout all of Asia , this fellow Paul has persuaded and turned away many people , by telling them that they are no gods at all who are made with hands .
44019027	" So there is danger not only that our trade come into disrepute , but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana will be brought into disrepute , and that she herself may even be deposed from her magnificence , she whom all Asia and the world now worships . "
44019028	After listening to this they were filled with rage , and cried out again and again , saying ,
44019029	The city was filled with commotion . They rushed like one man into the theater , dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus , Macedonians , Pauls companions in travel .
44019030	When Paul wanted to go in to the people , the disciples would not let him ,
44019031	and some of the Asiarchs , too , who were his friends , sent word to him repeatedly , entreating him not to venture into the theater .
44019032	Now some were shouting one thing , some another , for the assembly was in an uproar , and the majority had no idea why they were come together .
44019033	And they brought Alexander out of the crowd , whom the Jews had pushed forward . And Alexander , motioning with his hand , would have made a defense to the people ,
44019034	but when they saw that he was a Jew they all , with one voice , for about two hours , shouted ,
44019035	At length the recorder got them quiet . " Men of Ephesus , " he said , " who here does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple-guardian of the great Diana and of the image which fell down from Jupiter ?
44019036	" Since these facts cannot be gainsaid , you ought to be calm and do nothing reckless .
44019037	" For you have brought these men here , who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess .
44019038	If then Demetrius and his craftsmen have a grievance against any one , the courts are open and there are the proconsuls ; let them accuse one another .
44019039	But if you desire anything further , it must be settled in the regular assembly .
44019040	For indeed we are in danger of being accused in regard to this days riot , since there is no cause for it , nor shall we be able to give account for this disorderly gathering . "
44019041	With these words he dismissed the assembly .
44020001	After the uproar had ceased , Paul sent for the disciples and , after embracing them , bade them farewell , and started for Macedonia .
44020002	And when he had passed through those districts and encouraged the disciples in many addresses , he came into Greece where he spent three months .
44020003	Just as he was about to set sail for Syria , the Jews laid a plot against him , and he determined to return through Macedonia .
44020004	There accompanied him as far as Asia , Sopater of Berea , the son of Pyrrhus ; and of the Thessalonians , Aristarchus and Secundus ; and Gaius of Derbe , and Timothy ; and the Asians , Tychicus and Trophimus .
44020005	Now these had gone on , and were awaiting us at Troas ;
44020006	but we ourselves set sail from Philippi , after the days of unleavened bread , and joined them five days later at Troas . There we remained for a week .
44020007	On the first day of the week we met for the breaking of bread , and Paul , who was going away the next morning , began preaching to them , and prolonged his discourse until midnight .
44020008	Now there were many lamps in the upper room where we were assembled ,
44020009	and a young man named Eutychus was sitting in a window , overborne by deep sleep , while Paul continued to preach at length . Overcome at last by sleep , he fell down from the third story , and was taken up dead .
44020010	Then Paul went down , threw himself upon him , and embracing him , said . " Do not lament ; his life is still in him . "
44020011	Then he went upstairs again , broke bread and took some food , and after talking with them a long time , even until daybreak , he left them .
44020012	They had taken the lad home alive , and were not a little comforted .
44020013	The rest of us going before to the ship , set sail for Assos , intending to take Paul on board there ; for so he had appointed , because he intended to go by land .
44020014	And when he met us at Assos , we took him in , and came to Mitylene .
44020015	We sailed from thence , and arrived next day off Chios ; and the day after we touched at Samos ; and the following day we came to Mitylene .
44020016	For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus , so as not to spend time in Asia , for he was hurrying to get to Jerusalem , if it were possible , by the day of Pentecost .
44020017	From Miletus he sent to Ephesus for the elders of the church to come to him ;
44020018	and when they arrived , he said to them . " You yourselves know quite well , how I lived among you , from the first day that I set foot in Asia ,
44020019	" serving the Lord with all lowliness of mind , and with tears , and amid trials that befell me through the plots of the Jews .
44020020	" You know that I never shrank from declaring to you anything that was profitable , nor from teaching you publicity and in your homes ,
44020021	testifying both to Jews and Greeks repentance toward God , and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ .
44020022	And now I am going to Jerusalem , bound in the Spirit , not knowing what will befall me there ,
44020023	except that in city after city the Holy Spirit is warning me that bonds and afflictions are awaiting me .
44020024	But I hold not my life of any account , as dear unto myself , if only I may run my race , and accomplish the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus , to attest the gospel of the grace of God .
44020025	And now I know that not one of you among whom I went about preaching the kingdom , will ever see my face again .
44020026	So I testify to you this day that I am clear from the blood of all men ;
44020027	I never shrank from telling you the whole counsel of God .
44020028	Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has appointed you overseers , and be shepherds of the church of God which he has purchased with his own blood .
44020029	I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come among you , and they will not spare the flock ;
44020030	and that from among your own number , men will arise , perverting the truth , to draw away the disciples after them .
44020031	So be on guard ; and remember that for three years I ceased not to admonish you all , night and day , even with tears .
44020032	" And now I commend you to God and to the word of his grace . He is able to build you up , and to give you your inheritance among all those who are consecrated .
44020033	" No mans silver or gold of clothing did I ever covet .
44020034	" You yourselves know how these hands of mine provided for my needs , and those of my companions .
44020035	" In all things I have set you an example , how that so toiling , you ought to help the weak and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus , how he himself said , " It is more blessed to give than to receive . "
44020036	When he had so said , Paul kneeled down , and prayed with them .
44020037	And they all began , with loud lamentations , to throw their arms about his neck , and to kiss him lovingly , again and again ,
44020038	sorrowing most of all for the words that he had spoken , that after that day they should look upon his face no more . And they began to escort him to the ship .
44021001	When at least we had torn ourselves away , and had set sail , we ran a straight course to Cos , and next day to Rhodes , and from there to Patara .
44021002	And when we had found a ship bound for Phoenicia , we went aboard and set sail .
44021003	After sighting Cyprus and leaving it on the left hand , we sailed for Syria , and put in at Tyre ; for there the ship was to unload her cargo .
44021004	We looked up the local disciples and remained there seven days ; and these disciples kept telling Paul , through the Spirit , that he should not set foot in Jerusalem .
44021005	When , however , our time was up , we left and started on our journey ; and all of them , with wives and children , were escorting us on our way until we were out of the city ; then , kneeling down on the beach , we prayed ,
44021006	and said good-bye , and went on board the ship , while they returned home again .
44021007	And when we had finished the voyage from Tyre , we reached Ptolemais , and greeted the brothers and stayed with them one day .
44021008	On the morrow we started for Caesarea , where we went into the house of Philip , the evangelist , who was one of the seven , and stayed with him .
44021009	Now Philip had four unmarried daughters who prophesied ,
44021010	and while we remained there many days , a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea .
44021011	He came to us , and taking Pauls girdle , he bound his own feet and hands , saying , " Thus says the Holy Spirit , so will the Jews at Jerusalem bind the owner of this girdle , and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles . "
44021012	As soon as we heard these words , both we and those who were standing near entreated Paul not to go up to Jerusalem .
44021013	" What do you mean by thus breaking my heart with your grief ? " answered Paul . " For I am ready not to be bound only , but also to die at Jerusalem , for the name of the Lord Jesus . "
44021014	And when he would not be persuaded , we ceased , saying , " The will of the Lord be done . "
44021015	A few days after this we took up our luggage and went up to Jerusalem .
44021016	And some of the disciples from Caesarea accompanied us . They led us to the house of Mnason , a Cypriote , a disciple of long standing , with whom we were to lodge .
44021017	At length we reached Jerusalem , and the brothers there received us gladly .
44021018	On the following day we went with Paul to call on James , and all the elders were present .
44021019	After saluting them Paul rehearsed , one by one , the things that God had done among the Gentiles by his ministry .
44021020	And they , when they heard it , glorified God , and said to him . " You see , brother , how many thousands there are among the Jews , of those who have believed , and they are all zealous for the Law .
44021021	" Now what they have been told about you , again and again , is that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles , to forsake Moses , and not to circumcise their children , nor to follow the old customs .
44021022	" What then ought to be done ? They will certainly hear that you are come .
44021023	" So do this that we tell you .
44021024	" We have four men here under a vow ; associate yourself with them , purify yourself with them , and pay their expenses so that they may have their heads shaved ; then every one will know that there is no truth in the rumors that they have heard about you ; but that you yourself walk orderly obeying the law .
44021025	" As for the Gentile believers , we wrote giving judgment that they should abstain from anything sacrificed to an idol , from blood , from what is strangled , and from fornication . "
44021026	Then Paul took the men , and after purifying himself with them next day , went into the temple to declare the fulfilment of the days of purification , until the offering was offered for every one of them .
44021027	But when the seven days were almost over , the Asiatic Jews caught sight of him in the temple , and began to stir up all the crowd , and laid hands on him , shouting .
44021028	" Men of Israel , help ! This is the man who goes everywhere preaching to everybody against the people , and the Law , and this place . And he has actually brought Gentiles even into the temple , and has desecrated the holy place . "
44021029	( For they had formerly seen Trophimus , the Ephesian , with him in the city , and supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple . )
44021030	The whole city was thrown into uproar . The mob surged together , seized Paul , and began to drag him outside the temple . Whereupon the doors were at once shut .
44021031	While they were attempting to kill him , news came to the tribune commander of the garrison that all Jerusalem was in an uproar .
44021032	At once he took soldiers and centurions , and rushed down upon them . When they saw the tribune and the troops , they left off beating Paul .
44021033	Then the tribune came up and seized him , and ordered that he be bound with two chains . " Who is he ? " he began asking , " and what has he done ? "
44021034	Some among the crowd kept shouting one thing , some another ; and when the tribune could not learn the facts because of the uproar , he ordered Paul into the barracks .
44021035	When was going up the steps , he had to be carried by the soldiers , because of the violence of the mob ,
44021036	for the whole mass of the people were following him , shouting , " Away with him ! "
44021037	Just as he was about to be taken into the barracks , Paul said to the tribune , " May I speak to you ? "
44021038	" Do you know Greek ? " said the tribune ; " Are you not , then , the Egyptian who in days gone by stirred up to sedition , and let into the wilderness the four thousand cutthroats ? "
44021039	" I am a Jew , " answered Paul , " a native of Tarsus in Cilicia , a citizen of no mean city . And I pray you , give me permission to speak to the people . "
44021040	So when he had given leave , Paul stood on the stairs , beckoning with his hands to the people . There came a great hush , and he spoke to them as follows , in Hebrew .
44022001	" Brothers and fathers , listen to the defense which I now make in your presence . "
44022002	When they heard him speaking in Hebrew they became the more quiet .
44022003	" I am a Jew , " he said , " born in Tarsus of Cilicia , but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel , taught according to the strict manner of the Law of our forefathers , ardent for God , even as you all are this day .
44022004	" I persecuted to the death this way , continually binding and delivering up to prisons both men and women .
44022005	" To this the high priest and all the council of elders are witnesses . It was from them that I received letters to the brothers in Damascus , and I was already on my way to bring those also who were there back to Jerusalem , in bonds , for punishment .
44022006	" But when , on my journey , I was nearing Damascus , about noon , suddenly a great light from heaven shone round about me .
44022007	" I fell to the ground , and heard a voice saying to me , " Saul ! Saul ! why are you persecuting me ?
44022008	" Who are you , Lord ? I asked . " I am Jesus , the Nazarene , whom you are persecuting , he answered me .
44022009	" Now my companions , though they beheld the light , did not hear the words of Him who spoke to me .
44022010	" And I said , What shall I do , Lord ? and the Lord said to me , Rise and go into Damascus , and there you will be told about all that you are destined to do .
44022011	" And as I was seeing nothing for the glory of the light , I was led by the hand of my companions , and so came into Damascus .
44022012	" And a certain Ananias , a pious man according to the Law , well thought of by all the Jews who lived there ,
44022013	" came to me , and standing by me , said to me , " Brother Saul , receive your sight " In that very hour I regained my sight and looked up at him .
44022014	" Then he said . " The God of our forefathers has appointed you to know his will ; and to see the righteous One , and to hear a voice from his mouth .
44022015	" For before the face of all men you will be a witness for him of what you have seen and heard .
44022016	" And now why do you wait ? Rise and be baptized , and wash away your sins , calling upon his name .
44022017	" After my return to Jerusalem , and while I was praying in the temple ,
44022018	" I fell into a trance and saw him saying to me , " Make haste and go quickly out of Jerusalem , because they will not receive your testimony concerning me .
44022019	" Lord , I replied , they themselves well know that I was beating and imprisoning in synagogue after synagogue those who believed in you ,
44022020	" and when the blood of your martyr Stephen was shed , I also was standing by and consenting , and holding the garments of his murders .
44022021	" Depart , he said to me , for I will send you forth , far hence , to the Gentiles . "
44022022	Until they heard this last statement , the people were listening to Paul , but now they roared out . " Away with such a fellow from the earth ! He is not fit to live ! "
44022023	When they continued to shout , throwing their clothes into the air , and flinging dust around ,
44022024	the tribune ordered him to be brought into the barracks , and examined under the lash , to learn for what reason the people were thus crying out against him .
44022025	But when they had tied him up with the thongs , Paul said to the centurion who was standing near , " If a man is a Roman citizen , and uncondemned , is it lawful for you to scourge him ? "
44022026	When the centurion heard that , he went to the tribune and said to him . " What are you intending to do ? This man is a Roman citizen . "
44022027	So the tribune came to Paul and asked him , " Tell me , are you a Roman citizen ? " " Yes , " he said .
44022028	" I paid a large sum to get this citizenship , " said the tribune . " But I was citizen-born , " said Paul .
44022029	Then those who were about to scourge him , immediately left him . And the tribune too , was afraid , when he learned that Paul was a Roman citizen , for he had had him bound .
44022030	The next day , as he wished to learn the real reason why the Jews accused Paul , he unbound him , and commanded the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin to come together , and brought Paul down , and placed him before them .
44023001	With a stedfast gaze at the Sanhedrin , Paul said , " Brothers , I have lived with a good conscience before God to this day . "
44023002	Then the High Priest Ananias ordered those who stood near Paul to strike him on the mouth .
44023003	" You whited sepulcher , " exclaimed Paul , " God will strike you ! You are sitting there to judge me according to the law , are you ? And do you command me to be struck , contrary to the Law ? "
44023004	" Do you rail at Gods high priest ? " said the bystanders .
44023005	" Brothers , I did not know that he was the high priest , " exclaimed Paul , " for it is written , Thou shalt not speak evil of a ruler of my people . "
44023006	Then perceiving that half the Sanhedrin were Sadducees and the other half Pharisee , he cried out in the Sanhedrin . " Brothers , I am a Pharisee , the son of Pharisees ! It is for the hope of the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial ! "
44023007	When he said this , there arose a quarrel between the Pharisees and Sadducees ; the meeting was divided .
44023008	For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection , neither angel nor spirit ; the Pharisees affirm them all .
44023009	Then a great clamor arose ; some of the scribes who belonged to the Pharisaic party stood up , and contended . " We find nothing wrong in this man . What if a spirit has spoken to him , or an angel ? "
44023010	But when the dissension became violent , the tribune , fearing that they would tear Paul in pieces , ordered the troops to march down and take him by force from among them , and bring him into the barracks .
44023011	And the following night the Lord stood by him and said . " Be of good courage ; for as you have borne faithful witness concerning me at Jerusalem , so you must testify at Rome also . "
44023012	When day dawned the Jews made a conspiracy , and bound themselves under a curse , saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul .
44023013	And there were more than forty who had sworn this oath .
44023014	They went to the high priests and elders , and said to them . " We have bound ourselves by a solemn oath to eat nothing until we have killed Paul .
44023015	" Now do you and the Sanhedrin ask the tribune to bring him down to you , as though you would judge his case more exactly ; and we are ready to kill him , before he comes near the place . "
44023016	But Pauls sisters son heard of their intended attack , and he went and got into the barracks , and told Paul .
44023017	And Paul called one of the centurions , and said , " Take this young man to the tribune , for he has something to tell him . "
44023018	So he took him , and brought his to the tribune , and said , " Paul , the prisoner , called me to him , and begged me to bring this young man to you , because he has something to tell you . "
44023019	And the tribune took him by the hand , and going aside , asked him privately , " What is it that you have to tell me ? "
44023020	" The Jews , " he answered , " have agreed to ask you to bring down Paul tomorrow to the Sanhedrin , as though they wish to examine his case in detail .
44023021	" Now do not let them persuade , for more than forty men are lying in wait for him , who have bound themselves under a curse , not to eat nor drink until they have killed him ; even now they are all ready , awaiting your consent . "
44023022	So the tribune sent the young man home with the injunction , " Tell no man that you have given me this information . "
44023023	Then he called two centurions to him and said . " Get ready by nine oclock tonight two hundred infantry to march as far as Caesarea , and also seventy troopers and two hundred spearmen . "
44023024	He further ordered them to provide horses on which to mount Paul , so as to bring him safely to Felix , the governor .
44023025	He also wrote a letter in the following terms .
44023026	" Claudius Lysais unto the Most Excellent Governor Felix , greeting .
44023027	" This man Paul had been seized by the Jews , and was about to be killed by them , when I came upon them with the troops , and rescued him , as I had learned that he was a Roman citizen .
44023028	" Anxious to find out why they had accused him , I brought him down to their Sanhedrin .
44023029	" Here I learned that he was accused about questions of their law , but was not charged with anything worthy of death or imprisonment .
44023030	" Now when I received information that there would be a plot against the man , I sent him at once to you , charging his accusers also to speak against him before you . "
44023031	So the soldiers took Paul , as they were bid , and brought him by night to Antipatris .
44023032	Next day the infantry returned to the barracks , leaving the troopers to ride on with him .
44023033	They reached Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor , and also presented Paul before him .
44023034	After reading the letter , he asked to what province he belonged , and when he understood that he was of Cilicia , he said ,
44023035	" I will hear your case when your accusers also are come . " And he ordered him to be kept in custody in Herods palace .
44024001	Five days later , Ananias the high priest came down to Caesarea with some of the elders , and with an orator , named Tertullus . They laid information before the governor against Paul .
44024002	So Paul was sent for , and then Tertullus began to accuse him , saying . " As it is owing to your excellency that we enjoy profound peace , and that the state of this nation ,
44024003	" owing to your wise care , has been improved in every respect and in every place , we accept it with profound thankfulness .
44024004	" But not to weary you too much , I beg of your Excellency to listen to a few words from us .
44024005	" For we have found this fellow a pest , an inciter of insurrection among all the Jews of the empire , and a ringleader in the heresy of the Nazarenes .
44024006	" He even tried to profane the Temple , but we arrested him .
44024007	" Then the chief captain , Lysias came and violently took him from us .
44024008	From him you will be able , by examining Paul yourself , to learn the truth of all these charges we are bringing against him . "
44024009	The Jews also joined in the charge , maintaining that these were the facts .
44024010	Then at a nod from the governor , Paul spoke . " Because I know that for many years you have been a judge in this nation , I feel encouraged to make my defense .
44024011	" For you have it in your power to know that it is not more than twelve days ago that I went up to Jerusalem to worship ;
44024012	" and that neither in the Temple , nor in the synagogues , nor in the city , did they find me disputing with any man or stirring up a crowd .
44024013	" Nor can they prove the charges which they are now bringing against me .
44024014	" But this I confess to you , that I worship the God of our ancestors , according to the Way which they call a heresy , believing everything that is according to the Law , or is written in the Prophets ,
44024015	" and having hope toward God , which these also themselves look for , that there is to be a resurrection both of the just and the unjust .
44024016	" Hence I too endeavor to have a conscience void of offense toward God and men alway .
44024017	" Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation , and to offer sacrifices .
44024018	" While I was thus engaged , they found me in the temple , purified , with no crowd and no uproar . But there were certain Asiatic Jews
44024019	" who ought to have been here before you , and to have made accusations if they had anything against me .
44024020	" Or let these men themselves say what fault they found , when I appeared before the Sanhedrin !
44024021	" Unless it was for this one sentence which I uttered when I stood and cried , It is for the resurrection of the dead that I am on my trial today before you . "
44024022	At this point Felix , who had a pretty accurate knowledge of the Way , adjourned the case , saying to the Jews , " When Lysias the tribune comes down , I will go carefully into the matter . "
44024023	And he gave orders to the centurion that Paul should be kept in custody , but treated with indulgence , and that his personal friends were not to be forbidden to minister to him .
44024024	Some days later Felix came , with his wife Drusilla , a Jewess ; he sent for Paul , and listened to him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus .
44024025	And as he reasoned about morality , self-control , and the future judgment , Felix was terrified , and said , " For the present go on your way , and when I find a convenient season , I will send for you . "
44024026	He was hoping that Paul would give him money , and for this reason he used to send for him often to converse with him .
44024027	But after two full years Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus , and because he wished to curry favor with the Jews , Felix left Paul still in prison .
44025001	Three days after Festus entered his province , he went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem .
44025002	The high priest and the Jewish leaders laid charges against Paul before him .
44025003	They urged him , asking it as a favor , to send for him to Jerusalem . They meant to lay in wait for him and kill him on the way .
44025004	But Festus answered that Paul was in custody at Caesarea , and that he himself was going there soon .
44025005	" Let those then , " he said , " who are in authority among you , go down with me , and if there is anything amiss in the man , let them accuse him . "
44025006	After staying not more than eight or ten days among them , he went down to Caesarea , and the next day , after taking his seat upon the tribunal , he ordered Paul to be brought .
44025007	When he came in , the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him and brought a number of serious charges against him , which they could not prove .
44025008	Paul said in his defense , " I have committed no crime against the Law of the Jews , against the Temple , or against Caesar . "
44025009	But Festus , wishing to ingratiate himself with the Jews , answered Paul and said , " Will you go up to Jerusalem and be tried there by me upon these charges ? "
44025010	" I am standing before Caesars tribunal , " answered Paul , " where I ought to be tried . I have done no wrong to the Jews , as you very well know .
44025011	" If I am a criminal and have done anything for which I ought to die , I do not object to die . But if none of their charges is true , no man can give me up to them . I appeal to Caesar . "
44025012	Then Festus , after conferring with the council , answered . " You have appealed to Caesar ; to Caesar you shall go . "
44025013	A short time after this King Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to pay their respects to Festus .
44025014	And while they tarried many days , Festus laid Pauls case before the king . " There is a man here , " he said , " whom Felix left a prisoner .
44025015	" The chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me about him , when I was at Jerusalem , demanding a sentence against him .
44025016	I told them that it was not the custom of the Romans to give any man up for punishment , before the accused had his accusers face to face , and had opportunity of defending himself against the charges that had been brought against him .
44025017	" So when a number of them came together here , I made no delay , but the next day took my seat in the tribunal , and commanded the man to be brought .
44025018	" But when his accusers stood up , they did not begin charging him with any of the crimes that I was expecting ,
44025019	but they kept quarreling with him about certain matters connected with their own religion , and about one Jesus who had died , but whom Paul affirmed over and over was alive .
44025020	I was perplexed how to investigate such questions , and asked Paul whether he would go to Jerusalem , and there be judged of these matters .
44025021	But when Paul appealed to have his case reviewed for the decision of the Emperor , I ordered him to be detained until I could send him up to Caesar . "
44025022	" I should like to hear the man , myself , " said Agrippa to Festus . Festus answered , " You shall hear him tomorrow . "
44025023	So the next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp , and took their places in the hall of audience , accompanied by the tribunes and men of high rank in the city . At the command of Festus Paul was brought in .
44025024	" King Agrippa , " said Festus , " and all men who are present with us , you see here the man about whom the entire body of the Jews at Jerusalem , and here also , sent to me , crying out that he ought not to live any longer .
44025025	" I could not find that he had done anything for which he ought to die ; but as he himself has appealed to the Emperor , I have determined to send him .
44025026	" Now I have nothing very definite to tell our sovereign about him . So I have brought the man before you all , and especially before you , King Agrippa , in order that , after examination , I may have something to write .
44025027	" For it does seem to me unreasonable to send a person without signifying the charges against him . "
44026001	Then Agrippa said to Paul , " You are permitted to speak for yourself . " So Paul stretched forth his hand and began to make his defense .
44026002	" I think myself happy , King Agrippa , that I am to make my defense before you this day , in regard to all the accusations brought against me by the Jews ;
44026003	" especially since you are an export in all Jewish customs and questions . I pray you , expert in all Jewish customs and questions . I pray you , hear me with patience .
44026004	" The kind of life I have lived from my youth upward among my own nation and at Jerusalem , all that early life of mine , is well known to all the Jews .
44026005	" They know me of old , if they are willing to testify , how that according to the strict sect of our religion , I lived a Pharisee .
44026006	" Today I am standing trial because of the hope of the promise made by God to our ancestors ,
44026007	" a promise which our twelve tribes , earnestly serving God night and day , hope to attain . It is concerning this hope , King Agrippa , that I am accused by the Jews .
44026008	" Why is it deemed incredible by you all , if God raises the dead ?
44026009	" I indeed once thought with myself that I ought to do many things against the name of Jesus , the Nazarene .
44026010	" And this also I did in Jerusalem . Armed with authority from the chief priests , I shut up many of the saints in prison , and when they were condemned to death I gave my vote against them .
44026011	" In all the synagogues also I punished them oftentimes , and tried to make them blaspheme ; and in my mad fury I was pursuing them even to foreign cities .
44026012	" On this errand I was traveling to Damascus one day , armed with authority and commission of the chief priests ,
44026013	" when at noon , as I journeyed , O King , I saw a light from heaven , brighter than the sun , shining around me and around those who journeyed with me .
44026014	" We all fell to the ground ; and I heard a voice saying to me in Hebrew . " Saul , Saul , why are you persecuting me ? It is hard for you to kick against the goad .
44026015	" Who are you , Lord ? I said . " And the Lord said . I am Jesus whom you are persecuting .
44026016	" But rise and stand on your feet , for I have appeared to you in order to appoint you my minister and my witness both of what you have already seen and of those things in which I will appear to you .
44026017	" I will deliver you from the Jewish people , and from the Gentiles to whom I am sending you to open their eyes
44026018	" so that they may turn from darkness to light , and from the power of Satan unto God , in order to receive remission of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in me .
44026019	" So then , O King Agrippa , I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision ;
44026020	" but I proceeded to preach , first to those in Damascus , and then in Jerusalem and throughout all the country of Judea , and also to the Gentiles , that they must repent and turn to God and do deeds worthy of repentance .
44026021	" For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple , and tried to kill me .
44026022	" But having obtained the help that comes from God , I stand even to this day witnessing both to small and great , saying nothing except what the prophets and Moses said should come ;
44026023	" how that the Christ must suffer , and how he should be the first to rise from the dead , and should bring a message of light to the Jewish people and to the Gentiles . "
44026024	As Paul thus made his defense , Festus exclaimed in a loud voice . " Paul , you are raving mad ; your great learning is driving you mad . "
44026025	" I am not mad , most noble Festus , " said Paul ,
44026026	" I am speaking words of sober truth . For the King , to whom I am speaking freely , knows of these matters . I am persuaded that not one of these things has escaped his notice ; for these things were not done in a corner .
44026027	" King Agrippa , do you believe the prophets ? I know that you believe . "
44026028	Agrippa answered , " In short , you are doing your best to persuade me to become a Christian . "
44026029	" Long or short , " answered Paul , " my prayer to God is that not only you but all who are my hearers this day might become such as I am , save for these chains . "
44026030	Then the king rose , and Bernice , and those who were sitting with him .
44026031	When they had withdrawn they continued talking to one another . " This man is doing nothing , " they said , " for which he deserves death or imprisonment . "
44026032	And Agrippa said to Festus , " If he had not appealed to Caesar , he might have been set free . "
44027001	When it was decided that we should sail for Italy , they proceeded to hand over Paul and a few other prisoners to the custody of Julius , a centurion of the Imperial Regiment .
44027002	We embarked in a ship of Adramyttium which was about to sail to the ports of the province of Asia , and put to sea . Aristarchus , a Macedonian of Thessalonica , accompanied us .
44027003	The next day we touched at Sidon . There Julius treated Paul kindly , and gave him leave to visit his friends and refresh himself .
44027004	Putting to sea from thence we sailed under the lee of Cyprus , because the winds were against us ;
44027005	and after sailing across the Cilician and Pamphylian waters , we came to Myra , in Lycia .
44027006	And there the centurion found an Alexandrian ship bound for Italy , and put us on board of her .
44027007	For many days we sailed slowly , and then arrived with difficulty over against Cnidus ; from this point , as the wind did not further favor us , we ran under the lee of Crete , off Cape Salmone ;
44027008	and coasting along with difficulty we reached a place called Fair Havens , not far from the town of Lasea .
44027009	By this time the season was far advanced , and sailing had become dangerous ( for the Autumn Fast was past ) ; so Paul began to warn them .
44027010	" Sirs , " he said to them , " I perceive that the voyage will be attended with injury and serious loss , not only to the cargo and to the ship , but also to our own lives . "
44027011	But the centurion paid greater heed to the master and to the owner than to anything that was spoken by Paul ;
44027012	and as the harbor was ill adapted for winter quarters , the majority advised putting out to sea from thence , to see whether they could get to Phoenix and winter there , a harbor on the coast of Crete facing northeast and southeast .
44027013	And when the south wind blew softly , supposing that they had obtained their purpose , they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete , close in shore .
44027014	But it was not long before a furious wind , called Euroclydon , rushed down from the island ;
44027015	when the ship was caught and could not face the wind , we gave way to it , and let her drive .
44027016	Then we ran under the lee of a little island named Claudia , where with great difficulty we were able to secure the ships boat .
44027017	After hauling it aboard , they used ropes to undergird the ship , and since they were fearful lest they should be driven upon the Syrtes , they lowered the gear and lay to .
44027018	And as we were being terribly battered by the storm , the next day they began to throw the freight overboard ,
44027019	and on the third day with their own hands they threw the ships tackling overboard .
44027020	Then when for many days neither sun nor stars were seen , and a great tempest still beat upon us , all hope that we should be saved was now taken away from us .
44027021	When for a long time they had been without food , Paul stood among them and said . " Men , you ought to have listened to me , and not have set sail from Crete , and so have spared yourselves this injury and loss .
44027022	" But now take courage . There will be no loss of life among you , but only of the ship ,
44027023	" for last night an angel of the God whose I am and whom I serve , stood by me and said .
44027024	" Fear not , Paul ; you must stand before Caesar . Behold , God has granted you the lives of all who are sailing with you .
44027025	" So take courage , men ! I believe God , I believe that things will turn out exactly as it has been told me .
44027026	" But we must be cast upon a certain island . "
44027027	It was now the fourteenth night , and we were drifting through the Adriatic Sea when , about midnight , the sailors began to suspect that they were drawing near to some land .
44027028	So they sounded and found twenty fathoms ; and after a little they sounded again , and found fifteen fathoms .
44027029	Then , fearing lest we should run ashore on the rocks , they threw out four anchors from the stern , and longed for day to come .
44027030	And when the sailors were trying to flee from the ship , and had lowered the boat into the sea under pretext of laying anchors from the bow ,
44027031	Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers , " Unless these men remain on the ship , you cannot be saved . "
44027032	Then the soldiers cut the ropes of the ships boat and let her fall off .
44027033	And while day was dawning , Paul kept urging them all to take some food . " This is the fourteenth day , " he said , " that you have been on the watch , fasting , having eaten nothing .
44027034	" So I beg you to take some food , for this is for your safety . For there shall not a hair perish from the head of any one of you . "
44027035	When he had so said and had taken bread , he gave thanks to God before them all , and broke it and began to eat .
44027036	Then they all cheered up and themselves took food .
44027037	There were in the ship two hundred and seventy-six souls , all told .
44027038	After eating a hearty meal , they began to lighten the ship by throwing the wheat overboard .
44027039	When it was day they tried in vain to recognize the land , but they spied an inlet with a sandy beach , and they began conferring to see whether they could drive the ship into it .
44027040	They cast off the anchors and left them in the sea , and unloosing at the same time the ropes that tied the rudders , they hoisted the foresail to the breeze , and headed for the beach .
44027041	But coming to a place where two seas met , they ran the ship aground ; the bow struck and remained fixed , but the stern began to break up under the violence of the waves .
44027042	Now the soldiers were planning to kill the prisoners , lest any of them should swim off and so escape .
44027043	But the centurion kept them from their purpose , because he wished to save Paul . He gave orders that those who could swim should first jump overboard and get to land ;
44027044	and that the rest should follow , some on planks and some on other bits of wreckage . And so it came to pass that all escaped safe to the land .
44028001	And when we were escaped , we ascertained that the island was called Malta .
44028002	The foreign-speaking people showed us uncommon kindness , for they lighted a fire and made us all welcome , because of the rain and because of the cold .
44028003	Now when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and thrown them on the fire , a viper crawled out because of the heat , and fastened on his hand .
44028004	When the natives saw the reptile hanging on his hand , they began saying to one another , " No doubt this man is a murderer , whom , though he has escaped from the sea , yet justice does not allow him to live . "
44028005	However , he shook off the reptile into the fire and received no harm .
44028006	But they kept expecting him to swell up or fall down dead suddenly . But after waiting a long time , and seeing no harm come to him , they changed their minds , and said over and over that he was a god .
44028007	Now in the neighborhood there were estates belonging to the governor of the island , whose name was Publius . He received us and entertained us for three days courteously .
44028008	It happened however that the father of Publius was lying ill of fever and dysentery . So Paul went to see him and prayed and laid his hands on him and healed him .
44028009	After this all the other sick people on the island came , and continued to be restored to health .
44028010	These loaded us with many honors and , when at last we set sail , they put on board such things as we needed .
44028011	Three months passed before we set sail an Alexandrian ship which had wintered in the island . Its name was " The Twin Brothers . "
44028012	And touching at Syracuse , we stayed there three days .
44028013	From thence , tacking round , we reached Rhegium . Next day a south wind sprang up , which brought us in a day to Puteoli .
44028014	There we found brothers who invited us to stay a week with them . Then we reached Rome .
44028015	From there the brothers , when they heard about us , came out to meet us as far as the Appian Forum and the Three Taverns . When Paul saw them he thanked God and took courage .
44028016	When we finally entered Rome , Paul was allowed to live by himself with the soldier to guard him .
44028017	Now three days later he called the leading Jews together , and when they were come together he said to them . " Brothers , I was delivered a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans , though I had done nothing against the people or the customs of your fathers .
44028018	" Then when they had examined me they wanted to set me at liberty because there was no cause of death in me .
44028019	" But when the Jews objected I was forced to appeal to Caesar , not that I had anything to accuse my nation of .
44028020	This is the reason why I begged you to see and speak with me . For because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain . "
44028021	They said to him . " We neither received any letters about you from Judea nor has any brother come hither to report or speak any harm of you .
44028022	" But we are eager to hear from you what it is that you believe ; for we all know that as for this sect it is everywhere spoken against . "
44028023	So they arranged a day with him and came to him in his lodgings in great numbers . He expounded the matter to them ; testifying to the Kingdom of God , and persuading them about Jesus , from morning till evening , both from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets .
44028024	Some began to believe what he said , but some were unbelieving .
44028025	Unable to agree among themselves , they began to go , but not before Paul had spoken a word to them , saying . " Right well did the Holy Spirit say to your ancestors , through the prophet Isaiah .
44028026	" Go to the people and tell them , You will hear and hear , and by no means understand ; And will look , and by no means see .
44028027	For this peoples heart is grown obtuse , Their ears are heavy of hearing , Their eyes have they closed , Lest they should see with their eyes And hear with their ears , Lest they understand with their heart , And turn again , and heal them .
44028028	" Be fully assured , therefore , that this salvation of God is now sent unto the Gentiles . They will listen to it . "
44028029	When he finished speaking , the Jews departed , and reasoned among themselves .
44028030	After this Paul lived for two whole years in his own rented house , and used to receive all who came to see him .
44028031	He continued to preach the kingdom of God , and to teach about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness , quite unmolested .
45001001	From Paul , a slave of Jesus Christ , called to be an apostle , set apart for a gospel of God ,
45001002	which through his prophets he promised beforetime , in holy writings ;
45001003	this gospel is concerning his Son , Jesus Christ our Lord , who was born of Davids posterity in respect of his bodily nature ,
45001004	but was by his resurrection from the dead instated as Son of God , with power , in respect of his spirit of holiness .
45001005	It is through him , even Jesus Christ our Lord , that I received grace and apostleship to promote obedience to the faith among all the Gentiles , for his names sake ;
45001006	among whom you also are called to be Jesus Christs .
45001007	To all that are in Rome , beloved of God , called to be saints . May God our Father , and the Lord Jesus Christ , bless you , and give you peace .
45001008	First I thank my God , through Jesus Christ , for all of you , because your faith is being proclaimed throughout all the world .
45001009	God is my witness , to whom I render holy service in my spirit in the gospel of his Son , how unceasingly I am ever making mention of you in my prayers ,
45001010	always entreating him that now at length , if such be his will , the way may be made clear for me to come to you .
45001011	For I am longing so to see you , in order to impart to you some spiritual gift , so that you may be established ;
45001012	that is , that I with you may be encouraged by you , each of us by the others faith , yours and mine .
45001013	I want you to know , brothers , that many a time I have planned to come to you - though until now I have been hindered - so as to have some harvest-fruit among you also , even as I have among the rest of the Gentiles .
45001014	To Greeks and to barbarians , to the cultured and to the uncultured , I have a debt to discharge .
45001015	So much as in me is , I am ready to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome .
45001016	FOR I AM PROUD OF THE GOSPEL . IT IS GODS SAVING POWER FOR EVERY ONE WHO BELIEVES . FOR THE JEW FIRST , AND ALSO FOR THE GENTILE .
45001017	FOR IN IT IS BEING REVEALED A RIGHTEOUSNESS WHICH PROCEEDS FROM GOD , FROM FAITH UNTO FAITH ; AS IT IS WRITTEN .
45001018	For Gods wrath is ever being revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who smother the truth by their unrighteousness .
45001019	This is so because that which may be known of God is manifest among them ; for God has made it manifest to them .
45001020	For ever since the creation of the world his invisible nature , even his everlasting power and divinity , has been clearly seen , being perceived through the things that are made . So they have no excuse .
45001021	For although they knew God , yet they did not glorify him as God , nor give him thanks ; but became vain in their reasoning , and their senseless minds were darkened .
45001022	While they professed to be wise , they became fools ,
45001023	and exchanged the majesty of the imperishable God for an idol , graven in the likeness of perishable man , or of birds and four-footed beasts and creeping things .
45001024	So God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity , to the dishonoring of their own bodies ;
45001025	because they exchanged the truth of God for an untruth , and worshiped and served the creature , rather than the Creator who is blessed forever . Amen .
45001026	That is why God has given them up to passions of dishonor ; for on the one hand their women actually changed the natural function of sex into that which is against nature ;
45001027	and on the other hand their men likewise abandoned the natural use of women , and were ablaze with passion for one another ; men with men practising shameless acts and receiving in their own person that recompense of their wrong-doing which necessarily followed .
45001028	And just as they refused to continue to retain God in their knowledge , so did God cast them out to an outcast mind , to do those things which were indecent .
45001029	They were overflowing with every kind of iniquity , depravity , greed , and malice . They were full of envy , murder , quarreling , deceit , and malignity .
45001030	They became whisperers , back-biters , hated of God , insolent , haughty , boastful . They invented sins . They were disobedient to parents .
45001031	They were without sense , without faith , without natural affection , without mercy .
45001032	Though they knew well the ordinance of God , that those who practise such vices are worthy of death , they not only continue to do the same , but were even applauding those who practise vice .
45002001	You are therefore inexcusable , O man , whoever you are , that sits in judgment ; for in judging another you are condemning yourself . You , the judge , are habitually practising the very same things .
45002002	" We know that Gods judgment against those who practise such vices is in accord with the truth , " you say ?
45002003	Very well ; and do you suppose , you who judge those that practise such vices , and are doing the very same , that you will elude the judgment of God ?
45002004	Or do you despise the riches of his kindness and forbearance and long patience ? Do you not know that the kindness of God is leading you to repentance ?
45002005	In your hardness and impenitence of heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath on the Day of Wrath , when the righteous judgment of God is revealed .
45002006	For He will render to every man according to his works ;
45002007	eternal life to those who by patience in well-doing strive for glory and honor and immortality ;
45002008	but anger and wrath upon those who are self-willed and disobey the truth , but obey unrighteousness .
45002009	Anguish and calamity will be upon every soul of man who practises evil , upon the Jew first , and also upon the Gentile ;
45002010	but glory and honor and peace to every man who does good , to the Jew first , and also to the Gentile .
45002011	For there is no partiality with God .
45002012	For all who have sinned without law will also perish without law ; and all who have sinned under law will be judged by law .
45002013	For it is not the hearers of law who are righteous in the eyes of God ; nay , it is the doers of law who will be accounted righteous .
45002014	For when Gentiles , who have no law , obey by natural instinct the commands of the Law , they even though they have no law , are a law to themselves .
45002015	For they show that the work of the Law is written in their hearts , while their conscience bears them witness , as their reasonings accuse , or it may be defend , them ,
45002016	in the day when God will judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ , according to my gospel .
45002017	Now if you bear the name of a Jew , and rely upon law , and boast yourself in God ,
45002018	and know his will , and can test the things that differ ; if you are instructed out of the Law ,
45002019	and are confident that you yourself are a darkness ,
45002020	an instructor of the foolish , a teacher of the young , because you have in the Law the form of knowledge and of the truth - well then , you who are teaching others , do you ever teach yourself ?
45002021	You who are preaching that a man should not steal , do you practise theft ?
45002022	You who keep saying that a man should not commit adultery , do you commit adultery ? You who hold idols in abhorrence , are you plundering their temples ?
45002023	You who are making your boast in the Law , do you habitually dishonor God through your transgressions of the Law ?
45002024	For the name of God is continually blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you , even as the Scripture itself says .
45002025	Circumcision does indeed profit , if you are obedient to the Law ; but if you habitually break the Law , your circumcision is become uncircumcision .
45002026	So if the uncircumcised keeps the ordinance of the Law , shall not his uncircumcision be reckoned equivalent to circumcision .
45002027	And shall not those who are physically uncircumcised , but who keep the Law , condemn you who are a breaker of the Law , although you have a written law and circumcision ?
45002028	For the real Jew is not the man who is one outwardly , and the real circumcision is not outward in the flesh ;
45002029	but the real Jew is one inwardly , and real circumcision is heart-circumcision , spiritual , not literal , praised not by men , but by God .
45003001	What special privilege , then , has the Jew ? Or what is the use of circumcision ?
45003002	Much in every way . First of all , because to them were entrusted the oracles of God .
45003003	Supposing some of them have proved faithless ?
45003004	By no means ! Be sure that God is ever true , though all mankind prove false . As it is written , That thou mayest be found just in thine argument , And gain thy cause when thou contendest .
45003005	But if our unrighteousness thus brings out Gods righteousness , what shall we say ? Is God unrighteous - I speak after the manner of men - when he inflicts his anger on us ?
45003006	Be it far from us ; for in that case how could God judge the world ?
45003007	But if by a falsehood of mine the truthfulness of God has been made to redound to his glory , why am I still tried as a sinner ?
45003008	And why not say ( as I myself am slanderously reported to say ) , " Let us do evil that good may come out of it " ? Such arguments are rightly condemned .
45003009	What then ? Are we Jews in a better position ? Not at all , for I have already charged all , both Jews and Gentiles , with being under sin .
45003010	As it is written . There is none righteous , no , not one ;
45003011	There is none that understands , none that seeks for God !
45003012	All have swerved from the right path ; Every one of them has become corrupt . There is none that practises good , no , not one .
45003013	Their throat is an open grave ; With their tongues they have used deceit . The venom of asps is under their lips .
45003014	Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness .
45003015	Their feet are swift to shed blood .
45003016	Destruction and ruin are in their paths ;
45003017	And the path of peace they have not known .
45003018	Reverence for God is not before their eyes .
45003019	Now we know that whatever the Law says , it speaks to those who are under the Law ; so that every mouth may be shut , and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God .
45003020	For no man will be justified in Gods sight by works of the Law ; for through the Law comes the consciousness of sin .
45003021	But now , quite apart from any law , a righteousness coming from God has been fully brought to light , continually witnessed to by the Law and the Prophets .
45003022	I mean a righteousness coming from God through faith in Jesus Christ , for all who believe . For there is no distinction between Jew and Gentile ,
45003023	since all have sinned and lack the glory which comes from God ;
45003024	but they are now being justified by his free grace through the deliverance that is in Christ Jesus .
45003025	For God openly set him forth for himself as an offering of atonement through faith , by means of his blood , in order to show forth his righteousness - since in his forbearance he had passed over the sins previously committed - to show forth his righteousness ,
45003026	I say , at this present time ; that he himself might be just , and yet the justifier of him who has faith in Jesus .
45003027	Then what becomes of boasting ? It is shut out . What sort of law forbids it ? A law of works ? No , but a law of faith .
45003028	For I conclude that a man is justified by faith , altogether apart from the deeds of the Law .
45003029	Is God then the God of the Jews alone , and not of the Gentiles also ? He is God of the Gentiles also ,
45003030	since there is one God who will justify the circumcised through faith , and by their faith will he justify the uncircumcised .
45003031	Do we then render law invalid through faith ? Certainly not ; on the contrary we make it stand .
45004001	What then shall we say of Abraham , our ancestor in the flesh ?
45004002	For if Abraham was justified by works , he has something to be proud of , but not before God .
45004003	For what does Scripture say ? And Abraham believed God , and it was set down to his account as righteousness .
45004004	Now if a man earn his pay by his work , it is not counted to him as a favor , but it is paid him as a debt ;
45004005	but a man who does not " work , " but believes in him who justifies the ungodly , has his faith imputed to him for righteousness .
45004006	Just as David also speaks of the blessedness of the man to whom God imputes righteousness apart from actions .
45004007	Blessed he says are they whose iniquities have been forgiven , And whose sins have been covered .
45004008	Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin .
45004009	Is this blessing , then , for the circumcised alone ? or for the uncircumcised also ? Abrahams faith , I say , was imputed to him for righteousness .
45004010	How then was it imputed to him ? When he was circumcised ? or uncircumcised ? Not in circumcision , but in uncircumcision ;
45004011	and he received circumcision as a sign , a seal of the faith-righteousness which he had while he was in uncircumcision ; in order that he might be the father of all who believe , even though they are uncircumcised ; so that righteousness might be imputed to them .
45004012	He is the father of circumcision to those who are not merely circumcised , but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham which he held while he was as yet uncircumcised .
45004013	For the promise that he should be heir of the world did not come to Abraham or to his posterity through law , but through faith-righteousness .
45004014	For if those who are righteous through law are heirs , faith is empty and the promise becomes void .
45004015	For law works wrath ; but where there is no law , neither is there transgression .
45004016	This is why righteousness is of faith , that it may be a free gift ; so that the promise stands firm to all Abrahams posterity ; not to his children of his faith . For in the sight of the God in whom he believed , who gives life to the dead , and calls into being that which is not , Abraham is the father of us all both Jews and Gentiles ,
45004017	as it is written , I have made you a father of many nations .
45004018	For Abraham , hoping against hope , had faith to the end that he might become a father of many nations , according to that which had been spoken , So numberless shall your descendants be .
45004019	Though he was about a hundred years old , his faith did not fail him when he regarded his own body , now as good as dead . and remembered Sarahs barrenness .
45004020	Nor did he with regard to the promise of God waver in unbelief , but he waxed strong in faith , while he gave God glory ,
45004021	and was fully persuaded that what God had promised , he was able also to perform .
45004022	And so his faith was reckoned to him for righteousness .
45004023	Now these words were not written simply for his sake , but for us as well .
45004024	For it will be " reckoned for righteousness . " to us also , who believe on him that raised from the dead our Lord Jesus ;
45004025	who was betrayed to death for our transgressions , and raised again to life for our justification .
45005001	Since we stand justified as the result of faith , let us continue to enjoy the peace we have with God through our Lord Jesus Christ .
45005002	Through him also we have had our access into this grace in which we have taken our stand , and are exulting in hope of the glory of God .
45005003	And not only so , but we are actually exulting also even in our troubles ; for we know that trouble works fortitude ,
45005004	and fortitude character , and character , hope -
45005005	a hope which never disappoints us . For through the Holy Spirit who has given to us , the " brimming river of the love of God " has overflowed in our hearts .
45005006	For while we were still without strength , Christ died in due time for the ungodly .
45005007	Why , a man will hardly give his life for another , even for a righteous man , though perchance for a good man one might even take it upon himself to die .
45005008	But God gives proof of his love to us by the fact that while we were still sinners , Christ died for us .
45005009	By how much more , then , being now justified in his blood , shall we be saved through him from the wrath of God .
45005010	For if , when we were Gods enemies , we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son , how much more , now that we are reconciled , shall we be saved in his life .
45005011	And not only that , but we exult in God through our Lord Jesus Christ , through whom we have now obtained our reconciliation .
45005012	Thus , then , sin came into the world through one man , and through sin came death and so death spread to all men , because all had sinned .
45005013	For prior to the Law , sin actually existed in the world , but sin was not set down to mans account when there was no law .
45005014	Nevertheless , from Adam to Moses death reigned as king , even over those who had not sinned after the likeness of Adams transgression . Now Adam is a type of Him who was to come .
45005015	But the free gift is not like the transgression ; for if through the transgression of that one man the rest on men died , much more did the grace of God and the gift given in his grace in the one Man , Jesus Christ , overflow unto the rest of men .
45005016	And it is not with the free gift as it was through the one that sinned ; for the judgment came from one transgression unto condemnation ; but the free gift came from many transgressions unto acquittal .
45005017	For if through the transgression of the one , death reigned as king through the one , much more shall those who receive the overflowing grace and gift of righteousness reign as kings in life through One , through Jesus Christ .
45005018	It follows then , as through the transgression of one man came condemnation unto all men , even so through the act of righteousness of One came acquittal and life to all men .
45005019	For just as through the disobedience of one man the rest were made sinners ; even so by the obedience of One shall all the rest be made righteous .
45005020	Now law was brought in so that transgression might abound ; but where sin abounded , grace super-abounded ;
45005021	in order that as sin has ruled as king in death , so also grace might rule as king in righteousness which issues in eternal life , through Jesus Christ our Lord , - ours !
45006001	What then shall we say ? Shall we continue to abound in sin , in order that grace may come to abound ?
45006002	No indeed ; how shall we who have died to sin still go on living in it any longer ?
45006003	For do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Jesus Christ , have been baptized into his death ?
45006004	We have been buried together with him , then , through baptism into his death , in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father , so also we should live in a newness of life .
45006005	For if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death , so we shall also be united with him in the likeness of his resurrection .
45006006	For this we know , that our old self was crucified with Christ , in order that the slave of sin might be destroyed ; so that we should no longer be in slavery to sin -
45006007	for he who is dead is set free from sin .
45006008	Now if we have died with Christ , we believe that we shall also live with him ;
45006009	knowing that Christ , being raised from the dead , dies no more ; death has no more dominion over him .
45006010	For the death that he died , he died unto sin once for all ; but the life that he lives he is living unto God .
45006011	Even so count yourselves also to be dead unto sin , but alive unto God in Christ Jesus .
45006012	Therefore let not sin rule as king in your mortal body , compelling you to obey its lusts .
45006013	Do not continue to present any part of your body to sin to be used as a weapon of unrighteousness . On the contrary , be presenting yourselves to God , as alive from the dead , and the various parts of your bodies to be used as weapons of righteousness .
45006014	For sin shall not lord it over you ; for you are not under the rule of law , but under the rule of grace .
45006015	What then ? Shall we commit an act of sin because we are not under law , but under grace ? Certainly not .
45006016	Do you not know that when you surrender yourselves as slaves to any one to obey him , you are his slaves whom you obey ; whether it be sin , whose end is death , or obedience , whose end is righteousness ?
45006017	But God be thanked that you who were once the slaves of sin have obeyed from your hearts that type of teaching to which you were appointed ;
45006018	and being set free from sin , you became the slaves of righteousness -
45006019	I speak in these homely figures because of the weakness of your fleshly nature - just as you once surrendered your faculties into slavery to impurity and to all lawlessness , so now you must surrender your faculties into slavery to righteousness , unto deeds of holiness .
45006020	For when you were the slaves of sin , you were under no subjection to righteousness .
45006021	What harvest-fruit then had you at that time in the things of which you are now ashamed ? For the end of those things is death .
45006022	But now that you have been set free from sin and become slaves of God , the harvest-fruit which you are reaping tends to produce holiness , and it ends is life eternal .
45006023	FOR THE POOR WAGES OF SIN IS DEATH , BUT THE FREE GIFT OF GOD IS ETERNAL LIFE IN CHRIST JESUS , OUR MASTER .
45007001	Surely , brothers , you know ( for I am speaking to those who know what law means ) that law governs a person only during his lifetime ?
45007002	For a married woman who has a husband is bound by law to her husband during his lifetime ; but if her husband dies , she is released from the law of her husband .
45007003	So then , if during her husband lifetime , she unites herself with another man , she will be counted an adulteress ; but if her husband dies , she is free from the Law , so that she is no adulteress , even if she unites herself with another man .
45007004	So also , my brother , you were made dead to the Law through the body of Christ ; that you should be joined to another , even to Him who was raised from the dead that we might bear fruit for God .
45007005	For while we were unspiritual , the sinful passions , aroused by the Law , were ever active in every part of our bodies , leading us to bear fruit unto death .
45007006	But now we have been released from the Law , because we are dead to that in which we were held ; so that we are now in thraldom in new and spiritual conditions , and not under the old written code .
45007007	What shall we say then ? Is the Law sin ? Certainly not . On the contrary I should not have become acquainted with sin had it not been for the Law ; for except the Law had repeatedly said , " Thou shalt not lust , " I should never have known the sin of lust .
45007008	But when sin had gained a vantage-ground , by means of the commandment , it stirred up within me all manner of lust ; for where there is no law , sin is dead .
45007009	Once I lived apart from the Law , myself ; but when the commandment came , sin revived , and I died ;
45007010	and the very commandment which should have meant life , this I found to mean death .
45007011	For sin , when it had gained a vantage-ground through the commandment , beguiled me , and through it slew me .
45007012	So then the Law is holy , and the commandment is holy and righteous and good .
45007013	Did then that which was good become for me death ? Never ! but sin did ; that it might be manifest as sin , by that the unutterable malignity of sin might become plain through the commandment .
45007014	For we know that the Law is spiritual ; but as for me , I am a creature of flesh , bought and sold under the dominion of sin .
45007015	For what I perform I know not ; what I practise is not what I intend to do , but what I detest , that I habitually do .
45007016	If then I habitually do what I do not intend to do , I am consenting to the Law , that it is right .
45007017	And now it is longer I myself who do the deed , but it is sin which has its home in me .
45007018	For I know that in me , that is in my flesh , no good thing has its home ; for while to will is present with me , to carry out that which is right is not .
45007019	For the good that I intend to do , I do not ; but the evil which I do not ; but the evil which I do not intend to do , that I am ever practising .
45007020	But if I do the very thing I do not intend to do , it is no more I who practise it , but sin which has its home in me .
45007021	I find , then , this law , that when I intend to do good , evil is ever present with me .
45007022	For in my inmost self I delight in the law of God ;
45007023	but I find a different law in my bodily faculties , waging war with the law of my will , and taking me prisoner to that law of sin which is in my bodily faculties .
45007024	Oh , wretched man that I am ! Who shall deliver me from this slave of death ?
45007025	Oh , thank God ! it is through Jesus Christ our Lord . So then I myself in my will am in thraldom to the law of God ; yet in my animal nature I am in thraldom to the law of sin .
45008001	Thus there is now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus ;
45008002	for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and of death .
45008003	For God has done what the Law could not do , weakened as it was by flesh . By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh , and on account of sin , he condemned sin in the flesh ;
45008004	in order that the Law might be fulfilled in us who order our lives not after the flesh , but after the spirit .
45008005	For they who live after the flesh , give their attention to the things of the flesh ; But they who live after the spirit , give their attention to spiritual things .
45008006	To be earthly minded means death ; To be spiritually minded means life and peace .
45008007	For to be earthly minded is enmity against God ; For such a mind is not subject to the Law of God , Nor can it be ;
45008008	And they who are earthly minded cannot please God .
45008009	But you are not earthly , but spiritual , if indeed the Spirit of God is really dwelling in you . If any one does not have the Spirit of Christ , he is none of his .
45008010	But if Christ is in you , though your bodily self is dead because of sin , your spirit is full of life because of righteousness .
45008011	But if the Spirit of Him who raised up Jesus from dead is dwelling in you , He who raised up Jesus from the dead is dwelling in you , He who raised up Christ Jesus from the dead will also make your dying bodily self live by his indwelling Spirit in your lives .
45008012	Therefore , brothers , we are debtors - but not to the flesh , to live according to the flesh ;
45008013	for if you go on living according to the flesh , you are on the road to die ; but if by the Spirit you keep putting to death the deeds of the body , you will live .
45008014	For only those are sons of God who are led by Gods Spirit .
45008015	For you have not received a spirit of slavery in order that you should once more be afraid ; but you have received a spirit of adoption , in which we cry out , " My Father , my dear Father ! "
45008016	For his Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit , that we are children of God ;
45008017	and if children , then heirs , heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ ; but to share his glory , we must now be sharing his sufferings .
45008018	For I count as nothing what we now suffer , in comparison with the glory which will soon be unveiled to us .
45008019	All nature even is waiting with eager longing for the unveiling of the vision of Gods sons .
45008020	For nature was subjected to imperfection , not by its own will , but by the will of Him who thus made it subject -
45008021	yet not without the hope that some day nature itself also will be freed from the thraldom of decay , into the freedom which belongs to the glory of the children of God .
45008022	For we know that all nature has been groaning and travailing together until this hour .
45008023	And not only that , we ourselves , although we are grasping the first-fruits of the Spirit , even we ourselves are inwardly groaning , while we are waiting for adoption , the redemption of our body .
45008024	For by hope we are saved ; but hope which is clearly seen is no longer hope .
45008025	Who hopes for what he clearly sees ? But if we hope for something that we do not see , we then patiently wait for it .
45008026	In the same way the Spirit also takes hold with us in our weakness ; for we know knot how to pray as we ought ; but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings which cannot be uttered .
45008027	And the Searcher of Hearts knows what the Sprits meaning is , because his intercessions for the saints are according to the will of God .
45008028	Now we know that all things continually work together for good to to those who love God , to those who have been the called according to his purpose .
45008029	For whom he foreknew , he also foreordained to be conformed to the likeness of his Son , so that he might be the eldest of a great brotherhood ;
45008030	and whom he foreordained , those he also called ; and whom he called , those he also justified ; and whom he justified , those he also glorified .
45008031	What shall we say then , to these things ? If God be for us , Who can be against us ?
45008032	He that spared not his own Son , But freely delivered him up for us all , How shall he not with him also freely give us all things ?
45008033	Who shall accuse Gods elect ? God acquits them ;
45008034	Who is there to condemn them ? Will Christ who died ? Yes , and who rose from the dead , The Christ who is also at the right hand of God , And is interceding for us ?
45008035	What shall separate us from the love of Christ ? Shall anguish , or calamity , or persecution , or famine ? Shall nakedness , or peril , or sword ?
45008036	Even as it is written . For thy sake we are killed all the day long ; We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter .
45008037	Nay , in all these things we are more than conquerors Through Him who loved us .
45008038	For I am fully persuaded that neither death nor life , Neither angels nor principalities , nor powers , Neither the present world nor the world to come , Nor the powers of Nature ,
45008039	Nor height , nor depth , Nor any other created thing , Shall be able to separate us from the love of God Which is in Christ Jesus our Lord .
45009001	I am speaking the truth in Christ , it is no lie . My conscience bears me witness in the Holy Spirit that I have deep sorrow
45009002	and incessant anguish in my heart .
45009003	For I was on the point of praying to be accursed from Christ on behalf of my brothers , my kinsmen according to the flesh .
45009004	For they are Israelites ; to them belong the sonship , the Shekinah glory , the covenants , the giving of the Law ; the service of the temple , and the promises ;
45009005	theirs are the patriarchs , and of them , as concerning the flesh , is Christ , who is over all , God , blessed forever , Amen .
45009006	It is not , however , as though Gods word had failed ! For they are not all Israel who have sprung from Israel ;
45009007	they are not all children of Abraham because they are Abrahams descendants . The promise was , In Isaac shall thy posterity be called .
45009008	That is , it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God ; but the children of the promise are counted as his posterity .
45009009	For thus is the word of promise , According to this season I will come , and Sarah shall bear a son .
45009010	And not only so , but when Rebecca was pregnant by our forefather Isaac , though one man was the father of both children ,
45009011	and even though they were still unborn , and had done nothing either good or bad , in order that the purpose of God might stand according to election , not of works , but of Him who called ,
45009012	it was said to her , The elder shall serve the younger .
45009013	As it is written , Jacob have I loved , but Esau have I hated .
45009014	What shall we say then ? that there is injustice with God ? No indeed .
45009015	His words to Moses are . I will have mercy on whom I choose to have mercy ; I will have compassion on whom I choose to have compassion .
45009016	So then it is not a question of him who wills , nor of him who runs , but of God who has mercy .
45009017	For the Scripture says to Pharaoh , It is for this very purpose that I have raised you up , To show in you my power , And to proclaim my name far and wide , in all the earth .
45009018	So then he has mercy on whom he will , and whom he will , he hardens .
45009019	Then you will say to me . " Why does he still go on finding fault ? Who can withstand his will ? "
45009020	" Nay , but who are you , O man , that replies to God ? Shall the thing formed say unto him who formed it , " Why did you do me like this ? "
45009021	Or has not the potter power over the clay , to make out of the same lump one vessel for noble , and another for ignoble uses ?
45009022	But what if God , while intending to show forth his wrath , and to make known his power , yet endured , with much long-suffering , vessels of wrath , fitted to destruction ?
45009023	And what if he thus purposed to make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy , which he had before prepared for glory ?
45009024	Now such are we whom he has called , not only from among the Jews , but also from among the Gentiles .
45009025	As he also said in Hosea . Those who were not my people I will call " my people , " And her " beloved " who was not beloved ;
45009026	And in that very spot where it was told them , " You are not my people , " There they shall be called " Sons of the living God . "
45009027	And in regard to Israel , Isaiah exclaims . Though the number of the sons of Israel be like the sands of the sea , it is but a remnant of those who shall be saved ;
45009028	for the Lord will execute his word upon the earth , finishing it and cutting it short .
45009029	Even as in an earlier passage , Isaiah says , Except the Lord of Sabbath had us some few descendants , we should have become like Sodom , and should have fared like Gomorrah .
45009030	What then shall we say ? That Gentiles who never pursed righteousness have overtaken it , even the righteousness of faith ?
45009031	But that the descendants of Israel , who were in pursuit of a law of righteousness , did not arrive at that law ?
45009032	And why ? Because they sought it not by faith , but thought to gain it by works . They stumbled at the stone of stumbling ;
45009033	even as it is written . Behold , I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense ; but he that believes on Him shall not be put to shame .
45010001	Brothers , the longing of my heart and my prayer to God is for my countrymen , that they may be saved .
45010002	For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God , only it is a zeal without knowledge .
45010003	For because they were ignorant of Gods righteousness , and sought to establish their own righteousness , they did not submit themselves to the righteousness of God .
45010004	For to every believer Christ is an end of law as a means of righteousness .
45010005	For Moses writes concerning the righteousness of the Law , saying , The man that doeth it shall live by it .
45010006	But the righteousness of faith speaks in this way . Say not in thine heart , " Who shall ascend to heaven ? " - that is , to bring Christ down ;
45010007	Nor , " who shall descend into the abyss ? " - that is , to bring Christ up from the dead .
45010008	But what does it say ? The word is near thee , even in thy mouth and in thy heart . That is the very word of faith which we preach ;
45010009	Confess with your mouth " Jesus is Lord , " and believe in your heart that God actually raised him from the dead , and you will be saved .
45010010	For with the heart man believes unto righteousness , and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation .
45010011	The Scriptures say , Whoever believes in Him will not be put to shame .
45010012	For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile , because the same Lord Jesus is all over , and is rich unto all who call upon Him ;
45010013	for Whoever will call upon the name of the Lord will be saved .
45010014	How then shall thy call upon Him in whom they do not believe ? And how are they to believe in One of whom they have never heard ? And how shall they hear without a preacher ?
45010015	And how can men preach unless they are sent ? As it is written , How beautiful are the feet of those who bring a glad gospel .
45010016	And yet they did not all hearken to the good news ; for Isaiah said , Lord , who hath believed our message ?
45010017	So faith comes from a message heard , and the message comes from the teaching of Christ .
45010018	But I ask , Did they fail to hear ? Yes , truly , Their sound has gone out unto all the earth , And their words unto the ends of the world .
45010019	But I say , Did Israel not know ? First Moses says . I will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no nation ; Against a Gentile nation , void of understanding , will I anger you .
45010020	But Isaiah speaks very boldly , I was found of those who were not seeking me , I was made manifest to those who were not asking for me .
45010021	But to Israel he says , All day long I have been spreading out my hands unto a disobedient and contrary people .
45011001	Then I ask , Did God cast off his people ? No indeed . For I also am an Israelite , a son of Abraham , a member of the tribe of Benjamin .
45011002	God did not cast off his people whom he foreknew . For do you not know what is said in the Scripture about Elijah ? how he pleaded with God against Israel , saying ,
45011003	Lord , they have killed thy prophets , they have overthrown thine altars ; And now I alone am left , and they seek my life .
45011004	But what was the answer of God to him ? I have reserved for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal .
45011005	In the same way also at this time there is a remnant chosen by gift of grace .
45011006	But if it is by grace , it is no longer of works ; or else grace is no more grace .
45011007	What then ? that which Israel has been seeking for , that he has not obtained ; but the chosen have obtained it , and the rest have been hardened .
45011008	According as it is written , God has given them a spirit of slumber , Eyes that they should not see , Ears that they should not hear , unto this day .
45011009	As David says . Let their table be made a snare and a trap , And a stumbling-block and a recompense unto them ;
45011010	Let their eyes be darkened , that they may not see , And bow thou down their backs forever .
45011011	I ask then , " Have they stumbled so as to fall ? " No indeed ; but by their lapse salvation has come unto Gentiles , " to provoke Israel to jealousy . "
45011012	Now if their stumbling enriches the world , and their loss enriches the Gentiles , how much more must their fulness do !
45011013	For to you who are Gentiles I say that since I am an apostle to the Gentiles , I glorify my ministry ,
45011014	if by any means I might " provoke to jealousy " my kinsmen , and save some among them .
45011015	For if their casting out is the reconciliation of the world to God , what will their restoration be but life out of death ?
45011016	Now if the first-fruits of the dough Abraham and the Patriarchs are holy , so also is the whole mass their descendants . And if the root of a tree Abraham is holy , so also are the branches his descendants .
45011017	Supposing that some of the branches have been broken off , and you , although you were but a wild olive , have been grafted in among the branches and have become a partaker with them of the fatness of the olive tree , do not glory over the branches ;
45011018	or if you are glorying , remember that it is not you who uphold the root , but the root which upholds you .
45011019	" Branches have been broken off , " you say , " that I might be grafted in . "
45011020	True , through their unbelief they were broken off , and by your faith you stand . Do not be puffed up , but fear ;
45011021	for if God spared not the natural branches , neither will he spare you .
45011022	Fix your gaze , therefore , on the goodness and the severity of God ; towards those who fell , severity , but towards you , Gods goodness , if you continue stedfast in his goodness ; otherwise you , too , will be cut off .
45011023	And they also those Jews , if they do not continue in their unbelief , will be grafted in again ; for God is able to graft them in again .
45011024	For if you were cut out of that which is by nature a mere wild olive tree , and have been grafted , contrary to nature , into a fruitful olive tree , how much more shall these , the natural branches , be regrafted into their own olive tree ?
45011025	For I would not , my brothers , have you ignorant of this hidden truth , for fear that you become wise in your own conceits . that a hardening in part has befallen Israel , until the fulness of the Gentiles is come in .
45011026	And so all Israel will be saved , as it is written . The deliver will come from Zion , He will banish all ungodliness from Jacob ;
45011027	This is my covenant with them , When I shall take away their sins .
45011028	In relation to the gospel , the Jews are Gods enemies for your sake ; but in relation to the election , they are dearly loved for their forefathers sake .
45011029	For no change of purpose can annul Gods free gift and call .
45011030	And as in times past you were yourselves disobedient to God , but now , thanks to their disobedience , have obtained mercy ;
45011031	even so they also have now been disobedient , that by the mercy shown to you they also may now obtain mercy .
45011032	For God has locked up all in the prison of disobedience , that upon all he may have mercy .
45011033	Oh , the depths of the riches , both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God ! How unfathomable are his judgments , and how unsearchable his paths !
45011034	Who has known the mind of the Lord ? Or who has been his counsellor ?
45011035	Who has first given to Him , So as to receive payment in return ?
45011036	For of him and through him , and for him , are all things . All glory to him forever and ever ! Amen .
45012001	I entreat you therefore , brothers , by the mercies of God , to present your bodies to Him as a living sacrifice , holy and acceptable to God . This is your reasonable service of worship .
45012002	And be not conformed to this world , but be transformed by the renewing of your minds , so that you may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God .
45012003	For , through the grace that was given to me , I tell every man among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think ; but so to think , as to think soberly , according to the measure of faith which God has given him .
45012004	For even as we have many members in one body , and not all members have the same function ;
45012005	so we , who are many , are one body in Christ , and we are severally members of one another .
45012006	But we have gifts differing according to the grace which was given to us . He that has the gift of prophecy , let him prophesy according to the proportion of his faith .
45012007	If it is the gift of administration , let us give ourselves to our service .
45012008	Let the teacher give himself to his teaching ; and he who exhorts others to his exhortation . He who gives , let him do it in singleness of mind . He who rules , let him rule with diligence ; and he who shows mercy must be cheerful .
45012009	Let love be without insincerity . Abhor what is evil ; wed yourselves to what is good .
45012010	As for brotherly love , be tenderly affectionate one to another , in honor preferring one another .
45012011	In your diligence be free from sloth . Be glowing in spirit . Slave for the master .
45012012	Rejoice in hope ; be patient under affliction ; continue stedfast in prayer .
45012013	Be liberal to needy saints . Practise hospitality .
45012014	Bless your persecutors , bless , and curse not .
45012015	Rejoice with those who rejoice , and weep with those who weep .
45012016	Have full sympathy with one another . Set not your minds on high affairs , but associate with lowly folk . Do not be wise in your own conceits .
45012017	Do not pay back evil for evil . Aim to do what is honorable in the eyes of all .
45012018	If it be possible , so far as it lies with you , be at peace with all men .
45012019	Never revenge yourself , beloved , but leave the field clear for Gods wrath ; for it is written , " Vengeance is mine , I will repay , " says the Lord .
45012020	On the contrary , therefore , If your enemy is hungry , feed him ; if he is thirsty , give him drink ; for by so doing you will be heaping burning coals on his head .
45012021	Do not be overcome by evil , but be overcoming evil with good .
45013001	Every one should be in the higher authorities ; for there is no authority apart from God . The authorities that now exist have been appointed by God .
45013002	Therefore the man who rebels against authority is opposing the divine ordinances ; and those who withstand will bring judgment on themselves .
45013003	For rulers are no terror to good deeds , but to evil . Would you be fearless of the rulers authority ? Do what is good , and you will have his praise .
45013004	For the ruler is Gods minister appointed for your good . But if you are a wrong-doer , be afraid ; he does not carry the sword to no purpose ; he is Gods servant , appointed to vengeance upon the guilty .
45013005	Wherefore you must needs be in subjection , not only because of fear , but also for conscience sake .
45013006	This too , is the reason why you pay taxes ; because the authorities are ministers of Gods service , attending continually upon this very thing .
45013007	Render to all their dues ; taxes to whom taxes , customs to whom customs , respect to whom respect , and homage to whom homage is due .
45013008	Never owe any one anything save the debt of brotherly love ; for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the Law .
45013009	For the Law which says , Thou shalt not commit adultery , thou shalt do no murder , thou shalt not steal , thou shalt not bear false witness , thou shalt not covet , and whatever other commandment there be - is all summed up in this one saying , Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself .
45013010	Love never wrongs his neighbor ; therefore love is the fulfilment of the Law .
45013011	Carry out these injunctions because you know the crisis that we are in , that now it is high time for you to awake out of sleep ; for now is our salvation nearer than when we first believed .
45013012	The night is far spent ; The day is at hand . Let is therefore take off the deeds of darkness , Let us put on the armor of light .
45013013	Let us live honestly , as in the day , Not in reveling and drunkenness , Not in lust and licentiousness , Not is strife and jealousy ;
45013014	But clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ , And make no provisions for your earthly nature And the gratification of its lusts .
45014001	Welcome a man of weak faith , but not for the purpose of deciding doubtful points .
45014002	One man has faith to eat anything ; but he whose faith is weak , eats only vegetables .
45014003	He who eats meat must not despise the man who abstains ; and let not the man who abstains judge him who eats ; for God has received him .
45014004	Who are you just that judges the household-servant of another ? To his own lord he stands or falls . And stand he will , for his Master has power to make him stand .
45014005	There are some who esteem one day above another ; there are others who esteem all days alike ; let each other be fully persuaded in his own mind .
45014006	He who regards the day , regards it unto his Lord ; and he who regards it not , disregards it unto his Lord . He who eats meat , eats unto his Lord , for he gives God thanks ; and he who abstains , abstains unto his Lord , since he , too , gives God thanks .
45014007	For not one of us lives unto himself , and not one dies unto himself .
45014008	If we live , we live unto our Lord ; if we die , we die unto our Lord . So then , whether we live or die , we belong to our Lord .
45014009	For this purpose Christ died and became alive again , that he might be the Lord both of the dead and of the living .
45014010	But you the abstainer , why do you pass judgment on your brother ? Or you again the non-abstainer , why do you despise yours ? For we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of God .
45014011	For it is written , " As I live , " says the Lord , " to me every knee shall bow , And to God shall every tongue confess . "
45014012	So then each one of us shall give account of himself to God .
45014013	So let us no longer pass judgment on one another ; rather let this be your judgment , that no one put a stumbling-block in his brothers way , nor any cause of falling .
45014014	I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is in itself unclean ; but any food is " unclean " for one who considers it " unclean . "
45014015	If your brother is continually pained because of your food , you are not conducting yourself any longer in love . Do not , by what you eat , persist in destroying a man for whom Christ died .
45014016	Therefore do not let what is right , so far as you are concerned , be evil spoken of .
45014017	For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking , but of righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit .
45014018	Those who are slaving for Christ devotedly in these ways , are well pleasing to God and highly commended by man .
45014019	So then let is eagerly pursue the things that make for peace and the upbuilding of each other .
45014020	Do not , for the sake of food , be tearing down Gods work . All food indeed is ceremonially clean , but a man is in the wrong if his food proves a stumbling-block .
45014021	The right course is not to eat meat , nor to drink wine , nor to do anything through which your brother is made to stumble .
45014022	Have you faith ? Keep it to yourself as in the presence of God . He is a happy man who does not condemn himself in that which he approves .
45014023	But he who has misgivings , and yet eats meat , is condemned already , because his action is not based on faith ; and whatever is not based on faith is sin .
45015001	Now we who are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak , and not to seek our own pleasure .
45015002	Let each one of us try to make his neighbor happy for his good , unto his upbuilding .
45015003	For even Christ pleased not himself ; but as it is written , The reproaches of those who were reproaching thee fell upon me .
45015004	For everything that was written of old has been written for our instruction , that through patience , and through the comfort of the Scriptures , we might have hope .
45015005	Now the God of patience and of comfort grant you to be in full sympathy with one another , in accordance with the example of Jesus Christ ;
45015006	so that with one heart and with one voice you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
45015007	Wherefore always receive one another into fellowship , to the glory of God , even as Christ also received you .
45015008	For I say that Christ has been made a minister of the Circumcision the people of Israel , in vindication of Gods truth , so that he may confirm the promises given to our forefathers ;
45015009	and so that the Gentiles also should praise God for his mercy , as it is written , Therefore I will offer praise to thee among the Gentiles , And sing to thy name .
45015010	Or again , Rejoice , O Gentiles , with his people .
45015011	Or again , Praise the Lord , all ye Gentiles , And let all the people extol him .
45015012	Or again , as Isaiah says . There shall be the root of Jesse , And he that arises to rule over the Gentiles ; On him shall the Gentiles hope .
45015013	Now the God of all hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing , that you may be overflowing with hope in the power of the Holy Spirit .
45015014	And I myself also am confident regarding you , my brothers , that you yourselves are already full of goodness , filled with all knowledge , and well able to give advice to one another .
45015015	Still I have written unto you the more boldly , in part , by way of reminding you , because of that gift of grace which God bestowed upon me , in making me a priest of Jesus Christ unto the Gentiles .
45015016	I act as priest of the gospel of God ; so that the Gentiles , when offered before him , may be an acceptable sacrifice , because consecrated by the Holy Spirit .
45015017	I have then my boast in Christ Jesus concerning the things of God .
45015018	For I will not dare to speak of any thing except that which Christ has done through me to bring the Gentiles to obedience by word and deed ,
45015019	through the might of signs and wonders , in the power of the Holy Spirit . So that beginning at Jerusalem and its environs , I have proclaimed without reserve the gospel of Christ , even as far as Illyricum .
45015020	My ambition has been , however , to preach the gospel where Christs name was not already known , so that I might not build upon another mans foundation .
45015021	But , as Scripture says , He shall be seen by those to whom no news about him ever came , And those who have never heard of him shall understand .
45015022	This is why I have been so hindered from coming to you .
45015023	But now , since I have no more any " opening " in these parts , and since I have longed for many years to come to you
45015024	whenever I go to Spain , I am hoping to see you on my way there , and to be set forward by you on my way there , and to be set forward by you on my journey thither , after I have enjoyed your company for a little while .
45015025	Just now I am going to Jerusalem to serve the saints .
45015026	For it has been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make an offering for the poor among the saints at Jerusalem .
45015027	Yes , it has been made their good pleasure , and their debt , too . For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual riches , they owe it to them also to minister to them the Jews in worldly goods .
45015028	When , therefore , I have settled this , and have secured to them the poor at Jerusalem the fruit of this collection , I shall come on by you into Spain .
45015029	And I know that when I come to you , I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of Christ .
45015030	Brothers , I beseech you , by Jesus Christ our Lord , and by the love which the Spirit gives , to help me in my struggle by your prayers to God on my behalf ,
45015031	that I may be delivered from the disobedient in Judea ; that my mission to Jerusalem may be favorably received by the saints ;
45015032	and that I may come to you in joy , by the will of God , and find rest together with you .
45015033	The God of peace be with you all ! Amen .
45016001	I commend to you our sister Phoebe , who is a minister of the church at Cenchrae .
45016002	I beg you to give her a Christian welcome , as the saints should ; and to assist her in any matter in which she may have need of you . For she herself has been made an overseer to many people , including myself .
45016003	Salute Priscilla and Aquila , my fellow laborers in the cause of Jesus Christ ,
45016004	who risked their own lives to save mine ; who are thanked not only by me ,
45016005	but by all the churches among the Gentiles . Salute likewise the church that meets in their home . Salute Epaenetus , my dearly beloved , the first man in Roman Asia to believe in Christ .
45016006	Salute Mary , who toiled terribly for you ;
45016007	and Andronicus and Junia , my kinsfolk and fellow prisoners , who are notable among the apostles , and who became Christians before I did .
45016008	Salute Amplias , my beloved in the Lord ;
45016009	and Urbanus , my fellow toiler in Christ ; and Stachys , my dear , dear friend .
45016010	Salute Apellas , tested and tried in Christ , and the household of Aristobulus ,
45016011	and Herodion , my kinsman . Salute the believing members of the household of Narcissus .
45016012	Salute Trypheana and Tryphosa , who are ever toiling in the Lord . Salute dear Persis , who has toiled terribly in the Lords service .
45016013	Salute Rufus , the chosen in the Lord , and his mother and mine .
45016014	Salute Asyncritus , Phlegon , Hermes , Patrobas , Hermas , and the brothers who are associated with them .
45016015	Salute Philologus and Julia , Nereus and his sister , Olympas , and all the saints associated with them .
45016016	Salute one another with a holy kiss . All the churches of Christ salute you .
45016017	I exhort you , brothers , to keep watch of those who are causing the divisions among you , and occasions of stumbling , contrary to the teaching which you have learned .
45016018	Turn away from them . For men of that stamp are not the slaves of Christ , but are slaves to their own appetites . By their smooth and fair speech they beguile the hearts of the innocent .
45016019	I say this , for the tidings of your obedience have been told throughout the world . On your own behalf , then , I rejoice ; but I want you to be wise unto the good , but innocents in evil .
45016020	The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet . The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you .
45016021	Timothy , my fellow worker , salutes you ; so do my fellow countrymen Lucius , Jason , and Sosipater .
45016022	I , Tertius , who write this letter , salute you in the Lord .
45016023	Gaius , my host , and the host of the church , salutes you . Erastus , the treasurer of the city , salutes you , and so does brother Quartus .
45016024	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all !
45016025	Now I commend you to Him who is able to keep you stedfast , according to my gospel , and the proclamation of Jesus Christ , whereby is unveiled the secret truth which was kept secret through immemorial ages ,
45016026	but now has been brought to light , and by command of the eternal God made known to the Gentiles by the scriptures of the Prophets , so that the Gentiles might hold obedience of the faith .
45016027	Unto Him , the only wise God , through Jesus Christ , be glory forever . Amen .
46001001	Paul , called by the will of God to be an apostle of Jesus Christ , and Sosthenes , his brother .
46001002	to the Church of God at Corinth , to those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus , called to be saints , together with all , wherever they are , who call upon the name of the Lord Jesus .
46001003	Grace to you , and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
46001004	I am always thanking God on your behalf , for the grace of God bestowed on you in Christ Jesus ;
46001005	that in everything you have been enriched in him , in all speech , and in all knowledge
46001006	( for thus my witness for Christ was confirmed among you ) ;
46001007	so that you lack no divine gift , while you are waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ .
46001008	He will also keep you perfectly stedfast unto the end , so that you will be unreprovable in the Day of our Lord Jesus Christ .
46001009	Faithful is the God by whom you were called into fellowship with his Son , Jesus Christ our Lord .
46001010	Now I beg you , brothers , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , to speak in accord , all of you , and to have no divisions among you , but to be knit together in a common mind and temper .
46001011	For it has been plainly told me concerning you , my brothers , by Chloes people , that there are dissensions among you .
46001012	I mean by this that one of you says , " I am a follower of Paul " ; another , " I of Apollos " ; another , " I of Cephas " ; another , " I of Christ . "
46001013	Has Christ been divided ? Paul , was he crucified for you ? or was it into the name of Paul that you were baptized ?
46001014	I am thankful to God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius ,
46001015	so that no one can say you were baptized in my name .
46001016	Yes , I did baptize the house of Stephanas also , but I do not think I baptized any one else .
46001017	For Christ did not think I baptized any one else . For Christ did not send me forth to baptize , but to proclaim the gospel ; and that not in philosophic words , lest the Cross of Christ should be made an empty thing .
46001018	For the message of the Cross is indeed for those on their way to destruction , foolishness ; but for us who are on our way to salvation it is the power of God .
46001019	For thus it is written , I will destroy the wisdom of the philosophers , And the prudence of the prudent will I confound .
46001020	Sage , rabbi , skeptic of this present age - where are they all ? Has not God made foolish the philosophy of the world ?
46001021	For when , in the wisdom of God , the world by its philosophy knew not God , the world by its philosophy knew not God , it pleased God , by the foolishness of preaching , to save those who believe .
46001022	Jews continue to ask for miracles and Greeks are ever wanting philosophy ,
46001023	but we come preaching a crucified Messiah - to Jews a stumbling-block , to Greeks foolishness ,
46001024	but to those who are the called , whether Jews or Greeks , Christ , the power of God and the wisdom of God .
46001025	For the foolishness of God is wiser than men , and the weakness of God is stronger than men .
46001026	For consider your own calling , brothers , that not many wise in earthly wisdom , not many powerful , not many of noble birth , have been called .
46001027	No , God has chosen the worlds folly to confound its philosophy ; and the worlds weakness to confound its strength .
46001028	The worlds base things has God chosen , and the things that are not , to bring to naught the things that are ;
46001029	so that no mortal man should glory in his presence .
46001030	It is of him that you are in Christ Jesus , whom God made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption ,
46001031	so that as Scripture says , He that glories , let him glory in the Lord .
46002001	And when I came to you , brothers , I came not to proclaim Gods great secret purpose in fine language of philosophy ;
46002002	for I determined to know nothing , while among you , but Jesus as Christ , and him a crucified Christ .
46002003	In weakness and fear and great trembling came I among you .
46002004	My message and my preaching were not in the persuasive language of philosophy , but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power ;
46002005	in order that your faith should rest , not on human philosophy , but on the power of God .
46002006	Notwithstanding , among those who are mature I do teach philosophy ; though not the philosophy of the present age , nor of its rulers who are coming to nought .
46002007	No , it is Gods wisdom that I utter , that hidden wisdom which God had decreed before the world began , unto our glory .
46002008	None of the rulers of the present age understands it , for if they had , they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory .
46002009	Nay , as it is written . Eye has not seen , Nor ear heard , Neither have entered into mans heart The things which God has prepared For those who love him .
46002010	Yet God has unveiled them to us by his Spirit . For the Spirit fathoms everything , even the abysmal depths of God .
46002011	For what man knows the depths of man except the mans own inner Spirit ? Even so , also , the Spirit of God knows the deeps profound of God .
46002012	But we have not received the spirit of the world , but the Spirit which comes forth from God , that we may realize the blessings freely given us by God .
46002013	Of these high themes we speak in words not taught by human philosophy , but by the Spirit ; interpreting spiritual things to spiritual men .
46002014	The unspiritual man rejects the teachings of Gods Spirit ; for him it is folly . He cannot understand it , for it is spiritually discerned ,
46002015	But the spiritual man discerns everything , yet is himself discerned by no one .
46002016	For what man understands the mind of the Lord , that he should instruct Him ?
46003001	As for me , brothers , I could not talk to you as spiritual men , but as to creatures of flesh , mere babes in Christ .
46003002	I fed you milk , not meat ; for you were unable to bear it .
46003003	You are not able even now , for you are still unspiritual . While there is among you jealousy and strife , are you not still unspiritual , and behaving like worldlings ?
46003004	When one says , " I follow Paul , " and another , " I follow Apollos , " are you not mere worldlings ?
46003005	What then is Apollos ? What is Paul ? Just ministers through whom you have believed , and each doing the work that the Lord gave him .
46003006	I planted , Apollos watered , but God made the seed grow .
46003007	So neither is he who planted anything , nor he who watered , but God alone , who is making the seed grow .
46003008	Now , though he who plants and he who waters are one , each will receive his own reward , according to his own service .
46003009	For we are Gods fellow workers ; and you are Gods field , you are Gods building .
46003010	According to the grace of God vouchsafed me , like a skillful master-builder , I have laid a foundation ; but another will be building upon it . Let each take heed how he builds on it .
46003011	The foundation is already laid - Jesus Christ - and no man can lay another .
46003012	On that foundation , if a man proceeds to build gold , silver , precious stones , wood , hay , stubble , each mans work will be made manifest .
46003013	The Day will disclose it , for it dawns in fire , and the fire will test each mans work , of what quality it is .
46003014	If any mans work - the building he has made - stands the test , he will be rewarded .
46003015	If any mans work is burned up , he will suffer loss , but he himself will be saved , as it were through the flames .
46003016	Do you not know what you are Gods sanctuary , and that the Spirit of God is dwelling within you ?
46003017	If any one tear down Gods sanctuary , God will tear him down ; for the sanctuary of God is holy , and that is what you are .
46003018	Let no one deceive himself . If any one of you supposes that he is wise in the philosophy of the present age , let him become foolish , so that he may be wise .
46003019	For the philosophy of this world is foolishness in Gods sight . It is written , He snares the wise in their own craftiness ,
46003020	and again , The Lord knows the reasonings of the wise , how futile they are .
46003021	So let no one make boast in men . For all things are yours ;
46003022	Paul , Apollos , Cephas , the world , life , death , things present or things to come ; all things are yours ;
46003023	and you are Christs , and Christ is Gods .
46004001	Let any man look upon us as servants of Christ , and stewards of the secret truths of God .
46004002	Now it is required of stewards , that a man be found faithful .
46004003	But to me it matters very little that I am judged by you , or by any earthly court .
46004004	Indeed I do not even judge myself ; for though I know nothing against myself , yet that does not vindicate me ; for he who judges me is the Lord .
46004005	So make no hasty judgment until the Lord come , who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness , and will make plain the purpose of mens hearts . Then each mans due praise will come to him from God .
46004006	Now these things , brothers , I have applied in a figure to myself and to Apollos for your sakes ; that in us you might learn not to go beyond what is written ; that none of you be puffed up for the one , against the other .
46004007	For who makes you a differ , brother ? Or what have you that you did not receive ? But if you did receive it , why are you boasting as if you had not received it ?
46004008	But you , forsooth , are already full , are you ? You are already rich ? Without us you are already reigning ? Yes , and I would that you did reign , so that we also might reign with you .
46004009	But it seems to me that God has exhibited us apostles , last of all , like men doomed to death ; for we are made a spectacle to the whole world , both to men and to angels .
46004010	For Christs sake we are fools , but you are quite philosophic in Christ . We are weak , but you are strong ; you are honorable , but we are outcast .
46004011	Even to his very hour we are enduring hunger and thirst and nakedness and blows .
46004012	Homeless men , we toil , working with our own hands .
46004013	When reviled , we bless ; when persecuted , we endure ; when defamed , we conciliate . We have been made , as it were , scum-o-the-earth , the very refuse of the world , to this very hour !
46004014	I am not writing this to shame you , but to admonish you , as my beloved children .
46004015	For though you have ten thousand tutors in Christ Jesus , you can have but one father . For in Christ Jesus I begot you through the gospel .
46004016	I beg you then to imitate my example .
46004017	With this in mind I have sent Timothy to you . He is my dear and faithful son in the Lord , who will remind you of my ways in Christ ; the manner in which I ever teach everywhere in every church .
46004018	Now some are puffed up , as though I were not coming to you .
46004019	But come to you I will , and that soon , if it please the Lord , and then I shall learn not the talk of these boasters , but their power .
46004020	For the kingdom of God is not in talk , but in power .
46004021	Which do you want ? Am I to come to you with a rod , or in a loving and tender spirit ?
46005001	It is actually reported that there is immorality among you , and such immorality as is not even among the heathen - that a man has taken his fathers wife !
46005002	Yet you are puffed up instead of mourning and removing from among you the man who has done this thing .
46005003	For I , although absent in body , yet present in spirit , have already passed sentence , by the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ , on him who has done this thing .
46005004	When you are gathered together , and my spirit is with you together with the power of our Lord Jesus ,
46005005	I have handed over such a man to Satan for the destruction of his flesh , that his spirit may be saved , in the day of the Lord Jesus .
46005006	Your glorying is not good . Do you not know that even a little leaven leavens all the lump ?
46005007	Then get rid of the old leaven , so that you may be like a new lump , as you are now unleavened . For our Paschal Lamb has already been sacrificed , Christ himself .
46005008	So let us keep the unending feast , not with any old leaven , neither with leaven of malice and vice , but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth .
46005009	I told you in my letter not to associate with the immoral .
46005010	Not that in this world you were actually to have no contact with the immoral , the avaricious , the thievish , or with idolaters ; for then you would have to leave the world , altogether .
46005011	But what I wrote was that you were not to associate with any so-called brother who is immoral , or avaricious , or idolatrous , or abusive , or a drunkard , or an extortioner . No , with such persons do not even sit at table .
46005012	What have I to do with the judging of outsiders ? Must not you judge those who are within the church , while God judges outsiders ?
46005013	Expel that wicked man from among you .
46006001	Dare any one of you who has a grievance against his neighbor go to law before heathen judges , instead of before the saints ?
46006002	Do you not know that the saints will judge the world ? And if the world is to be tried by you , are you unfit to try such trifling cases ?
46006003	Do you not know that we are to try angels ? How much more , then , the affairs of life .
46006004	Why then , if you have cases relating to earthly affairs which need to be decided , is it men who are absolutely nothing in the church whom you make your judges ?
46006005	I say this to shame you . Is it so that there is not among you a single wise man , capable of deciding between a man and his brother ?
46006006	Must brother go to law with brother , and that , too , before unbelievers ?
46006007	Indeed , to say nothing more , the fact that you have lawsuits with one another is altogether a defect in you . Why not rather suffer injustice ? Why not rather endure being cheated ?
46006008	On the contrary , you yourselves are inflicting injustice and fraud , and that upon your brothers .
46006009	Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God ? Do not be deceived . None who are immoral , or idolaters , or adulterers , or catamites , or sodomites ,
46006010	or thieves , or avaricious men , or drunkards , or foul-mouthed men , or extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God .
46006011	Such were some of you , but you have washed away your stains , you have been consecrated , you have been justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ , and in the Spirit of our God .
46006012	" All things are lawful for me " ? Yes , but not all things are good for me . " All things are lawful for me " ? Yes , but I will not let myself be enslaved by the power of any .
46006013	" Food is meant for the stomach , and the stomach for food " ? Yes , but God will soon put an end both to the one and to the other . The body , however , exists not for immorality , but for the Lord , and the Lord for the body ;
46006014	and the God who raised up our Lord will up-raise us also by his mighty power .
46006015	You know , do you not , that your bodies are members of Christ ? Shall I then take the members of Christ , and make them members of a harlot ? God forbid !
46006016	Do you not know that he who joins himself to a harlot is one with her in body ? ( For God says , The two shall become one flesh . )
46006017	While a man who is united with the Lord is one with Him in spirit ?
46006018	Flee from immorality . Every other sin that a man commits lies outside the body , but the immoral man sins against his own body .
46006019	Do you not know that your body is a sanctuary of the Holy Spirit who is within you , the Spirit whom you have from God ?
46006020	You are not your own ; for you have been bought with a price , therefore glorify God in your bodies .
46007001	Now concerning the question in your letter . It is well for a man to have no intercourse with a woman ,
46007002	but because there is so much immorality let each man have his own wife ; and let each women have her own husband .
46007003	Let the husband give his wife her due , and likewise the wife her husband . The wife is not mistress of her own person ,
46007004	but her husband is ; and in the same way the husband is not master of his own person , but his wife is .
46007005	Do not refuse one another , unless it is only temporary and by mutual consent , so that you may devote yourselves to prayer . Then come together again , lest through your lack of self-control Satan begin to tempt you to sin .
46007006	But what I have just said is by way of concession , not command .
46007007	I would that every one lived as I do ; but each man has his own special gift from God , one this , another that .
46007008	But to the unmarried , and the widows , I say that it is well for them to remain as I am .
46007009	If , however , they are not exercising self-control , by all means let them marry ; for marriage is better than the fever of passion .
46007010	But to those already married my commandment is - and not mine , but the Lords - that a wife is not to leave her husband ;
46007011	( or if she has already left him let her either remain as she is , or be reconciled to him ) , and also that a husband is not to put away his wife .
46007012	To the rest it is I who am speaking , not the Lord . If any brother has a wife who is not a believer , if he is willing to live with her , let him not send her away .
46007013	And a woman whose husband is not a believer , if he is willing to live with her , let her not separate from him .
46007014	For the unbelieving husband is consecrated through union with his believing wife ; and the unbelieving wife , through union with her believing husband . Otherwise your children would be unholy , but now they are consecrated to God .
46007015	But if the unbelieving partner be determined to leave , separation let it be . In such cases the believing husband or wife is not under bondage . But it is into peace that God has called us .
46007016	For how do you know , wife , whether you will save your husband ? Or how do you know , husband , whether you will save your wife ?
46007017	Only whatever be the lot in life to which God has assigned each one - and whatever the condition in which he was living when God called him - - in that let him continue . Such is the rule I give in all the churches .
46007018	So , was any man called , being circumcised ? Let him not become uncircumcised . Was any man called when he was uncircumcised ? Let him not be circumcised .
46007019	Circumcision is nothing , and uncircumcision is nothing . Keeping Gods commands in everything .
46007020	Whatever be the condition of life in which he was called , in that let him continue .
46007021	Were you called in slavery ? Let not that trouble you ; but if you can become free make use of the opportunity .
46007022	For the slave who has been called in the Lord is the Lords freedman ; and in the same way , the free man who is called is Christs slave .
46007023	You have been brought with a price ; do not become slaves to men .
46007024	Where each man stood when he was called , there , brothers , let him stay , close to God .
46007025	I have no command from the Lord to give you concerning unmarried women ; but I give you my opinion , and it is that of a man who , through the Lords mercy , is deserving of your confidence .
46007026	I think then , that in view of the time of suffering now imminent , it is best for a man to remain as he is .
46007027	Are you bound to a wife ? Do not seek to be free . Are you free from the marriage bond ? Do not seek for a wife .
46007028	Yet if you do not marry , you have not done wrong ; and if a girl marries , she has not done wrong . Such people , however , will have trouble in worldy affairs , and I wish to spare you .
46007029	Indeed , brothers , the time that remains to us has been shortened ; so let those who have wives live as if they had none ,
46007030	let those who weep be as though they did not weep , those who rejoice as though they did not rejoice , those who buy as though they did not possess ,
46007031	and those who use the world as though using it sparingly . For the present phase of the world is passing away .
46007032	So I want you to be free from all anxieties . An unmarried man is anxious about the Lords business , how he may please the Lord ;
46007033	but a married man is anxious about worldly affairs , how he may please his wife , and he is divided in his mind .
46007034	Again , the woman who is widow , or the maid , is anxious about the Lords business , how she may be pure in body and in mind ; but the married woman is anxious about worldly affairs , how she may please her husband .
46007035	It is in your own interest that I say this ; not that I may entangle you in a snare , but that I may help you to serve the Lord with fitting and undistracted service .
46007036	If , however , a father feels that he is not treating his virgin daughter in a seemly manner , in leaving her unmarried beyond the flower of her age , and so the matter is urgent , let him do what she desires ; he commits no sin . Let the marriage take place .
46007037	On the other hand , he who is firm in his purpose and is under no compulsion , but is free to carry out his own wishes , and who has determined to keep his daughter unmarried , does well .
46007038	So he that gives his daughter in marriage is doing right , and he who keeps her unmarried will be doing right , and he who keeps her unmarried will be doing better .
46007039	A wife is bound to her husband during his lifetime ; but if her husband dies , she is free to marry whomever she will , provided it be in the Lord .
46007040	But she is happier , in my judgment , if she remains as she is ; and I think that I , too , have the Spirit of God .
46008001	Now in regard to food which has been offered to idols , we are sure of course that " we all have knowledge . " But knowledge puffs up , while love builds up .
46008002	If a man thinks that he already has knowledge , he does not yet truly know as he ought to know ;
46008003	but if a man loves God , he is known by him .
46008004	Now as to eating food that has been offered to idols , we know well that an idol has no real existence in the universe , and that there is no God but One .
46008005	For though there be so-called " gods , " celestial of terrestrial , as indeed there are gods many and lords many ,
46008006	yet for there is one God , the Father , from whom are all things , and we for him ; and one Lord Jesus Christ , by whom are all things , and we by him .
46008007	But that " knowledge " is not possessed by all ; but some , accustomed until now to the idol , eat food as that which has actually been offered to an idol , and so their conscience , being still weak , is defiled .
46008008	Now food does not bring us nearness to God . Neither if we eat do we gain any advantage , nor if we eat not , do we lose any .
46008009	But see to it lest this right of yours become a stumbling-block to the weak .
46008010	For if any one should see you , the possessor of " knowledge , " reclining at table in an idols temple , would not his conscience , if he were weak , be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols ?
46008011	So he is lost , this weak man , lost by your " knowledge . " this brother for whom Christ died .
46008012	In so sinning against your brothers , and in ever and again wounding their weak consciences , you are sinning against Christ .
46008013	Therefore , if what I eat makes my brother to stumble , I will never eat meat again , lest I make my brother to stumble .
46009001	Am I not free ? Am I not an apostle ? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord ? Are you not my work in the Lord ?
46009002	Even if I am not an apostle to others , to you at least I am ; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord .
46009003	This is my reply to my critics .
46009004	Have I no right to claim food and drink ?
46009005	Have I no right to take a believing wife with me on my journey , as the rest of the apostles and the Lords brothers and Peter do ?
46009006	Are we the only ones , Barnabas and I , who have no right to give up manual labor ?
46009007	What soldier ever serves at his own expense ? What farmer ever plants a vineyard and his flock and does not taste the milk ?
46009008	Am I saying this on human authority only , or does not the Law also say the same ?
46009009	Yea , in the Law of Moses it is written , Thou shalt not muzzle an ox while he is treading out the grain .
46009010	Is it the oxen that God is thinking about , or is it really said for our sakes ? It was written for us ; because the plowman ought to plow in hope , and the thresher in hope of getting a share of the crop .
46009011	If I have sown for you the seeds of spiritual good , is it a great thing if I reap from you temporal goods ?
46009012	If others share this authority over you , do not I far more ? Yet I have not availed myself of it , but am patiently enduring ; so that I may not in any way hinder the progress of Christs gospel .
46009013	You know , do you not , that those who minister in the temple , and those who serve at the altar , get their portion of the sacrifices ?
46009014	Even so the Lord ordained that those who proclaim the gospel should get their living by the gospel .
46009015	But for my part , I have never availed myself of any of these rights . I do not say this to bring it about in my own case . I would rather die than let any one make void this boast of mine .
46009016	Proclaiming the gospel gives me no ground of boasting ; for necessity is laid upon me ; woe is me if I preach not the gospel .
46009017	For if I do this of my own accord , I have my pay ; but if unwilling , I have at least discharged my stewardship .
46009018	What then is my wage ? This , that I can make the gospel free where I carry it ; and that I can refrain from using my rights as a preacher of the gospel .
46009019	Though free from all men , I make myself the slave of all , that I may win the more .
46009020	To the Jews I am become like a Jew , that I may win Jews ; to those under the Law , like one under the Law , though I am not under the Law , myself ;
46009021	to those outside the Law , as one outside the Law , to win those outside the Law ( though I am not outside the law of God , but inside the law of Christ ) .
46009022	I am become weak to the weak , to win the weak . I am become all these things to all men that , by any and by all means , I may save some .
46009023	And I am doing it all for the gospels sake , that I may become a copartner in it .
46009024	Do you not know that in a foot-race , though all run , only one receives the prize ? So run that you may win .
46009025	Every man who contends in the games continually trains himself by all manner of self-restraint . Now they do it to get a fading garland , but we , one that is unfading .
46009026	For my part , then , I run with no wavering to the goal . I box not as one beating the air ,
46009027	but I bruise my body and keep it in subjection , lest having called others to the contest , I should myself be disqualified .
46010001	For I would not have you ignorant , brothers , how our fathers were all under the cloud , and all passed through the sea ,
46010002	and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea .
46010003	They all ate of the same spiritual bread ,
46010004	and all drank from the same spiritual stream , for they were drinking from a spiritual rock that followed them , and that Rock was Christ .
46010005	But in most of them God was not well pleased , for they were laid low in the desert .
46010006	Now this happened as a warning for us , that we might not long for evil things as they longed .
46010007	And you must not be idolaters like some of them . as it is written , The people sat down to eat and drink , And they rose up for idol dances .
46010008	Nor must we act licentiously , as some of them did , and fell in a single day , twenty-three thousand of them .
46010009	Neither must we presume upon the patience of our Lord , as some of them presumed , and were destroyed by the serpents ;
46010010	nor murmur , as some of them did , and were destroyed by the Destroying Angel .
46010011	Now these things were happening to them typically , but were written down for our admonition who stand at the meeting of the ages .
46010012	So then let him who imagines that he is standing so securely beware lest he fall .
46010013	No temptation has overtaken you that is beyond mans power ; but God is faithful , who will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear , but will , with every temptation , provide the way of escape also , so that you may be able to withstand .
46010014	So then , my beloved , continually flee from idolatry .
46010015	I am speaking to men of sense ; do you yourselves judge what I say .
46010016	The cup of blessing which we bless , is it not a common participation in the blood of Christ ? The bread which we break , is it not a common participation in the body of Christ ?
46010017	Because we who are many are one bread , one body , for we all do share in the one loaf .
46010018	Look at Israel according to the flesh ; are not those who eat the sacrifices in communion with the altar ?
46010019	What then shall we say ? that an offering to an idol is anything ? or that an idol is really anything ?
46010020	On the contrary , what the heathen sacrifice they sacrifice to demons and not to God , and I do not want you to have communion with demons .
46010021	You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and also the cup of demons ; you cannot be partakers in the Lords table and in the table of demons .
46010022	What ! would we provoke the Lord to jealousy ? Are we stronger than he ?
46010023	" All things are lawful , " you say ? But not all things are expedient ; " all things are lawful " ; but not all build up .
46010024	Let not each one be always seeking his own , but rather his neighbors good .
46010025	Eat anything that is for sale in the markets , asking no questions for conscience sake ;
46010026	for the earth and its fulness are the Lords .
46010027	If one who is not a believer invites you to his house , and you wish to go , eat everything that is set before you , without asking questions for conscience sake .
46010028	But if any one tells you , " This food has been offered in sacrifice , " do not eat it , for the sake of him who told you ,
46010029	and for your conscience sake - his conscience , not your own . " But , " you may object , " why should my freedom be decided upon anothers scruples of conscience ?
46010030	If I eat after giving thanks , why am I denounced for eating that for which I have given thanks ? "
46010031	Because whether you are eating or whether you are drinking , you are to do it all for the glory of God .
46010032	Do not be a cause of stumbling either to Jews of to Gentiles , or to the church of God .
46010033	For so I also try to please all men in every way , not by seeking my own good , but the good of the many , that they may be saved .
46011001	Be imitators of me , as I am an imitator of Christ .
46011002	Indeed I praise you for remembering me in everything , and because you are holding fast to the traditions just as you received them .
46011003	But I wish you to understand that the head of every man is Christ , and of a wife her husband is head ; and that God is head of Christ .
46011004	Every man who prays or prophesies with head veiled dishonors his Head ;
46011005	but every woman who prays or prophesies with her head unveiled dishonors her head ( her husband ) . for it is one and the same thing as if she were shaven .
46011006	If a woman does not wear a veil , let her also cut off her hair ; now if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved , let her be veiled .
46011007	A man , indeed , ought not to have his head veiled , for he is an image and glory of God ; but woman is a glory of man .
46011008	For it is not man who was made from woman , but woman was made from man .
46011009	And man was not created for woman , but woman for man .
46011010	For this reason the woman ought to have authority over her head , because of her guardian angels .
46011011	However , in the Lord neither is woman independent of man , nor is man independent of woman ;
46011012	for just as the woman was made from the man , so also is the man born of the woman , while they both come from God .
46011013	Judge of this for your own selves . It is fitting that a woman should pray to God with her head unveiled .
46011014	Nor does nature itself teach you that it is a disgrace to a man to have long hair ,
46011015	but it is womans glory , because her hair has been given her instead of a veil .
46011016	If , however , any one is inclined to be disputatious regarding such a custom , let him know that neither I nor the churches of God hold to such a custom .
46011017	But in giving you the following instructions , I cannot praise you ; your solemn assemblies do more harm than good .
46011018	To begin with , I am told - and I believe there is some truth in it - that when you meet at a church there are divisions among you .
46011019	For there must needs be also parties among you , in order that the good may be tested and made known .
46011020	Again , when you meet together , there is no true eating of the Lords Supper ;
46011021	for each one of you begins to eat his own supper ; one goes hungry , while another gets drunk .
46011022	What ! Have you no houses in which to eat or drink ? or do you wish to show your contempt for the church of God , and to shame those who have no homes to eat in ? What shall I say to you ? Shall I praise you ? In this I certainly do not praise you .
46011023	For I passed on to you the account , which I myself received from the Lord ; how the Lord Jesus , on the very night he was betrayed , took bread ,
46011024	and when he had given thanks , he broke it , saying , " This is my body , broken for you ; this do in memory of me . "
46011025	In the same way also , he took the cup after supper , saying . " This cup is the new covenant in my blood ; do this , whenever you drink it , in memory of me . "
46011026	For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup , you are proclaiming your Lords death until he come .
46011027	So he that eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord unworthy must answer for a sin against the body and blood of the Lord .
46011028	Let each man scrutinize himself , and thus let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup .
46011029	For whoever eats and drinks without discerning the body , eats and drinks condemnation to himself .
46011030	This is why many among you are feeble and sickly , and many sleep .
46011031	If however , we were judging ourselves aright , we should not now be condemned ;
46011032	but through our condemnation by the Lord , we are trained so that we may not be condemned ;
46011033	So , my brothers , whenever you come together for this meal , wait for one another .
46011034	If any one is hungry , let him eat at home , so that your meetings do not bring condemnation upon you . The other matters I will adjust when I come .
46012001	Now concerning spiritual gifts , brothers , I do not wish you to be ignorant .
46012002	You know that when you were heathen you went astray after dumb idols , wherever he be led .
46012003	Wherefore I want you to understand that no one who speaks in the Spirit of God says , " Jesus is accursed , " and no one can say , " Jesus is Lord , " except in the Holy Spirit .
46012004	Now there are varieties of gifts , but the same Spirit ;
46012005	there are various forms of service , and the same Lord ;
46012006	and varieties of work , and the same God , who works in all .
46012007	Now to each man has been given his manifestation of the Spirit for the common good .
46012008	For to one man by the Spirit has been given a word of wisdom , to another a word of insight by the same Spirit ;
46012009	to one man by the same Spirit is given faith , to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit ;
46012010	to another the powers which work miracles , to another prophecy , to another the discernment of spirits ; to another varieties of tongues , to another the interpretation of tongues .
46012011	But the one and the same Spirit gives power to all , distributing his gifts to each as he wills .
46012012	For just as the body is one and has many members , and all the members of the body , although they be many , are one body ; so also is Christ .
46012013	And we can see this , for in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body , whether Jew or Gentile , whether slave or free , and we were all made to drink of one Spirit .
46012014	For the body is not one member , but many .
46012015	If the foot should say , " Because I am a hand , I am not part a part the body , " would it not indeed be a part of the body ?
46012016	Or if the ear should say , " Because I am not an eye , I am not a part of the body , " would it be any less a part of the body ?
46012017	If the whole body were an eye , where were hearing ? If all were hearing , where were smelling ?
46012018	But now God has set the members , each one of them , in the body as it has pleased him .
46012019	If all were one member , where would the body be ?
46012020	But now there are many members , but one body .
46012021	And the eye cannot say to the hand , " I have no need of you " . nor again of head to the feet , " I have no need for you . "
46012022	On the contrary , we need those members of the body which seem to be weaker ;
46012023	upon those parts of the body which we esteem less honorable , we bestow more abundant honor , and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness .
46012024	For whereas our comely parts have no need , God has tempered the body together , giving more abundant honor to that member in which lacked ;
46012025	that there should be no disunion in the body , but that members mutual care for one another .
46012026	When one member suffers , all the others suffer with it ; and when one member is honored , all the members are glad with it .
46012027	Now you are the body of Christ , and individually members of it .
46012028	And God has appointed those in the church to be first of all apostles , second , prophets , third , teachers . then workers of miracles , healers , helpers , administrators , users of various kinds of " tongues . "
46012029	Are all apostles ? Are all prophets ? teachers ? workers of miracles ?
46012030	Have all gifts of healing ? Do all speak with tongues ? Do all interpret ?
46012031	Desire earnestly the greater gifts . And yet I will go on to show you a still more excellent way .
46013001	Though I speak in the tongues of men and of angels , but have no love , I am become a clanging brass , or a clashing cymbal .
46013002	Though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge , and have all faith , so that I could remove mountains , but have not love , I am nothing .
46013003	And though I sell all my goods to feed the poor , and though I give my body to be burned , but have not love , it avails me nothing .
46013004	Love suffers long and is kind ; love envies not ; love makes no parade , is not puffed up ,
46013005	is not rude , nor selfish , nor easily provoked . Love bears no malice , never rejoices over wrong-doing ,
46013006	but rejoices when the truth rejoices .
46013007	It knows how to be silent , it is trustful , hopeful , patient , enduring .
46013008	Love never fails ; but though there are prophecies , they will fail ; though there are tongues , they will cease ; though there is knowledge , it will be superseded .
46013009	For our knowing is imperfect , and our prophesying is imperfect ;
46013010	but when the perfect is come , then the perfect will be done away .
46013011	When I was a child I spoke like a child , felt like a child , thought like a child ; now that I am become a man , I have done with childish things .
46013012	For now we see as in a mirror , and are baffled , but then face to face ; now I know in fragments , but then shall I understand even as I also have been understood .
46013013	Faith , Hope , Love endure - these three ; but the greatest of these is Love .
46014001	Hotly pursue this love , yet seek earnestly spiritual gifts , and chiefly that you may prophesy .
46014002	For he who speaks in a " tongue " speaks not to man but to God , for no one understands him , but in the Spirit he utters secret truths .
46014003	But he who prophesies addresses words to men that build up , encourage , and console .
46014004	He who speaks in a tongue upbuilds himself ; but he who prophesies upbuilds the church .
46014005	Now I should like you all to speak with " tongues " ; but I should rather that you prophesied , For he who prophesies is greater than he who speaks with tongues , unless he interprets , so that the church may be built up .
46014006	Now brothers , if I should come to you speaking with tongues , what should I benefit you , unless I speak to you some revelation , or knowledge , or prophecy , or teaching ?
46014007	For if lifeless instruments such as the flute or the harp give no distinction in the sounds , how shall it be known what is fluted or harped ?
46014008	Or , for example , if the trumpet give an uncertain sound , what soldier will be prepared for battle ?
46014009	In the same way with you , if you utter unintelligible words with your tongue , how can what you say be understood ? You will be speaking to the winds !
46014010	There are , let us say , so many languages in the world , and none without its meaning .
46014011	If then I do not know the force of expression , I shall seem a barbarian to the one who uses it , and he will seem a barbarian to me .
46014012	So also in your case , since you are ambitious for spiritual gifts , seek to excel in them for the upbuilding of the church .
46014013	So let him who speaks with tongues pray that he may interpret .
46014014	For if I pray in an unknown tongue , my spirit prays , but my mind is barren .
46014015	What then ? I will pray with my spirit , and I will pray also with my mind . I will praise God with my spirit , but I will praise him with my mind , also .
46014016	For if you in your spirit bless God , how shall he who fills the place of the unlearned say the Amen to your thanksgiving , when he does not know what you are talking about ?
46014017	You on the one hand offer a good thanksgiving , but the other is not built up .
46014018	Thank God I speak with tongues more than you all ,
46014019	but in the church I would rather speak five words with my understanding , so as to instruct others , than ten thousand in an unknown tongue .
46014020	Brothers , do not become children in understanding ; be babes in malice , but in understanding become mature men .
46014021	In the Law it is written . With men of other tongues , and by the lips of strangers , will I speak to this people , and even then they will not listen to me , says the Lord .
46014022	So then the gift of tongues is for a sign , not to believers , but to unbelievers ; but prophecy is not for unbelievers , but for those who believe .
46014023	Accordingly , when the whole church assemblies , and everybody is speaking " with tongues , " if there enter men unlearned or unbelieving , will they not say that you are mad ?
46014024	But if all are prophesying when an unlearned or unbelieving man enters , he is convicted in conscience by your speaker , he feels himself judged by all ,
46014025	and the secret depths of his heart are laid open . So he will fall upon his face and worship God , saying , " Of a truth , God is with you . "
46014026	What follows , then , brothers ? Whenever you meet together , each contributes something ; a psalm , a sermon , a revelation , a tongue , an interpretation . Let all be done for edification .
46014027	If any one speaks in an unknown tongue , let it be by two , or at the most by three , and that in turn , and let some one interpret .
46014028	But if there is no one to interpret , let them keep silence in the church , and speak to themselves and to God .
46014029	Let the prophets speak by two or three , and let the others exercise their judgment .
46014030	But if to one as he sits there some revelation is made , let the first be silent .
46014031	For you can all prophesy one by one ; so that all may be learning , and all may be encouraged .
46014032	The spirits of prophets are subject to prophets ,
46014033	for God is not a God of confusion , but of peace . This custom prevails in all the churches of the saints .
46014034	" In your congregation " you write , " as in all the churches of the saints , let the women keep silence in the churches , for they are not permitted to speak . On the contrary let them be subordinate , as also says the law .
46014035	And if they want to learn anything , let them ask their own husbands at home , for it is shameful for a women to speak in church . "
46014036	What , was it from you that the word of God went forth , or to you only did it come ?
46014037	If any one thinks himself a prophet or spiritual , let him recognize that what I am now writing you is a command of the Lord .
46014038	But if any one disregard it he will be disregarded .
46014039	So , my brothers , be ambitious for the gift of prophecy , and speak not against the gifts of tongues .
46014040	Let everything be done decently and in order .
46015001	Now I am calling to your remembrance , brothers , the gospel which I preached to you , which you also received , and on which you have taken your stand , The first man is of the earth , earthly ; the second Man is of heaven .
46015002	by which also you are saved , if you are holding fast the message which I preached to you ; unless indeed you have believed in vain .
46015003	For the very first thing I taught you was that I had myself been taught , that Christ died for our sins according to the Scripture ,
46015004	that he was buried , and that he was raised the third day , according to the Scriptures ,
46015005	and was seen by Cephas , and then by the Twelve .
46015006	Afterward he was seen at one time by more than five hundred brethren , most of whom are still alive , but some are fallen asleep .
46015007	Then he was seen by James , then by all the apostles ,
46015008	and last of all , as by one born out of due time , he was seen by me also .
46015009	For I am the least of the apostles , I who am not worthy to be called an apostle , because I persecuted the church of God .
46015010	But by the grace of God I am what I am , and that grace of his , bestowed upon me , did not prove ineffectual . I labored more abundantly than all the rest , yet not I , but by the grace of God that is with me .
46015011	But whether it is I or they , thus do I preach , and thus you came to believe .
46015012	If then , we are preaching Christ , that he rose from the dead , how are some of you saying that there is no resurrection from the dead ?
46015013	But if there is no resurrection from the dead , then not even Christ has been raised ;
46015014	and if Christ has not been raised , then our preaching is vain , and vain also is your faith .
46015015	More than that , we are detected in bearing false witness against God ; because we testified of God that he raised Christ from the dead , whom he did not raise , if indeed the dead rise not .
46015016	For if the dead rise not , neither has Christ arisen ;
46015017	and if Christ be not risen , your faith is vain , you are still in your sins .
46015018	More than that , those who are sleeping in Christ have perished .
46015019	If in this life only we have hope in Christ , we are of all mankind most pitiable .
46015020	But now , now , Christ is risen from the dead , the first-fruit of those who have fallen asleep .
46015021	For since by man came to death , by man came also the resurrection from the dead .
46015022	For just as in Adam all die , so also in Christ all will be made alive .
46015023	But each in his own order ; Christ the first-fruits , then those who belong to Christ at his appearing .
46015024	And then the end , when he shall hand over his kingdom to God his Father , after he has abolished all rule and authority and power .
46015025	For he must rule until he has put all his enemies under his feet .
46015026	The last enemy that will be destroyed is Death .
46015027	For He hast put all things under his feet , but in that quotation All things are put under him , it is evident that God is excepted , who put all things under Him .
46015028	For when everything is subjected to him , then the Son himself shall subject himself to Him who made them subject , that God may be all in all .
46015029	Else what shall they do who are baptized for the dead ? If the dead are really not raised , why are they baptized for them ?
46015030	Yes , and why am I myself exposed to danger every hour ?
46015031	Every day I am facing death , my brothers , I affirm it by that pride in you which I have through Christ Jesus our Lord .
46015032	If after the manner of men I have fought with wild beasts at Ephesus , what good does it do me ? If the dead do not rise , Let us eat and drink , For we shall be dead tomorrow .
46015033	Do not deceive yourselves . Evil companions ruin good morals .
46015034	Wake up , do justly , cease from sin ; for I say to your shame that some of you have no acquaintance with God .
46015035	But some one will ask . " How are the dead raised ? and with what body are they coming ? "
46015036	Foolish man ! The seed you sow does not come to life unless it dies .
46015037	And when you sow the seed you are not sowing the body that it will become , but bare grain , of wheat perhaps , or some other grain .
46015038	But God gives it what body he pleases , and to each kind of seed its own body .
46015039	All flesh is not the same flesh ; there is human flesh , another of fishes of animals , another of birds , another of fishes .
46015040	There are both celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial ; but the splendor of the celestial is one thing , and the splendor of the terrestrial is another .
46015041	There is one glory of the sun , another of the moon , and another of the stars ; for star differs from star in glory .
46015042	So it is in the resurrection of the dead . It is sown in corruption , It is raised in incorruption ;
46015043	Sown in weakness , It is raised in power ;
46015044	The body sown is animal The body is raised is spiritual . If there is an animal body , there is also a spiritual body .
46015045	Thus it is written . The first man , Adam , became a living being , the last Adam , a life-giving Spirit .
46015046	Now it is not the spiritual which is first , but the animal , and then the spiritual .
46015048	Like him who was of earth , are the earthy ; and like Him who is of heaven , are the heavenly ;
46015049	As we have borne the likeness of him who was of earth , so also let us bear the likeness of Him who is of heaven .
46015050	I tell you this , brothers , that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God ; nor can corruption inherit incorruption .
46015051	Lo , I tell you a secret truth . we shall not all be sleeping , but we shall be changed ,
46015052	in a moment , in the twinkling of an eye , when the last trumpet sounds . For the trumpet will sound , and the dead will be raised , incorruptible , and we shall be changed .
46015053	For this corruptible must be clothed with incorruption , and this mortal must be clothed with immortality .
46015054	And when this mortal has been clothed with immortality , then will the words of Scripture come to pass , Death has been swallowed up in victory .
46015055	Where , Death , is thy victory ? Where , Death , is thy sting ?
46015056	Now the sting of death is sin , and the power of sin is the Law .
46015057	But thanks be to God , who has given us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ .
46015058	So , my brothers beloved , stand firm , immovable , always abounding in work for the Lord , because you know that your toil is not fruitless in the Lord .
46016001	Now concerning the offering for the saints , you also are to do as I directed the church of Galatia .
46016002	On the first day of each week let each of you put aside something , keeping it in store as he may prosper , so that when I come there may be no collections going on .
46016003	On my arrival I will send those whom you may accredit by letter to carry your bounty to Jerusalem .
46016004	And if it is worth while for me to go too , they will accompany me .
46016005	Now I shall come to you after I have gone through Macedonia .
46016006	I shall remain some time with you ; possibly spending the winter , in order that you may help me forward in whatever journey I take .
46016007	For I do not wish at this present time to see you merely in passing ; but if the Lord permits , I hope to remain some time with you .
46016008	I am staying for the present in Ephesus , until Pentecost ;
46016009	for a door has opened to me , great and effectual , and the opponents are many .
46016010	If Timothy come , see to it that he is among you without trepidation ; for he is doing the Lords work , as I am , so let no one disparage him .
46016011	Whenever he comes to me , send him on his way in peace , for I am expecting him with the other brothers .
46016012	As for our Apollos , I have many times urged him to go to you with the others , but he was always unwilling to go to you at this time . He will come , however , whenever he has a good opportunity .
46016013	Be watchful , stand firm in the faith , be manly , be strong .
46016014	Let all that you do be done in love .
46016015	I beg you this , my brothers - you know the household of Stephanus , that they were the first-fruits of Achaia , and that they devoted themselves to the service of the saints -
46016016	so I want you also to show deference to such , and to every fellow worker , and laborer .
46016017	I am glad that Stephanus and Fortunatus and Achaicus have arrived , for they have made up for your absence .
46016018	They refresh my spirit as they do yours . So cultivate the acquaintance of such men .
46016019	The churches of Asia greet you . Aquila and Priscilla ( Prisca ) , with the church that meets in their house , greet you heartily in the Lord .
46016020	All the brothers send greetings . Greet one another with a holy kiss .
46016021	The greeting of me , Paul , with my own hand .
46016022	If any one does not love the Lord , let him be accursed . Our Lord is coming .
46016023	The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you .
46016024	My love be with you all in Christ Jesus .
47001001	To the Church of God which is in Corinth , and to all the saints throughout Greece . from Paul , by Gods will an apostle of Christ , and from brother Timothy .
47001002	Grace to you and peace from God our Father in the Lord Jesus Christ .
47001003	Thanks be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of tender mercies and the God of all comfort ,
47001004	who ever comforts me in all my troubles , so that I may be continually able to comfort those who are in any trouble by the comfort with which God is ever comforting me .
47001005	For just as I have more than my share in the sufferings of the Christ , so also through the Christ I have more than my share of comfort .
47001006	If I am afflicted , it is for your comfort and salvation ; and if I am receiving comfort , it is for your comfort - a comfort produced within you by your patient fortitude , under the same sufferings which I also am enduring .
47001007	My hope for you is firm ; for I know that as you are comrades in my sufferings , so also are you comrades in my comfort .
47001008	Now , brothers , I want you to know about the troubles which befell me in Asia ; how I was burdened altogether beyond my strength , so that I renounced all hope even of life itself .
47001009	Indeed , I had in myself , and still have , the sentence of death , in order that I might not rely on myself , but on God who raises the dead to life .
47001010	He delivered me from such a death , and will deliver me . On him I have set my hopes that he will continue to deliver me ,
47001011	while all of you also are helping me by your prayers ; so that from many lips thanksgiving may rise on my behalf for the blessings vouchsafed to me through the intercessions of many .
47001012	For this is my proud boast , the testimony of my conscience , that it was in holiness and with pure motives before God , not in worldly wisdom , but in the grace of God , that I have conducted myself in the world , and above all in my relations with you .
47001013	For I am writing to you nothing different from what you read aloud and very well recognize , and I hope will continue to recognize to the very end ,
47001014	as some indeed did recognize in part at last , that I am your cause of boasting , just as you will be mine on the Day of Jesus our Lord .
47001015	And in this confidence I intended to visit you , before going elsewhere , that you might have a pleasure twice over .
47001016	I intended to go by you into Macedonia , and to come again to you from Macedonia , and by you to be sent forward on my way to Judea .
47001017	In purposing this did I display " caprice " ? Or what I purpose do I purpose in a worldly way , so that it may mean either " Yes , yes , " or " No , no " ?
47001018	As God is faithful , my message to you is not now " Yes , " now " No . "
47001019	For Jesus Christ , Son of God , who was proclaimed among you by us , that is , by Silvanus and Timothy and me , was not wavering between " Yes " and " No , " but in him is the everlasting " Yes . "
47001020	For however many are the promises of God , in him they are " Yes . " Therefore also through him let the Amen be said by our voices to the glory of God .
47001021	And he who has established me with you in the Anointed One , and has anointed me , is God .
47001022	He has also set his seal upon me , and given me the pledge of his Spirit in my heart .
47001023	But for my part I call God to witness , as my soul shall answer for it , that it was to spare you that I came not to Corinth
47001024	( not that I am attempting to lord it over your faith , but rather to work with you for your happiness ) ; for your faith is stedfast .
47002001	I decided that I would not visit you again in grief ;
47002002	for if I cause you grief , who is there to cause me joy except those whom I have grieved ?
47002003	And for this very reason I wrote you , that I might not come only to be grieved by those who ought to give me joy ; and because I trusted in you all , that my joy is the joy of all of you .
47002004	For I wrote to you out of much affliction and anguish of heart , through many tears ; not to pain you , but to convince you of my love , my abundant love for you .
47002005	As to him who has been , and now is , causing pain , it is not I whom he has pained , but all of you - at least some of you ( not to overstate the case ) .
47002006	Sufficient for the offender is the punishment imposed by the majority ;
47002007	so that now you ought rather to forgive and comfort him , lest he should be overwhelmed by the excess of his grief .
47002008	So I beg you to reinstate him in your love .
47002009	For this very purpose also I wrote you ( before ) , that I might test you , to see if you were obedient in every respect .
47002010	If you forgive the man , I forgive him , too ; for whatever I have forgiven has been forgiven in the presence of Christ ,
47002011	for your sakes , that I may not be overreached by Satan , for I am not ignorant of his devices .
47002012	Now when I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ , although a door was opened to me in the Lord ,
47002013	I could get no peace of mind because I failed to find Titus , my brother . So I bade them good-bye and started off for Macedonia .
47002014	But thanks be to God , who in every place is leading me in the train of Christs triumph , and is making manifest through me the knowledge of him , an odor of incense everywhere .
47002015	I am Christs fragrance upwafted unto God , among those who are being saved and those who are perishing ;
47002016	to these latter an odor of death to death , to the former , of life to life . For such service as this , who is sufficient ?
47002017	I am ; for I am not like most , trafficking in the word of God , but rather from a sincere heart , like a man of God , I speak in Christ , in the very presence of God .
47003001	Am I beginning again to " recommend " myself ? Or do I need , as some do , letters of commendation either to you or from you ?
47003002	You are my letter , written on my heart , known and read by all men .
47003003	Since all can see that you are a letter of Christ transcribed by men , written not with ink , but with the Spirit of the living God , not on tablets of stone , but on human hearts as tablets .
47003004	Such confidence I have through Christ before God .
47003005	Not that I am sufficient in myself to reach any conclusion in my own wisdom ; but my sufficiency is from God .
47003006	It is he who has also made me sufficient as a minister of a new covenant ; not of a letter but of a spirit ; for the letter kills , but the spirit makes alive .
47003007	If , however , the administration of death , written with letters and engraved on stones , began in glory , so that the children of Israel could not gaze steadily on the face of Moses , because of the glory of his face - a glory even then fading -
47003008	how much more shall the ministry of the Spirit abide in glory ?
47003009	For if the ministry of condemnation had glory , far more is the ministry of righteousness radiant in glory .
47003010	Indeed that which once was glorious has lost its glory , because of the glory which surpasses it .
47003011	For if that which was fading came in glory , far more will that which ever abides be glorious .
47003012	Therefore , cherishing such a hope , I use great freedom of speech .
47003013	I do not do as Moses did , who used to cover his face with a veil to keep the children of Israel from beholding the passing of a fading glory .
47003014	Nay , their minds were made dull ; for to this very day , at the public reading of the Old Testament , the same veil rests thereon , because it is not revealed to them that in Christ the veil is taken away .
47003015	Yes , to this very day , whenever Moses is read , a veil lies on their hearts ;
47003016	but when their heart turns to our Lord the veil is stripped away .
47003017	( The Lord means the Spirit , and where the Spirit of the Lord abides there is freedom . )
47003018	And we all , with unveiled faces , reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord , are ourselves continually being transformed into the same likeness , from glory to glory , as by the Lord , the Spirit .
47004001	So then , as I have this ministry because of Gods mercy to me , I do not lose heart .
47004002	I have renounced the hidden things of shame , not spending my life in craftiness , nor adulterating the word of God ; but setting forth the truth openly , I strive to commend myself to every mans conscience as in the sight of God .
47004003	But even if my gospel , too , is " veiled , " it is among those who are on the way to perish that it is " veiled . "
47004004	Among them the god of this age has blinded the understanding of the unbelieving so that the sunshine of the gospel of God , should not dawn upon them .
47004005	It is not myself that I proclaim , but Christ Jesus as Master , and myself that I proclaim , and myself your slave for Jesus sake .
47004006	For God who said , " Out of darkness light shall shine , " is he who has shone in my heart , that the sunrise of the knowledge of God may shine forth in the face of Christ .
47004007	But I hold this treasure in an earthen vessel , in order that the surpassing greatness of the power may be from God , and not from myself .
47004008	On every side I am hard pressed , yet not hemmed in ; perplexed , but not in despair ;
47004009	persecuted , but not forsaken ; struck down , but not destroyed .
47004010	Wherever I go , I am always carrying about in my body the dying of Jesus , in order that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in this body of mine .
47004011	For , alive though I am , I am always given over to death for the sake of Jesus , that the life also of Jesus may shine forth in my dying flesh .
47004012	So while death is working in me , life is working in you .
47004013	But having the same spirit of faith of which it is written , I believed , and therefore have spoken , I also believe and so I speak .
47004014	For I know that He who raised from the dead the Lord Jesus , will raise me also with Jesus , and set me at your side in his presence .
47004015	For everything is for your sakes , so that more abundant grace , because of the thanksgiving of many voices , might overflow to the glory of God .
47004016	For this reason , as I have said , I do not lose courage , but even though my outward man is wasting away , my inward man is being renewed , day by day .
47004017	For my light affliction , which is but for a moment , is working out for me a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory ,
47004018	while I am gazing not at things seen , but at things unseen ; for things seen are temporal , but things unseen are eternal .
47005001	For I know , if this earthly tent of mine were struck , I have a mansion built by God , a house not made with hands , eternal in the heavens .
47005002	For in this tent I am groaning , earnestly longing to be under the cover of my heavenly habitation ; if so be that being so covered ,
47005003	I shall not be found naked .
47005004	For in this tent of mine I am groaning in deep trouble ; not that I wish to be unclothed , but to be clothed upon , that what is mortal may be swallowed up in life .
47005005	And He who has wrought me out for this very end is God , who has given me his Spirit as pledge .
47005006	Therefore I am always of good courage , because I well know that while I am at home in the body , I am in banishment from the Lord ,
47005007	for I am walking by faith , not by sight .
47005008	So I have good courage , and am well pleased rather , to be in banishment from the body and to be at home with the Lord .
47005009	And for this reason I also make it home with the Lord .
47005010	For we must all be made manifest , in our true characters , before the Judgment-seat of Christ ; so that each one may receive according to that which he has done in his body , whether good or evil .
47005011	So , because I know the fear of God , I " persuade men . " What I am is manifest to God , and I hope manifest also to your conscience .
47005012	I am not " commending myself to you again , " but I am giving you an occasion of boasting on my behalf , so that you may have an answer ready for those who boast in externals , and not in the heart .
47005013	For if I was " beside myself , " it was to God ; of if I am now " of sound mind , " it is for you .
47005014	For the love of Christ overmasters me ; because I thus judge that if One has died for all , then all have died ;
47005015	and that he died for all in order that the living may live no longer for themselves , but for Him who died and rose again for them .
47005016	Therefore henceforth I know no one simply as a man - even if I have known Christ as a man , yet now I do so no longer .
47005017	So there is a new creation when any man is in Christ . The old life has passed away , behold , the new is come .
47005018	And all this is from God , who through Christ reconciled me to himself , and gave me the ministry of reconciliation ;
47005019	how that God was in Christ reconciling a world to himself , not reckoning to men their trespasses ; and that to me he has entrusted the message of that reconciliation .
47005020	On Christs behalf , then , I come as ambassador . It is as though God was entreating you , through me , on Christs behalf I beg you to be reconciled to God .
47005021	Him who knew no sin , in our behalf he has made to be sin ; so that in him we might become the righteousness of God .
47006001	As a worker with him I beseech you not to receive the grace of God in vain .
47006002	For he said . In an acceptable time have I heard thee , And in the day of salvation have I succored thee . Behold , now is the acceptable time ! behold , now is the day of salvation !
47006003	I am giving no one a cause of stumbling in order that my ministry may not be discredited ;
47006004	but in every way I am striving to commend myself as Gods minister by stedfast endurance , by afflictions , by troubles , by distresses ,
47006005	by floggings , by imprisonment ; in riots , in labors , in sleepless watching , in hunger and thirst ;
47006006	with purity , understanding , patience , and kindness ; by the Holy Spirit , by love sincere ,
47006007	by a true teaching and an energy divine ; by the weapons of righteousness , for attack or for defense ,
47006008	amid honor or dishonor , amid evil report and good report ; as a deceiver and yet true ;
47006009	as unknown and yet well known ; as at deaths door , yet , strange to tell , I live on ; as chastened , but not killed ;
47006010	as grieved , but always glad ; as poor , but making many rich ; as having nothing , yet possessing everything .
47006011	O Corinthians , I am unsealing my lips to you ; my heart is wide open to you .
47006012	There is no narrowness in my love ; but the narrowness is in your own .
47006013	I pray you , therefore , in fair exchange ( I speak as to my children ) , let your hearts also be wide open to me .
47006014	Be not unequally yoked with unbelievers ; for what fellowship has righteousness with lawlessness ? what communion has light with darkness ?
47006015	What concord has Christ with Belial ? What portion has a believer with an unbeliever ?
47006016	And what compact has Gods temple with idols ? For we are a temple of the living God , as he has said . I will dwell among them , and walk about among them ; I will be their God , and they will be my people .
47006017	Therefore , Come out from among them and separate yourselves , saith the Lord , touch not what is unclean ;
47006018	then I will receive you and will be to you a Father , and you shall be to me sons and daughters , saith the Lord Almighty .
47007001	As these promises are ours , beloved , let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and of spirit , and perfect our holiness in the fear of God .
47007002	Make room for me in your hearts ! I have wronged no man , I have ruined no man , I have defrauded no man .
47007003	I am not saying this to blame you , for as I have already said , I hold you in my heart to live together and to die together .
47007004	Great is my faith in you ; great is my cheerful assurance in you . I am filled with comfort ; in spite of all my troubles , my heart is overflowing with joy .
47007005	For even after I reached Macedonia , my flesh had no rest , but I was troubled on every hand . Without were fights ; within were , fears .
47007006	But the God who comforts the down-hearted comforted me by the coming of Titus ,
47007007	and not alone by his coming , but also by the comfort you had been to him . For he told me of your eager longing , of your penitence , and of your zeal on my behalf , so that I was happier still .
47007008	Even if I caused you pain by my letter , I do not regret ; though I did regret it when I saw that my letter had caused you pain , even for a time .
47007009	But now I am glad ; not because you were pained ; but because your pain led you to repentance .
47007010	For your pain came from God , and so you took no harm from me . For the pain which is from God works repentance leading to salvation , a repentance never to be regretted . But the worlds pain works death .
47007011	Note the results of this pain which God permitted ; what earnestness it has called forth in you , what explanations , what indignation , what alarm , what longing , what fervor , what punishment of wrong . In every way you have proved yourselves innocent in the matter .
47007012	So then , even if I did write to you , it was not for the sake of the wrong-doer , or of him who had been wronged , but to make clear to yourselves in the sight of God your earnest care for me .
47007013	This is what comforts me . In addition to this comfort of mine , I have been made still happier by the happiness of Titus ; because his spirit was refreshed by you all .
47007014	Although I have been boasting a little to him about you , I have not been put to shame . But as in every matter I have spoken the truth to you , so also my boast to Titus has been proved to be the truth .
47007015	And his tender affection is all the greater toward you , when he calls to mind the obedience of you all , and the fear and trembling with which you received him .
47007016	I rejoice that I have complete confidence in you .
47008001	Now , brothers , I wish to tell you about the grace of God which has been manifest in the churches of Macedonia .
47008002	For although in heavy trial of affliction , their overbrimming happiness , even in spite of their deep poverty , abounded to the opulence of their unselfishness .
47008003	For I can testify that according to their ability , and even beyond their ability , of their own free will , too , they have given help .
47008004	With earnest entreaty they craved of me the privilege of a share in ministering to the saints in Jerusalem .
47008005	And this not as I had expected , but in accordance with the will of God , they first gave themselves to God and to me .
47008006	With the result that I have been begging Titus that , as he had been the one to begin the work with you , so he should complete among you this grace also .
47008007	Now then , as you excel in everything , in faith and utterance and knowledge and all zeal and in your love to me , see to it that you excel in this grace also .
47008008	I do not say this by way of command , but by the zeal of others I am trying to prove the reality of your love .
47008009	For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , how though he was rich , for your sakes he became poor , that you through his poverty might become rich .
47008010	And I will give you my opinion in this matter ; for this offering is fitting in your case , considering that you made a beginning before others , not only in the willingness to do something but also in actually doing something a year ago .
47008011	So now complete the doing of it also , in order that just as there was the readiness to will , so there may be the accomplishment according to your means .
47008012	For if there be first willing mind , the gift is accepted according to what a man has , and not according to what he has not .
47008013	Nor are other people to be relieved , and you to be distressed ;
47008014	but burdens are to be equalized . Now your abundance at this present time present time is a supply for their want , in supply for your want ; and so burdens be equalized ,
47008015	even as it is written , He who gathered much had nothing over , and he who gathered little did not lack .
47008016	But thanks be to God who has inspired in the heart of Titus the same zeal on your behalf that I have .
47008017	For he not only consented to my request , but being thoroughly in earnest , comes to you of his own accord .
47008018	And I am sending with him that brother whose fame in the service of the gospel is spread through all the churches .
47008019	More than that , he is the one chosen by the churches to accompany me on my journey , in administering this gift of yours for the Lords glory . And this has my full consent ,
47008020	because I am on my guard in this , that no one should blame me , in respect to this bounty which I am administering .
47008021	For I aim at being above reproach , not only in the sight of the Lord , but also in the sight of men .
47008022	With them I am sending our brother of whose zeal I have often had proof in many ways , and who is now zealous because of his great confidence in you .
47008023	As for Titus , remember that he is a partner of mine , and is also my associate in labors for you . As for the other brothers , remember that they are delegates from the churches , men in whom Christ is glorified .
47008024	So show to the churches an evidence of your love , and a justification to these brothers of my boasting about you .
47009001	It is indeed unnecessary for me to write you in regard to the ministration to the saints at Jerusalem ,
47009002	for I know how ready you are , and am always boasting about you to the Macedonians , telling them that Greece has been ready for a year past ; and your zeal has been a spur to the majority of them .
47009003	Nevertheless I am sending the brothers in order that my boast about you may not prove vain in this instance ; so that , as I kept saying , you may be prepared .
47009004	For if any Macedonians come with me and find you not ready , shame would come upon me ( not to speak of you ) in respect to this confidence .
47009005	So I have thought that I must ask these brothers to visit you beforehand , and get your promised contribution ready in advance . I want it to be given of your bounty , not extorted from your covetousness .
47009006	Mark this ; he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly ; and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully .
47009007	But let each give according to the purpose of his heart ; not grudgingly of under compulsion . It is a cheerful giver that God loves .
47009008	And God is able to give you an overflowing measure of every grace , so that all your wants of every kind may be supplied at all times , and you may give of your abundance to every good work ;
47009009	As it is written . He scattered broadcast , he gave to the poor ; His almsgiving continues forever .
47009010	He who ever supplies seed to the sower , and bread for the food of man , will supply and make plentous your seed , and increase the harvest springing up from your almsgiving .
47009011	You yourselves will be enriched with all good things , that you may give ungrudgingly ; and your gifts , of which I am the agent , will make men give thanks to God .
47009012	Because the ministry of this contribution not only supplies the needs of the saints , but also overflows in many a thanksgiving to God .
47009013	For this ministration proves you . On account of it men glorify God for your faithfulness to your professions of the gospel of Christ , and for the liberality of your gifts to them and to all .
47009014	Moreover , in their prayers for you they will be longing after you , because of the exceeding grace of God that is resting upon you .
47009015	THANKS BE TO GOD FOR HIS UNSPEAKABLE GIFT !
47010001	Now I Paul , myself , appeal to you by the humble-heartedness and selflessness of Christ - Paul who " in your presence is humble , but bold enough when he is absent " -
47010002	I beseech you , and I say , do not make me show my boldness , when I come in the boldness with which I think I shall show my courage against some who think that I am walking on the low level of the flesh .
47010003	Though I do walk on the low level of the flesh , I do not make war as the flesh does ;
47010004	for the weapons of my warfare are not weapons of the flesh , but mighty for God , in pulling down all fortresses .
47010005	For I pull down imaginations and every crag that lifts itself against the knowledge of God . And I carry every thought away into captivity and subjection to Christ ;
47010006	and I am fully prepared to punish every act of disobedience , when once your submission has been put beyond question .
47010007	Look these facts in the face . If any man is fully persuaded as regards himself that he belongs to Christ , let him consider again with himself , that just as he is Christs , so also am I .
47010008	If , however , I were to boast more loudly concerning the authority which the Lord gave me ( not to cast you down , but to build you up ) , I should have no cause for shame .
47010009	Let it not seem as if I were overawing you with my letters .
47010010	" His letters indeed , " says one , " are mighty and forcible , but his personality is weak , and his speech contemptible . "
47010011	Let such a man assure himself that my actions , when I am present , will be just like my words in my letters when I am absent .
47010012	I have not indeed the audacity to class myself among , or compare myself with , certain of the self-commenders ; yet they are not wise in measuring themselves by one another and in comparing themselves with one another .
47010013	I , however , will not indulge in undue boasting , but will confine it within the limits of the sphere to which God has assigned me - a sphere which reaches even to you .
47010014	For I am not overstepping the limits of my authority , as though I reached you not ; since I have already come even as far as Corinth to proclaim the gospel of Christ .
47010015	I am not " boasting beyond measure in the labors of others , " but it is my hope that , as your faith goes on increasing among yourselves , by the enlargement of my appointed limits ,
47010016	I may carry the gospel to countries beyond you ; and not be boasting of work made ready to my hand within another mans limit .
47010017	Meanwhile . Let him who boasts , boast in the Lord .
47010018	For a man is proved worthy , not by his self-commendation , but when he is commended by the Lord .
47011001	Would that you could put up with a little " folly " from me ! Nay , do bear with me .
47011002	I have a divine jealousy on your behalf ; for I betrothed you to one only husband , even to Christ , that I might present you to him , a chaste virgin .
47011003	But I fear lest , just as the serpent beguiled Eve in his craftiness , so your minds should be seduced from your single-mindedness and purity toward Christ .
47011004	If indeed some one is coming to preach another Jesus , whom I did not preach , or you are receiving a Spirit other than you once received , or another gospel which you did not accept before , you would do well to bear with me .
47011005	For I reckon that I am in no respect behind your superapostolic apostles .
47011006	Yes , though I be unskilled in speech , at least I am not in knowledge ; indeed I made this perfectly plain to you in all things and among all men .
47011007	Is it a sin , forsooth , that I humbled myself that you might be exalted , in preaching the gospel to you free of cost ?
47011008	Other churches I spoiled , and took their wages to do you service .
47011009	Even when I lacked the actual necessities of life while I was with you , I was a burden to no one ; for whatever I lacked , the brothers from Macedonia supplied , when they came . So I kept myself from being a burden to you in any way , and will continue to do so .
47011010	As the truth of Christ is in me , this boasting of mine shall not be stopped within the boundaries of Greece !
47011011	And why ? Because I love you not ? God knows I do .
47011012	I am doing and will continue to do this in order to cut away the ground from under those who wish some cause for slander ; and that the ground of their boasting may appear as does mine .
47011013	For such fellows are sham apostles of Christ .
47011014	No wonder ! for Satan himself disguises himself as an angel of light .
47011015	It is no great marvel , then , if his ministers also disguise themselves as ministers of righteousness . Their end will be according to their works .
47011016	I say again , let no one think me a fool . Or , if you must , at least bear with me as a fool , that I , too , may do a little boasting .
47011017	What I am about to say I am not speaking by the Lords command , but as it were in pure folly , in this boldness of boasting .
47011018	Since so many are making worldly boasts , I shall boast , too !
47011019	Although you are wise , you put up with fools willingly enough !
47011020	You put up with it , though they make slaves of you , live on you , seize your property , lord it over you , even strike you in the face , in the way of degradation !
47011021	I say that I was weak , and yet for whatever reason any one is bold ( I speak in mere folly ) I too am bold .
47011022	Are they Hebrews ? So am I . Are they descendants of Israel ? So am I . Are they descendants of Abraham ? So am I .
47011023	Are they ministers of Christ ? ( I speak as though I were beside myself ) , such , far , more , am I ; in labors more abundant , in imprisonments also more abundant , in floggings beyond measure , in deaths often .
47011024	Five times at the hands of the Jews , I have received one short of forty lashes .
47011025	Three times I have been scourged by the Romans ; once I have been stoned ; three times have I been shipwrecked ; a night and a day have I been adrift in the open sea .
47011026	My journeys have been many ; in perils of rivers , in perils of bandits ; in perils from my countrymen , in perils in the city , in perils in the wilderness ; in perils on the sea , in perils among false brothers ;
47011027	in toil and weariness , often in sleepless watching , in hunger and thirst , often without anything to eat ; in cold and in nakedness .
47011028	Not to mention other things , there is the crowding pressure of each day upon me , the care of all the churches .
47011029	Who is weak , and I am not weak ? Who is caused to stumble , but I burn with indignation ?
47011030	If boast I must , it shall be concerning my weakness .
47011031	The God and Father of the Lord Jesus , he who is blessed forever , knows that I am telling the truth .
47011032	In Damascus , the governor under Aretas the King , kept guard over the city of the Damascus , to arrest me ;
47011033	but through an opening in the wall I was let down in a basket , and so escaped and out of his hands .
47012001	I am forced to boast , though it is unprofitable , but I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord . I urged Titus to go , and with him I sent our brother . Did Titus make gain of you ? And did I not walk in the same spirit as he did ? Did I not take the very same steps ?
47012002	I know a Christian man who , fourteen years ago ( whether in the body I know not , or out of the body , I know not . God knows ) , was caught up - - this man of whom I speak - even into the third heaven .
47012003	And I know such a man ( whether in the body or apart from the body I know not , God knows ) ,
47012004	who was caught up into Paradise , and heard unutterable words which no human being is permitted to utter .
47012005	Of such a one I will boast ; but on my own behalf I will not boast except in my weaknesses .
47012006	If I should choose to continue boasting I should not be foolish , for I should be speaking the truth . But I refrain , lest by the stupendous grandeur of the revelation any one should estimate me beyond what he sees in me , or hears from me .
47012007	It was for this reason , lest I should be over-elated , that there was given me a thorn in the flesh , a messenger of Satan , to buffet me , lest I should be over-elated .
47012008	Concerning this , three times over I supplicated the Lord that it might leave me ;
47012009	but he has answered me . " My grace is sufficient for you ; it is in weakness that my power is perfected . "
47012010	Most gladly therefore will I boast rather of my weakness , that over me like a tent may be pitched the power of Christ . That is why I rejoice in weakness , in ill-treatment , in troubles , in persecutions and calamities for Christs sake . For when I am weak , then am I strong .
47012011	I am become a fool - you have forced me to ; for you yourselves ought to have been my vindicators . In no respect am I inferior to these superapostolic apostles , even though I am nothing .
47012012	In truth the signs of the true apostle were wrought among you in all patience by signs and marvels and powers .
47012013	In what respect , then , were you inferior to the other churches , except that I myself was not a burden to you ? Forgive me this wrong !
47012014	And now for the third time I am preparing to visit you . I will not be a burden to you , for I am not seeking yours , but you . For the children ought not to lay up for the parents , but the parents for the children .
47012015	For my part , I will most gladly spend , yea , and will myself be spent , for your souls . If I love you more abundantly , am I to be loved the less ?
47012016	But though it be granted that I was not a burden to you , yet , you say , this was my cunning with which I caught you by a trick .
47012017	Did I make gain of you through any of those whom I sent to you ?
47012019	Do you think that all this time I am defending myself to you ? It is before the presence of God that I am speaking in Christ ; and all , beloved , for your upbuilding .
47012020	For I dread that perhaps , when I come , I may not find you to be such as I wish , and that I may be found by you such as you do not wish ; I dread lest there should be quarrels , jealousy , tempers , party spirit , slandering , gossip , arrogance , tumults ;
47012021	and lest when I come again my God may humble me before you , and lest I shall mourn for many those who have sinned before , and have not repented of the impurity and immorality and wantonness which they have practised .
47013001	This will be my third visit to you . Out of the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be confirmed .
47013002	I have said formerly , and I now forewarn you as when I was present the second time , so now when I am absent the second time , so now when I am absent , saying to those who had sinned before , and to all the rest , " If I come again , I will not spare , "
47013003	Since you want a proof of Christ who is speaking in me , he who is not feeble toward you , but powerful among you .
47013004	For though he was crucified through weakness , yet he now lives through the power of God . I also am weak , sharing in his weakness , but I shall live with him by the power of God .
47013005	Examine yourselves to see if you are in the faith ; put your own selves to the proof . Or do you not know , your own selves , that Jesus Christ is in you , unless indeed you fail to abide the proof ?
47013006	But I hope you will find that I abide the proof .
47013007	And my prayer to God is that you may do no evil ; not in order that I may appear approved , but that you may do what is noble , though I should seem unable to abide the proof .
47013008	For I have no power against the truth , but only in defense of the truth .
47013009	For I am always glad whenever I am weak , but you are strong . For this also I am praying , for your perfect reformation .
47013010	For this reason I am writing thus while absent , so that when I come , I may not have to deal sharply , according to the authority which the Lord gave me for building up , and not for pulling down .
47013011	Finally , brothers , farewell . Aim at perfection , take courage , be of one mind , live in peace ; so shall the God of love and peace be with you .
47013012	Salute one another with a holy kiss .
47013013	All the saints salute you .
47013014	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , and the love of God , and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all .
48001001	Paul , an apostle sent not from men nor by any man , but by Jesus Christ and by God the Father who raised him from the dead ;
48001002	with all the brothers who are with me . To the churches of Galatia greeting .
48001003	Grace be to you , and peace from God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ ,
48001004	who gave himself for our sins , that he might deliver us from this present evil age in accordance with the will of our God and Father ,
48001005	to whom be glory forever and ever . Amen .
48001006	I am amazed that you are so soon shifting your ground , and deserting him who called you by the grace of Christ ,
48001007	for another gospel , which indeed is not another ; only there are certain individuals who are troubling you , and desiring to pervert the gospel of Christ .
48001008	But even though I myself or an angel from heaven were to preach any gospel other than that which I did preach to you , let him be accursed .
48001009	I have said it before , and I now repeat it , if any one is preaching a gospel to you other than that which you have received , let him be accursed .
48001010	Think you that I am now trying to conciliate men or God ? Or am I " seeking to please men " ? If I were still seeking to please men , I should not be a slave of Christ .
48001011	For I would have you know , brothers , that the gospel I preach is not man-made ;
48001012	for neither did I myself receive it from man , nor by man was I taught it , but by a revelation an apocalypse of Jesus Christ .
48001013	For you have heard of my former conduct in Judaism , how furiously I used to persecute the church of God , and how I kept seeking to root it out ;
48001014	and how in my zeal for Judaism I outstripped many of my own age and nation , in my special zeal for the traditions of my forefathers .
48001015	But when God who had set me apart from my very birth ,
48001016	and had called me by his grace , was pleased to reveal his Son in me , so that I might preach his gospel among the Gentiles , without consulting a human being ,
48001017	or even going up to Jerusalem to see those who had been apostles before me , I went off at once to Arabia , and on my return came back to Damascus .
48001018	Then three years later I went up to Jerusalem to get acquainted with Peter , and spent two weeks with him .
48001019	I saw no other apostle except James , the Lords brother .
48001020	( In what I am now writing , I call God to witness that I am telling the truth . )
48001021	Then I went into the districts of Syria and Cilicia .
48001022	But to the churches of Christ in Judea I was personally unknown ;
48001023	only they used to hear it said , " He who was once persecuting us is now preaching the gospel of the very faith which he once tried to ruin . "
48001024	And they were giving glory to God on my account .
48002001	Fourteen years later I went up to Jerusalem again , with Barnabas , and took Titus also with me
48002002	( I went up at that time in obedience to a revelation ) . And I laid before them the gospel which I am wont to preach among the Gentiles . I did this privately before those in authority , lest by any means I should be running , or should already have run , in vain .
48002003	But although Titus , my companion , was a Greek , they did not compel even him to be circumcised .
48002004	Yet there were false brethren who had crept in to spy out the freedom we enjoy in Christ Jesus , in order to enslave us again .
48002005	To them we did not yield submission even for an hour , in order that the truth of the gospel might abide unshaken among you .
48002006	But those in authority - what they once were makes no difference to me ; God is no respecter of persons - those I say who were in authority had no additions to make my message .
48002007	On the contrary , when they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel for the uncircumcised , just as Peter has with the gospel for the circumcised
48002008	( for he who has equipped Peter for the apostleship to the circumcised , equipped me also for the apostleship to the Gentiles ) ,
48002009	and when they recognized the grace which had been given to me , James and Cephas and John , then thought to be pillars , gave to Barnabas and to me the right hand of fellowship . They agreed that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the Jews .
48002010	They stipulated only that we should remember the poor , which very thing indeed I was quite eager to do .
48002011	But when Cephas came to Antioch I resisted him to his face , because he stood self-condemned .
48002012	For until certain men came from James he used to eat with the Gentile Christians , but when they came , he began to draw back and to separate himself , because he was afraid of the circumcision party .
48002013	And the rest of the Jewish Christians also dissimulated with him , so that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy .
48002014	But when I saw that they were not walking a straight path , in the presence of the truth of the gospel , I said to Cephas before them all . " If you , although you are a Jew , live like the Gentiles and not like the Jews , why do you try to compel the Gentiles to become Jews ?
48002015	" We are Jews by birth , and not Gentile sinners ;
48002016	" yet because we know that no man is justified by the works of the Law , but by the faith of Jesus Christ , we ourselves also have put our faith in Jesus Christ , that we might be justified by the faith of Christ , and not by the works of the Law ; for " By the works of the Law shall no flesh be justified . "
48002017	But if while seeking to be justified in Christ we ourselves also have been found to be sinners , is Christ then a minister of sin ? Far from it !
48002018	For if I am rebuilding the very things which I destroyed , I am proving myself a transgressor .
48002019	For it is through law I died to law , in order to live to God .
48002020	I have been crucified with Christ , so it is no longer I who am living , but it is Christ who is living in me ; and the life I am now living in the flesh , I am living in faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself up for me .
48002021	I do not annul the grace of God ; for if righteousness comes by way of the Law , then indeed Christ died Christ for nothing .
48003001	O foolish Galatians , who has bewitched you ? You , before whose very eyes Jesus Christ was placarded as crucified !
48003002	Answer me this one question . " When you received the Spirit , was it from doing what the Law commands or from believing the message heard ? "
48003003	Are you so without sense ? After beginning with the Spirit , will you now end with the flesh ?
48003004	Did you have such experience to no purpose - if indeed it was really to no purpose ?
48003005	Does he then who supplies you with his Spirit and works miracles among you , do it because you do what the law commands of because you believe the message heard ?
48003006	Even as Abraham believed God and it was counted to him for righteousness ?
48003007	Notice then that the true sons of Abraham are children of faith .
48003008	And the Scripture , anticipating Gods justification of the Gentiles by faith , announced the gospel to Abraham beforehand in the words , In thee shall all the Gentiles be blessed .
48003009	So then they who are children of faith are blessed with Abraham the faithful ;
48003010	but a curse rests on those who have their root in the works of the Law ; for it is written . Cursed is every one that continues not in all the things written in the Book of the Law , to do them .
48003011	And it is manifest that by the Law no man is justified in the sight of God . because The just shall live by faith ,
48003012	and the Law has nothing to do with faith , but declares , The man that has done these things shall live therein .
48003013	Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the Law by becoming a curse for us ( for it is written , Cursed is every one who is hanged upon a tree ) ,
48003014	to the end that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles , so that through faith we might receive the promised Spirit .
48003015	Let me illustrate , brothers , from every-day life . When once a human testament is made , and formally ratified , no one sets it aside or adds to it .
48003016	Now it was to Abraham that the promises were spoken , and to his offspring . God did not say , " offsprings " as if speaking of many , but " and to your offspring , " as of one ; and this is Christ .
48003017	I mean to say that the testament which God has already ratified could not be annulled by the Law which came four hundred and thirty years later , so as to make the Promise void .
48003018	For if the inheritance comes from law , it no longer comes from a promise ; but God did give it as a free gift to Abraham by a promise .
48003019	To what purpose , then , was the Law ? It was imposed later for the sake of transgressions , until the " Offspring " should come to whom the promise had been made . It was arranged through angels by the hand of a mediator .
48003020	( Now a mediator implies more than one person , but God is only one . )
48003021	Is the Law then opposed to the promises of God ? Certainly not ; for if a law had been given which could make alive , then righteousness would actually have come from law ;
48003022	but the Scripture has shut up the whole world in prison together under sin , in order that the promise due to faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who have faith .
48003023	Before the Faith came we were perpetual prisoners under the Law , in preparation for the destined faith about to be revealed .
48003024	So the Law has been our tutor-slave our pedagogue to lead us to Christ , so that we may be justified by faith ;
48003025	but now that the Faith is come , we are no longer under a tutor-slave .
48003026	You are all sons of God through your faith in Jesus Christ .
48003027	For all of you who were baptized into Christ , have clothed yourselves with Christ .
48003028	In him there is neither Jew nor Greek , there is neither slave nor free , there is no male and female ; for you are all one in Christ Jesus .
48003029	And if you belong to Christ , then you are the descendants of Abraham , heirs according to the promise .
48004001	What I mean is this . As long as the heir is a child , he differs in no respect from a slave , though he be the owner of the whole inheritance ;
48004002	but is under the control of guardians and trustees , until the time appointed by his father .
48004003	So we Jews also , when we were children , were held in bondage under the empty externalities of the world .
48004004	But when the fulness of time was come God sent forth his Son , born of a woman , born under law ,
48004005	to redeem from captivity those under law , in order that we might receive our sonship .
48004006	And because you are sons , God sent forth the spirit of his Son into your hearts , crying , " Dear , dear Father ! "
48004007	So each one of you is no longer a slave , but a son , and if a son , then an heir , too , through Gods grace .
48004008	But once , when you Gentiles had no knowledge of God , you were slaves to gods which have no real being .
48004009	Now , however , when you have come to know God , or rather to be known by God , how is it that you are beginning to turn back to those weak and beggarly externalities , eager to be in bondage to them again ?
48004010	You are scrupulous , are you , in observing " days " and " months " and " seasons " and " years " ?
48004011	I am alarmed about you for fear lest I may have bestowed labor on you to no purpose .
48004012	Brothers , I beseech you , become as I am , because I also have become as you are . You never did me any wrong ;
48004013	on the contrary , you know that although it was illness which brought about my preaching the gospel to you at my first visit ,
48004014	and although my bodily affliction was a trial to you , you did not scoff at it nor spurn me , but welcomed me like an angel of God , like Christ Jesus himself .
48004015	Why then did you account yourselves so happy ? ( For I bear you witness that if you could you would have torn out your own eyes and given them to me . )
48004016	Am I then become your enemy , because I am telling you the truth ?
48004017	These men are courting your favor to no good purpose . They want to isolate you , so that you will be courting their favor .
48004018	It is always an honorable thing to have your favor sought in an honorable cause , always , and not only when I am with you .
48004019	O my little children , of whom I travail again in birth until Christ be formed within you !
48004020	How I wish I could be with you now , that I might change my tone ; for I am perplexed about you .
48004021	Tell me , you who wish to be subject to the Law , why do you not listen to the Law ?
48004022	For it is written that Abraham had two sons , one by the slave woman and one by the free woman ;
48004023	but while the son by the slave woman was born according to the flesh , the son by the free woman was born in fulfilment of a promise .
48004024	Now all this is an allegory , for these women are the two covenants ; one from Mount Sinai , which is Hagar bearing children into bondage
48004025	( for the word Hagar stands for Mt . Sinai in Arabia and represents the present Jerusalem who with her children is in bondage . )
48004026	But the Jerusalem that is above is free , and she is our mother .
48004027	For it is written , Rejoice , O thou barren one who dost never bear , Break forth in joy , thou that dost not travail ; For the children of the desolate woman are many . Yea , more than hers who has a husband .
48004028	But you , brothers , are like Isaac , children of the promise ;
48004029	but just as in old times the son born by the flesh used to persecute the son born by the power of the Spirit , so also it is now .
48004030	But what does the Scripture say ? Send away the slave-woman and her son ; for the slaves son shall not be heir along with the son of the free woman .
48004031	So , brothers , we are the children of no slave woman , but of free woman . For freedom did not Christ set us free ;
48005001	stand firm then , and do not be again entangled in a yoke of bondage .
48005002	Listen to me ! I , Paul , declare to you that if you are to continue to follow the rite of circumcision , Christ will be no profit to you .
48005003	I solemnly testify to every man who submits to circumcision that he obligates himself to keep the whole Law .
48005004	If you are being justified by law , you are cut off from Christ ; you are fallen away from grace .
48005005	But we are not , for we through the Spirit are eagerly waiting by faith for a hope of righteousness ( a hope well founded ) ;
48005006	because in Christ neither circumcision has any value , nor uncircumcision , but faith which works through love .
48005007	You were running your race nobly . Who hindered you from obeying the truth ?
48005008	The influence brought to bear does not come from him who is calling you .
48005009	A little leaven is leavening the whole lump .
48005010	As for me , I am fully trusting you in the Lord that you will be no otherwise minded ; but he who is trying to unsettle you will have to bear his punishment , whoever he may be .
48005011	But I , brothers , if I " still preach circumcision , " why am I still persecuted ? Then surely the stumbling-block of the Cross has ceased to be an obstacle !
48005012	Would to God that those who are trying to unsettle you would even have themselves mutilated .
48005013	For you , brothers , were called for freedom ; only do not make your freedom an excuse for self-indulgence , but in love enslave yourselves to one another .
48005014	For the whole Law has been fulfilled in this one precept , Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself .
48005015	But if you are always biting and devouring one another , take heed lest you be utterly consumed one by another .
48005016	This is my meaning . Let your steps be guided by the Spirit , and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh .
48005017	For the desire of the flesh is against that of the Spirit , and the desire of the Spirit is against that of the flesh , for they two are antagonistic , so that you may not do those things that you wish .
48005018	But if you are habitually led by the Spirit you are not under law .
48005019	Now the works of the flesh are manifest ; such , for instance , as fornication , impurity , indecency ,
48005020	idol-worship , sorcery , quarrels , party-spirit , jealousy , passionate anger , intrigues , factions , sectarianism ,
48005021	envy , drunkenness , revelings , and things like these . I tell you beforehand , as I have already told you , that those who practise such sins shall not inherit the kingdom of God .
48005022	But the harvest-fruit of the Spirit is love , joy , peace , long-suffering , kindness , goodness , fidelity , gentleness , and self-control ;
48005023	against such there is no law .
48005024	And those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and appetites .
48005025	If we are living by the Spirit , let us also keep step in the Spirit .
48005026	Let us not become conceited , provoking one another , envying one another .
48006001	Even if any one should be overtaken in a fault , brothers , you that are spiritual ought , in a gentle spirit , to restore such a one , each one of you looking to himself , lest you too be tempted .
48006002	Ever be bearing one anothers burdens , and so be fulfilling the law of Christ .
48006003	If a man fancies himself to be somebody when he is really nobody he is deceiving himself .
48006004	Let each one test his own work , and he will then have something to be proud of by comparing himself with himself , and not with any one else ;
48006005	for every one must carry his own pack load .
48006006	He , however , who is being taught in the message , should always share with his instructor in all the good things which he possesses .
48006007	Be not deceived . God is not mocked . Whatever a man sows , that will he also reap .
48006008	The man who is sowing to his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption ; but he who is sowing to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap life eternal .
48006009	And let us not be weary in well-doing , for in due season we shall reap if we faint not .
48006010	So then , as we have opportunity , let is do good to all men , but especially to those who are of the household of faith .
48006011	See with what large letters I have written to you in my own handwriting !
48006012	Those who are trying to compel you to be circumcised are such as wish to make a fair show in the flesh , only that they may not suffer persecution for the cross of Christ .
48006013	Even those who are being circumcised , are not themselves keeping the Law , but they want you to be circumcised so that they may glory in your flesh .
48006014	God forbid that I should glory in anything except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ , upon which the world has been crucified to me and I have been crucified to the world .
48006015	For in Jesus Christ neither is circumcision anything , nor uncircumcision , but a new creation .
48006016	On all who will govern their lives by this rule and on the Israel of God may peace and mercy rest .
48006017	From this time forth let no one trouble me , for I bear branded in my body the marks of Jesus , my Master .
48006018	May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit , brothers . Amen .
49001001	Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God , to the saints who are in Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus ,
49001002	grace to you and peace from God our father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
49001003	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who has blessed us in every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms in Christ .
49001004	Even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world to be holy and without blemish in his sight .
49001005	For in his love he predestined us ( such was the good pleasure of his will ) to adoption for himself as sons through Jesus Christ ,
49001006	and to the praise of his glorious grace which he graciously bestowed upon us in the Beloved .
49001007	It is in him we have deliverance , the forgiveness of our trespasses , through his blood ;
49001008	so abundantly did he lavish upon us the riches of his grace in all wisdom and understanding ,
49001009	when he made known to us , I say , that good pleasure which he purposed in himself
49001010	for the government of the fulness of the ages , that all things in heaven and earth are alike should be gathered up in Christ , as Head .
49001011	It is he in whom we Jews also have our inheritance , having been chosen beforehand according to the purpose of Him who executes all things according to the counsel of his will ,
49001012	that we who first hoped in Christ should be for the praise of his glory .
49001013	And in him , because you listened to the proclamation of the truth , the evangel of your salvation , and trusted it , you Gentiles too were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit ,
49001014	who for the praise of his glory is the pledge of our common heritage , unto the complete redemption of his purchased property .
49001015	For this reason I also , from the time when I heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which prevails among you , and your love to all the saints ,
49001016	do not cease to praise God for you , whenever I mention you in my prayers .
49001017	I am praying that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father most glorious , may grant you a spirit of wisdom and revelation , through an intimate knowledge of himself ;
49001018	and that the eyes of your heart may be flooded with light so that you may understand what is the hope of his calling , what the wealth of the glory of his inheritance in the saints ,
49001019	and what the surpassing greatness of his might in us who believe , as seen in the energy of that resistless might
49001020	which he exercised in raising Christ from the dead , and in seating him at his right hand in the heavenly heights ,
49001021	far above all hierarchies and authorities and powers and dominions and every name that is named , not only in this age but in that which is to come .
49001022	God has put all things under Christs feet , and placed him as Head over all in the church ,
49001023	which is his body , the fulness of Him who fills the universe .
49002001	And so God has given life to you Gentiles also , who were once dead in your trespasses and sins ,
49002002	in which you passed your lives after the way of this world , under the sway of the Prince of the Powers of the Air , the spirit who is now working among the sons of disobedience .
49002003	And among them we all once passed our lives , indulging the passions of our flesh , carrying out the dictates of our senses and temperament , and were by nature the children of wrath like all the rest .
49002004	But God , who is rich in mercy , because of the great love with which he loved us ,
49002005	even while we were dead in our trespasses , made us live together with Christ ( it is by grace you have been saved ) .
49002006	together with him He raised us from the dead , and together with Christ Jesus seated us in the heavenly realm ,
49002007	in order that he might show to the ages to come the amazing riches of his grace by his goodness to us in Christ Jesus .
49002008	For by grace you have been saved through faith , and that not of yourselves ; it is Gods gift .
49002009	It is not of works , so that any one can boast of it ;
49002010	for we are his handiwork , created in Christ Jesus for good deeds , which God predestined us to make our daily way of life .
49002011	Do not forget then , that you Gentiles in the flesh , who are called " uncircumcision " by the " circumcision " made in flesh by mans hand ,
49002012	were once upon a time without Christ , aliens from the commonwealth of Israel , strangers to the covenants of the Promise , without hope and without God in the world .
49002013	But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near in the blood of Christ .
49002014	For he is our Peace , who has made the two of us Jew and Gentile one , and has broken down the party-wall of partition between us .
49002015	In his own body he abolished the cause of our enmity , the law of commandments contained in ordinances , in order to make the two into one new man in himself , so making peace .
49002016	Thus he reconciled us both in one body to God by his cross , on which he slew our enmity .
49002017	So he came preaching " Peace " to you Gentiles who were afar off , and " Peace " to us Jews who were near ;
49002018	because it is through him that we both have access in one spirit to the Father .
49002019	Take notice then that no longer are you strangers and foreigners , but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of Gods household .
49002020	You are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets , Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner-stone .
49002021	In him the whole building , fitly framed together , rises into a holy temple in the Lord ;
49002022	and in him you , too , are continuously built together for a dwelling-place of God through his Spirit .
49003001	For this reason I , Paul , the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles -
49003002	for surely you have heard of the stewardship of the grace of God entrusted to me for you ?
49003003	You have heard how by direct revelation the secret truth was made known to me , as I have already briefly written you .
49003004	By reading what I have written , you can judge of my insight into that secret truth of Christ
49003005	which was not disclosed to the sons of men in former generations , as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to his holy apostles and prophets ,
49003006	namely , that in Christ Jesus the Gentiles form one body with us the Jews , and are coheirs and copartners in the promise , through the gospel .
49003007	It is of this gospel I became a minister according to the gift of the power of the grace of God , bestowed on me by the energy of his power .
49003008	To me , who am less than the least of all saints , has this grace been given , that I should proclaim among the Gentiles the gospel of the unsearchable riches of Christ ;
49003009	and should make all men see the new dispensation of that secret purpose , hidden from eternity in the God who founded the universe ,
49003010	in order that now his manifold wisdom should , through the church , be made known to the principalities and powers in the heavenly sphere ,
49003011	according to his eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord .
49003012	In him we have this fearless confidence and boldness of access through our faith in him .
49003013	So I beg you not to lose heart over my tribulations in your behalf ; they are your glory .
49003014	For this cause I bend my knees before the Father ,
49003015	from whom every fatherhood in heaven and earth is named ,
49003016	praying him to grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in your inmost being ;
49003017	that Christ may make his home in your hearts through your faith ; that you may be so deeply rooted and so firmly grounded in love ,
49003018	that you may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is " the breadth , " " the length , " " the depth , " and " the height , "
49003019	and may know the love of Christ which transcends all knowing , so that you may be filled with all the " plenitude " of God .
49003020	Now unto him who , according to his might that is at work within us , is able to do infinitely more than all we ask or even think ,
49003021	to him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus , to all generations , world without end , Amen .
49004001	I summon you then , I the prisoner in the Lord , to live lives worthy of the calling to which you were called .
49004002	With all humility and gentleness and long-suffering forbear with one another in love ;
49004003	and endeavor to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bonds of peace .
49004004	There is one body and one spirit , even as also you were called in one hope of your calling .
49004005	There is one Lord , one faith , one baptism ,
49004006	one God and Father of all , who is over all , and through all , and in all .
49004007	And to each one of us was grace given according to the measure of the munificence of Christ .
49004008	Thus it is said , When he ascended on high , he led captivity captive and gave gifts to men .
49004009	Now surely this " he ascended " implies that he also descended into the lower part of the earth .
49004010	He who descended is he who ascended above the highest heaven , that he might fill the universe .
49004011	It is he who made some men apostles , some prophets , some evangelists , and some pastors and teachers ,
49004012	in order to equip the saints for the work of serving , for the building up of the Body of Christ -
49004013	till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God , to the maturity of manhood , to the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ .
49004014	So we shall no longer be children , tossed up and down , and blown about by every wind of teaching , tricked by the craft of men in the snares of misleading error ;
49004015	but holding the truth in love we shall grow up in every part into him who is our Head , even Christ .
49004016	From him the whole body ( knit together and compacted by all its joints ) makes continual growth of the body so as to build itself up in love , through the energy of his bounteous provision , according to the need of each several part .
49004017	This then I tell you and implore you in the Masters name , to pass your lives no longer as the Gentiles do in the perverseness of their minds ;
49004018	having their understanding darkened , alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them , because of the hardening of their hearts .
49004019	These being past feeling have given themselves over to sensuality , in order to practise every form of impurity with greedy zest .
49004020	But you have not so learned Christ ,
49004021	if indeed you have listened to him , and in him been taught the truth as it is in Jesus .
49004022	You have learned to lay aside , with your former manner of living , the old self who was on his way to ruin , as he followed the desires which deceive ;
49004023	and to be made new in the spirit of your mind ,
49004024	and to put on the new self , created after Gods likeness , in the uprightness and holiness of the truth .
49004025	So then put away falseness and speak every man the truth to his neighbor , for we are members one of another .
49004026	" Be angry and sin not " ; let not the sun go down upon your anger .
49004027	Give the devil no place .
49004028	Let him who stole steal no more , but let him work , and in honest industry toil with his hands , so that he may have something to give to the needy .
49004029	From your lips let no evil words come forth , but such as occasion warrants , such as are good for upbuilding and give a blessing to the hearers .
49004030	And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God , in whom you have been sealed for the day of redemption .
49004031	Banish from among you all bitterness and passion and anger and clamor and slander , as well as all malice ;
49004032	and be kind to one another , tender-hearted , forgiving one another , even as God in Christ has forgiven you .
49005001	Learn then to imitate God as his beloved children ,
49005002	and to lead lives of love , just as Christ also loved you and gave himself up for you , an offering and sacrifice unto God , for you , an offering and sacrifice unto God , for " an odor of sweetness . "
49005003	As for sexual vice and every kind of impurity or lust , it is unbecoming for you as Christians even to mention them ;
49005004	so too with vulgarity and buffoonery and foolish jesting . Such words become you not , but rather thanksgiving .
49005005	For be well assured that no one guilty of fornication or impurity or covetousness which is idolatry , has any heritage in the kingdom of Christ and of God .
49005006	Let no man deceive you with empty arguments , for it is these vices that bring down the wrath of God upon the sons of disobedience ;
49005007	therefore do not become sharers with them .
49005008	For you were once darkness , but are now in the Lord .
49005009	Lead the life of children of light , for the fruit of the light consists in every kind of goodness and uprightness and truth .
49005010	Examine carefully what is well pleasing to the Lord ,
49005011	and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of the darkness , but rather expose them .
49005012	For it is a shame even to speak of the things that are done by such men in secret ;
49005013	but all these things , when exposed , are by the light made manifest , and what is made manifest is light .
49005014	For this reason it is said , " Awake , thou sleeper ! Arise from the dead ; And Christ shall shine upon thee ! "
49005015	See to it , then , that you carry on your life carefully ; not as foolish , but as wise men .
49005016	Buy up opportunity , for the times are evil .
49005017	For this reason do not be thoughtless , but learn to know what the Lords will is .
49005018	Do not be drunk with wine , in which is riotous living , but drink deep in the Spirit ,
49005019	when you talk together ; with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , singing and with all your hearts making music unto the Lord ;
49005020	and at all times for all things give thanks to God , the Father , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ .
49005021	Submit yourselves one to another out of reverence for Christ .
49005022	Wives likewise to their husbands as to the Lord ,
49005023	because a husband is the head of his wife even as Christ is head of the church , his body , which he saves .
49005024	But as the church submits itself to Christ , so also wives to their husbands in everything .
49005025	Husbands , love your wives , just as Christ loved the church and gave himself for her ,
49005026	in order that after cleansing her in the bath of baptism , he might sanctify her by his word ,
49005027	so as to present her to himself , the church glorified , without spot or wrinkle or any such blemish ; but on the contrary holy and faultless .
49005028	That is how husbands ought to love their wives , as they love their own bodies . He who loves his wife loves himself .
49005029	For no man ever yet hated his own flesh , but nourishes and cherishes it as Christ does the church ;
49005030	for we are members of his body .
49005031	For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother , and shall cleave unto his wife , and they two shall be one flesh .
49005032	There is a deep mystery here - I am speaking of Christ and his church .
49005033	But as for you individually , you must each one of you love his own wife exactly as if she were yourself ; and the wife , on her part , should reverence her husband .
49006001	Children , obey your parents in the Lord ; for this is right .
49006002	Honor your father and mother ( this is the first commandment with a promise attached ) ,
49006003	that it may be well with you , and that you may live long on the earth .
49006004	And you fathers , do not irritate your children , but bring them up in the nature and admonition of the Lord .
49006005	Slaves , be obedient to those who are your earthly masters , with reverence and humility , in singleness of heart as if to Christ himself ;
49006006	not with eye service , as men-pleasers , but as the slaves of Christ , doing the will of God ;
49006007	slaving with good-will from your heart , as for the Lord and not for men ;
49006008	because you know that whatever good any man does , the same shall he receive from the Lord , whether he be slave or free man .
49006009	And you masters , show the same spirit to your slaves , and stop threatening them ; for you know that your masters and theirs is in heaven , and that there is no respect of persons with him .
49006010	Finally , my brothers , let your hearts be strengthened in the Lord , and in the power of his might .
49006011	Put on all the panoply of God , so that you may be able to stand your ground against the stratagems of the devil .
49006012	For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood , but against the despotisms , the empires , the rulers of this present darkness , the spirit-hosts of evil in the heavenly realm .
49006013	Therefore take up the panoply of God , so that when the evil day comes you may be able to withstand them , and having overthrown them all , to stand your ground .
49006014	Stand firm then , girt about with the belt of truth , and wearing the breastplate of righteousness ,
49006015	and having your feet shod with the stability of the gospel of peace .
49006016	And take up to cover you the shield of faith , with which you will be able to quench all the flaming darts of the Evil One .
49006017	Take likewise the helmet of salvation , and the sword of the Spirit , which is the word of God .
49006018	Continue to pray at all times , with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit , and watching for it with all perseverance and supplication for all saints ;
49006019	and for me , that utterance may be given me to open my mouth boldly , and to make known the mystery of the gospel for which I am an ambassador ,
49006020	and in chains . Pray that I may proclaim it boldly as I ought to speak .
49006021	But that you also may know my affairs and how I do , Tychicus , my beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord , will make everything known to you .
49006022	I have sent him to you for this very purpose , that you may know about us , and that he may cheer your hearts .
49006023	Peace to the brothers and love , with faith from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
49006024	May grace be with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with sincerity .
50001001	Paul and Timothy , slaves of Christ Jesus , to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi , and to the elders and deacons .
50001002	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
50001003	Upon every remembrance of you I am ever thanking my God for you all ;
50001004	in every petition of mine in your behalf I am offering my prayer with joy for your fellowship in forwarding the gospel ,
50001005	from the first day you heard it until now .
50001006	Of this I am fully persuaded , that He who has begun a good work in you will go on completing it until the day of Jesus Christ .
50001007	It is but just that I should be thus mindful of you all , because I have you in my heart , and because in these fetters of mine and in my defense and confirmation of the gospel you are all my fellow partners in the privilege .
50001008	God is my witness how I yearn for you all in the tenderness of Christ Jesus .
50001009	And it is my prayer that your love may abound yet more and more in intelligence and insight
50001010	for testing things that differ , so that you may be pure and blameless until the day of Christ ,
50001011	being filled with the fruit of righteousness through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God .
50001012	I want you to know , brothers , that what has happened to me has turned out rather to help than to the hindrance of the gospel .
50001013	Throughout the whole Praetorian guard and among all the others it has become plain that these chains of mine are for the sake of Christ ;
50001014	and most of the brothers in the Lord , made confident in the Lord through my imprisonment , are much emboldened to speak Gods message with free and fearless confidence .
50001015	Some indeed are preaching Christ out of envy and contentiousness , but others from good-will .
50001016	but the former preach Christ out of rivalry , not sincerely , because they think they are adding bitterness to my bonds .
50001017	These latter out of their love , because they know that I am set here for the defense of the gospel ;
50001018	What of it ? In any case , whether in pretence or in honest truth , Christ is still preached , and in that I am rejoicing , yes , and will rejoice .
50001019	For I know that these things will turn out to my salvation through your prayers and a rich supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ .
50001020	So it is my keen expectation and hope that I shall never feel ashamed , but that with fearless courage , now as hither to , Christ may be magnified in my body , whether by my life or by my death .
50001021	For , with me , to live is Christ and to die is gain .
50001022	But now , if life in the flesh , if this be the fruit of my toil - what to choose I do not know ,
50001023	but am in a quandary between the two . I am perplexed . I have a strong desire to break camp and to be with Christ , which is far better ;
50001024	but for your sakes it is more necessary that I should still live on in the body .
50001025	And because I am convinced of this , I know that I shall live , and go on working side by side with you all for your progress and joy in the faith ,
50001026	so that you may find me fresh cause of exultation in Christ Jesus , because of my presence among you once more .
50001027	Only do lead lives worthy of the gospel of Christ ; so that whether I come to see you or hear reports concerning you in my absence , I may know that you are standing firm in one spirit , with one soul , enlisted in a common struggle for the faith of the gospel ,
50001028	and in no way terrorized by its enemies . For you fearlessness is a clear indication of coming ruin for them , but of salvation for you at the hands of God .
50001029	For it has been granted you in Christs behalf , not only to believe on him , but also to suffer for his sake ,
50001030	while you wage the same conflict which you once saw in me , and now hear that I maintain .
50002001	If then there is any comfort in Christ , if there is any persuasive power in love , if there is any companionship of the Spirit , if there is any tenderness or pity ,
50002002	I entreat you to make my joy overflow by living in harmony ; possessing the same love , and with one soul united in one purpose .
50002003	Do nothing out of strife , nothing out of vanity , but let each one in true humility consider the others to be of more account than himself .
50002004	Let each have an eye not only for his own interests , but also for the interests of others .
50002005	Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus ,
50002006	who , though from the beginning he had the nature of God , did not reckon equality with God something to be forcibly retained ,
50002007	but emptied himself of his glory by taking the form of a slave , when he was born in the likeness of men .
50002008	More than this , after he had shone himself in human form , he humbled himself in his obedience even to death ; yes , and to death on a cross .
50002009	And for this God highly exalted him , and graciously bestowed upon him the name which is above every name ;
50002010	that in the name of Jesus every knee in heaven , on earth , and under the earth should bend ,
50002011	and every tongue confess that " Jesus Christ is Lord , " to the glory of God the Father .
50002012	And so , my beloved , as you have always obeyed , not only in my presence , but now much more in my absence , with reverence and self-distrust work out your own salvation ;
50002013	for it is God who , in his good-will is ever working in you both will and deed .
50002014	Do everything without grumbling and disputes ,
50002015	that you may become blameless and innocent , the sons of God , without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation , among whom you shine like stars in a dark world ,
50002016	holding out a message of life . Thus it will be my boast at the day of Christ that I have not run in vain , or toiled for nothing .
50002017	Nay , even if my life is to be poured out as a libation upon the sacrifice and service of you faith ,
50002018	I will rejoice and congratulate you all ; and in the same way you must rejoice and congratulate me .
50002019	Now I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you before long , so that I may be of good comfort when I learn the news concerning you .
50002020	For I have no other like him with a genuine concern for your welfare ,
50002021	for they are all seeking their own interests , not those of Jesus Christ .
50002022	And you know Timothys worth , how he has shared my servitude in furtherance of the gospel , like a son helping his father .
50002023	So I hope to send him , as soon as ever I see how it will go with me ;
50002024	but I trust in the Lord that I also shall come shortly .
50002025	Epaphroditus , my brother and coworker and fellow soldier , who is your messenger and minister to my needs , I have thought it necessary to send to you ;
50002026	for he has been homesick for you all , and distressed at your having heard of his illness .
50002027	And indeed he was sick nigh unto death ; but God had mercy on him , and not on him only , but on me also so that I should not have sorrow upon sorrow .
50002028	Therefore I have been the more eager to send him , in order that you may rejoice in seeing him again , and that I may have one sorrow less .
50002029	Receive him then in the Lord with all joy , and hold in honor men like him ;
50002030	for it was through the work of the Lord that he came near to death ; for he hazarded his very life to supply what was lacking in the help you sent me .
50003001	Finally , my brothers , continue to rejoice in the Lord . To write the same thing is not indeed wearisome to me , and it is safe for you .
50003002	Beware of " these dogs , " these mischievous workers , beware of the concision !
50003003	For we are the true circumcision , who worship God in the spirit , and make our boast in Christ Jesus , and have no confidence in outward rites ,
50003004	although I myself might have confidence in outward rites . If any one else claims a right to trust in them , far more may I ;
50003005	circumcised the eighth day , of the stock of Israel , of the tribe of Benjamin , a Hebrew sprung from the Hebrews ; as to the Law , a Pharisee ;
50003006	as to zeal , a persecutor of the church ; as to the righteousness which comes through law , blameless .
50003007	But what was once gain to me , that I have counted loss for Christ .
50003008	In very truth I count all things but loss compared to the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord . For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things , and esteem them but refuse that I may gain Christ ,
50003009	and be found in him ; not having my own righteousness of the Law , but that alone which is through the faith of Christ , the righteousness which comes from God , founded upon faith .
50003010	I long to know him in the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings , by sharing the likeness of his death ;
50003011	if by any means I might attain to the resurrection from the dead !
50003012	I do not say that I have already won , or am already perfect , but I am passing on to lay hold on the prize for which also Christ has laid hold of me .
50003013	Brothers , I do not regard myself to have yet laid hold of it ; but this one thing I do , forgetting what is behind me , but straining every nerve toward that which lies ahead ,
50003014	I am ever pressing on toward the goal , for the prize of Gods heavenward call in Christ Jesus .
50003015	Let us all then , who are mature Christians , strive for this ! God will make this clear to any of you who are striving for other goals ;
50003016	if only we guide our steps by the standards we have already attained .
50003017	Brothers , be comrades in imitating me , and study those whose life and walk is according to the pattern I have set you .
50003018	For there are many - as I used often to tell you , and am now telling you even with tears - who live and walk as the enemies of the cross of Christ .
50003019	Their end is destruction , their belly is their god , their glory is in their shame , and their minds are set on earthly things .
50003020	But commonwealth is in heaven ; and it is from heaven also that we are anxiously awaiting a Saviour , the Lord Jesus Christ ,
50003021	who will change the fashion of the body of our abasement into the likeness of his glorious body by the energy with which he is able even to subject all things to himself .
50004001	Stand fast then , brothers , dearly loved and longed for , my joy and my crown , so stand fast in the Lord , beloved !
50004002	Euodia I entreat , and I entreat Syntyche , to be of the same mind of the Lord ;
50004003	yes , and I beg you also , my true yokefellow , to help them ; for these women shared my toil in the furtherance of the gospel , together with Clement , and the rest of my fellow workers whose names are in the book of life .
50004004	Rejoice in the Lord alway , and again will I say , rejoice !
50004005	Let your reasonableness be recognized by every one . The Lord is near you .
50004006	Do not worry about anything ; but in everything by prayer and supplication , with thanksgiving , let your requests be made known to God ;
50004007	and the peace of God , which passes all understanding , will stand guard over your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus .
50004008	Finally , brothers , whatever is true , whatever is worthy of reverence , whatever is just , whatever is pure , whatever is lovely , whatever is of good repute , if virtue is anything , if honor is anything , be always thinking about these .
50004009	Put in practise also what you have learned and received and heard and seen in me ; and the God of peace shall be with you .
50004010	Moreover , I greatly rejoiced in the Lord that now once more your care for me blossomed afresh ; though indeed you did take thought in this matter , but you lacked the opportunity of expression .
50004011	Not that I speak as if I were in want , for at least have learned how to be content , whatever happens .
50004012	I know how to live humbly , and I also know how to bear prosperity . In every place and under all circumstances I have been initiated into the secret of fulness and of hunger , of prosperity and of want .
50004013	I am strong for everything in Him who gives me strength .
50004014	Notwithstanding , you have acted nobly in making yourselves comrades in my trouble .
50004015	And you very well know , Philippians , that in the beginning of the gospel , when I had left Macedonia , no church but yourselves had fellowship with me in the matter of giving and receiving .
50004016	For even while I was still in Thessalonica , you sent once and again for my needs .
50004017	It is not your gifts I am eager for , but I am eager for the abundant profit that accrues to your divine account .
50004018	But I give you a receipt in full for all things abound . I am amply supplied with what you sent by Epaphroditus - an odor of sweet fragrance , a sacrifice acceptable , well pleasing to God .
50004019	All your own needs my God will fully supply , according to his riches in glory , in Christ Jesus .
50004020	Now unto our God and Father be the glory , forever and ever . Amen .
50004021	Salute every saint in Christ Jesus . The brothers who are with me salute you .
50004022	All the saints salute you , and especially the slaves of the Emperors household .
50004023	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirits .
51001001	Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ , by the will of God , and Timothy our brother ,
51001002	to the holy and believing brothers in Christ who are in Colosse . Grace to you , and peace , from God our Father .
51001003	Whenever I pray for you I am continually thanking God , the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ
51001004	( since I heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and your love to all the saints )
51001005	because of the hope laid up for you in heaven . Long ago you heard of this hope in the message which came to you of the truth of the gospel .
51001006	And just as it is spreading through the whole world , bearing fruit and increasing , so also is it among you , from the day in which you heard it , and came truly to know the grace of God ,
51001007	as you learned it from Epaphras , our dearly loved fellow slave . He is a faithful minister of Jesus Christ in your behalf ,
51001008	and it is he who has told me of your love for me in the spirit .
51001009	For this reason from the day I heard of it I have never ceased to pray for you , asking God to fill you with the knowledge of his will with every kind of wisdom and spiritual insight ;
51001010	that you may walk worthy of the Lord in every kind of pleasing ; that you may be fruitful in every kind of good work , and may increase in the knowledge of God ;
51001011	that you may be strengthened in every kind of strength by the might of his glory for every kind of patience and fortitude with good cheer .
51001012	I ask that you may give thanks to the Father who has made us fit to receive our share of the heritage of the saints in the light .
51001013	For he has delivered us out of the dominion of the darkness , and transplanted us into the kingdom of his dear Son ,
51001014	in whom we have redemption , the forgiveness of our sins .
51001015	He is a visible image of the invisible God , the firstborn of all creation ;
51001016	for in him was the universe created , things in heaven and on earth , the seen and the unseen , thrones , or dominions , or principalities , or powers ; by him and for him all have been created ;
51001017	and HE IS before all , and in him all things subsist .
51001018	He is the head of his Body , the Church . He is the beginning , the firstborn from the dead , in order that in all things he may become preeminent .
51001019	For in him all the divine fulness chose to dwell ;
51001020	and by him it chose to reconcile all things alike on earth or in heaven to himself ; making peace by him , through the blood of his cross .
51001021	And you , alienated as you once were , hostile at heart in your evil deeds ,
51001022	he has now in his human body reconciled to God by his death , in order that he may bring you into his presence , holy and unblemished and irreproachable .
51001023	And this he will do if , indeed , you continue in the faith , firmly founded and stedfast , and never moved away from the hope of the gospel which you heard , and which has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven , that gospel of which I , Paul , was made a minister .
51001024	I am now rejoicing in my sufferings on your behalf ; and I am filling up in my own body what is yet lacking of the sufferings of Christ in behalf of the church , his Body .
51001025	It is of this I was made a minister , according to the stewardship entrusted to me by God for you , fully to declare Gods message ;
51001026	that secret truth , which , although hidden from ages and generations of old , has now been made manifest to his saints .
51001027	To them God willed to make known among the Gentiles how glorious are the riches of that secret truth , which is " Christ in you , the hope of glory . "
51001028	Him I am ever proclaiming , warning every one and teaching every one , in all wisdom ; that I may bring every man into his presence , full grown in Christ .
51001029	For that end I am ever toiling , wrestling with all that energy of his which is mightily at work within me .
51002001	For I would have you know how great a contest I am waging for you and the brethren in Laodicea , and for all who have never seen my face .
51002002	May their hearts be comforted ! May they be knit together in love ! May they gain in all its riches the full assurance of their understanding ! May they come to a perfect knowledge of the secret truth of God , which is Christ himself .
51002003	In Him are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge !
51002004	And this I say , lest any one should mislead you with enticing words .
51002005	For though I am absent from you in body , I am with you in spirit , happy to note your discipline and the solid front of your faith in Christ .
51002006	As then you have received Jesus Christ , your Lord , in him live your lives ;
51002007	since you are rooted in him , and in him continually built up . Be firmly established in the faith as you were taught it , and continually abound in it with thanksgiving .
51002008	Take care lest any man drag you away captive by his philosophy which is a vain deceit , following the traditions of men and the worlds crude notions , and not Christ .
51002009	For it is in Christ that all the fullness of deity dwells bodily ,
51002010	and in him you have your fulness , and he is the Lord of all the principalities and powers .
51002011	In him also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands ; even in putting off your sensual nature in Christs own circumcision ,
51002012	when you were buried with him in baptism . In baptism also you were raised with him , through your faith in the energy of that God who raised him from the dead .
51002013	And you also , at one time dead in your trespasses and in the uncircumcision of your sensual nature , he has made alive together with himself . For he forgave us all our transgressions ,
51002014	blotted out the handwriting of ordinances that stood against us and was hostile to us , and took it out of our way , nailing it to his cross .
51002015	Principalities and powers he disarmed , and openly displayed them as his trophies , when he triumphed over them in the cross .
51002016	Therefore do not permit any one to sit in judgment on you in regard to what you may eat or drink , or in regard to feast-days or new moons or sabbaths .
51002017	These were a shadow of things to come , but the substance belongs to Christ .
51002018	Let no man at his will defraud you of your prize through his false humility and worship of the angels , taking his stand on the visions he has seen , and vainly puffed up by his material mind ;
51002019	instead of keeping connection with the Head from the whole body draws nourishment for all its needs by the joints which bind it ; and is knit together , and grows with a divine growth .
51002020	If you died with Christ to the worlds rudimentary notions , why , as if you still lived in the world , do you submit yourselves to dogmatisms found on teachings and doctrines of men -
51002021	such as " Do not handle this , " " You must not taste that , " " Do not touch this " -
51002022	all things which are intended to perish in the using ?
51002023	For these precepts , although they have a show of wisdom with their self-imposed devotions and fastings and bodily austerities , are of no real value against the indulgence of the carnal appetites .
51003001	If you then are risen with Christ , seek those things which are above , where Christ abides , seated on the right hand of God .
51003002	Set your heart on things above , not on earthly things ;
51003003	for you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God .
51003004	When Christ , who is our life , appears , then will you also appear with him in glory .
51003005	So slay your baser inclinations . fornication , impurity , appetite , unnatural desires , and the greed which is idolatry .
51003006	These things are ever bringing down the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience ,
51003007	among whom you once led your daily life when you lived in them .
51003008	But now you also must renounce them all . Anger , passion , and ill-will must be put away ; slander , too , and foul talk , so that they may never soil your lips .
51003009	Lie not one to another , but strip off the old self with its doings ,
51003010	and put on that new self which is continually made over according to the likeness of its Creator , into full understanding .
51003011	In it that new creation there is no " Greek and Jew , " " circumcised and uncircumcised , " " barbarian , " " Scythian , " " slave , " " free man , " but Christ is all , and in us all .
51003012	Therefore , as Gods chosen people , consecrated and beloved , clothe yourselves with tenderness of heart , kindness , humility , gentleness , good temper ;
51003013	bearing with one another and forgiving each other , if any one has a grievance against another . Just as Christ the Lord forgave you , so must you forgive .
51003014	Over them all bind on love , which is the girdle of completeness .
51003015	Let the peace of Christ , to which also you were called in one body , rule in your hearts , and show yourselves thankful .
51003016	Let the word of Christ have its home in you richly , in all wisdom . Teach and admonish one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , ever singing with grace in your hearts unto God .
51003017	And whatever you do , whether in word of in deed , do all in the name of the Lord Jesus , giving thanks to God our Father through him .
51003018	Wives , submit yourselves to your husbands , as is fitting for Christians .
51003019	Husbands , be loving to your wives , and be not cross or surly with them .
51003020	Children , obey your parents in everything , for this is well pleasing in Christians .
51003021	Fathers , do not harass your children , lest you make them spiritless .
51003022	Slaves , obey in all things your earthly masters , not with eye-service , as men-pleasers , but in singleness of purpose , out of reverence for your Lord .
51003023	And whatever you do , do it heartily as for the Lord , and not for men .
51003024	You know that from the Lord you will receive reward of the inheritance , for you are the Lord Christs slaves .
51003025	For he who wrongs another will be paid back for his wrong-doing , and there will be no favoritism .
51004001	Masters , deal justly and fairly with your slaves , knowing that you also have a Master in heaven .
51004002	Be unwearied in prayer , and keep awake in it when giving thanks .
51004003	Keep on praying for me , too , that God may open for me a door of utterance to speak the secret truth of Christ , for which I am a prisoner .
51004004	Pray that I may unfold it as I ought to speak .
51004005	Conduct yourselves with wisdom toward those without , buying up your opportunities .
51004006	Let your speech be always gracious , with a savor of salt , and learn how to give every man a fitting answer .
51004007	Tychicus , my beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow slave in the Lord , will make known to you all that concerns me .
51004008	I have sent him with Onesimus , the faithful and beloved brother , one of your own number , for this very purpose , to let you know how I am , and to cheer your hearts .
51004009	They will inform you of all that goes on here .
51004010	Aristarchus , my fellow prisoner , salutes you , and Marcus , the cousin of Barnabas ( about whom you received instructions ; if he comes to you , make him welcome ) , and Jesus surnamed Justas .
51004011	These are my only fellow workers for the kingdom of God , belonging to the circumcision , who have been any comfort to me .
51004012	Epaphras , one of yourselves , salutes you , a slave of Christ who is always agonizing for you in his prayers , that you may stand firm , mature , and fully assured in all the will of God .
51004013	For I can testify to his deep interest in you and in those in Laodicea and Hierapolis .
51004014	Luke , the beloved physician , salutes you , and so does Demas .
51004015	Salute the brothers in Laodicea ; Nympha also , and the church which meets at her house .
51004016	And when this letter has been read to you , see that it is read also in the church of Laodiceans , and that you also read the letter from Laodicea .
51004017	And tell Archippas to take heed to the ministry which he has received in the Lord , that he may fulfill it .
51004018	I , Paul , add this farewell in my own handwriting . Do not forget these chains of mine . Grace be with you .
52001001	Paul and Silas and Timothy . To the church of the Thessalonians which is in God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ . Grace be to you , and peace .
52001002	I am continually thanking God for all , always making mention of you in my prayers ,
52001003	as I call to mind your work of faith , and labor of love , and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ , in the presence of our God and Father .
52001004	For I know , O brothers , beloved of God , that he has chosen you ;
52001005	for my gospel did not come to you in word only , but in power also , and in the Holy Spirit , and with deep conviction . For you know also the manner in which I behaved myself among you for your sakes .
52001006	Moreover , you began to follow the pattern I set you , and the Lords also , receiving the word with joy in the Holy Spirit , although amid severe persecution .
52001007	Thus you became a pattern to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia .
52001008	For the word of the Lord has been sounded forth from you , and its sound has been heard not only in Macedonia and Achaia , but also in every place where the tidings of your faith toward God have been spread abroad , so that I have no need to speak of it .
52001009	For others , of their own accord , tell about the welcome I had from you , and how you turned to God from your idols , to be slaved of a true and living God ,
52001010	and to await for the coming of his Son from the heavens , the Son whom he raised from the dead , even Jesus , our Deliverer from the wrath to come .
52002001	For you yourselves know , brothers , that my visit to you did not fail of its purpose ;
52002002	for you remember that although I had already borne ill-treatment and insult at Philippi , I took courage in my God to tell you the gospel of God , in the face of much opposition .
52002003	For my preaching was not grounded on a delusion , or on impure motives , on in deceit .
52002004	But as my fitness to be entrusted with the gospel has been tested and approved by God , I so speak , not to please men , but to please God , who is testing my motives .
52002005	For as you well know , I never resorted to flattery , nor to any pretext for enriching myself . God is my witness !
52002006	Now was I seeking glory from men , either yourselves or others , although I might have exercised authority as Christs apostle .
52002007	On the contrary I showed myself among you as gentle as a mother , when she tenderly nurses her own children .
52002008	So in my fond affection it was my joy to give you , not only the gospel of God , but my very life also , because you had become dear to me .
52002009	You recall , brothers , my labor and toil ; how , while working at my trade day and night , so as not to become a burden to any of you , I proclaimed to you the gospel of God .
52002010	You are witnesses - and so is God - how pure and just and blameless was my behavior among you believers .
52002011	You know how I was wont to treat each of you as a father treats his children ,
52002012	exhorting and imploring and adjuring each one among you to lead a life worthy of the God who called you into his own kingdom and glory .
52002013	For this reason also I am giving continual thanks to God , because when you heard from me the spoken word of God , you received it not as the word of men , but as the word of God ( which in truth it is ) , who himself is effectually at work in you believe .
52002014	For you , brothers , began to follow the example of the churches of God in Judea , which are in Christ Jesus ; and you in your turn suffered at the hands of your fellow citizens persecutions like to those which they endured from the Jews -
52002015	The men who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets , and drove us out - they are displeasing to God , and are the enemies of all mankind .
52002016	They forbid me to speak to the Gentiles with a view to their salvation . They continue always to fill up the measure of their sins ; but the wrath of God is come upon them to the full !
52002017	But I , my brothers , although torn from you for a short season ( in presence , not in heart ) , made eager efforts to behold you face to face with strong longing .
52002018	For that reason I would fain have visited you - I , Paul , again and again - but Satan hindered me .
52002019	For what is my hope , or joy ? What is the victors wreath in which I exult ? What but your own selves in the presence of our Lord Jesus , at his coming !
52002020	For you are my pride and my delight .
52003001	And so , when I could no longer bear it , I made up my mind to be left behind at Athens , all alone .
52003002	I sent Timothy , my brother and Gods fellow worker in the gospel of Christ , to strengthen you and to hearten you in your faith .
52003003	So that no one should be shaken by these troubles-for you know well that we are appointed to troubles .
52003004	For even when I was with you I used to tell you beforehand that I was to suffer affliction ; and so it proved , as you know .
52003005	So , when I could no longer endure it , I sent to find out about your faith , fearing that the tempter had tempted you and that my labor had been in vain .
52003006	But now that Timothy has returned from you to me , and has brought good news of your faith and love , and that you are still holding me in affectionate remembrance , always longing to see me as I also am longing to see you .
52003007	I have been comforted , my brothers , in regard to you , in spite of all my distress and affliction over your faith .
52003008	For now I am really living , if you are standing firm in the Lord .
52003009	For what thanksgiving can I render again to God in your behalf , in return for all the joy which you cause me in the presence of my God ?
52003010	Night and day I am praying earnestly that I may see you face to face , and may perfect whatever is yet lacking in your faith .
52003011	Now may our God and Father himself , and our Lord Jesus Christ , direct my path to you .
52003012	Meanwhile , may the Lord cause you to increase and abound in love toward one another and toward all men , even as I do toward you .
52003013	And so may he establish your hearts unblamable in holiness before our God and Father , at the coming of our Lord Jesus , with all his saints .
52004001	Finally then , my brothers , I continue to beseech and exhort you in the Lord Jesus , that , as you learned of me how to walk so as to please God - and you are actually doing so - that you abound in it yet more and more .
52004002	For you know what charges I laid upon you through the Lord Jesus .
52004003	For this is Gods will , even your sanctification ; that you should abstain from sexual vice .
52004004	That each one should learn how to take a wife in purity and honor .
52004005	Not in the passion of lust , like the Gentiles who know not God .
52004006	That no man overreach or take advantage of his brother in such matters , because " the Lord takes vengeance " in all these things , as also I repeatedly forewarned you and testified to you .
52004007	For God has not called us for uncleanness , but in holiness .
52004008	So that he who rejects this is not rejecting man , but the God who gave you his Holy Spirit .
52004009	It is not needed that I should write to you about brotherly love ; for you yourselves have been taught by God to love one another .
52004010	As indeed you do love all the brothers in Macedonia . But I exhort you , brothers , to abound in this yet more .
52004011	Also , that you endeavor to live quietly and to mind your own business , and to work with your hands ( as I charged you ) .
52004012	So that your conduct may be seemly toward those that are without , and that you may not need help from any man .
52004013	But I would not have you ignorant , brothers , about those who are falling asleep . You must not sorrow like other men , who have no hope .
52004014	For if we really believe that Jesus died and rose again , so even so will God through Jesus bring with him those also who have fallen asleep .
52004015	For this I tell you by the word of the Lord , that we who are living , who survive unto the coming of the Lord , will in no wise precede those who have fallen asleep .
52004016	For the Lord himself with a shout , with the voice of an archangel , and with the trumpet of God will descend from heaven . Then the dead in Christ will rise first .
52004017	And afterwards we who are alive , who remain , shall be caught up together with them in the clouds , to meet the Lord in the air ; and so shall we ever be with the Lord .
52004018	So comfort one another with these words .
52005001	Now as to the times and the seasons , brothers , you have no need that anything be written to you .
52005002	You yourselves know perfectly that the Day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night .
52005003	While men are saying " Peace and safety , " then , like birth-pangs upon a woman with child , destruction will come upon them suddenly . In no wise will they escape .
52005004	But you , brothers , are not in darkness , that " the Day " should come upon you like a bandit .
52005005	For you are all sons of light , and sons of day . We are not of night nor of darkness .
52005006	So then let us not be sleeping as do the rest , but let us be watchful and self-controlled .
52005007	For those who are sleeping , sleep in the night , and those who are drunken , are drunken in the night .
52005008	But let us who are of the day be self-controlled , putting on the breastplate of faith and love ; and for a helmet , the hope of salvation .
52005009	For God did not appoint us to wrath , but to win salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ .
52005010	He died for us , in order that whether we are keeping vigil in life or sleeping in death we may ever be living together with him .
52005011	So comfort one another , and try to build one another up , as indeed you are doing .
52005012	I entreat you , brothers , to acknowledge those who are toiling among you and are your leaders in the Lord , and give you counsel .
52005013	Esteem them very highly in love for their works sake . Live in peace among yourselves .
52005014	And , brothers , we urge you to admonish the disorderly , comfort the faint-hearted , sustain the weak , lose patience with none .
52005015	Take care that none of you ever return evil for evil , but always pursue what is kind to one another and to all .
52005016	Always be joyful .
52005017	Pray without ceasing .
52005018	Give thanks in every circumstance , for this is the will of God for you in Christ Jesus .
52005019	Quench not the Spirit .
52005020	Do not despise prophesyings .
52005021	But try all , holding fast to the good .
52005022	Hold aloof from every form of evil .
52005023	May the God of peace consecrate you wholly ; and may your spirit and soul and body be kept altogether faultless until the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ .
52005024	He who calls you is faithful ; he will fulfil my prayer .
52005025	Brothers , pray for me .
52005026	Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss .
52005027	I adjure you , in the name of the Lord , to have this letter read to all the brothers .
52005028	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you .
53001001	Paul and Silvanus and Timothy . To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
53001002	Grace to you , and peace from God the Father , and the Lord Jesus Christ .
53001003	I ought always to thank God for you , brothers , as is fitting because of the abundant growth of your faith and of the overflowing love with which every one of you is filled toward one another .
53001004	So that I myself am boasting about you among the churches of God , boasting of the stedfastness and faith which you are displaying in all the troubles and afflictions which you are enduring .
53001005	They are an evidence of the righteous judgment of God , who will count you worthy of his kingdom , in behalf of which you are even now suffering .
53001006	For truly Gods justice must render back trouble to those who are troubling you ,
53001007	and give to you , who are now troubled , rest , along with me at the unveiling " apocalypse " of the Lord Jesus from heaven , with his mighty angels ,
53001008	in flaming fire . Then shall he take vengeance on those who know not God , even on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus .
53001009	They shall suffer punishment , even an eternal destruction from the presence of the Lord , and from the brightness of his glorious majesty ,
53001010	when he comes to be glorified in his saints , and to be wondered at in all believers , on that Day ; ( for you also believed our testimony ) .
53001011	To this end I am making my constant prayer for you , beseeching God to make you worthy of your calling , and to fulfil mightily every desire of goodness and effort of faith ;
53001012	so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in him , according to the grace of our God and of our Lord Jesus Christ .
53002001	Now concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to meet him , I entreat you , brothers ,
53002002	not to be " quickly shaken out of your wits " and not to be agitated either by a spirit or by a message , or by an epistle purporting to be from me , saying , " The Day of the Lord is at hand . "
53002003	Let no one deceive you by any means . For it will not come until after the Great Apostasy , and the revealing of the Man of Sin , the son of perdition ,
53002004	the adversary , who opposes and exalts himself against all that is called God , or is an object of worship ; so that he takes his seat in the Temple of God , and vaunts himself as God .
53002005	Do you not recall that I often told you this , when I was with you ?
53002006	And now you know what is holding him back , to the end that he may be revealed in his appointed time .
53002007	For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work ; only there is one who is hindering and will continue to hinder till he be removed ;
53002008	and then the lawless one will be revealed . Him the Lord will consume with the breath of his lips , and destroy with the brightness of his appearing ;
53002009	even he whose coming is according to the energy of Satan , in every power and sign and lying wonder ,
53002010	and with all deceit of unrighteousness for those who are perishing , because they did not receive the love of the truth for their salvation .
53002011	For this reason God is sending on them an energy of delusion , that they should put faith in a falsehood ;
53002012	so that they all should be condemned , who are faithless to the truth , but take pleasure in evil .
53002013	But for you , brothers , whom the Lord loves , I ought to give thanks to God continually , because God has chosen you from the beginning for salvation in consecration of the Spirit and belief of the truth .
53002014	For this he called you through my gospel , so that you might obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ .
53002015	So , brothers , stand fast , and hold fast the teachings which you have been taught by me , whether by word of mouth or by letter .
53002016	And may our Lord Jesus Christ himself , and God our Father , who has loved us and given us eternal encouragement and a good hope in grace ,
53002017	comfort your hearts , and establish you in every good work and word .
53003001	Finally , brothers , pray on for me , that Gods word may run swiftly , and be glorified as in your own case ,
53003002	and that I may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men ; for all do not hold the faith .
53003003	But the Lord is faithful ; he will stablish you and guard you from the Evil One .
53003004	Now we have fully fixed our faith on you in the Lord , that you are doing and will continue to do what we enjoin .
53003005	May the Lord incline your hearts to the love of God and to the stedfastness of Christ .
53003006	I summon you , in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ , to shun any brother who leads an idle and disorderly life , which is not according to the rule you received from me .
53003007	For you know well how you must imitate me . For I did not lead an idle or disorderly life among you ;
53003008	I did not eat my food as a gift from any man , but in toil and travail , night and day , I worked , so that I might not be a burden to any of you .
53003009	Not that I have no right to such support ; it was simply to give you an example for you to imitate .
53003010	For indeed when I was with you , I used to charge you , " If any man will not work , he shall not eat . "
53003011	But I hear that there are those of your number who are leading idle and disorderly lives , who are not busy , but mere busybodies .
53003012	Now all such I command and entreat , by the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ , to work in quietness . and to earn their own living .
53003013	But you , brothers , must not grow weary in well-doing .
53003014	If any man does not give heed to what I have said in this letter , mark that man ; do not associate with him , so as to make him feel ashamed ;
53003015	and yet do not count him as an enemy , but admonish him as a brother .
53003016	And may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times and in every way . The Lord be with you all .
53003017	I , Paul , add this greeting in my own handwriting , which is my token in every letter . Thus I write -
53003018	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all .
54001001	Paul , and apostle of Jesus Christ by command of God our Saviour and Jesus Christ our Hope ,
54001002	to Timothy , my true son in the faith ; Grace , mercy and peace from God , our Father , and the Lord Jesus Christ .
54001003	As I begged you when I was setting out for Macedonia , stay where you are at Ephesus , and instruct certain individuals there not to be teaching heterodoxy ,
54001004	nor to be paying attention to myths and interminable genealogies , which tend to promote discussions rather than a stewardship entrusted by God , a stewardship which is in faith .
54001005	Now the end of the exhortation is love , out of a pure heart and a good conscience and an undissembled faith .
54001006	Some have failed here , and have turned aside to empty argument .
54001007	Although they desire to be teachers of the law , they understand neither the words they use nor the subjects they talk about .
54001008	I know well that " the Law is good " if a man use it lawfully ;
54001009	but he must remember that the Law is not enacted for a good man , but for the lawless and rebellious , for the irreligious and sinful , for the godless and profane , for parricides and murderers ,
54001010	for the immoral , for sexual perverts , for slave dealers , liars , perjurers , and whatever else is contrary to sound teaching ,
54001011	as laid down in the glorious gospel of the blessed God , which has been entrusted to me .
54001012	And I am thankful to Christ Jesus our Lord , who has thus enabled me , that he accounted me faithful , and appointed me to his service ,
54001013	although I had formerly been a blasphemer and a persecutor and a doer of outrage . But I obtained mercy because I acted ignorantly in unbelief .
54001014	And the grace of our Lord overflowed with faith and love that is in Christ Jesus .
54001015	Faithful is the saying , and worthy of all acceptation , that " Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners " ! And there is no greater sinner than I !
54001016	Yet for this very cause I obtained mercy , so that in me , the chief of sinners , Jesus Christ might display all his boundless patience as an illustration for those who should later believe in him , and so gain life eternal .
54001017	Now unto the King eternal , immortal , invisible , the only God , be glory and honor forever and ever . Amen !
54001018	This charge then , I am laying upon you , Timothy , my son , according to the predictions formerly made concerning you . Fight the good fight in the spirit of these predictions ,
54001019	keeping fast hold of faith and a good conscience ; which certain individuals have cast aside , and so made shipwreck of their faith .
54001020	Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander , whom I have given over to Satan , so that they may be taught not to blaspheme .
54002001	First of all then , I am urging that supplications , prayers , intercessions , and thanksgivings be offered regularly for all men ;
54002002	for kings and all who are in authority , in order that we may lead a tranquil and peaceful life in all godliness an gravity .
54002003	For this is good and pleasing in the eyes of our Saviour God ,
54002004	whose will it is that all men should be saved , and come into full knowledge of the truth .
54002005	For God is one ; and one is mediator between God and man , the Man Christ Jesus ,
54002006	who gave himself as a ransom in behalf of all , to be attested in due time .
54002007	It was for this testimony that I myself was appointed a herald and apostle ( I am telling the truth , I am not lying ) , to be a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth .
54002008	My wish , then , is that in every place the men should offer prayer , lifting up holy hands , free from anger and disputation ;
54002009	in like manner also the women . I desire women to clothe themselves in suitable apparel , adorning themselves with reverence and self-restraint ; not with hair plaited with gold or pearls , or with expensive clothes ,
54002010	but ( as becomes women proclaiming godliness ) with the ornament of good deeds .
54002011	Let a woman learn quietly in entire submission .
54002012	I allow no woman to teach , or to exercise authority over a man ; but let her keep quiet .
54002013	It was Adam who was first formed , then Eve .
54002014	And it was not Adam who was deceived ; but it was the woman who was thoroughly deceived , and who became involved in transgression .
54002015	Notwithstanding she will be saved by the Child-bearing ; ( so will they all ) , if they live in faith and love and holiness , with self-restraint .
54003001	This is a faithful saying , " If any man is seeking the office of a minister he is aspiring to a noble task . "
54003002	The minister should be a man of blameless character ; he should be husband of but one wife ; he should live a sober , self-restrained , orderly life ; he should be hospitable , skilled in teaching ;
54003003	no drinker or brawler ; but forbearing , peaceable , and no money-lover ;
54003004	he should be a man who rules his own household well , and keeps his children ever under control and thoroughly well behaved .
54003005	For if a man does not know how to rule his own household , how shall he take charge of a church of God ?
54003006	He must not be a recent convert , lest he be blinded with pride , and incur the doom of the devil .
54003007	He should also have a good reputation among outsiders , lest he fall into reproach , and into a snare of the devil .
54003008	Deacons , likewise , must be serious , not double-tongued , not given to much wine , not greedy of gain ,
54003009	holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience .
54003010	They should first be tested , and after that , if they are found irreproachable , let them serve as deacons .
54003011	Deaconesses likewise must be grave , not slanderers , sober , faithful in all things .
54003012	Let deacons be the husband of but one wife , men who rule their children and their household properly .
54003013	For those who have well discharged the duties of a deacon are gaining an honorable position for themselves , as well as much fearless confidence in the faith of Christ Jesus .
54003014	Although I am hoping to come to you before long ,
54003015	I am writing this to you in case I should be detained , to let you see how you ought to behave in the household of God - the Church of the everliving God , the pillar and mainstay of the truth .
54003016	Yes ! without contradiction , great is the mystery of godliness !
54004001	Now the Spirit distinctly declares that in latter days there will be some who will fall away from the faith , by listening to spirits of error , and to teachings of demons
54004002	speaking lies in hypocrisy . These are men whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron ,
54004003	who discourage marriage , and enjoin abstinence from foods which God created to be received with thankfulness , by those who believe , and have a clear knowledge of the truth .
54004004	For everything that God has created is good , and nothing is to be rejected if only it is received with thankfulness .
54004005	For it is sanctified by the Word of God and by prayer .
54004006	As you lay all these things before the brothers , you will be a noble minister of Christ Jesus , nourishing yourself in the precepts of the faith and that noble teaching which you have followed .
54004007	Ever reject these profane and old womanish myths ; and continually train yourself for the contest of godliness .
54004008	For physical training is of some small service , but godliness is of service in everything ; since it carries with it a promise of life , both here and hereafter .
54004009	Faithful is the saying , and worthy of all acceptation .
54004010	" We toil and agonize because our hopes are set on the ever-living God , who is the Saviour of all men . - of believers in particular .
54004011	Keep preaching and teaching these things .
54004012	Let no one despise you on account of your youth , but become an example for the faithful in word , in life , in love , in faith , in purity .
54004013	Be applying yourself until I come to public reading , preaching , and teaching .
54004014	Never neglect the gift within you , which was given in fulfilment of prophecy at the time of the laying on of hands by the elders .
54004015	Let these things be your care , give yourself wholly to them , so that your progress may be manifest to all .
54004016	Give heed to yourself and to your teaching . Persevere in these things , for by doing this you will save both yourself and your hearers .
54005001	Do not reprimand an aged man , but continue pleading with him as if he were your father . Treat the young men as brothers ,
54005002	the older women as mothers , the younger women as sisters in all purity .
54005003	Ever honor widows who are really widows ;
54005004	but if any widow has children or grandchildren , let these learn to show their piety first toward their own household , and to make some return to their parents , for that is pleasing in Gods sight .
54005005	Now she who is a widow indeed , and desolate , has fixed her hope on God , and devotes herself to supplications and prayers , day and night .
54005006	But she who lives in wantonness is dead even while she still lives .
54005007	Keep admonishing them regarding these things , so that they may be irreproachable .
54005008	But if any one fails to provide for his own , and especially for his kindred , he has denied the faith and is worse than an infidel .
54005009	A widow , to be placed upon the list , must be not less than sixty years old , and one who has been the wife of but one husband .
54005010	She must be well reputed for good works , as one who has brought up a family , received strangers with hospitality , washed the feet of the saints , relieved the distressed , and diligently followed every good work .
54005011	But exclude from the list the younger widows ; for where they have become wanton against Christ , they desire to marry ,
54005012	and incur condemnation because they have broken their first troth .
54005013	Moreover , they learn to be idle , wandering about from house to house , and are not only idlers , but gossips also , and busybodies , repeating things they ought not .
54005014	It is my wish , then , that the younger widows marry , bear children , rule their houses , and give no occasion to our adversary for railing .
54005015	For already some widows have gone astray after Satan .
54005016	Any believing woman , who has widowed relatives , ought to relieve them and not let the church be burdened with them ; so that the church may relieve the really destitute widows .
54005017	Let the elders who fill their offices well , be held worthy of twofold honor ; especially those who have the task of preaching and teaching .
54005018	For the Scripture says , You must not muzzle an ox when he is treading out the grain , and The worker is worth his wages .
54005019	Do not receive an accusation against an elder , except on the testimony of two or three witnesses .
54005020	Rebuke offenders publicly , so that others also may take warning .
54005021	I charge you solemnly in the presence of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ and of the elect angels , that you observe these things without prejudice against any man , and do nothing out of partiality .
54005022	Never ordain any one hastily , nor take part in the wrong-doing of others . Keep yourself pure .
54005023	Do not continue to drink nothing but water , but take a little wine for your stomachs sake , and your frequent attacks of illness .
54005024	Some mens sins are notorious , and lead them straight on the way to condemnation ; but others sins follow them up .
54005025	So also noble deeds are conspicuous , and even if otherwise , they cannot be kept hidden .
54006001	Let those who are under the yoke as slaves esteem their masters as worthy of all honor , so that the name of God and the teachings be not blasphemed .
54006002	Those whose masters are Christian believers must not treat them with disrespect , because they are brothers ; nay , rather slave for them the better because those who get the benefit of their services are believing and beloved . Continue to teach and preach this .
54006003	If any one teaches heterodoxy , and refuses to consent to the wholesome words of the Lord Jesus Christ , and to the teachings of religion ,
54006004	he is puffed up with conceit and knows nothing , but is doting about disputations and a strife of words . These give rise to envy , quarrels , railings , evil suspicions ,
54006005	and wrangling between men whose minds are corrupt and destitute of the truth ; who suppose that godliness is a source of gain .
54006006	Now godliness with contentment is truly gainful ;
54006007	for we have brought nothing into the world , and it is certain we can carry nothing out !
54006008	So if we have food and shelter , let us be content with that .
54006009	Those who desire to be rich fall into the snares of temptation and many foolish and hurtful lusts , which drown men in destruction and perdition .
54006010	For the love of money is a source of all kinds of evil ; and in their eager desire to be rich some have been led astray form the faith , and have pierced themselves with many sorrows .
54006011	But you , O servant of God , flee from these things , and run after integrity , piety , faith , love , stedfastness , gentleness .
54006012	Keep contending in the noble contest of the faith ; seize hold on eternal life , to which you were called when you confessed the good confession in the presence of many witnesses .
54006013	In the presence of God who gives life to all , and of Christ Jesus who bore witness to the good confession before Pontius Pilate ,
54006014	I charge you , keep your commission spotless and irreproachable until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ .
54006015	For in his own good time this will be brought about by that blessed and only potentate , King of kings and Lord of lords ,
54006016	who alone possesses immortality , who dwells in light that none can approach , whom no man has ever seen or can see ; to whom be honor and power everlasting . Amen .
54006017	Charge the rich of this world not to be supercilious , nor to trust in uncertain riches , but in God , who provides all things richly for our use .
54006018	Charge them to practise benevolence , to be rich in good works , to be open-handed and generous ,
54006019	laying up right good treasure for themselves in the world to come , in order that they may obtain the Life which is life indeed .
54006020	O , Timothy , guard the treasure which is committed to you . Shun the profane babblings and contradictions of the falsely called " knowledge "
54006021	which some professing have erred from the faith . Grace be with you .
55001001	Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus , by the will of God , sent forth to proclaim the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus .
55001002	To Timothy , my beloved child ; Grace mercy , and peace to you from God our Father and Christ Jesus our Lord .
55001003	I give thanks to God whom I worship with a pure conscience as my fathers did , when I remember you unceasingly in my prayers .
55001004	Night and day when I recall your tears I am longing to see you , that my happiness may be complete .
55001005	I have been reminded of that sincere faith which is in your heart ; which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice , and , I am fully persuaded , dwells in you also .
55001006	For this reason let me remind you to keep ever blazing that gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands .
55001007	For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice , but a spirit of power and of love and of self-control .
55001008	Do not then be ashamed to bear witness for our Lord , nor for me , his prisoner . Nay , join with me in suffering for the gospel by the power of God .
55001009	He has saved us and called us with a holy calling , not dealing with us according to our works , but according to his purpose and grace which he gave us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time .
55001010	This has now been made manifest through the appearing of our Saviour Christ Jesus , who has put an end to death , and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel .
55001011	Of the gospel I was appointed a herald , apostle , and teacher ; and that is the reason I am now undergoing these sufferings .
55001012	But I am not ashamed ; for I know whom I have fully believed , and I am thoroughly persuaded that he is able to keep what I have given him until the Day .
55001013	Hold fast the pattern of sound teaching you have heard from me in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus .
55001014	Guard the glorious trust which has been committed to you by the aid of the Holy Spirit who makes his home in us .
55001015	You already know that all the Christians in Roman Asia forsook me , among them Phygellus and Hermogenes .
55001016	The Lord show mercy to the house hold of Onesiphorus ; for many a time he refreshed me , and was not ashamed of my chain .
55001017	But when he came to Rome he sought for me until he found me .
55001018	The Lord grant him to find mercy form the Lord in that Day ! And you know better than I how many services he rendered in Ephesus .
55002001	Do you then , my son , strengthen you heart in the grace which is in Christ Jesus .
55002002	The teachings which you have heard from me , attested by many witnesses , deliver into the keeping of faithful men , who in their turn will be able to teach others also .
55002003	Take your share in suffering as a good soldier of Jesus Christ .
55002004	A soldier in active service avoids entangling himself in the every-day affairs of life , so that he may please his commander .
55002005	And again , an athlete is not crowned unless he obeys the rules of the game .
55002006	The farmer who has done the work should be the first to get a share of the crop .
55002007	Reflect on what I am telling you . The Lord will give you understanding in everything .
55002008	Always remember that Jesus Christ , a descendant of David , has been raised from the dead according to the gospel I proclaim .
55002009	For preaching it I am suffering , and am even put in chains as a malefacter .
55002010	But Gods message is no prisoner . That is why I endure everything for the sake of the chosen , that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory .
55002011	Faithful is the saying . " If we have died with him , we shall also live with him .
55002012	If we endure suffering , we shall also reign with him . If we disown him , he too will disown us .
55002013	If we prove faithless . he abides faithful , for he cannot be false to himself . "
55002014	Always call these truths to mens mind ; adjuring them in the presence of God to avoid controversy . It is a useless thing , and subverts those who listen to it .
55002015	Strive earnestly to present yourself unto God , tested and proved worthy by trial , a workman unashamed , ever cutting a straight path for the message of the truth .
55002016	but avoid profane babble ; for people will go farther and farther in impiety ,
55002017	and their teaching will spread like a gangrene .
55002018	Among such are Hymenaeus and Philetus , who have gone astray concerning the truth by declaring that the resurrection is already past ; and they are undermining the faith of some .
55002019	Nevertheless Gods firm foundation stands unshaken , bearing this inscription , THE LORD KNOWS THOSE WHO ARE HIS , and this also , LET EVERY ONE WHO NAMES THE NAME OF THE LORD RENOUNCE WICKEDNESS .
55002020	Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver , but also of wood and clay , some for noble , some for ignoble uses .
55002021	If then a man keeps himself clear of these latter , he will be a vessel for honor , consecrated , useful to the Master , prepared for every good work .
55002022	Flee from the passions of youth , but run after righteousness , faith , love , and peace , in company with those who out of a pure heart call upon the Lord .
55002023	Ever shun foolish and puerile discussions , for you know that they lead to quarrels .
55002024	The Lords slave must not quarrel , but must be kind to all men ; a skilful teacher , patient of wrong .
55002025	He must be gentle when instructing opponents ; for possibly God may give them a change of mind for the recognition of the truth ,
55002026	and they may come to their senses again , and escape the snare of the devil , as they are restored to life by God to do his will .
55003001	But of this be sure . In the last days grievous times will come .
55003002	For men will be selfish , mercenary , boastful , haughty , blasphemous , disobedient to parents , ungrateful , irreligious ,
55003003	without natural affection , merciless , slanderous , dissolute , and brutal .
55003004	They will hate goodness , they will be treacherous , reckless , blinded with pride , lovers of pleasure , rather than lovers of God .
55003005	For although they keep up the outward form of religion , they deny its power .
55003006	Turn away from all such . Some of them creep into private houses and lead captive silly women who , laden with sins ,
55003007	and led captive by ever-changing impulses , are always learning but never able to arrive at knowledge of truth .
55003008	As Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses , so also do these men withstand the truth ; being corrupt in mind and worthless in all that concerns the faith .
55003009	But they will not get on ; for their folly will be made as openly manifest to all as was that of Jannes and Jambres .
55003010	But you , Timothy , have followed my teaching , my conduct , my aims , my faith , patience , love , endurance ,
55003011	as well as the persecutions and sufferings which befell me at Antioch , Iconium , and Lystra . You know all the persecutions I endured , and how the Lord delivered me out of them all !
55003012	Yes , and all who purpose to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted .
55003013	But wicked men and impostors will go on from bad to worse , deceiving others , and being themselves deceived .
55003014	But do you hold fast what you have learned and have held to be true . You know those from whom you have learned it ,
55003015	and how from a child you have known the Holy Scriptures , which are able to make you wise unto salvation through faith in Christ Jesus .
55003016	Every Scripture , seeing that it is God-breathed , is also profitable for teaching , for refutation , for correction , and for training in righteousness ,
55003017	so that the man of God may himself be complete , and completely equipped for every good work .
55004001	I adjure you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus who is about to judge the living and the dead - by his appearing and his kingdom , I adjure you - Luke only is with me . Pick up Mark , and bring him with you , for he is useful to me in my ministry .
55004002	proclaim the message , be urgent in season and out of season ; convince , rebuke , encourage , with never-failing patience and teaching .
55004003	For a time will come when they will not listen to wholesome teaching , but wanting to have their ears tickled , they will heap up for themselves teachers upon teachers to satisfy their own fancies .
55004004	They will turn away their ears from the truth , and turn aside to myths .
55004005	But as for you , be always self-controlled , face hardships , do the work of a missionary , discharge all the duties of your ministry .
55004006	I for my part am a libation already being poured in sacrifice ; and the time of my unmooring is at hand .
55004007	I have fought in the glorious contest ; I have run the race ; I have kept the faith .
55004008	Henceforth there is laid up for me the garland of righteousness which the Lord , the righteous Judge , will award to me on that Day , and not to me only , but also to all those who have loved his appearing .
55004009	Do your best to come to me speedily ,
55004010	for Demas has deserted me for love of this present world , and is gone to Thessalonica ; Crescens is gone to Galatia ; Titus to Dalmatia .
55004012	Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus .
55004013	When you come , bring the cloak I left in Troas with Carpus ; also my books , but especially my parchments .
55004014	Alexander , the coppersmith , manifested bitter hostility toward me . The Lord will requite him according to his works .
55004015	Be also on your guard against him , for he has violently opposed my arguments .
55004016	At the time of my first defense no one stood by me ; on the contrary they all deserted me - may it not be laid to their charge !
55004017	Nevertheless the Lord Jesus stood by me , and strengthened my heart , that through me full proclamation of the gospel might be made , and the Gentiles might hear it ; and I was rescued from the lions jaws .
55004018	And the Lord will rescue me from every evil assault , and will preserve me for his heavenly kingdom . To him be the glory forever and ever ! Amen !
55004019	Give my greetings to Prisca and Aquila , and the household of Onesiphorus .
55004020	Erastus remained at Corinth ; Trophimus I left behind me ill at Miletus .
55004021	Do try to come before winter . Eubulus greets you , and so do Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brotherhood .
55004022	The Lord Jesus be with your spirit . Grace be with you all .
56001001	To Titus , my true son in a common faith , from Paul , a slave of God , and an apostle of Jesus Christ , according to the faith of Gods elect , and to the knowledge of the truth which goes with piety ;
56001002	I write in hope of life eternal which God who never lies , promised before times eternal ,
56001003	but manifested in his own time ; that word of his in proclaiming which I have been entrusted by command of God our Saviour .
56001004	Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Saviour .
56001005	I left you in Crete for this reason , that you might set right the things left unfinished , and appoint presbyters in every city as I had instructed you ;
56001006	men who are blameless , the husband of one wife , with believing children who are not accused of riot or insubordination .
56001007	For indeed a presiding officer , as Gods steward , ought to be blameless , not self-willed or quick-tempered , not a drunkard or violent , or greedy of filthy lucre ;
56001008	but he must be hospitable , a lover of the good , sober-minded , just , holy , self-controlled .
56001009	He must hold to the faithful word according to the teaching , so that he may be able both to encourage by sound teaching , and to confute our opponents .
56001010	For there are many individuals who are unruly , empty talkers and deceivers , particularly those of the circumcision , whose mouths must be stopped ;
56001011	for they upset whole households and , for filthy lucres sake , teach what they ought not to teach .
56001012	By one of their own number , by a prophet of their own , it has been said , " Cretans are always liars , evil beasts , idle gluttons . "
56001013	This testimony is true . So rebuke them sharply ,
56001014	so as to make them sound in the faith , not giving heed to Jewish myths and commandments of men who turn away from the truth .
56001015	All things are pure to the pure ; but to the contaminated and the faithless nothing is pure , nay , their very minds and consciences are tainted .
56001016	They profess to know God , but by their deeds they disown him ; in that they are detestable , disobedient , and reprobate for good work of any sort .
56002001	But do you , on your part , speak what becomes sound teaching ;
56002002	that the older men be self-controlled , serious and sober-minded , sound in faith , in love , in patience ;
56002003	that older women likewise be reverent in demeanor , not slanderers or slaves to much wine , but teachers of what is right .
56002004	They should train the younger women to love their husbands and children ,
56002005	to be sober-minded , chaste , workers at home , kind and submissive to their husbands , in order that Gods message be not maligned .
56002006	The younger men exhort to be sober-minded ; in every respect showing yourself an example of good works .
56002007	In your teaching be serious and sincere .
56002008	Let the instruction that you give be sound and above reproach , so that our opponents may be ashamed because they find no evil things to say about us .
56002009	Exhort slaves to be obedient to their own masters , and to be well-pleasing to them in every respect ;
56002010	not to contradict nor pilfer , but to exhibit praiseworthy trustworthiness in every thing , that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things .
56002011	" For Gods grace has shined forth bringing salvation to all men
56002012	And schooling us to renounce impiety and evil passions , And to live soberly , righteously , and godly in this present age ;
56002013	While we look for the blessed hope and epiphany of the glory of our great God and Saviour , Jesus Christ .
56002014	He gave himself for us to redeem us from all iniquity , and to purify unto himself a people zealous of good works . "
56002015	Thus speak , exhort , reprove with all authority . Let no one despise you .
56003001	Remind them to be submissive to their rulers and authorities ; let them be obedient , ready for every good work ;
56003002	they must speak evil of none , they must not be quarrelsome , but gentle , showing perfect meekness toward all .
56003003	For we were ourselves once foolish , disobedient , deceived , slaving for various lusts and pleasures , passing our lives in malice and envy . We were hateful , and we hated one another .
56003004	But when the kindness of God our Saviour , And his love toward men shined forth ,
56003005	He saved us , not because of any deeds that we had done in righteousness , But because of his own pity for us . He saved us by that washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit
56003006	which he poured out upon us richly , through Jesus Christ our Saviour ;
56003007	In order that being justified by his grace , We might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life .
56003008	This saying is trustworthy . On this I want you to firmly insist ; that those who have faith in God must be careful to maintain honest occupations . Such counsels are good and profitable for men .
56003009	But avoid foolish questionings and genealogies and dissensions and wranglings about the law ; for these are unprofitable and empty .
56003010	After a first and second admonition , refuse a man who is causing divisions ;
56003011	you may be sure that such a man is perverted and sinning , and is self-condemned .
56003012	As soon as I send Artemas or Tychicus to you , join me in Nicopolis as quickly as you can , for I have arranged to winter there .
56003013	Speed Zenas the lawyer , and Apollos , on their journey diligently .
56003014	Let them want nothing , and " let our people learn to devote themselves to honest work to supply the necessities of their teachers , " so that they be not unfruitful .
56003015	All who are with us salute you . Salute those who love me in faith . Grace be with you all .
57001001	To my beloved friend and coworker Philemon ,
57001002	to my sister Apphia , to my fellow soldier Archippus , and to the church which meets at Philemons house . From Paul , a prisoner of Jesus Christ , and brother Timothy .
57001003	Grace and peace be to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
57001004	I am ever mentioning you in my prayers , and giving thanks to God ,
57001005	because I am hearing of your love and of the faith which you hold , not only toward the Lord Jesus Christ , but toward all the saints .
57001006	And I pray that your participation may become effectual , as you come to acknowledge every good thing which is in you to Christ .
57001007	For I have great joy and comfort in your love , my brother , because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed .
57001008	And so , although I might be bold in Christ to dictate to you what is fitting ,
57001009	yet for loves sake , I rather beseech you , I , Paul , an old man , and now a prisoner for Christ Jesus !
57001010	I beseech you for my son , Onesimus , whom I have begotten in these chains .
57001011	Once you found him " unprofitable , " but now he is " profitable " to you and to me .
57001012	I am sending him back to you , he himself , that is , my very heart !
57001013	I could wish to retain him at my side , so that he might minister to me in your stead , in my bonds for the gospel .
57001014	But without your consent I was unwilling to do anything , so that your kindness to me might be of your own free will , and not of compulsion .
57001015	Perhaps for this reason you were separated from him for an hour , in order that you might have him back forever ,
57001016	no longer as a slave , but more than a slave , as a brother beloved ; especially dear to me , but how much more to you , both as a man and a fellow Christian .
57001017	If then you count me as a partner , receive him as you would me .
57001018	And if he has wronged you at all , or is owing you anything , charge that to me .
57001019	I Paul am writing this in my own handwriting , " I will repay you . " But I will not mention that you owe me , over and over , your very soul .
57001020	Come my brother , let me have joy in the Lord because of you ! Refresh my heart in Christ !
57001021	Because I am thoroughly persuaded of your obedience , I have written you , knowing full well that you will do by me what I am asking .
57001022	Please also prepare for me a lodging , for I am hoping by your prayers to be restored to you again .
57001023	Epaphras , my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus , sends you greeting ;
57001024	so do Mark , Aristarchus , Demas , and Luke , my fellow workers .
57001025	May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit . Amen .
58001001	God , who in ancient days spoke to our ancestors in the prophets , at many different times and by various methods ,
58001002	has at the end of these days spoken to us in a Son whom he appointed heir of all things ; through whom also he made the universe .
58001003	He being an emanation of Gods glory and stamp of his substance , and upholding the universe by the utterances of his power , after by himself making purification of our sins , has taken his seat on the right hand of the Majesty on High .
58001004	He is as much superior to the angels as the name that he has inherited surpasses theirs .
58001005	For to what angel did God ever say , Thou art my son ; this day have I become thy Father ? and again , I will be a father to him , and he shall be to me a son ?
58001006	And further , when he brought the firstborn into the habitable world , he said , Let all the angels of God worship him .
58001007	While of the angels he said , He makes his angels into winds , His ministering servants into flames of fire .
58001008	But to the Son he says . Thy throne , O God , is forever and ever , And the scepter of thy kingdom is the scepter of justice .
58001009	Thou hast loved righteousness and hated lawlessness ; Therefore did God , thy God , anoint thee with the oil of gladness beyond thy comrades .
58001010	And , Thou , O Lord , in the beginning didst lay the foundations of the earth , And the heavens are the work of thy hands .
58001011	They will perish , but thou remainest ; They all will grow old like a garment ,
58001012	Like a mantle thou wilt fold them up , And like a garment they will be changed . But thou art the same , And thy years will never fail .
58001013	To which of the angels has he ever said , Sit at my right hand , Till I make thy foes a footstool for thy feet ?
58001014	Are they not all ministering spirits , sent forth for service in behalf of those who are about to inherit salvation ?
58002001	For this reason we must pay the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard , for fear we should drift away .
58002002	For if the word uttered through angels stood firm , so that every transgression and act of disobedience met with its just retribution , how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation ?
58002003	Which having begun to be spoken by the Lord , was confirmed to us by those who heard him ;
58002004	God himself corroborating their testimony by signs and wonders and a variety of miraculous powers , and by gifts of the Holy Spirit imparted in accordance with his own will .
58002005	It is not to angels that God subjected the age to be , of which we are speaking .
58002006	But some one , somewhere , testified , saying . What is Man , that thou art mindful of him ? Or any man , that thou carest for him ?
58002007	Thou hast made him only a little lower that the angels ; With glory and honor hast thou crowned him ; And hast set him to govern the works of thy hands ;
58002008	Thou hast put all things under his feet . For this putting all things under man means leaving nothing not subject to him . But we do not yet see all things subject to him .
58002009	What we do see is Jesus , who was made for a time a little lower than the angels , now crowned with glory and honor , because of the suffering of death , in order that through Gods grace he might taste death for every man .
58002010	For it befitted him , for whom and through whom all things exist , in bringing many sons to glory , to make the Pioneer of their salvation perfect through sufferings .
58002011	For both he who sanctifies and those whom he is sanctifying are all from One ; for which reason he is not ashamed to call them brothers , saying .
58002012	I will proclaim thy name to my brothers ; In the midst of the Church I will hymn thy praises .
58002013	And again , I myself will put my trust in God . And again , Lo , I and the children God has given me .
58002014	Therefore , since the children are sharers in flesh and blood , he also similarly partook of the same , in order that through death he might render powerless him that had the power of death , that is , the devil ;
58002015	And might deliver those who through fear of death had been subject to life-long bondage .
58002016	For assuredly it is not angels , nay , it is the offspring of Abraham , whom he is ever taking by the hand .
58002017	And so it was necessary that he should in all points be made like his brothers , so that he might become a compassionate and faithful high priest , in all that relates to God , to make reconciliation for the sins of the people .
58002018	For inasmuch as he himself has suffered , being tempted , he is also able instantly to succor those who are tempted , he is also able instantly to succor those who are tempted .
58003001	Therefore , holy brothers , comrades of a heavenly calling , fix your thoughts then upon Jesus , the Apostle and High Priest of our confession .
58003002	How faithful he was to the God who appointed him ! For while Moses also was faithful in all Gods house ,
58003003	Jesus has been counted worthy of greater glory than Moses , inasmuch as he who has built a house has higher honor than the house itself .
58003004	For every house has its builder ; but he who built the universe is God .
58003005	And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant , bearing testimony to a witness about to be spoken ;
58003006	but Christ as a Son in his own house ; and we are that house , if we retain the cheerful courage and pride of our hope firm unto the end .
58003007	Therefore , as the Holy Spirit says . If you hear Gods voice today ,
58003008	Continue not to harden your hearts as in the Provocation , On the day of temptation in the wilderness ,
58003009	When your forefathers tried my forbearance And saw my deeds for forty years .
58003010	For this reason I was sore displeased with that generation , And said , " They are always wandering in their hearts ; They have never learned my ways " ;
58003011	So I swore in my wrath , " They shall never enter into my rest . "
58003012	See to it , brothers , that there shall never be in any one of you an evil and unbelieving heart , manifesting itself in apostasy from the living God .
58003013	On the contrary , encourage each other daily , so long as there is a " Today , " so that no one of you is hindered by the deceitfulness of sin .
58003014	For we are become comrades of the Christ , if we hold our first title deed firm until the very end .
58003015	In the words of Scripture , Today , if you hear his voice , Do not continue to harden your hearts as at the Provocation .
58003016	For who were they that heard and yet provoked him ? Was it not all who came out of Egypt under the leadership of Moses ?
58003017	And with whom was he grieved for forty years ? Was it not with those who had sinned , and whose dead bodies fell in the wilderness ?
58003018	And to whom did he swear that they should never enter into his rest , if not to those who had proved faithless ?
58003019	So you see that it was through unbelief that they were not able to enter in .
58004001	Let us be on our guard , then , though there is a promise still standing of being admitted to his rest , lest any one of you should be found to have come short of it .
58004002	For the Good News is come to us just as it did to them . But the message they heard was of no benefit to them , because they did not share the faith of those who gave heed to it .
58004003	We are actually entering into that rest , we who have believed , as God has said , - In my wrath I swore - " They shall not enter into my Rest , " although his works were finished since the foundation of the world .
58004004	For he has said , somewhere , regarding the seventh day , And God rested on the seventh day from all his work .
58004005	And again in this passage , They shall not enter into my rest .
58004006	Since , then , it remains that some should enter into it , and since those who formerly had the Good News preached to them did not enter in because of unbelief ,
58004007	he again fixes a day , saying long afterward by Davids lips , in words already quoted , Today if you hear his voice , Continue not to harden your hearts .
58004008	For if Joshua had given them rest , he would not have spoken afterward of another day .
58004009	So there remains a Sabbath Rest for the people of God .
58004010	For whoever has entered into his rest has rested from his works , just as God did from his .
58004011	Let us , then , be earnest to enter into that rest , so that no one may fall into the same example of disobedience .
58004012	For living is the Word of God , and active , and sharper than any two-edged sword , piercing even to the severance of soul form spirit , of both joints and marrow , and is a discerner of the very thoughts and conceptions of the heart .
58004013	And there is not a creature hidden form him , but all things are naked and laid prostrate before the eyes of him with whom we have to do .
58004014	Inasmuch , then , as we have a great High Priest , Jesus , the Son of God , who has passed through the heavens , let us hold fast our confession of faith .
58004015	For we have not a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses , but one who has been tempted in all points like as we are , yet without sin .
58004016	Let us , then , draw near with glad boldness to the throne of grace , that we may receive mercy , and find grace to help us in our times of need .
58005001	For every high priest chosen from time to time from among men is appointed on behalf of men , in matters relating to God , to offer both gifts and sacrifices on behalf of sins .
58005002	He is able to deal gently with the ignorant and erring , since he himself also is encompassed with moral weakness ,
58005003	and because of this weakness he is bound to offer sin-offerings not only for the people , but also for himself .
58005004	Again no one takes this honorable office for himself , but he is called by God , just as Aaron was .
58005005	So even the Christ was not raised to the high glory of the priesthood by himself , but on the contrary by Him who said to him . Thou art my Son ; this day have I become thy Father ;
58005006	and again , Thou art a priest forever , after the order of Melchisedek .
58005007	In the days of his flesh , with better cries and weeping Jesus offered up prayers and supplications to Him who was able to save him out of death ; and he was heard because of his devout submission .
58005008	Though he was a son , yet learned he obedience through the things which he suffered ;
58005009	and by being thus made perfect , he became the source of enduring salvation to all who obey him ,
58005010	while God himself pronounced him High Priest according to the order of Melchisedek .
58005011	Concerning him I have much to say , and much that is hard to make clear to you , because you have grown dull of hearing .
58005012	And this too , although you ought by this time to be teaching others , you are still needing some one to teach you the very rudiments of divine revelation . You need milk , not solid food .
58005013	For every one who feeds on milk is inexperienced in the word of righteousness . He is still an infant .
58005014	But solid food is for adults , that is , for those who by constant practise have their faculties trained to discriminate between good and evil .
58006001	So let us get beyond the teaching of the elementary doctrines of Christ , and let us be borne along toward what is mature . Let us not be continually laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works ,
58006002	of faith in God , of the teaching regarding ablutions and the laying on of hands , of the resurrection of the dead , and of eternal judgment .
58006003	And this we will do , if God permit .
58006004	For in the case of those who have been once for all enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift ,
58006005	and become partakers of the Holy Spirit , and tasted the good word of God , and the powers of the Future Age ,
58006006	and then fallen away , it is impossible to renew them again unto repentance . For they repeatedly crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh , and expose him to an open shame .
58006007	For land that has drunk the showers that now and again fall upon it , and produced vegetation useful for those for whom it was tilled , receives a blessing from God ;
58006008	but if it produces thorns and thistles , it is considered worthless , and is in danger of being cursed , and its end will be to be burned .
58006009	But though we thus speak , we are persuaded better things of you , beloved , and things that accompany salvation .
58006010	For God is not unjust ; he will not forget your work and the love you showed for his cause , in sending help to your fellow Christians , as you are still doing .
58006011	but I am longing that each of you continue to show the same diligence to realize the fulness of your hope , even to the end .
58006012	Then do not become slack , but be imitators of those who through faith and patience are inheriting the promises .
58006013	For when God make the promise to Abraham , since he could swear by none greater , he swore by himself , saying .
58006014	Surely I will bless you , and bless you ; I will increase you , and increase you .
58006015	And so by patiently waiting , Abraham obtained the promise .
58006016	I am referring to the oath because men swear by what is greater than themselves , and in every dispute of theirs the oath is final for confirmation .
58006017	On which principle God , wishing to show more convincingly to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his purpose , mediated with an oath ;
58006018	that by means of two immutable things - his promise and his oath - in which it is impossible for God to break faith , we refugees may have strong encouragement to grasp the hope set before us .
58006019	This hope we have as an anchor of the soul , secure and strong , and passing into the sanctuary which is beyond the veil ;
58006020	whither Jesus himself is entered as a forerunner on our behalf , having become a priest forever , after the order of Melchisedek .
58007001	It was this Melchisedek , King of Salem and Priest of the Most High God , who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him ;
58007002	and it was to him that Abraham apportioned a tithe of all the spoil . He was first , as his name signifies , King of righteousness , and then King of Salem , that is , King of Peace ;
58007003	without father or mother , without lineage , having neither beginning of days nor end of life , but resembling the Son of God , he remains a priest in perpetuity .
58007004	But observe how great this man was , to whom even Abraham , the Patriarch , gave a tenth part of the spoils .
58007005	Now those of the sons of Levi who are appointed to the priesthood , are authorized by the Law to take tithes of the people , that is , of their brothers , and that too , although these are descended from Abraham .
58007006	But this man who had no Levitical genealogy actually took tithes of Abraham , and blessed him to whom the promises belong .
58007007	Now it is beyond all controversy that the inferior is always blessed by the superior .
58007008	Again it is mortal men who receive tithes in the one case ; while in the other it is he of whom it is attested , " He lives . "
58007009	And even Levi , who is the receiver of tithes , so to speak , paid tithes through Abraham ;
58007010	for Levi was yet in the loins of his father , when Melchisedek met Abraham .
58007011	Now if there were perfection through the Levitical priesthood , ( and it was under it that the people received the Law ) why was it still necessary for another kind of priest to arise , after the order of Melchisedek , instead of being reckoned according to the order of Aaron ?
58007012	For when the priesthood changes , of necessity the law also changes .
58007013	He who is thus described belonged to another tribe , not one member of which has ever served at the altar .
58007014	For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah , a tribe of which Moses said nothing concerning the priesthood .
58007015	And this is yet more abundantly clear if , after the likeness of Melchisedek , there arises another Priest ,
58007016	who has become such , not according to the law of a transitory enactment , but according to the energy of an indissoluble life .
58007017	For the words are in evidence , Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchisedek .
58007018	For there is a setting aside of a foregoing commandment , because of its weakness and unprofitableness
58007019	( for the Law brought nothing to perfection ) ; and there is the bringing in of a better hope by which we draw near to God ;
58007020	mightier because it was not promised apart from an oath .
58007021	For although those priests became such without an oath , He had an oath form God who said to him , The Lord hath sworn and will not change , Thou art a priest forever .
58007022	And by so much Jesus becomes the guarantor of a better covenant .
58007023	And they indeed have been made priests , many in number , because they have been prevented by death from continuing ;
58007024	but he , because of his abiding forever , holds his priesthood inviolable .
58007025	Hence also he is able to continue saving to the uttermost those who are ever drawing near to God through him , seeing that he is ever living to intercede for them .
58007026	For we needed just such a high priest , holy , innocent , undefiled , separated from sinners , and exalted above the heavens ;
58007027	one who has no need , like the high priests , to offer up daily sacrifices , first for his own sins , then for those of the people . For his sacrifice was made once for all , when he offered up himself .
58007028	For the Law appoints human beings to be high priests , men with all their weakness ; but the word of the oath , which was later than the Law , appoints a Son , perfected forevermore .
58008001	The pith of all that we have been saying is this ; we do have such a High Priest ; and he has taken his seat on the right hand of the throne of Majesty in the heavens ,
58008002	a minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle , which the Lord pitched , not man .
58008003	For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices ; whence it follows that this High Priest also must have some offering to make .
58008004	Now were he on earth , he would not even be a priest , since there are here those who present the gifts according to the Law -
58008005	those priests who serve a mere outline and shadow of the heavenly reality , just as Moses was divinely instructed when he was about to build the Tabernacle . " See " , he says , " that you make everything on the pattern showed you on the mountain . "
58008006	But Jesus has obtained a better ministry , by so much as he is also Mediator of a better covenant , which has been enacted upon better promises .
58008007	For if the first covenant had been faultless , there would have been no need for a second .
58008008	But finding fault with them , He says . " There are days coming , " says the Lord , " When I will establish with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah a new covenant ;
58008009	Not according tot he covenant which I made with their forefathers , On the day when I took them by the hand to lead them forth out of the land of Egypt ; For they did not continue in my covenant , And therefore I disregarded them , " says the Lord .
58008010	" For this is the covenant which I will covenant with the house of Israel , After these days , " says the Lord ; " I will put my laws into their minds , And upon their hearts will I write them ; And I will be their God , And they shall be my people ;
58008011	And they shall not teach every man his fellow citizen , And every man his brother , saying , Know the Lord ; For all shall know me , From the least to the greatest of them .
58008012	For I will have mercy upon their wrong-doings , And their sins I will remember no more . "
58008013	By calling the covenant " new , " He has made the first one obsolete ; and whatever is becoming obsolete and aged , is near to vanishing .
58009001	Now even the first covenant had its ordinances of public worship , and its sanctuary , a material one .
58009002	For a tent was built , the outer one called the Holy Place , in which were the lamp and the table and the loaves of the Presence ;
58009003	and behind the second veil was the tent called the Holy of Holies .
58009004	In it was the golden altar of incense , and also the Ark of the Covenant covered all over with gold , in which was a golden pot holding the manna , and Aarons rod that budded , and the tables of the covenant ;
58009005	while above it , overshadowing the mercy-seat , were the cherubim of glory . But I must not speak about these in detail .
58009006	Such then were the arrangements . Into the outer tent the priests enter continually in the performance of their duties ;
58009007	but into the inner tent the high priest only goes alone , once a year , and that not without blood , which he offers for himself and for the ignorances of the people .
58009008	The Holy Spirit teaching by this that the way into the Holiest has not yet been disclosed while the first tent is still standing .
58009009	This is a parable , for the present time , according to which gifts and sacrifices are offered that are not able , as far as conscience is concerned , to perfect the worshiper ;
58009010	since they consist only in meats and drinks and various ablutions , carnal ordinances , imposed until the time of reformation .
58009011	But when Christ came , a High Priest of good things to come , he passed through the greater and more perfect tent not made with hands , that is to say , not of this material creation ,
58009012	not taking the blood of goats and oxen , but his own blood , and entered once for all into the Holy Place , obtaining for us an eternal redemption .
58009013	For if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who have been defiled , sanctify to the cleansing of the flesh ,
58009014	how much more shall the blood of Christ , who through his eternal spirit offered himself free from blemish to God , cleanse your conscience from dead works unto the service of an ever-living God !
58009015	And because of this he is the Mediator of a new testament , in order that , since a death has taken place to atone for offenses committed under the first testament , those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance .
58009016	For where there is a testament , there must also be brought forward in evidence the death of the testator .
58009017	For a testament is only of force in case of the dead , being never valid so long as the testator lives .
58009018	Accordingly we find that not without blood was the first testament enacted .
58009019	For after every commandment according to the law had been spoken by Moses to the people , he took the blood of calves and goats , and scarlet wool and hyssop , and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people .
58009020	saying , This is the blood of that testament which God commanded in regard to you .
58009021	Moreover the tabernacle and all the vessels of service he sprinkled likewise , and indeed , according to the Law ,
58009022	almost everything is purified by blood , and without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sins .
58009023	While , then , it was necessary that the copies of the heavenly things should be cleansed by such sacrifices , the heavenly things themselves required nobler sacrifices than these .
58009024	For it was not into a Sanctuary made by hands , a mere type of the reality , that Christ entered , but he entered into heaven itself , now to appear in the very presence of God on our behalf .
58009025	Nor did he enter to offer himself repeatedly , as the high priest entered into the sanctuary , year after year , with blood that was not his own ; ( for in that case he would have needed to suffer repeatedly , ever since the foundation of the world ; ) but now , once for all , at the end of the ages , he has appeared to abolish sin , but the offering of himself .
58009027	And since it is appointed to men once to die , and after that the judgment ;
58009028	so also the Christ , after being once for all offered to bear the sins of many , will appear a second time , without sin , to those who wait for him for salvation .
58010001	For the Law , being only a shadow of the good things to come , and not their very substance , its priests cannot with the same sacrifice which year after year they offer continually , make perfect those who draw near .
58010002	Otherwise would they not have ceased to be offered ? Because the worshippers having been once cleansed , would have had no more consciousness of sin .
58010003	But on the other hand , in these sacrifices sins are called to memory , year after year .
58010004	For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sin .
58010005	It is for this reason that the Christ , on coming into the world , declared . Sacrifice and offerings thou dost not desire , But a body didst thou prepare for me ;
58010006	In whole burnt offerings and sin offerings Thou hast taken no pleasure .
58010007	Then I said , " I am come - in the roll of the book it is written of me - - To do thy will , O God . "
58010008	First when it is said , Thou hast no longing for , thou takest no delight in Sacrifices and offerings , or whole burnt offerings and sin offerings ,
58010009	( offerings regularly made under the law ) , and then it is added , Lo , I come to do thy will , he does away with the first , in order that he may establish the second .
58010010	And it is by this will that we have been sanctified by the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all .
58010011	For while every priest stands , day after day , at his ministrations , and many times repeats the same sacrifices , which can never take away sins ,
58010012	this Priest , after offering one Sacrifice for sins , sat down forever on Gods right hand ;
58010013	henceforth waiting until his enemies be put as the footstool of his feet .
58010014	For by one single offering he has perfected forever those whom he is sanctifying .
58010015	And the Holy Spirit also gives his testimony , when he said .
58010016	" This is the covenant I will make with them After those days , " says the Lord . " I will set my laws upon their hearts , And I will inscribe them on their minds . "
58010017	Then he adds , And their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more .
58010018	But when these have been remitted , there is no more any offering for sin .
58010019	Since , then , we have a cheerful confidence , brothers , to enter into the Holiest by the blood of Jesus ,
58010020	by the way which he dedicated for us , that new and living way , through the veil ( that is , his flesh ) ;
58010021	and since we have a great High Priest over the house of God ;
58010022	let us draw near with a true heart , in full assurance of faith , our hearts sprinkled from and evil conscience , and our bodies bathed in pure water .
58010023	Let us hold fast the confession of our hope , unwavering ( for He is faithful who promised ) ;
58010024	and let us consider one another , to provoke unto love and good works ;
58010025	not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together , as is the custom of some , but exhorting one another ; all the more as you behold the Day drawing near .
58010026	For if we sin wilfully , after we have received the knowledge of the truth , there no longer remains any other sacrifice for sins ,
58010027	but a certain fearful expectation of judgment , and a fiery indignation which is about to devour the adversaries .
58010028	Any one who set at naught the law of Moses was put to death without pity , on the testimony of two or three witnesses .
58010029	How much surer , think you , will be the punishment of one who has trodden under foot the Son of God , and has profaned that covenant blood with which he was sanctified , and has done despite to the spirit of grace ?
58010030	For we know Him who said , Vengeance is mine , I will repay , and again , The Lord will judge his people .
58010031	IT IS A FEARFUL THING TO FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THE LIVING GOD !
58010032	But ever call to mind the former days , in which , after having been enlightened , you endured a great conflict of sufferings ;
58010033	partly by being made a public spectacle in reproaches and afflictions , and partly by sharing the fortunes of those that were so used .
58010034	For you did sympathize with the prisoners , and you did take joyfully the confiscation of your goods ; conscious that you had for yourselves greater , even lasting possessions .
58010035	Now do not fling away your bold confidence , for it has a great recompense of reward .
58010036	For you need stedfastness , so that after having done the will of God , you may receive the promise ,
58010037	For yet a very , very little while , and then The Coming One will have come , without delay .
58010038	But it is by faith that my Righteous One will live , And if he draws back , my soul takes no pleasure in him .
58010039	" But we are not of defections unto perdition , but of faith unto the gaining of the soul . "
58011001	Now faith is the title-deed of things hoped for ; the putting to the proof of things not seen .
58011002	For by it men of old times had witness borne to them .
58011003	By faith we understand that the world was fashioned by the Word of God , so that what we see was not made out of what is visible .
58011004	By faith Abel offered to God a sacrifice more acceptable than that of Cain , through which he had witness borne to him that he was righteous , God giving the testimony by accepting his gifts ; and through it he , although he is dead , still speaks .
58011005	By faith Enoch was translated so that he should not see death ; and he was not found , because God had translated him . Before his translation he had witness borne to him that he pleased God .
58011006	now without faith it is impossible to please him ; for he who comes to God must believe that he is , and that he ever rewards those who are seeking .
58011007	By faith Noah , warned of God of things not yet seen , reverently gave heed , and built an ark for the saving of his house ; by which he condemned the world , and became an heir of the righteousness which is of faith .
58011008	By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out unto a place which he was to receive for an inheritance ; and he went out , not knowing whither he went .
58011009	It was by faith that he sojourned in the promised land as an alien , living in tents with Isaac and Jacob , his fellow heirs of the same promise .
58011010	For he continually looked for the city which has foundations , whose builder and maker is God .
58011011	By faith even Sarah herself received power to conceive seed , although she was past the age for child-bearing , because she counted Him faithful who had promised ;
58011012	and thus there sprang from one man , and him practically dead , a nation like the stars in the heavens in multitude , or grains of sand upon the seashore , innumerable .
58011013	These all died in faith , not having yet received the promises ; nay , but they saw them from afar , and hailed them , and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth .
58011014	For those who say such things make it plain that they are seeking a Fatherland .
58011015	And if they had cherished the memory of that land from which they went out , they would have found an opportunity to return ;
58011016	but now they are longing for a better homeland , that is , a heavenly . Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God ; and he has prepared a city for them .
58011017	By faith Abraham , when he was put to the test , was on the point of offering up Isaac ; yes , he who had received the promise was about to offer up his only son ,
58011018	of whom it had been said , It is through Isaac that your posterity will be traced .
58011019	For he accounted God able even to raise from the dead , from whence , figuratively speaking , he did indeed receive him back again .
58011020	By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau , even concerning things to come .
58011021	By faith Jacob , when he was dying , blessed each of Josephs sons , and worshiped , leaning on the top of his staff .
58011022	By faith Joseph , when his end was nigh , made mention of the exodus of the children of Israel , and gave instructions in regard to his bones .
58011023	By faith Moses , when he was born , was hid three months by his parents , because they saw that he was a beautiful child , and they were not afraid of the kings decree .
58011024	By faith Moses , when he was grown up , refused to be called the son of Pharaohs daughter ,
58011025	choosing rather to share ill-treatment with the people of God , than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season .
58011026	He accounted the obloquy of Christ to be greater than the treasures of Egypt ; for he fixed his eyes on the reward .
58011027	By faith he left Egypt , not because he feared the wrath of the king , but he endured as seeing Him who is invisible .
58011028	By faith he established the Passover , and the sprinkling with blood , in order that the Destroying Angel might not touch the firstborn .
58011029	By faith the people crossed over the Red Sea as on dry land ; and when the Egyptians tried to do this they were swallowed up .
58011030	By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled seven days .
58011031	By faith Rahab , the harlot , perished not with the disobedient , because she had received the spies in peace .
58011032	And what more shall I say ? for time would fail me to tell of Gideon , of Barak , of Samson , and of Jeptha ; of David and Samuel and the prophets ,
58011033	who through faith conquered kingdoms , wrought righteousness , obtained promises , stopped the mouths of lions ,
58011034	quenched the power of fire , escaped the edge of the sword , out of weakness were made strong , proved valiant in warfare , and routed armies of aliens .
58011035	Woman received their dear ones alive from the dead ; and others were broken on the wheel , not accepting the offered deliverance , in order that they might obtain a better resurrection .
58011036	Others again bore trial of mockings and scourgings , yes , even of chains and imprisonment .
58011037	They were stoned , they were sawn asunder , they were tempted , they were slain with the sword , they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins , being destitute , persecuted , tormented -
58011038	of whom the world was not worthy - wandering in deserts and mountains and caves and holes in the ground .
58011039	Yet , though these all had witness borne to them by their faith , they received not the promise ;
58011040	since it was for us that God had in store some better thing , so that apart from us they should not be perfected .
58012001	Seeing then that we are encircled with this great cloud of witnesses , let us also lay aside every weight , and the sin that clings about us . Let us run with patience the race that is set before us ,
58012002	looking unto Jesus , the pioneer and perfecter of our faith , who for the joy that was set before him endured a cross , despising shame , and has now taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of God .
58012003	Compare yourselves with him who endured such hostility against himself at the hands of sinners , lest you grow weary , fainting in your souls .
58012004	Not yet have you resisted unto blood in your fight against sin ;
58012005	and have you forgotten the exhortation which reasons with you as sons ? My son , do not despise the training of the Lord , Nor faint when he corrects you ;
58012006	For it is those whom he loves that he disciplines , And he scourges every son whom he acknowledges .
58012007	It is for discipline that you are enduring these sufferings . God is dealing with you as sons . For what son is there whom his father does not discipline ?
58012008	If you are left without discipline , in which all children share , then are you bastards and not sons .
58012009	Furthermore , our earthly fathers used to discipline us , and we gave them reverence . Shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits , and live ?
58012010	For they only disciplined us for a few days , as seemed good to them ; but he does it for our profit , that we may share his holiness .
58012011	Now no discipline seems for the present to be joyous , but grievous ; but afterward it yields the peaceable fruits of righteousness to those who have been trained under it .
58012012	Wherefore lift up your listless hands , strengthen your feeble knees ;
58012013	make straight path for your feet , so that what is lame may not be put out of joint , but rather be healed .
58012014	Run swiftly after peace with all men , and holiness , without which no man shall see the Lord .
58012015	Look carefully that there be no one who falls back from the grace of God ; that no root of bitterness springs up to trouble you , and by its means many become defiled .
58012016	Take care lest there be any fornicator or scorner like Esau among you , who for one meal sold his birthright .
58012017	For you know that even when he afterward desired to inherit the blessing , he was rejected ; he found no room for repentance , though he sought it earnestly , with tears .
58012018	For you are not come to a palpable and enkindled fire ,
58012019	nor to gloom and darkness and tempest and the blare of a trumpet and an audible voice . Those who heard that voice entreated that no word more should be spoken to them .
58012020	For they could not endure that which was enjoined , Even if a wild beast touches the mountain it shall be stoned to death ;
58012021	and so terrible was the scene that Moses said , I exceedingly fear and tremble .
58012022	On the contrary you are come to Mount Zion , the city of the living God , the heavenly Jerusalem , to innumerable hosts of angels ,
58012023	to the festal assemblage and church of the firstborn , registered in heaven , to a Judge who is God of all , to the spirits of just men made perfect ,
58012024	to Jesus the Mediator of the New Covenant , and to his sprinkled Blood whose message cries louder than that of Abel .
58012025	See that you do not refuse him who is speaking . For if they did not escape punishment when they refused to listen to their instructor on earth , much less shall we escape if we turn away from him who is teaching us from heaven ;
58012026	whose voice then shook the earth , but now he has promised , saying , Once again , once for all , I make not only earth , but heaven also to tremble .
58012027	That phrase , " Once again , " signifies the removal of the things which can be shaken , created things , in order that the things which cannot be shaken may remain .
58012028	Wherefore since we are receiving a kingdom which is unshakable , let us give thanks , and so offer acceptable worship to God , with holy awe and fear ,
58012029	FOR INDEED OUR GOD IS A CONSUMING FIRE .
58013001	Let brotherly love continue .
58013002	Do not neglect to show hospitality ; for by it some have even entertained angels unawares .
58013003	Remember those who are in prison , as if you were fellow prisoners ; remember too , those who are being ill-treated , since you too , are in the body .
58013004	Let marriage be held in honor by all , and the marriage bed be undefiled ; for fornicators and adulterers will God judge .
58013005	Let your life be untainted by love of money ; be content with such things as you have ; for God himself has said , I will never leave thee ; I will never forsake thee .
58013006	So that we can say with confidence , The Lord is my helper ; I will not be afraid . What can man do to me ?
58013007	Remember your leaders , the men who spoke the message of God to you ; consider the issue of their lives , and imitate their faith .
58013008	Jesus Christ is the same yesterday , today , and forever .
58013009	Do not allow yourselves to be swept away by various and strange teachings . For it is a beautiful thing to be established in heart by grace , and not by regulations regarding food , from which those that occupied themselves with them have derived no benefit .
58013010	We Christians have an altar from which those have no right to eat who minister in the Tabernacle .
58013011	For the bodies of the animals whose blood is carried by the High Priest into the Holy Place are burned outside the camp ,
58013012	and so Jesus suffered outside the gate in order to sanctify the people by his own blood .
58013013	Let us then go forth to him outside the camp , bearing his reproach .
58013014	For we have not here an abiding city , but we are earnestly seeking the city that is to be .
58013015	In his name , then , let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God , that is the fruit of lips that confess his name .
58013016	And forget not to be kind and liberal ; for with that sort of sacrifice God is well pleased .
58013017	Obey your leaders and submit to them ; for they are keeping watch over your souls , as those who must give account ; that they may do thus with joy and not with lamentation , for this would be unprofitable to you .
58013018	Keep on praying for me . I am persuaded that I have a clear conscience , and I desire in every way to live nobly .
58013019	I the more earnestly ask for your prayers , that I may be the more speedily restored to you .
58013020	Now the God of peace , who brought up from the dead our Lord Jesus , that great Shepherd of the sheep , by the blood of an eternal covenant ,
58013021	equip you in every good deed for the doing of his will , doing in you what is well-pleasing in his sight , through Jesus Christ . To him be the glory unto the ages of the ages ! Amen !
58013022	But I entreat you , brothers , bear with my word of exhortation , for I have written to you briefly .
58013023	You know that our brother Timothy has been set free . If he comes soon , I will see him with you .
58013024	Salute all your leaders and the saints . The brothers from Italy send you greeting .
58013025	Grace be with you all , Amen .
59001001	James , a slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ , sends greeting to the twelve tribes that are scattered abroad .
59001002	My brothers , when you are beset by various temptations , count it all joy ,
59001003	because you know that the testing of your faith is working out endurance .
59001004	But let endurance have its perfect work , so that you may be perfect and entire , not lacking in anything .
59001005	If any one of you is lacking in wisdom , let him ask it from the God who gives to all men freely and without upbraiding ; and it will be given to him .
59001006	But let him ask in faith , without wavering ; for he who wavers is like a surge of the sea , wind-driven and tossed .
59001007	Such a man need not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord ,
59001008	double-minded as he is , unstable at every turn .
59001009	Let a brother in humble circumstances glory in his exaltation ;
59001010	but a rich brother , in his humiliation ; because like the flower of the grass the rich man will pass away .
59001011	For as the sun comes up with a burning heat , it withers the grass , and its flowers fall , and the grace of the fashion of it perishes ; so also shall the rich man fade away amid his pursuits .
59001012	Blessed is the man who endures temptation ; for when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love him .
59001013	When he is being tempted , let no one say , " It is God who tempts me , " for God cannot be tempted with evil , nor does he tempt any man .
59001014	But each man is tempted by his own lusts that allure and entice him .
59001015	Then lust conceives and gives birth to sin ; and sin , when it is mature , brings forth death .
59001016	Do not be deceived , my brothers !
59001017	Every good gift and every perfect boon is from above , and is ever coming down to us from the Father of the heavenly lights , with whom is no variation nor shadow of eclipse .
59001018	Because he willed , he gave us birth through the word of truth , so that we should be a kind of first-fruits among his creatures .
59001019	Mark this well , my dear brothers . Let every man be swift in hearing , slow in speaking , slow in growing angry ;
59001020	for a mans anger does not further the righteous purpose of God .
59001021	So strip off all filthiness and superfluity of wickedness , and in meekness receive the implanted Word , which is able to save your souls .
59001022	And become doers of the Word , and not merely hearers , deceiving yourselves .
59001023	Because if any one is a hearer of the Word and not a doer , he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror ;
59001024	for after he has looked carefully at himself , he goes away , and at once forgets what he is like .
59001025	But the man who looks closely into the perfect law - the law of liberty - and continues looking , this man will be blessed in his deed because he is not a hearer who forgets , but a doer who does .
59001026	If a man thinks himself to be religious , and yet does not bridle his tongue , but deceives his own religion ,
59001027	and undefiled before our God and Father , to look after orphans and widows in their affliction , and ever to keep himself unspotted from the world .
59002001	My brothers , do not hold the faith of the Lord Jesus , the Lord of Glory , in a spirit of caste .
59002002	Suppose a man comes into your synagogue with a gold ring and dazzling clothes , and suppose a poor man comes in , also , in shabby clothes ,
59002003	and you look up to him who wears the fine clothing , and say to him , " Sit here in this fine place ! " and to the poor man you say , " Stand there ! " or " Sit on the floor at my feet ! "
59002004	are you not drawing distinctions among yourselves , and have you not become judges with evil thoughts ?
59002005	Listen , my dear brothers , has not God chosen the poor of this world to be rich in faith , and to inherit the kingdom which he has promised to those who love him ?
59002006	But you have dishonored the poor man . Do not the rich oppress you and drag you to court ?
59002007	Are they not blaspheming that glorious Name by which you are called ?
59002008	If you are keeping the royal law , which says , Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thou dost thyself , you are doing well .
59002009	If you have the spirit of caste you are committing sin , and are convicted by the Law as transgressors .
59002010	For if a man keeps the whole of the Law , and yet stumbles in one point , he is guilty of all .
59002011	For he who said , Do not commit adultery , said also , Do not Kill . Now if you do not commit adultery , but if you do kill , you have transgressed the Law .
59002012	So speak and act like men who are to be judged by the law of liberty .
59002013	For judgment is without mercy to the man who has showed no mercy . but mercy glories in the face of judgment .
59002014	My brothers , what good is it if any one says that he has faith , if he has no deeds ? Can such faith save him ?
59002015	If a brother or sister be naked and in need of daily food ,
59002016	and one of you says to them , " Depart in peace , find warmth and food for yourselves , " but at the same time you do not give the necessaries of the body , what good would that do them ?
59002017	In just the same way faith , if it have not deeds , is by itself a lifeless thing .
59002018	Some one indeed may say , " You have faith , and I have deeds . " " Then show me your faith , " I answer , " apart from any deeds , and I will show you my faith by my deeds . "
59002019	You believe that God is one ? You do well ; even the demons believe , and they shudder .
59002020	But do you want to be convinced , O foolish man , that faith apart from deeds is barren ?
59002021	Was not Abraham our ancestor justified by deeds , in that he offered up Isaac , his son , upon the altar ?
59002022	You see how faith was cooperating with deeds , and faith was made perfect by deeds .
59002023	And the Scripture was fulfilled which said , And Abraham believed God , and this was imputed to him as righteousness , and he was called Gods friend .
59002024	You see , then , that it is by his deeds a man is justified , and not simply by his faith .
59002025	In like manner was not Rahab , the harlot , justified by her deeds , in the fact that she received the messengers and sent them forth by another way ?
59002026	So just as the body without a spirit is dead , so faith is dead without deeds .
59003001	Do not become many teachers , my brothers , because you know well that we teachers shall be judged by a severer standard than others .
59003002	For in many respects we often stumble . If any man never stumbles in speech , the same is a perfect man , able to bridle the whole body as well .
59003003	When we put bits in the mouths of horses to make them obey us , we control their whole body also .
59003004	Look at the ships too , though they are so large , even when driven by fierce winds they are turned by a very small rudder , wherever the impulse of the helmsman wills .
59003005	So also the tongue is a small member and makes great boasts . Behold , how great a forest is set on fire by a little spark !
59003006	And the tongue is a fire ; it is a very world of iniquity among our members , defiling the whole body , and setting on fire the wheel of nature , and is itself set on fire by hell .
59003007	For while every kind of beast and bird , and of reptiles and sea-creatures are tamable , and actually have been tamed by mankind ,
59003008	no man can tame the tongue , restless evil that it is , full of deadly poison .
59003009	With it we continually bless our Lord and Father , and with it we are accustomed to curse men made in the image of God .
59003010	From out of the same mouth pour forth blessings and cursings ! My brothers , this ought not to be so .
59003011	Does a spring pour forth from the same opening sweet water and bitter ?
59003012	Can a fig tree , my brothers , bear olives ; or a grape-vine , figs ? No more can salt water yield fresh water .
59003013	Who among you is wise and intelligent ? Let him show his deeds by his good life , in the meekness of wisdom .
59003014	But if you have bitter jealousy and faction in your heart , do not be boasting of that , and be false to the truth .
59003015	Such wisdom is not that which is descending from on high , but is earthly , sensual , demonlike .
59003016	For wherever jealousy and faction exist , there is confusion and every evil deed .
59003017	But the wisdom which comes from on high is first pure , then peaceable , gentle , conciliatory , overflowing with mercy and good fruits , without partiality and without insincerity .
59003018	And the fruit of righteousness is being sown in peace by those who are working peace .
59004001	Where do the conflicts and quarrels that go on among you come from ? Do they not come from your passions which are always making war among your bodily members ?
59004002	You continually crave and do not obtain ; you are killing and coveting and cannot acquire ; you are fighting and at war . You do not have , because you do not ask .
59004003	You continue to ask and do not receive , because you are asking with a wrong purpose , in order to spend it upon your pleasures .
59004004	You adulteresses , do you not know that the friendship of the world is enmity to God ? Whoever , then , desires to be a friend of the world , makes himself and enemy of God .
59004005	Or do you suppose that it is in vain that the Scripture says , " The spirit which has its home in us yearns over us unto jealousy ? "
59004006	But he gives more and more grace . therefore it is said , God ever resists the proud ; but to the humble he gives grace continually .
59004007	So then ever be subject to God , Ever resist the devil and he will flee from you .
59004008	Draw near to God And he will draw near to you . Cleanse your hands , you sinners , And purify your hearts , you double-minded .
59004009	Lament and mourn , and weep aloud ! Let your laughter be turned into mourning , And your joy into gloom !
59004010	Humble yourselves before the Lord , And he will raise you up .
59004011	Do not be talking against each other , brothers . He who is talking against a brother and condemning his brothers is talking against the Law and condemning the Law . But if you are condemning the Law , you are not a doer of the Law , but a judge .
59004012	But One is your Lawgiver and Judge - he who is able to save and to destroy . But you , who are you , to be condemning your neighbor ?
59004013	Go to now , you who say , " Today or tomorrow we shall journey to such a city and spend a year there , and trade and make money , "
59004014	when all the time you do not know what will happen on the morrow . For what is your life ? You are but a mist , appearing for a brief time , and then vanishing .
59004015	You ought instead to say , " If the Lord wills it , we shall live and do this or that . "
59004016	But now you are glorying in these insolent boastings of yours ; all such glorying is evil .
59004017	So to him who knows how to do right and does not do it , to him it is sin .
59005001	Go to now , you rich men ! Weep aloud , howl for the miseries which are about to come upon you !
59005002	For your riches lie rotting , and your clothing has become moth-eaten .
59005003	Your gold and silver are rusted . and their rust will be for a testimony against you , and it will eat your flesh . For you have been storing up fire in these last days !
59005004	Look ! the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields , which you have been keeping back by fraud , are crying aloud ! And the cries of the reapers have entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth !
59005005	You have lived luxuriously on earth , you have taken your pleasure , you have fattened your hearts for a day of slaughter .
59005006	You have condemned , you have murdered the righteous man unresisting !
59005007	Be patient , then , brothers , till the coming of the Lord . Behold the farmer who waits for the precious fruit of the earth , being patient over it , until it gets the early and the latter rains .
59005008	So you also must be patient . Stablish your hearts ; for the coming of the Lord is at hand !
59005009	Do not make complaints against each other , brothers , lest you yourselves be condemned . Behold the Judge is standing before the very door !
59005010	Take , my brothers , for an example the suffering and the patience of the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord .
59005011	Remember we count those that were stedfast happy . You have heard of the stedfastness of Job , and have seen the end of the Lord with him , seen how the Lord is full of tenderness .
59005012	Again , above all things , my brothers , swear not at all , neither by the heavens , nor by the earth , nor by any other oath . Let your " yes " be " yes , " and your " no , " " no , " so you will not fall under condemnation .
59005013	Is any one of you in trouble ? Let him pray .
59005014	Is any in good spirits ? Let him sing unto his harp . Is any one of you ill ? Let him send for the elders of the church , and let them pray over him , after anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord ;
59005015	and the prayer of faith will restore the sick , and the Lord will raise him up . And if he has committed sins , it will be forgiven him .
59005016	So confess your sins one to another , and pray for one another , that you may be healed . For the fervent prayer of a righteous man is mighty in its working .
59005017	Elijah was a man of like passions with us , and he prayed again , and the sky gave rain , and the earth brought forth her fruit .
59005018	Then he prayed again , and the sky gave rain , and the earth brought forth her fruit .
59005019	My brothers , if any one of you strays from the truth , and some one brings him back ,
59005020	let him know that he who brings a sinner back from the error of his ways , saves his soul from death , and hides a multitude of sins .
60001001	Peter , an apostle of Jesus Christ , to the elect who are sojourners of the dispersion in Pontus , Galatia , Cappadocia , Roman Asia , and Bithynia ,
60001002	according to the foreknowledge of God the Father , in the sanctification of the spirit , unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ ; Grace and peace be multiplied to you .
60001003	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , by whose great mercy we have been born anew into a living hope , through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead ;
60001004	and into an inheritance imperishable and undefiled and fadeless , which has been kept in heaven for you
60001005	who , through faith , are continuously guarded by the power of God for a salvation , ready to be revealed in the last days .
60001006	Exult in this , though now for a brief moment , if need be , you have suffered many hardships .
60001007	These are in order that the test of your faith , more precious than gold that is perishable and yet is tested by fire , may redound to praise and glory and honor , at the revelation of Jesus Christ .
60001008	Him you love , though you have never seen him ; in him you ever believe , though even now you see him not , and you are rejoicing with joy unspeakable and full of glory ,
60001009	as you continually receive the reward of your faith , even the salvation of your souls .
60001010	Concerning this salvation the Prophets who prophesied regarding the grace intended for you , diligently sought and searched .
60001011	They were searching to know to what time , or to what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them kept pointing , when he ever testified beforehand concerning the sufferings of Christ and the glories that would follow .
60001012	It was revealed to them that it was not for themselves , but for you , that they were ministering the truths which have now been announced to you , by those who preached the gospel to you , through the help of the Holy Spirit sent forth from heaven - truths into which angels long to look .
60001013	So then brace up your minds , be steady in spirit , and fix your hope firmly in the grace that is coming to you , at the revelation of Jesus Christ .
60001014	Like obedient children , do not fashion yourselves according to the former passions of your days of ignorance ,
60001015	but become yourselves holy in your whole manner of living , as He who has called you is holy ,
60001016	as the Scripture says , You shall be holy , because I am holy .
60001017	And since you call upon him as Father , who impartially judges each one according to his deeds , pass the time of your sojourning here in reverence .
60001018	For you well know that not with perishable things , with silver or gold , were you redeemed from the emptiness of your manner of life , received by tradition from your ancestors ;
60001019	but with precious blood , like that of a lamb without spot or blemish , even the blood of Christ .
60001020	He was indeed foreknown before the foundation of the world , but was manifested at the end of the times for your sake .
60001021	Through him you believe in God who raised him from the dead and gave him glory ; so that your faith and hope are now in God .
60001022	Now that by obedience to the truth you have purified your lives for a brotherly love without hypocrisy , you must love one another from your hearts , fervently .
60001023	For you have been born anew , not of perishable , but of imperishable seed , by the living , lasting word of God .
60001024	For , All flesh is grass And all its glory like the flower of the grass . The grass fades , The flower falls ,
60001025	But the word of the Lord abides forever . And this is the word of the gospel which has been told to you .
60002001	Therefore put away all malice , all deceit , insincerity , jealousy , and slander of every sort .
60002002	Like new-born babes long for the pure spiritual milk to make you grow up into salvation ;
60002003	since you have tasted that the Lord is gracious .
60002004	Come to him then , that living Stone , rejected indeed by men , but chosen by God , and precious .
60002005	And yourselves like living stones be built into a spiritual house , to be a holy priesthood offering spiritual sacrifices , acceptable to God , through Christ Jesus .
60002006	For , as Scripture says . Behold , I lay in Zion a chief corner-stone , elect , precious , And he who believes on Him shall never be put to shame .
60002007	For you , then , that believe , is the preciousness ; but for those who do not believe , A stone which the builders rejected , The same has become the head stone of the corner ,
60002008	and , A stone of stumbling , and a rock of offense . They stumble over it because they are disobeying Gods word , and to this they were also appointed .
60002009	But you are an elect race , a royal priesthood , a holy nation , a purchased people , that you may show forth the virtues of Him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light -
60002010	you who once were not a people , but now are the people of God ; who were once without mercy , but now you have found mercy .
60002011	I beseech you , beloved , as pilgrims and exiles , to abstain from passions of the flesh that war upon your souls .
60002012	Let your manner of life before the Gentiles be honest ; so that , although they are now slandering you as evil-doers , they may , by beholding your noble conduct , come to glorify God , in the day of visitation .
60002013	Submit yourselves , for the Lords sake , to every human authority ; whether it be to the Emperor as supreme ruler ,
60002014	or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evil-doers and for the encouragement of well-doers .
60002015	For it is the will of God that by well-doing you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish men .
60002016	Live like free men ; and yet do not make your freedom a cloak for misconduct , but be the slaves of God .
60002017	Honor all men . Love the brotherhood . Reverence God . Honor the Emperor .
60002018	Household slaves , submit yourselves to your masters in all reverence ; not only to the kind and gentle , but also to the unreasonable .
60002019	For it is an acceptable thing to God , if from a sense of duty to him , a man endures a wrong , even suffering unjustly .
60002020	For what credit is it if , when you are struck for a fault , you take it patiently ? But if when you are doing well and suffer for it , you always take it patiently , this is acceptable with God .
60002021	For this is your calling ; because Christ also suffered for you , leaving you an example , so that you should follow in his footsteps ;
60002022	He committed no sin , Neither was guile found in his mouth .
60002023	He was reviled , and reviled not back . When he suffered he never threatened but always committed his cause to the One who judges rightly .
60002024	He bore our sins in his own body upon the tree , in order that we might become dead to sins , and be alive unto righteousness . By his wounds you have been healed .
60002025	For you were straying like lost sheep , but you are now returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls .
60003001	In the same way you wives must be submissive to your own husbands ; so that if some of them will not believe the message , they may apart from the message be won over by the behavior of their wives ,
60003002	when they see how pure and reverent you are .
60003003	Your adornment ought not to be the outward adornment of plaited hair and golden jewels and the wearing of beautiful dresses ;
60003004	but rather that hidden personality of the heart , the imperishable ornament of a quiet and gentle spirit , which in the sight of God is indeed precious .
60003005	For in this way in the olden time the holy women also , who put their trust in God , used to adorn themselves . They were ever in submission to their own husbands ;
60003006	thus , for example , Sarah obeyed Abraham , calling him lord . And you are daughters of Sarah , if you do what is right , and permit nothing to make you afraid .
60003007	In the same way you husbands live with your wives , according to knowledge , honoring your wife as of the weaker sex , yet as an heir with yourself of the grace of life ; so that your prayers may not be hindered .
60003008	Finally , you should all be harmonious , sympathetic , loving as brothers , tender-hearted , humble-minded ;
60003009	not paying back evil for evil or abuse for abuse , but on the contrary giving a blessing . Because for this you have been called - to inherit a blessing .
60003010	He who would love life and enjoy happy days , Let him keep his tongue from evil , And his lips from speaking guile ;
60003011	Let him turn from evil and do good , Let him seek peace , and pursue it .
60003012	For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous , And his ears are open to their cry ; But the face of the Lord is set against evil-doers .
60003013	Yet who will harm you if you become zealous for the good ?
60003014	But even if you should suffer in behalf of righteousness , you are happy . Do not be afraid of their terror , neither be troubled .
60003015	But consecrate Christ in your hearts , as Lord . Be always in readiness to make and answer to any one who asks you a reason for the hope that is within you , yet with gentleness and reverence .
60003016	See that you have a clear conscience , so that , although they speak of you as evil-doers , these libelers of your good Christian lives may be ashamed .
60003017	For it is better that you suffer for doing right , if such be Gods will , than for doing wrong ;
60003018	because Christ also once for all suffered for sins , the just for the unjust , that he might bring us to God . He was put to death in the flesh , but make alive in spirit .
60003019	( It was in spirit that he went and preached the Word to the spirits who were in prison ,
60003020	who in old times had been disobedient , when Gods longsuffering was waiting in the days of Noah , while an ark was building , in which a few persons - eight in number - were saved by water . )
60003021	Baptism , the counterpart of that , now saves you ( not the washing off of the filth of the flesh , but the prayer for a good conscience toward God ) , through the resurrection of Jesus Christ .
60003022	He is gone into heaven , and is on the right hand of God ; to Him angels and authorities and powers have been made subject .
60004001	Since , then , Christ suffered in the flesh , do you also ever arm yourselves with the same mind ( because he who has suffered in the flesh has done with sin ) ,
60004002	so that in future you may not spend your life in the flesh according to mens desires , but in the will of God .
60004003	For the time past of life may suffice us to have worked the will of the Gentiles , when we spent our life in lasciviousness , lusts , hard drinking , revelry , banqueting , and abominable idol worship .
60004004	They are astonished at this , that you do not run into the same excesses of profligacy as they do ; and they speak evil of you .
60004005	But they must render account to Him who stands ready to judge the living and the dead .
60004006	The gospel was preached for this cause to those who were dead also , that they might be judged according to men in flesh , but live according to God in spirit .
60004007	But the end of all things is close at hand ; so be sober , watch and pray .
60004008	Above everything have fervent love to one another ; for love veils a multitude of sins .
60004009	Be hospitable to one another , without grudging .
60004010	Whatever the gifts which each has received , use them for one another , as good stewards of the manifold grace of God .
60004011	If any one preaches , let him always preach as one who utters Gods truth ; if any one serves another , let it be with the strength which God supplies ; so that in every way God may be glorified through Jesus Christ , to whom be glory and dominion for ever and ever , Amen .
60004012	Do not think it strange , beloved , that a fiery ordeal has come to test you , as though some surprising thing had befallen you .
60004013	But be glad in the degree in which you share in the sufferings of Christ ; so that when his glory shall be revealed , you too may be glad with triumphant gladness .
60004014	If you are being reproached for the name of Christ , you are blessed , for the spirit of glory and of God is resting upon you .
60004015	But let none of you suffer as a murderer , or as a thief , or as an evil-doer , or as a spy upon other peoples business .
60004016	But if any man is suffering as a Christian , let him not be ashamed ; but let him ever glorify God in this Name .
60004017	It is time for judgment to begin with the household of God ; and if it first begin with us , what shall be the end of those who are disobedient to the gospel ?
60004018	If the righteous man is scarcely saved , where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear ?
60004019	So let those who are suffering according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well-doing , as unto a faithful Creator .
60005001	Now to you who are presbyters I make this appeal ; for I am myself a presbyter , and was a witness of the sufferings of Christ , and also a partaker of the glory about to be revealed .
60005002	Be shepherds to your flock of God ; take charge of them willingly , and not through compulsion ; not for filthy lucre , but with a willing mind ;
60005003	not by way of lording it over your heritage , but by becoming examples to the flock .
60005004	Then , when the Chief Shepherd shall appear , you too will receive the fadeless wreath of glory .
60005005	You younger men must submit to the presbyters ; and all of you must put on the garment of humility and serve one another , for God resists the haughty , But gives grace to the humble .
60005006	So humble yourselves under Gods mighty hand , so that he may exalt you in due time .
60005007	Cast all your care upon him , for he ever cares for you .
60005008	Be temperate , be vigilant ; because your enemy , the devil , is prowling about like a roaring lion , seeking whom he may devour .
60005009	Resist him , standing firm in the faith , knowing well that the same afflictions are being accomplished in your brothers that are in the world .
60005010	But the God of all grace , who has called us by Christ Jesus to share his eternal glory , will , after you have suffered a while , make you perfect , stablish , strengthen , settle you .
60005011	His is the dominion forever and ever ; Amen .
60005012	By Sylvanus , a faithful brother of yours , as I suppose , I have written you briefly , to comfort you , and to testify that this is the true grace of God . In this stand fast .
60005013	Your sister church in Babylon , elect with you , sends you salutations , and so does Marcus , my son .
60005014	Salute one another with a kiss of love . Peace be to you all who are in Christ Jesus .
61001001	Simon Peter , a slave and apostle of Jesus Christ , to those who have obtained an equally precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ .
61001002	Grace and peace be multiplied to you by the God and Father of Jesus our Lord .
61001003	For his power divine has granted to us everything needful for life and godliness , through the knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and virtue .
61001004	By these he has granted his promises to us , precious and splendid ; so that through them you may become partners of the divine nature , now that you have escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust .
61001005	For this very reason do your best to add to your faith manliness , and to manliness knowledge ,
61001006	and to knowledge self-control , and to self-control stedfastness , and to stedfastness piety ,
61001007	and to piety brotherly love , and to brotherly love , love itself .
61001008	For if these virtues are yours in abounding measure , they render you not idle nor unfruitful , until you come into the full knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ .
61001009	For the man who lacks these virtues is blind , short-sighted , forgetful of his cleansing from his old sins .
61001010	So , brothers , take diligent care to make your calling and election sure ; for if you do this , you will never stumble .
61001011	For so the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ will be richly supplied to you .
61001012	I shall therefore be always ready to remind you of all this , even though you know it , and are firmly founded in the truth which is with you .
61001013	So I think it right , as long as I am in this " tent , " to rouse you by way of reminding you ,
61001014	since I know that the time for me to strike tent comes swiftly on , even as our Lord Jesus Christ pointed out to me .
61001015	So I will do my best to enable you , even after my departure , continually to call these things to mind .
61001016	For we were not following cunningly devised fables , when we told you of the power and presence of our Lord Jesus Christ , but we had been eye-witnesses of his Majesty .
61001017	For he did receive honor and glory from God the Father , when there was borne such a voice to him from the Majestic Glory , This is my Son , my Beloved , in whom I delight ;
61001018	and this voice we ourselves heard , borne to us out of heaven , when we were with him on the holy hill .
61001019	And so we possess the word of prophecy made yet more sure . Unto this you do well to give heed as to a lamp shining in a dark place , till the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts .
61001020	But first be assured of this - that no prophecy of Scripture is of private interpretation .
61001021	For no prophecy was ever brought by the will of man ; but moved by the Holy Spirit , men spoke for God .
61002001	But there were false prophets , too , among the people , just as among you also there will be false teachers . These will secretly bring in destructive sects , denying even the Master who bought them , and bringing swift ruin upon themselves .
61002002	Then there will be many who will follow their immorality , because of whom the Way of the Truth will be maligned .
61002003	In their covetousness , with cunning words , they will make merchandise of you ; those whose doom has not been idle from of old , and whose destruction has not been slumbering .
61002004	For if God did not spare angels when they sinned , but cast them down to Tartarus , and committed them to chains of darkness , and reserved them for judgment ;
61002005	if he did not spare the ancient world , but preserved Noah , a herald of righteousness , with seven others , when he brought a flood upon an ungodly world ;
61002006	if he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and reduced them to ashes , thus holding them up as a warning to all who would live ungodly ;
61002007	and he delivered righteous Lot who was worn out by the lascivious life of the wicked
61002008	( for that righteous man , living among them , tormented his righteous soul in seeing and hearing , day after day , their lawless deeds ) ,
61002009	then be sure that the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation , and to keep the wicked ( who are even now enduring punishment ) for the " Day of Judgment " ;
61002010	especially those who spend their lives following the flesh in the lust of defilement , and in despising all authority . Audacious and wilful , they feel no awe in railing against dignities ;
61002011	even where angels , though surpassing them in strength and might , do not bring a railing judgment against them before the Lord .
61002012	But these men , like irrational creatures , mere animals , born to be taken and destroyed , continually rail about matters of which they know nothing . In their corruption they will surely be destroyed ,
61002013	suffering wrong as the wage of wrong which they have done . These are men who count it pleasure to carouse in open daylight ; they are spots and blemishes reveling in their deceit , even while they are feasting with you .
61002014	They have eyes full of harlots , eyes that cannot stop sinning . They entice unsteady souls . Their heart is trained in greed . They are an accursed generation .
61002015	They have forsaken the right way ; they have lost their way , and followed the road of Balaam , the son of Beor , who loved the wages of wrong-doing .
61002016	He was , however , rebuked for his own transgression ; a dumb ass spoke with a mans voice , and stopped the madness of the prophet .
61002017	Such men are like waterless springs , or mists storm-driven ; for them the blackness of darkness has been reserved .
61002018	For speaking great swelling words of vanity , they entangle , by their lasciviousness , in the lusts of the flesh , those who are just about to escape from the men that live in misconduct .
61002019	They promise them liberty , while they themselves are slaves of rottenness ! ( For indeed a man is the slave of anything which masters him . )
61002020	For if , after having escaped the pollutions of the world , through the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ , men are again entangled in them and overpowered , their last state is become worse than their first .
61002021	Indeed it would have been better for them not to have known the Way of Righteousness , than , after knowing it , to turn back from the holy command delivered to them .
61002022	In their case it has happened according to the true proverb , The dog returns again to his own vomit , and The sow , after washing , to her wallowing in the mire .
61003001	This is now my second letter to you , beloved . In both of them I am stirring up your pure minds by putting you in remembrance .
61003002	I want you to recollect the words that were foretold by the holy prophets , and the command of your Lord and Saviour , given you through your apostles .
61003003	Know this first , that mockers will come in the last days , in their mockery , men who walk the way of their own lusts
61003004	and say , " Where is the promise of His coming ? For since the day that our fathers fell asleep everything continues as it was from the beginning of the creation . "
61003005	For they willingly ignore the fact that there were heaven , from of old , and an earth formed out of water and through water , by the word of God ;
61003006	and that by the same means the world which then existed was destroyed by a deluge of water .
61003007	But the heavens and earth that now are , by the same word of God , have been reserved for fire , and are being kept for the Day of Judgment , and for the destruction of ungodly men .
61003008	Do not forget this one thing , beloved , that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years , and a thousand years as one day .
61003009	The Lord does not loiter over his promise , as some men esteem loitering ; but he is longsuffering toward you , not purposing that any should perish , but that all should pass on to repentance .
61003010	But the Day of the Lord will come like a thief ; and on that Day the heavens will vanish with a crash , the heavenly bodies will melt with fervent heat , and the earth and all its works will be burned up .
61003011	Now since all things are in the process of dissolution , what kind of men ought you to be , in all holy living and piety ;
61003012	while you look for and hasten the coming of the Day of God . At its coming the heavens , being on fire , will be dissolved , and the heavenly bodies will melt with fervent heat .
61003013	But according to his promise , we are looking for new heavens and a new earth , in which righteousness makes her dwelling .
61003014	And so , beloved , since you are looking for these things , continually give diligence that you may be found in peace , unspotted and blameless in his sight .
61003015	Regard our Lords longsuffering as salvation ; even as our dear brother Paul also wrote to you , according to the wisdom given to him .
61003016	It is the same in all his letters when he speaks of these things . There are indeed some things in his letters hard to understand , which the ignorant and the shifty wrest , as also they do the other Scriptures , to their own destruction .
61003017	Do you therefore , beloved , because you know these things beforehand , be on your guard lest you be led astray by the error of the wicked , and so fall from your own stedfastness .
61003018	But grow continually in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ . To Him be the glory both now and unto the Day of Eternity , Amen .
62001001	It is of what has existed from the beginning , of what we have listened to , of what we have seen with our own eyes , of what we have witnessed and touched with our own heads , it is concerning the Logos of Life that we are now writing .
62001002	And the Life was made visible , and we have seen it and are bearing witness , and are bringing you word of that Eternal Life which was face to face with the Father and was made visible to us .
62001003	It is what we have seen and heard that we are announcing to you , in order that you also may have partnership with us ; and our partnership is with the Father and with his Son , Jesus Christ .
62001004	And we are writing all this to you that our joy may be complete .
62001005	This , then , is the message that we have heard from him , and are announcing to you , that God is light , and no darkness what ever is in him .
62001006	If we say , " We have partnership with Him , " when we are passing our life in the darkness , we are lying and are not doing the truth .
62001007	But is we are passing our life in the light , as he is in the light , we ever have partnership with one another , and the blood of Jesus Christ is cleansing us from every sin .
62001008	If we say , " We have no sin , " we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us .
62001009	But if we confess our sins , faithful is he and just to forgive us our sins , and to cleanse us from all wrong-doing .
62001010	If we say , " We have not sinned , " we are making him a liar , and his word is not in us .
62002001	My children , I am writing this to you that you may not continue to sin ; but if any one sin , we ever have a Comforter before the Father , Jesus Christ the Righteous .
62002002	And he is the propitiation for our sins , and not for ours only , but also for those of the whole world .
62002003	This is how we may know that we have come to know Him , by always keeping his commandments .
62002004	He who says , " I know Him , " but does no continue obeying his commandments , is a liar ,
62002005	and the truth is not in him ; bit if any man obey his word , in him truly is the love of God made perfect . By this we come to know that we are in him .
62002006	By who says he " remains in him " ought to spend his life as he spent his .
62002007	Beloved , I am not writing a new commandment to you , nay , and old commandment , which you have had from the beginning . That old commandment is the message to which you have listened .
62002008	Yet again it is a new commandment which I am writing to you , which is true in him and is you ; because the darkness is passing away , and the true light is already shining .
62002009	He who says he is in the light , and hates his brother , is in darkness even until now .
62002010	But he who loves his brother is abiding in the light , and in it there is no cause of stumbling .
62002011	But he who hates his brother is in the darkness , and is spending his life in the darkness , and does not know where he is going , because the darkness has blinded his eyes .
62002012	I am writing to you , little children , because you sins are forgiven you for his names sake .
62002013	I am writing to you , fathers , because you have come to know him who is from the beginning . I am writing to you , young men , because you have fully overcome the Evil One . I have written to you , little children , because you have learned to know the father .
62002014	I have written to you , fathers , because you have learned to know him who is from the beginning . I have written to you , young men , because you are strong , and the word of God is abiding in you , and you have fully overcome the Evil One .
62002015	Love not the world , neither the things that are in the world . If any man love the world , the love of the Father is not in him .
62002016	For all that is in the world , the lust of the flesh , and the lust of the eyes , and the proud glory of life , is not from the Father , but from the world ;
62002017	and the world and its lusts are passing away , but he who ever does the will of God abides forever .
62002018	My children , this is the last hour , and as you have heard that an antichrist was coming , and now many antichrists are already risen , whence we may know that it is the last hour .
62002019	They came forth from us , but they did not belong to us . If they had belonged to us they would certainly have remained with us , but they went out that they might be manifest that they all are not of us .
62002020	Now you have an anointing from the Holy One , and you know all things .
62002021	I am not writing to you because you do not know the truth , but because you do know it , and know that no lie is of the truth .
62002022	Who is the liar if not the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ ? This is the Antichrist , even he who disowns the Father and the Son .
62002023	Whoever denies the Son , the same has not the Father ; but he who confesses the Son has the Father also . As for you , let what you have heard from the beginning abide in you .
62002024	If what you have heard from the beginning is abiding in you , you also will ever abide in the Son and in the Father .
62002025	And this is the promise which he has promised to us even life eternal .
62002026	I have written this to you concerning those who would lead you astray .
62002027	As to you , the unction you received from him remains ever in you , and you need no teaching from any one . But since his unction teaches you concerning all things and is true , and is no lie , abide continually in him , as it has taught you to do .
62002028	And now continue to abide in him , my children , so that when he shall appear we may have cheerful confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming .
62002029	If you know that he is righteous you know also that every one who habitually practises righteousness has been born of him .
62003001	Behold what manner of love the Father has given us in allowing us to be called " Children of God ! " And that is what we are . For this reason the world does not recognize us , because it did not know him .
62003002	We are Gods children now , beloved ; what we shall be has never yet been made manifest . But we know that when he is manifested we shall be like him ; for we shall see him even as he is .
62003003	And every one who is holding this hope in him is purifying himself , even as he is pure .
62003004	Every one who commits sin commits also lawlessness . Sin is lawlessness .
62003005	And you know that he was manifested to take away sins ; and in him is no sin .
62003006	Whoever continually abides in him does not habitually sin ; whoever lives in sin has not seen him , nor come to know him .
62003007	My children , let no one deceive you ; he who is working righteousness is righteous , just as he is righteous .
62003008	He who is committing sin is of the devil , because from the beginning of the devil is sinning . It was for this cause that the Son of God was manifested , that he might destroy the works of the devil .
62003009	Whoever is a child of God cannot go on sinning , because his seed is abiding in him ; and he cannot go on sinning because he is a child of God .
62003010	In this the children of God are manifest , and the children of the devil ; for every one who does not work righteousness is not a child of God , nor is he who does not love his brother .
62003011	For this is the message that you have listened to from the beginning , " WE ARE TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER . "
62003012	We are not to be like Cain , who belonged to the Evil One , and murdered his brother . And why did he murder him ? It was because his own deeds were evil , and his brothers , righteous .
62003013	Do not wonder , brothers , if the world continues to hate you .
62003014	We know that we have migrated , out of death into life , because we love our brothers . He who has no love is abiding in death .
62003015	Every one who is hating his brother is a murderer , and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him .
62003016	By this we learn to know love , because he laid down his life for us ; so we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers .
62003017	But whoever has this worlds goods , and beholds his brother in need , and shuts up his heart against him , how can the love of God continue to abide in him ?
62003018	My children , let us not love in word nor in talk , but in deed and in truth .
62003019	By this we shall come to know that we are really of the truth ,
62003020	and shall persuade our heart in his presence whenever our heart condemns us , because God is greater than our heart and knows all things .
62003021	Beloved , if our heart condemn us not , we have confidence toward God ,
62003022	and whatever we ask we are receiving from him , because we are keeping his commandments and doing those things that are pleasing in his sight .
62003023	His commandment is this , that we should believe in the name of his Son , Jesus Christ , and love one another as he has commanded us to do .
62003024	He who keeps his commandments is abiding in Him , and Christ in him . By this we know that Christ is abiding in us , by the Spirit which he has given us .
62004001	Do not believe every spirit , beloved , but test the spirits to see whether they are of God ; for many false prophets are gone out into the world .
62004002	By this you know the Spirit of God ; every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is from God ;
62004003	and every spirit which confesses him not , is not from God . And this is that spirit of Antichrist of which you have heard that it is coming , and that now it is already in the world .
62004004	My little children , you are of God and have conquered them ; because he that is within you is greater than he that is in the world .
62004005	They are of the world , and for this reason they speak as of the world , and the world listens to them .
62004006	But you are of God . He who is beginning to know God listens to us ; he who is not of God does not listen to us . By this we may distinguish the spirit of truth from the spirit of error .
62004007	Beloved , let us love one another ; for love is of God ; and every one that loves us a child of God .
62004008	He who does not love , does not know God ; for God is love .
62004009	In this was the love of God clearly shown toward us , by his sending his only Son into the world , so that we might live through him .
62004010	In this is love , not that we loved God , but that he loved us , and sent his Son to be a propitiation for our sins .
62004011	If God so loved us , beloved , we also ought to love one another .
62004012	No man has ever gazed on God ; but if we love one another , God ever abides in us , and his love is perfected in us .
62004013	By this we come to know that we are abiding in him , and he in us , because he has given us of his Spirit ;
62004014	and we have beheld and do testify that the Father has sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world .
62004015	If any man confesses that " Jesus is the Son of God . " God is abiding in that man , and he in God .
62004016	And we do know and have believed the love which God has for us . God is love ; and he who is abiding in love is abiding in God , and God is abiding in him .
62004017	In this is love made perfect with us , so that we may have cheerful confidence in the Day of Judgment , because we are living in this world as He lives .
62004018	Fear does not exist in love ; but love , when it is perfect , drives out fear . For fear has always torment , and he who has fear is not yet perfected in love .
62004019	We love because He loved us first .
62004020	If any one says , " I love God , " and yet hates his brother , he is a liar ; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen , cannot possibly love God , whom he has not seen .
62004021	And we have this command from God . HE WHO LOVES GOD IS TO LOVE HIS BROTHER ALSO .
62005001	Every one who believes that Jesus is the Christ is a child of God ; and every one who loves the Father , loves him also who is the Fathers Child .
62005002	By this we know that we love the children of God , when we love God and obey his commandments .
62005003	For love to God means obeying his commandments ; and his commandments are not irksome .
62005004	For whoever is a child of God is overcoming the world ; and our faith is the victory that has overcome the world .
62005005	And who it the one that is overcoming the world if not the man who believes that Jesus is the Son of God ?
62005006	Jesus Christ is he who came by water and blood , not by the water only , but by the water and by the blood . The spirit is he who bears testimony , because the Spirit is the truth .
62005007	For there are three who bear testimony , the Spirit , and the water ,
62005008	and the blood ; and the three are one .
62005009	If we accept mens testimony , the testimony of God is greater ; for this is the testimony of God , that he has borne testimony concerning his Son .
62005010	He who believes on the Son of God has the testimony in himself . He who does not believe God , has made him a liar , because he has not believed in the testimony that God has borne concerning his Son .
62005011	And the testimony is this , " God has given us eternal life , and this life is in his Son . "
62005012	He who has the Son has the life ; he who has not the Son of God has not the life .
62005013	I have written these words to you so that you may know that you have eternal life , you who believe in the name of the Son of God .
62005014	Now the confidence which we have in him is this , that he listens to us whenever we ask anything that is in accordance with his will .
62005015	And if we know that he is listening to us in what ever we are asking , we know that we obtain the petitions which we have made to him .
62005016	If any one sees his brother committing a sin that is not deadly , he shall ask , and God will give him life , for any one who is not committing a deadly sin . There is a deadly sin ; concerning that I do not say that he should pray .
62005017	All unrighteousness is sin ; and there is sin that is not deadly .
62005018	We know that whoever is a child of God is not habitually committing sin ; but he who is Gods child guards himself , and the Evil One never touches him .
62005019	We know that we are of God , and the whole world is lying in the Evil One .
62005020	And we know that the Son of God is come , and has granted us and understanding , so that we may come to know him who is true . And we are in him who is true , even in his Son Jesus Christ . This is the true God , and life eternal .
62005021	My little children , guard yourselves from idols .
63001001	The Elder to the Elect Lady and her children , whom I love in truth , and not only I , but also all those who have come to know the truth .
63001002	I love you for the sake of the truth which is abiding in us and will be with us forever .
63001003	Grace , mercy , and peace will be with us from God the Father , and from Jesus Christ the Fathers Son , in truth and love .
63001004	I am greatly rejoiced to find some of your children leading their lives in truth , even as we received commandment from the Father .
63001005	And now I am entreating you , Lady , not as though I were writing some new commandment to you , but one which we have had from the beginning , let us love one another .
63001006	And this is love , that we should lead our lives according to his commandments . This is the commandment , even as you heard from the beginning , that you should pass your life in love .
63001007	I say this because many deceivers are gone forth into the world , those who deny the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh . This is the deceiver and the Antichrist .
63001008	Watch yourselves , that you do not lose what we have wrought , but that you receive a full reward .
63001009	Whoever is going ahead , and is not abiding in the teachings of Christ , does not possess God ; but he who is abiding in the teaching possesses both the Father and the Son .
63001010	If any one come to you and does not bring this teaching , do not receive him into your house , nor give him any greeting .
63001011	For the man who greets him shares in his wicked work .
63001012	I have many things to write to you , but I would not write them with paper and ink . I hope to come to you and to talk with you face to face , so that your joy may be full .
63001013	The children of your elect sister send you greeting .
64001001	The Elder to the beloved Gaius , whom I love in the truth .
64001002	I pray that you may prosper , beloved , in every way , and be in good health , even as your soul is prospering .
64001003	For I was glad when brothers came and bore testimony to your truth , as indeed you are passing your life in truth .
64001004	I have no greater joy than this , to hear that my children are passing their lives in the truth .
64001005	You are acting faithfully , beloved , in whatever you are doing for the brothers and the strangers .
64001006	They have borne testimony to your love before the church . You will do well to speed them on their way worthily of God ;
64001007	since for the sake of the Name they have started out , taking nothing from the Gentiles .
64001008	Hence we ought to support such , so that we may become fellow workers for the truth .
64001009	I have written somewhat to the church ; but Diotrephes , who love to take the lead among them , does not receive me .
64001010	Do them when I come I will recall to mind the deeds which he is doing , prating against me with wicked words . Not satisfied with that , he refuses to receive the brothers , forbids those that would receive them , and excommunicates them from the church .
64001011	Do not imitate what is evil , beloved , but that which is good . He who does good is of God ; he who does evil has never gazed on God .
64001012	All men bear testimony to Demetrius , and so does the truth itself . I also bear testimony to him ; and you know that my testimony is true .
64001013	I have a great deal to write to you , but I do not want to write you with pen and ink .
64001014	I am hoping soon to see you , and then we shall talk face to face . Peace be to you ! The friends send their salutation . Salute the friends by name .
64001015	
65001001	Jude , a slave of Jesus Christ , and a brother of James . To those who are in God , the Father beloved , kept for Jesus Christ , and called .
65001002	May mercy and peace and love be multiplied to you .
65001003	Beloved , although I was making all haste to write to you in regard to our common salvation , I am compelled to write you an appeal to defend the faith once for all committed to the saints .
65001004	For certain men have crept in stealthily - men predestined in ancient prophecies for this condemnation - impious ones ! They pervert the grace of our God into licentiousness , and deny Jesus Christ , our sole Master and Lord .
65001005	I wish to remind you of what you already know right well , that although the Lord once saved a people out of the land of Egypt , he afterward destroyed those who did not believe ;
65001006	while the angels who did not keep their first domain but left their proper abode , are held by him in blank darkness , in everlasting chains , in preparation for the judgment of the Great Day .
65001007	So also Sodom and Gomorrah and the near-by cities which in like manner glutted themselves in sensuality and unnatural vice , are exhibited as a warning of the eternal fire , in the punishment they undergo .
65001008	Yet in just the same way these dreamers also defile the flesh , while they set at naught dominion and scoff at dignities .
65001009	But Michael , the Archangel , when in contending with the devil , he was disputing about the body of Moses , did not dare to pronounce sentence for blasphemy , but said , " The Lord rebuke you . "
65001010	Yet these men blaspheme about matters of which they know nothing , while they use such things as they do understand by instinct ( like the animals who have no reason ) for their own destruction .
65001011	Alas for them ! They have walked in the path of Cain ; for the sake of gain they have rushed headlong into Balaams error , and have perished in Korahs rebellion .
65001012	These are they who are stains upon your love-feasts ; when they feast sumptuously without scruple , looking after none but themselves . They are clouds without water , driven along by the winds ; trees of autumn , fruitless , doubly dead , torn up by the roots ,
65001013	wild waves of the sea , foaming out their own shame ; wandering stars , for whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever .
65001014	It was to these , too , that Enoch , the " seventh in descent from Adam , " prophesied , saying , " Lo ! the Lord is come with myriads of his saints ,
65001015	to execute judgment upon all , and to convict all the ungodly of all the ungodly deeds which in their ungodliness they have committed ; and of all the hard things which they have spoken against Him , ungodly sinners that they are ! "
65001016	For these are murmurers , always complaining . They always go where their passions lead , and their mouth speaks great swelling words , while they pay court to men for the sake of the advantage they can get .
65001017	But as for you , dearly beloved , remember the words spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
65001018	how they used to say to you , " In the last times there will be scoffers who will be led only by their godless passions . "
65001019	These are the men , sensual and unspiritual , who cause divisions .
65001020	But you , beloved , continually building yourselves up on your most holy faith , and ever praying in the Holy Spirit ,
65001021	must keep yourselves in the love of God , while waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ , which ends in life eternal .
65001022	Pity some who are wavering , and save by dragging them out of the fire ;
65001023	others pity , but with caution , hating even the garment spotted by the flesh .
65001024	Now unto Him who has power to guard you from stumbling , and to make you stand in the presence of his glory , faultless and exultant ,
65001025	to the only God , our Saviour , through Jesus Christ our Lord , be ascribed glory , majesty , might , and authority , as it was before time began , is now , and ever shall be to all the ages . Amen .
66001001	THE UNVEILING APOCALYPSE OF JESUS CHRIST which God gave him to show to his slaves the things which must soon come to pass ; and he sent and made it known by his angel to his slave John .
66001002	He bore witness of the Word of God , and of the testimony of Jesus Christ , even of all the things that he saw .
66001003	Blessed is he who reads , and they who hear the words of the prophecy , and keep what is written in it . FOR THE CRISIS IS AT HAND .
66001004	From John to the seven churches that are in Asia the Roman Province . Grace to you , and peace from Him that is and was and is to be , and from the Seven Spirits that are before his throne ,
66001005	and from Jesus Christ , the faithful witness , the firstborn of the dead , and the Ruler of the kings of the earth . To Him who loves us and has loosed us from our sins in his own blood ;
66001006	and has made us to be a kingdom of priests unto his God and Father ; to him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever , Amen .
66001007	Behold , he is about to come among the clouds ; and every eye will see him , and all the tribes of the earth will mourn over him . So shall it be , Amen .
66001008	" I am the Alpha and the Omega , " says the Lord God , who is , and who was , and who is to come , the Almighty .
66001009	I , John , who am your brother and who share with you in the woes and kingdom and stedfastness of Jesus , found myself in the island called Patmos , for the sake of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus .
66001010	I was in the Spirit on the Lords day , and I heard a loud voice behind me , like a trumpet ,
66001011	saying , " Write in a book what you see , and send it to the seven churches ; to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and Sardis and Philadelphia and Laodicea . "
66001012	And I turned to see the Voice which was speaking to me , and as I turned I saw seven golden candlesticks ;
66001013	and in the midst of the candlesticks One like to a son of man , clothed with a robe down to the feet , and with a golden girdle round his breast .
66001014	His head and his hair were as white as wool , as white as snow ; his eyes were like a flame of fire ,
66001015	and his feet like burnished brass , as if molten in a furnace ; and his voice like the voice of many waters .
66001016	In his right hand he held seven stars ; and out of mouth went a sharp , two-edged sword , and his face was as the sun shining in his strength .
66001017	When I saw him , I fell at his feet as one dead . And he laid his right hand upon me , saying . " Fear not ; I am the first and the last , and the Living One .
66001018	I was dead , and behold , I am alive forevermore ; and hold the keys of death and of Hades .
66001019	So write the things which you saw , and the things which are , and the things that will come to pass hereafter .
66001020	The mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand , and the seven golden candlesticks , is this . The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches , and the seven candlesticks are the seven churches . "
66002001	To the angel of the Church in Ephesus , write . These are the words of Him who holds the seven stars in his right hand , and who walks among the seven golden candlesticks .
66002002	I know your works and your toil and stedfastness , and that you cannot endure evil men , and that you tested those who called themselves apostles , though they are not , and how you found them false .
66002003	You are holding fast , and have borne up for my namess sake , and have not grown weary .
66002004	But I have this against you , that you have left your first love .
66002005	Remember whence you have fallen , and turn again , and do your first works . Otherwise I am coming to you and will remove your candlestick out of its place , unless you repent .
66002006	But this you have , that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans , which I hate .
66002007	He who has an ear , let him listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches . To him that overcomes , to him will I give to eat from the tree of life which is in the garden of God .
66002008	And unto the angel of the Church in Smyrna , write . These are the words of the First and the Last , he who died and has returned to life .
66002009	I know your persecution and your poverty - but you are rich ! I know the reviling of those who say that they themselves are Jews , when they are not , but are a synagogue of Satan .
66002010	Fear not what you are about to suffer ! Behold , the devil is indeed going to put some of you in prison , that you may be tested , and you will have persecution for ten days . Be faithful even unto death , and I will give you the crown of life .
66002011	Let him who has ears , listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches . He that overcomes shall not be hurt of the second death .
66002012	And to the angel of the Church in Pergamum , write These are the words of Him who holds the sharp two-edged sword .
66002013	I know where you dwell , where the throne of Satan is ; and yet you are holding fast my name , and you have not denied my faith , even in the days of Antipas , my witness , my faithful one , who was slain among you , where Satan has his dwelling .
66002014	But I have a few things against you , because you have there some who hold to the teaching of Balaam , who taught Balak to put a stumbling-block before the sons of Israel , to eat food offered to idols , and to practise immorality .
66002015	So you have also some who hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans .
66002016	Repent ; if you do not I will very soon come to you , and will make war upon them with the sword of my mouth .
66002017	He who has ears , let him listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches . To him that overcomes I will give of the hidden manna , and I will give him a white stone , and upon the stone a new name written , which no man knows , but he that receives it .
66002018	And to the angel of the Church in Thyatira , write . These are the words of the Son of God , who has his eyes like a flame of fire , and his feet like burnished brass .
66002019	I know your works and your love and faith and service and endurance ; I know that your last works are more than the first .
66002020	But I have this against you , that you are tolerating that woman Jezebel , who calls herself a prophetess , and she is teaching and leading my slaves astray , leading them to practise immorality , and to eat food which has been sacrificed to idols .
66002021	I have given her time for repentance ; but she is determined not to turn from her immorality .
66002022	Behold , I will lay her on a sick bed , and bring great distress upon those who have committed adultery with her , unless they turn away from her works .
66002023	And moreover , her children will I kill with pestilence . And all the churches shall know that I am he who searches the hearts and souls of men . I will give to each of you according to his works .
66002024	But to the rest of you in Thyatira , those who do not hold his teaching , and who do not know the " deep things " of Satan ( as they call them ) ,
66002025	I say that I am imposing upon you no fresh burden ; only hold fast what you have till I come .
66002026	To him that overcomes and perseveres in my works to the end , will I give authority over the nations .
66002027	And he shall shepherd them with a rod of iron , shattering them like earthen vessels ( as I myself have received from my Father ) ,
66002028	and I will give him the Morning Star . "
66002029	Let him who has an ear , listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches .
66003001	To the angel of the Church at Sardis , write . These things says He who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars . I know your works , that you have the name of being alive , but are really dead .
66003002	Be continually on the watch , and establish the things that remain , which were ready to die . For I have not found your works perfected before my God .
66003003	Call to mind , then , what you have received and heard , and hold to it , and repent . Unless you are on the watch , I will come as a thief , and you will never know at what hour I am coming upon you .
66003004	Yet you have a few names in Sardis that have not defiled their garment ; and they shall walk with me in white , for they are worthy .
66003005	He who overcomes shall thus be clad in white raiment ; and I will in no wise blot out his name from the book of life , and I will own his name before my Father , and before his angels .
66003006	Let him who has an ear , listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches .
66003007	Write also to the angel of the Church in Philadelphia . These things says He who is holy , he who is true , he who has the key of David , he who opens , and no one shall shut ; and who shuts , and no one opens .
66003008	I know your works . Lo , I have set before you an open door , which none can shut ; for though you have only a little strength , you have kept my word , and have not denied my name .
66003009	Behold , I am making those of the synagogue of Satan , those who say they are Jews , but are not , but are lying ; behold , I will make them to come and bow in reverence before your feet , and to know that I have loved you .
66003010	Because you have kept the word of my patience , I also will keep you from that hour of trial which is about to come upon the whole inhabited earth , to test those who dwell on the earth .
66003011	I am coming quickly . Hold fast what you have , that no one may take your crown .
66003012	He that overcomes , I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God ; and he shall go out from it nevermore . And I will write upon him the name of my God , and the name of the city of my God , the new Jerusalem , which is coming down from my God out of heaven , and my own new name .
66003013	He that has an ear , let him listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches .
66003014	To the angel of the Church in Laodicea , write . These things says the Amen , the witness , faithful and true , the beginning of the creation of God .
66003015	I know your works , that you are neither hot nor cold .
66003016	Would that you were either cold or hot . So because you are lukewarm , and neither hot nor cold , I am about to spew you out of my mouth .
66003017	For you keep saying , " I am rich , and have become wealthy , and have need of nothing , " and do not know that you are the wretched one , and pitiable and beggared and blind and naked .
66003018	I advise you to buy of me gold refined by fire , that you may become rich ; and white raiment to clothe yourself , so that the shame of your nakedness may not be made manifest ; and eye-salve to anoint your eyes , in order that you may see .
66003019	All whom I love I reprove and discipline ; therefore be full of zeal and repent .
66003020	Behold , I am standing at the door and knocking ! If any one listens to my voice , and opens the door , I will come to him , and sup with him , and he with me .
66003021	To him who overcomes , I will grant to sit down with me on my throne , as I myself have overcome and have taken my seat with my Father on his throne .
66003022	Let any one who has an ear listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches .
66004001	After this , in my vision , I saw a door opened in heaven ! And the first voice that I heard speaking with me was like a trumpet , saying , " Come up hither , and I will show you the things that must come to pass hereafter . "
66004002	Immediately I was in the Spirit ; and behold , there stood a throne in heaven , and upon the throne One sat ;
66004003	and he who sat was in appearance like a jasper stone and a sardius ; and there was a rainbow round about the throne , like an emerald to look upon .
66004004	And round about the throne were four and twenty Elders seated , who were clothed in white raiment , with golden crowns upon their heads .
66004005	From the throne issued lightning and voices and thunders . Seven blazing lamps were burning before the throne ; these are the seven Spirits of God .
66004006	And in front of the throne as it seemed , a glassy sea like crystal ; and in the midst of the throne and encircling it are four Living Creatures , full of eyes before and behind .
66004007	The first creature was like a lion , and the second like a calf , and the third creature had a face like a mans , and the fourth creature was like an eagle flying .
66004008	And the four Living Creatures , each one with six wings , are full of eyes round about and within ; day and night they are chanting ceaselessly . " Holy , holy , holy is the Lord God , the Almighty . Who was , and who is , and who is to come . "
66004009	And whenever the Living Creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits on the throne , to Him who lives forever and ever ,
66004010	the four and twenty Elders fall down before Him who sits on the throne , and worship Him who lives forever and ever , and cast their crowns before the throne , saying .
66004011	" Worthy art thou , our Lord and our God , To receive the glory and the honor and the power ; For thou didst create all things , And because of thy will they came into being And were created . "
66005001	Then I saw lying upon the right hand of Him who sat upon the throne , a book written within and on the back , close sealed with seven seals .
66005002	And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice , " Who is worthy to open the book , and to loose its seals . "
66005003	And no one in the heavens or on the earth , or under the earth , was able to open the book , or to look into it .
66005004	so I began to weep bitterly because no one was found worthy to open the book , or to look into it .
66005005	But one of the Elders said to me . " Do not weep ! Behold , the Lion of the tribe of Judah , the Root of David , has conquered , and so can open the book with its seven seals . "
66005006	Then I beheld a Lamb standing as if slain in the midst of the throne and of the four Living Creatures , and in the midst of the Elders . He had seven horns and seven eyes ( which are the seven Spirits of God , sent forth into all the earth ) .
66005007	And he went , and now he has taken the book out of the right hand of Him who was seated on the throne .
66005008	When he took the book , the four Living Creatures and the four and twenty Elders fell down before the Lamb . And each had a harp and a golden bowls full of incense , which are the prayers of the saints .
66005009	And they sang a new song , saying , " Worthy art thou to take the book And to open its seals ; For thou wast slain and didst ransom for God Men out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation ;
66005010	Thou hast made them kings and priests unto our God , And they shall reign on earth . "
66005011	Then I looked and heard a voice of many angels encircling the throne and a voice of the Living Creatures and of the Elders ; and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand , and thousands of thousands ,
66005012	singing aloud , " Worthy is the Lamb who has been slain , To receive power and riches and wisdom And might and honor and glory and blessing . "
66005013	And I heard every created thing that is in heaven , or on earth , or beneath the earth , or on the sea , and all things that are in them , saying , " To him who sits on the throne , And to the Lamb , Be the blessing and the honor , And the glory and the power , Forever and ever ! "
66005014	And the four Living Creatures kept saying , " Amen ! " And the Elders fell down and worshiped .
66006001	And I saw , when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals , and I heard one of the four Living Creatures say , with a voice like thunder , " Come ! "
66006002	And I saw , and lo , a white horse , and he who sat on him had a bow ; and there was given him a crown ; and he went forth conquering , and to conquer .
66006003	And when he opened the second seal , I heard the second Living Creature say , " Come ! "
66006004	And another horse come forth , a red horse . To him who sat on it , it was allowed to take peace from the earth , and to cause men to kill one another ; and a great sword was given to him .
66006005	And when he opened the third seal , I heard the third Living Creature say , " Come ! " And I saw , and lo , a black horse ! He who sat on him had a balance in his hand .
66006006	And I heard the semblance of a voice in the midst of the four Living Creatures , saying . " A quart of wheat for a shilling , and three quarts of barley for a shilling ; but do not harm the oil and the wine . "
66006007	And when he opened the fourth seal , I heard the voice of the fourth Living Creature calling , " Come ! "
66006008	So I liked , and lo , a pale horse ; and he who sat on him was named Death ; and Hades was following after him . To them was given authority over the fourth part of the earth , to kill with the sword , and with famine , and with death , and with the wild beasts of the earth .
66006009	And when he opened the fifth seal , I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God , and for the testimony which they bore .
66006010	And with a loud voice they cried , saying , " O Master , holy and true , How long dost thou not judge And avenge our blood On those who dwell on the earth ? "
66006011	And there was given to each one of them a white robe ; and they were told that they should rest for yet a little time , until the number should be completed by their fellow slaves and their brethren who were about to be put to death as they had been .
66006012	And I looked when he opened the sixth seal , and there was a great earthquake ; and the sun became black , like sackcloth , and the full moon became like blood ;
66006013	and the stars of the sky fell to earth , as a fig tree shaken by a gale drops its unripe figs .
66006014	And the sky parted asunder like a rolled-up scroll ; and every mountain and island was moved out of its place ;
66006015	and the kings of the earth , and the princes , and the generals , the rich and the mighty , both slaves and freemen , every one of them hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains .
66006016	And they began to say to the mountains and to the rocks . " Fall upon us and hide us From the face of him who is seated upon the throne , And from the wrath of the Lamb ;
66006017	For the Great Day of their wrath has come , And who is able to stand ? "
66007001	After this I saw four angels , standing at the four corners of the earth , restraining the four winds from blowing on the earth , or on the sea , or on any tree .
66007002	And I saw another angel ascend from the sunrising , having a seal of the living God ; and he cried with a great voice to the four angels to whom it was given to injure the earth and the sea ,
66007003	saying , " Do no harm to the earth , or the sea , or the trees , Until we have sealed the slaves of our God on their foreheads . "
66007004	And I heard the number of those who were sealed , a hundred and forty and four thousand , sealed out of every tribe of the children of Israel .
66007005	Of the tribe of Judah , twelve thousand were sealed ; Of the tribe of Reuben , twelve thousand ; Of the tribe of Gad , twelve thousand ;
66007006	Of the tribe of Asher , twelve thousand ; Of the tribe of Naphtali , twelve thousand ; Of the tribe of Manasseh , twelve thousand ;
66007007	Of the tribe of Symeon , twelve thousand ; Of the tribe of Levi , twelve thousand ; Of the tribe of Issachar , twelve thousand ;
66007008	Of the tribe of Zebulun , twelve thousand ; Of the tribe of Joseph , twelve thousand ; Of the tribe of Benjamin , twelve thousand ;
66007009	After this I looked , and behold a great multitude , whom no man could number , out of every nation and tribe and people and tongue , standing before the throne and before the Lamb , clothed in white robes , with palm branches in their hands ;
66007010	and they cried with a loud voice , saying " Salvation to our God , who sits on the throne , And to the Lamb ! "
66007011	And all the angels stood encircling the throne , and the Elders and the Living Creatures ; and they fell on their faces before the throne , worshiping God ,
66007012	and crying , " Even so ! The blessing and the glory and the wisdom And the thanksgiving and the honor and the power and the might Be to our God forever and ever . Amen . "
66007013	And one of the Elders spoke to me , saying . " Who are these , clad in white robes ? Whence come they ? "
66007014	And I said to him , " You know , my Lord . " And he said to me , " These are those who have come out of the great persecution , and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb .
66007015	For this they are now before the throne of God , and are serving him day and night in his temple . " And He who sits on the throne Will spread his tabernacle over them .
66007016	They hunger no more , Neither thirst any more ; Neither will the sun strike upon them , Nor any scorching heat ;
66007017	For the Lamb in the midst of the throne Will shepherd them , And will lead them to fountains of living water ; And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes . "
66008001	And when he opened the seventh seal , there followed a silence in heaven , about the space of half an hour .
66008002	And I saw the seven angels who stand before God , and seven trumpets were given them .
66008003	And another angel came and stood at the altar , having a golden censer , and a great quantity of incense was given him to mingle with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar , which was before the throne .
66008004	And the smoke of the incense , with the prayers of the saints , rose up from the hand of the angel into the presence of God .
66008005	Then the angel took the censer , and he filled it with fire from the altar , and poured it upon the earth ; and there followed thunders and voices and lightnings and an earthquake .
66008006	And the seven angels with the seven trumpets prepared to blow their trumpets .
66008007	And the first angel blew his trumpet , and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood , and it fell upon the earth ; and the third part of the earth was burned up , and the third part of the trees , and all the green grass .
66008008	And the second angel blew his trumpet , and something like a great mountain burning with fire was hurled into the sea ; and a third part of the sea became blood ;
66008009	and a third part of the living creatures in the sea died , and the third part of the ships were destroyed .
66008010	And the third angel blew his trumpet , and there fell from heaven a great star , blazing like a torch . It fell upon a third of the rivers and upon the springs . ( The name of the star is called Wormwood . )
66008011	A third part of the waters became wormwood ; and many men died of the waters , because they were made bitter .
66008012	And the fourth angel blew his trumpet , and the third part of the sun was blasted , and a third part of the moon , and a third part of the stars ; so that the third part of them should be darkened , and for a third part of the day there was no light , and at night it was the same .
66008013	And I looked and I heard a solitary eagle flying in mid-heaven , and crying with a loud voice , " Woe , woe , woe for all who live on the earth , Because of the rest of the trumpet-blasts That the three angels are about to blow ! "
66009001	Then the fifth angel blew his trumpet , and I saw a star fallen from heaven upon the earth ; and to him was given the key to the bottomless pit .
66009002	And he opened the bottomless pit , and out of the pit there went up a smoke like the smoke of a great furnace . And the sun and the air grew dark , because of the smoke out of the pit .
66009003	And out of the smoke came locusts upon the earth ; they were given power like that of scorpions on the earth . .
66009004	They were told not to hurt the grass of the earth , nor any plant , nor any tree , but only those who have not the seal of God on their foreheads .
66009005	Yet they were not permitted to kill them , but only to torture them for five months . Their torture was like the torture of a scorpion , when it stings a man .
66009006	In those days men will seek death , and will not find it ; they will long to die , but death ever flees from them .
66009007	The appearance of the locusts was like horses equipped for battle . On their heads there was something like crowns of gold , and their faces were like mens faces ,
66009008	and they had hair like the hair of women , and their teeth were like lions teeth ,
66009009	and they had breastplates something like breastplates of iron ; and the noise of their wings was like the noise of chariots , of many horses rushing into battle .
66009010	And they have tails like scorpions , and stings , and their power to torture men five months was in their tails .
66009011	They have a king over them , the angel of the bottomless pit . His name in Hebrew is Abaddon ; in Greek he is called Apollyon .
66009012	" The first woe has passed ; and still there are two woes to follow . "
66009013	Then the sixth angel blew his trumpet ; and I heard a voice from the horns of the golden altar which is before God ,
66009014	one saying to the sixth angel that had the trumpet , " Loose the four angels which are bound at the great river Euphrates . "
66009015	Then the four angels that were held in readiness for that hour and day and month and year , were let loose , to destroy a third of mankind .
66009016	The number of the hosts of the horsemen was twice ten thousand times ten thousand . I heard their number ;
66009017	and thus I saw the horses in the vision and their riders . They had breastplates of fire , " red as fire , dark blue as jacinth , and yellow as sulphur . " The heads of the horses were like lions heads , and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone .
66009018	By these three plagues a third of mankind were killed ; by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone which issued from their mouths .
66009019	For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails . For their tails are like serpents with heads , and with them they work woe .
66009020	And the rest of mankind who were not killed with these plagues , did not repent of the works of their hands . They would not give up the worship of demons and of idols made of gold and silver , and brass , and stone , and wood , which can neither see , nor hear , nor walk .
66009021	And they did not repent of their murders , nor of their sorceries , nor of their immorality , nor of their thefts .
66010001	And I saw another mighty angel coming down out of heaven , clad with a cloud ; and a rainbow was upon his head , and his face was like the sun , and his feet like pillars of fire .
66010002	In his hand he had a little book , open ; and he set his right foot upon the sea , and his left upon the land .
66010003	With a great voice he shouted as a lion roars ; and when he shouted , the seven thunders uttered their voices .
66010004	When the seven thunders uttered their voices , I was about to write ; but I heard a voice from the sky , saying , " Seal up the words which the seven thunders uttered , and write them not . "
66010005	And the angel whom I had seen standing upon the sea and upon the land lifted up his right hand to heaven ,
66010006	and swore by him who lives forever and ever , who created the heaven and all that is in it , and the earth and all that is in it , and the sea and all that is in it ,
66010007	" Delay there shall be no more , but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel , when he is about to blow his trumpet , then shall there be finished the mystery of God , according to the Good News which he told unto his slaves , the prophets . "
66010008	And the voice which I had heard from heaven , I heard again , speaking to me , and saying , " Go , take the little book that is open in the hand of the angel who stands upon the sea and upon the land . "
66010009	And I went to the angel and told him to give me the little book . And he said to me . " Take it , and eat it up ; it will make your belly bitter , but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey . "
66010010	I took the little book out of the hand of the angel , and ate it up , and it was in my mouth sweet like honey ; but when I had eaten it , my belly was made bitter .
66010011	Then I was told , " You must prophesy again over many peoples and nations and tongues and kings . "
66011001	And there was given me a reed like to a rod , and a voice said to me . " Go and measure the temple of God , and the altar , and those who are worshiping therein .
66011002	But the court which is outside the temple , omit , and do not measure that , for it has been given up to the Gentiles , and they shall tread under foot the Holy City for forty and two months .
66011003	And I will give power to my two witnesses , and clothed in sackcloth they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days .
66011004	" These are the two olive trees , and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth .
66011005	When any one wishes to hurt them , fire comes from their mouth and devours their enemies ; and if any man wishes to hurt them , in this manner he must be killed .
66011006	These have power to shut heaven so that it does not rain in the days of their prophecy ; and have power over waters to turn them to blood , and to smite the earth with all plagues , as often as they will .
66011007	" And when they shall have finished their testimony , the beast that is coming up out of the bottomless pit will make war with them , and overcome them , and kill them .
66011008	And their dead bodies lie in the streets of the great city whose mystical name is Sodom and Egypt - where also their Lord was crucified .
66011009	For three days and a half men of all peoples , and tribes , and languages , and nations , look upon their dead bodies , and refuse to let their dead bodies be laid in a tomb .
66011010	" And those who dwell on the earth are rejoicing over them , and making merry ; and they will send gifts to one another ; because these two prophets were a torment to those who dwell on the earth .
66011011	And after three days and a half the breath of life from God entered into them , and they stood on their feet , and great fear fell upon them .
66011012	And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them , " Come up hither , " and they went up to heaven on a cloud , while their enemies watched them .
66011013	And in that hour there was a great earthquake , and the tenth part of the city fell ; and there were killed in the earthquake seven thousand persons ; and the rest were frightened and gave glory to the God of heaven .
66011014	" The second woe is passed ; and there is a third woe soon to follow . "
66011015	And the seventh angel blew his trumpet ; and there followed great voices in heaven , and they said , " THE KINGDOMS OF THIS WORLD ARE BECOME THE KINGDOM OF OUR LORD AND OF HIS CHRIST , AND HE WILL REIGN FOREVER AND EVER . "
66011016	Then the four and twenty Elders who are seated before God on their thrones , fell upon their faces and worshiped God ,
66011017	saying . " We give thee thanks , O Lord God , The Almighty , who art and who wast ; For thou hast taken thy great power , And begun to reign .
66011018	The nations raged , and thy wrath came , And the time for the dead to be judged ; The time for rewarding thy slaves , the prophets And the saints , and those who reverence thy name , Both small and great ; And the time to destroy those who are destroying the earth . "
66011019	Then the temple of God in heaven was opened , and the ark of his covenant was seen inside his sanctuary ; and there followed lightnings and voices and thunders , and an earthquake , and great hail .
66012001	And a great sign was seen in heaven ; a woman clothed with the sun , and the moon under her feet , and upon her head a diadem of twelve stars .
66012002	She was with child ; and she cried out , travailing in birth , in anguish to be delivered .
66012003	And another sign was seen in heaven ; and lo , a great red dragon , with seven heads and ten horns , and upon his head seven diadems .
66012004	His tail drew a third part of the stars of the sky , and dashed them down to the earth . And the dragon stood before the woman about to be delivered , so that he might devour her child when she was delivered .
66012005	And she gave birth to a son , a man child , who is to shepherd all the nations with a rod of iron ; and her child was caught up unto God and unto his throne .
66012006	And the woman fled into the desert , where she has a place prepared by God , in which she is to be nourished for a thousand two hundred and threescore days .
66012007	And there was war in heaven . Michael and his angels went forth to war with the dragon ; and the dragon also fought , and his angels ;
66012008	but they failed , nor was their place found any more in heaven .
66012009	Now the great dragon was thrown down - that old Serpent , he who is called the devil and Satan , the deceiver of the whole world . He was thrown down to the earth , and his angels were thrown down with him .
66012010	And I heard a great voice in heaven , which said . " Now it is come ! the salvation and the power , The kingdom of our God , and the authority of his Christ ! For the accuser of our brethren is thrown down , Who accused them before our God , day and night .
66012011	And they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb , And by the word of their testimony ; And they loved not their life , even unto death .
66012012	Therefore rejoice , O heavens , And you who dwell therein ! Woe to the earth and the sea ! For the devil has gone down to you in great fury , Because he knows that he has but little time . "
66012013	When the dragon saw that he was hurled down to the earth , he pursued the woman who gave birth to the man child .
66012014	But the woman was given the two wings of the great eagle , so that she might fly into the desert to her place where she is nourished for a time , and times , and half a time , from the face of the serpent .
66012015	And the serpent poured water from his mouth after the woman , water like a river , so that he might cause her to be carried off by the stream .
66012016	But the earth came to the rescue of the woman and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the river that the dragon had poured forth from his mouth .
66012017	And the dragon was enraged at the woman , and went away to make war upon the rest of her children who keep the commandments of God , and hold fast the testimony of Jesus . And he stood upon the sand of the sea .
66013001	Then I saw rising up out of the sea a beast who had ten horns and seven heads . On his horns he had ten diadems , and on his heads blasphemous titles .
66013002	The beast I saw was like a leopard , and his feet were bears feet , and his mouth a lions mouth . The dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority .
66013003	And I saw that one of his heads seemed to have been mortally wounded , but its deadly wound had been healed . The whole earth was following the beast , wondering .
66013004	Men worshiped the dragon because he gave his authority to the beast ; and they worshiped the beast , saying . " Who is like the beast ? Who can fight with him ? "
66013005	And he was permitted to utter loud boasts and blasphemies ; and there was given to him authority to continue forty-two months .
66013006	So he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God , to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle ( those who live in his tabernacle in heaven ) .
66013007	The beast was allowed to wage war upon the saints , and to conquer them ; and there was given him authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation ;
66013008	and each one whose name has not been written in the Lambs book of life , the Lamb who has been slain from the foundation of the world . All who dwell on the earth shall worship him .
66013009	Let him who has ears to hear , listen .
66013010	Whoever is destined to go into captivity , goes into captivity . Whoever shall kill with the sword , shall surely be killed by the sword . ( Here is the endurance and faith of the saints . )
66013011	And I saw another beast ascending from the land ; and he had two horns like a lamb , but he spoke like a dragon ;
66013012	and he exerts the full authority of the first beast before him , and he makes the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast whose death-stroke was healed .
66013013	And he performs great miracles , so that he even causes fire to come down to the earth from the sky , before mens eyes .
66013014	And he deceives those who dwell on the earth , because of the miracles , which he is permitted to perform in the sight of the beast . He tells those who live on the earth to make an image to the beast who had the sword-stroke , yet lived .
66013015	And he was permitted to give breath to the image of the beast , so that the image of the beast should speak ; and so that any one who would not worship the image of the beast should be put to death .
66013016	And he makes all men , low and high , rich and poor , freemen and slaves , to have a brand put upon their right hands or upon their brows ,
66013017	so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the brand of the beast , or the number of his name .
66013018	Here is wisdom . Let him who has understanding count the number of the beast ; for it is the number of a man ; and his number is 666 .
66014001	And I looked , and lo , there was the Lamb standing on Mount Zion , and with were a hundred and forty and four thousand who had his name and his Fathers name written on their foreheads .
66014002	And I heard a voice from heaven like the voice of many waters , and the voice of a great thunder ; and I heard the voice of harpers harping on their harps .
66014003	They were singing a new song before the throne , and before the four Living Creatures and the Elders ; and none can learn that song , except the one hundred and forty and four thousand , who had been redeemed from the earth .
66014004	These are they who were not defiled with women ; for they are celibates . They follow the Lamb wherever he goes . They have been redeemed from among men to be the first-fruits unto God and the Lamb .
66014005	No lie was ever found on their lips ; they are spotless .
66014006	Then I saw another angel who was flying in mid-heaven . He had an eternal evangel , to evangelize all the dwellers on the earth , of every nation and tribe and tongue and people .
66014007	And he cried with a loud voice . " Fear God and give him glory , Because the hour of his judgment is come . And worship Him who made the heavens and the earth And the sea and springs of waters . "
66014008	Then a second angel followed , crying , " Fallen , fallen is Babylon the Great , Who has made all the nations drink the wine Of the frenzy of her fornication . "
66014009	And another angel , a third , followed them , crying with a mighty voice . " Whoever worships the beast and his image , And receives a brand on his forehead or on his hand ,
66014010	He also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God , Poured out unmixed in the cup of his anger ; And he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone In the presence of the holy angels , And in the presence of the Lamb ,
66014011	And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever ; And they have no rest day or night , Who worship the beast and his image , And all who receive the brand of his name . "
66014012	Here is the endurance of the saints , those who keep the commandments of God , and the faith of Jesus .
66014013	And I heard a voice from heaven , saying , " Write , Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord from henceforth ! Yea , says the Spirit , that they may rest from their labors , For their deeds do follow them . "
66014014	And I looked , and lo , a white cloud ; and on the cloud I saw One sitting like to a son of man , with a golden crown on his head , and a sharp sickle in his hand .
66014015	And another angel came out of the temple , shouting with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud . " Thrust in your sickle , and reap ; for the time to reap is come . The harvest of the earth is overripe . "
66014016	And he who sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle upon the earth ; and the earth was reaped .
66014017	And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven , and he , too , had a sharp sickle .
66014018	And another angel came from the altar , the angel who has power over fire , and he called with a loud voice to the one who had the sharp sickle , saying , " Thrust in your sharp sickle , And gather the clusters of the vine of the earth , For its grapes are fully ripe . "
66014019	So the angel thrust his sickle into the earth and gathered the clusters of the vine of the earth , and threw them into the winepress , the great winepress of the wrath of God .
66014020	And the winepress was trodden outside the city , and blood gushed out of the winepress , even to the bridles of the horses , as far as two hundred miles .
66015001	And I beheld another sign in heaven , great and marvelous , seven angels with the seven last plagues ; because with them the wrath of God is finished .
66015002	And I saw the semblance of a glassy sea , mingled with fire ; and standing by this glassy sea , with harps of God , were those who came off conquerors from the beast and from his image and from the cipher of his name .
66015003	They were singing the song of Moses , the slave of God , and the song of the Lamb , saying . " Great and marvelous are thy works , O Lord God , the Almighty ! Righteous and true are thy ways , Thou King of kings !
66015004	Who shall not fear , O Lord , And glorify thy name ? For thou only art holy . For all the nations shall come and worship before thee ; For thy righteous acts have been made evident . "
66015005	After that I looked , and the sanctuary of the tabernacle of testimony was opened in heaven ;
66015006	and there came out of the sanctuary the seven angels with the seven plagues . They were clothed in white linen , pure and bright , and girt about the breasts with golden girdles .
66015007	And one of the four Living Creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls , full of the wrath of God , who lives forever and ever .
66015008	The sanctuary was filled with smoke from the glory and majesty of God ; and no one could enter the sanctuary until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished .
66016001	Then I heard a loud voice which came out of the temple , saying to the seven angels , " Go , empty the seven bowls of the wrath of God upon the earth . "
66016002	The first angel went and poured out his bowl upon the earth . And it was turned to loathsome and painful sores upon all who bore the brand of the beast , and who worshiped his image .
66016003	And the second angel poured out his bowl upon the sea ; and it became blood , like the blood of a corpse , and every living creature died - everything in the sea .
66016004	And the third poured out his bowl into the rivers and springs of waters ; and they were turned into blood .
66016005	And I heard the angel of the waters saying . " Righteous art thou , thou who art and wast , The Holy One , Because thou didst inflict this judgment .
66016006	For men poured out the blood of thy saints and prophets , And thou hast given them blood to drink . And this they deserved . "
66016007	And I heard the altar saying , " Yea , O Lord , the Almighty , True and righteous are thy judgments . "
66016008	And the fourth angel poured out his bowl upon the sun , and the sun was permitted to scorch men with fire .
66016009	And men were scorched with the terrible heat ; and they blasphemed the name of the God who had the power over these plagues ; yet they repented not , to give him glory .
66016010	And the fifth poured out his bowl upon the throne of the beast ; and his kingdom became darkened , and men gnawed their tongues for pain ,
66016011	and they blasphemed the God of heaven , because of their pains and their sores ; yet of their deeds they did not repent .
66016012	And the sixth poured his bowl upon the great river , the River Euphrates , and its water was dried up so as to make ready the way for the kings that come from the sunrising .
66016013	And I saw three unclean spirits , like frogs , coming out of the dragons mouth , and the beasts mouth , and the false prophets mouth .
66016014	For these are the spirits of demons performing miracles , who go forth to the kings of the habitable earth , to gather them together for the battle of the great Day of God , the Almighty .
66016015	Lo , I am coming like a thief . Blessed is the who is on the watch and guarding his clothing , so that he may not walk naked , and they gaze on his shame .
66016016	And the spirits gathered the kings together at the place called in Hebrew , Armageddon .
66016017	And the seventh poured out his bowl upon the air , and a great voice came forth out of the temple from the throne , saying , " It is finished ! "
66016018	And lightnings and voices and thunders and a great earthquake such as had not happened since man began to be upon the earth , so great an earthquake , so mighty ;
66016019	and the great city was shattered into three parts , and the cities of the nations fell , and great Babylon came to mind before the face of God , to give her the cup of the wine of the passion of his anger .
66016020	And every island fled away , and the mountains sank from sight .
66016021	And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven , every stone about the weight of a talent ; and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail , for the plague of it is very great .
66017001	And there came one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls , and spoke to me , saying , " Come hither and I will show you the sentence passed upon the great harlot who sits on many waters ,
66017002	with whom the kings of the earth have committed adultery , while all who live on the earth have been made drunken by the wine of her immorality . "
66017003	And he bore me away in the Spirit into the desert , and I saw a woman who sat upon a scarlet beast covered with blasphemous names . It had seven heads and ten horns .
66017004	The woman was enwrapped in purple and scarlet and was encrusted with gold and precious stones and pearls . In her hand she held a golden cup filled with abominations , even the impurities of her immorality .
66017005	Upon her forehead a name was written , a mystery , " BABYLON THE GREAT , THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS , AND ABOMINABLE THINGS OF THE EARTH . "
66017006	And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints , and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus , and I wondered with a great wonder .
66017007	And the angel said to me . " Why did you wonder ? I will explain to you the mystery of the woman , and of the beast with the seven heads and ten horns , that carried her .
66017008	The beast that you saw was , and is not , and is about to come up out of the bottomless pit , and to go into perdition . And those who dwell on the earth shall wonder , those whose names have never , from the foundation of the world , been written in the Lambs Book of Life , when they gaze on the beast ; how he was and is not , and is to come .
66017009	Here is the mind that has wisdom . the seven heads are seven hills on which the woman is seated ;
66017010	and they are seven kings ; the five have fallen , one is , the other is not yet come ( and when he does come , he must remain a short time ) .
66017011	And the beast who was , but is not , is himself also an eighth , although he is one of the seven kings , and is on his way to perdition .
66017012	" The ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received their kingdoms ; but they have received authority as kings for one hour , together with the beast .
66017013	These kings have one mind , and they give their power and authority to the beast .
66017014	These will make war against the Lamb , and the Lamb will conquer them , for he is the Lord of lords , and King of kings . And they who are with him are called and faithful and chosen . "
66017015	And he also said to me . " The waters which you saw , on which the harlot takes her seat , are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues .
66017016	And the ten horns which you saw , they and the beast will hate the harlot and make her desolate and naked , and will eat her flesh and burn her up with fire .
66017017	For God has put it into their hearts to execute his purpose , in executing their common purpose , and by giving over their kingdoms to the beast , until the words of God shall be accomplished .
66017018	The woman whom you saw is the great city which holds sway over the kings of the earth . "
66018001	After this I saw another angel coming down from heaven , who had great authority ; and the earth was illumined by his glory .
66018002	He shouted with a mighty cry , saying . " She is fallen ! She is fallen , Babylon the great ! Now she is a dwelling-place of demons , A stronghold of every foul spirit , A stronghold of every foul and hateful bird .
66018003	For all nations , having drunk the wine of the frenzy of her fornication , are fallen ; And the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her , And the merchants of the earth have grown rich by the power of her wantonness . "
66018004	And behold I heard another voice from heaven saying . " Come out of her , that you have no fellowship with her sins , And that you receive not her plagues .
66018005	For her sins have been heaped to heaven , And God has remembered her iniquities .
66018006	Render to her what she rendered ; Yes , pay double what her deeds deserve . In the cup she mixed , mix double for her .
66018007	By so much as she glorified herself and waxed wanton , By so much give her of torture and tears , For she says in her heart , I sit here a queen , I am no widow . I shall in no wise see mourning .
66018008	Therefore in one day shall these plagues come upon her , Death and mourning and famine , And she shall be burnt with fire ; For mighty is the Lord God , her judge .
66018009	And the kings of the earth who committed fornication And lived wantonly with her , Will weep and wail over her , When they behold the smoke of her burning ,
66018010	Standing afar off for the fear of her torment , saying , Woe , woe , the great city Babylon , the strong city ! In one hour is your judgment come !
66018011	" And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her , For no one buys their merchandise any more -
66018012	Merchandise of gold and silver and precious stones , Of pearls , and fine linen , and purple and silk and scarlet ; All citron wood , and vessels of ivory , And vessels of rare wood and brass and iron and marble ;
66018013	Cinnamon and balsam and spices and myrrh and frankincense ; Wine and oil and fine flour and wheat ; Cattle and sheep , and horses and chariots , And slaves , and the souls of men .
66018014	And the fruits which your soul lusted for are gone from you , And all things that were dainty and sumptuous are perished from you , And men shall find them nevermore .
66018015	" The traders in those things , who were enriched by her , shall stand afar off for fear of her torment , weeping and mourning ,
66018016	saying . " Woe , woe , the great city ! She who was clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet , And adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls !
66018017	In one hour so great riches is made desolate ! " And every shipmaster and every one who sails to any port , And sailors , and all seafaring folk ,
66018018	Stood at a distance , and as they saw the smoke from the burning city , cried , " What city can compare with the great city ?
66018019	And they threw dust on their heads , and cried out , Weeping and mourning , saying , " Woe , woe , the great city , In which all who have ships on the sea Grew rich through her luxury ! For in one hour she is made desolate ! "
66018020	Rejoice over her , O Heaven ! Rejoice , ye saints , apostles , prophets ! For God has now avenged you .
66018021	Then a mighty angel lifted a boulder like a great millstone , and hurled it into the sea , saying , " So shall Babylon , the great city , be overthrown with a mighty fall , And shall be found no more at all .
66018022	No more shall the voice of harpers and minstrels , flute-players and trumpeters Be heard in you . No more shall any craftsman of any craft Be found at all in you . No more shall the sound of a millstone be heard at all in you .
66018023	No light of a lamp shall ever shine in you again ; And in you shall the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride be heard no more . For your merchants were the princes of the earth ; And with your sorcery were all the nations deceived ;
66018024	And in you was found the blood of prophets and of saints , And of all who have been slain upon the earth . "
66019001	After this I heard the semblance of the mighty voice of a great multitude in heaven , crying . " Hallelujah ! Salvation and glory and power Unto the Lord our God !
66019002	For true and righteous are his judgments ; For he has judged the great harlot Who was corrupting the earth with her fornication . On her he has avenged the blood of his slaves . "
66019003	And a second time they said . " Allelulia ! For the smoke of her torment goes up forever and ever ! "
66019004	Then the four and twenty Elders and the four beasts fell down and worshiped God who sits on the throne , saying , " Amen , Hallelujah ! "
66019005	And a voice came forth from the throne , saying , " Praise our God , all you his slaves , All you who fear him , small and great ! "
66019006	And I heard a sound like the voice of a great multitude , and like the voice of many waters , and like the voice of mighty thunderings , saying . " Alleluia , for the Lord God omnipotent reigns !
66019007	Let us rejoice and triumph and give him the glory ; For the marriage of the Lamb is come , And his bride has made herself ready ,
66019008	And it has been granted to her to array herself in fine linen , bright and pure ; For the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints . "
66019009	And he said to me , Write , " Blessed are those who have been bidden to the marriage supper of the Lamb . " And he said to me , " These are true words of God . "
66019010	And I fell down at his feet to worship him , and he said to me . " See that you do it not . I am a fellow slave of yours and of your brothers who hold the testimony of Jesus ; for the testimony of Jesus is the vital breath of prophecy . "
66019011	And I saw heaven opened , and lo ! a white horse ; and he who sat upon him was named " Faithful and True " ; and in righteousness does he judge and make war .
66019012	His eyes are a flame of fire , and upon his head are many diadems ; and he has a name written , which none knows but himself .
66019013	He is clothed in a vesture dipped in blood ; and his name is called , THE WORD OF GOD
66019014	And the armies of heaven followed him upon white horses , clothed in fine linen , white and pure .
66019015	And there issues from his lips a sharp sword with which to smite the nations . He shall shepherd them with a rod of iron . And he treads the winepress of the passion of the anger of Almighty God .
66019016	And on his robe and on his thigh he has a name written , KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS
66019017	And I saw an angel standing in the sun , who shouted in a loud voice to all the birds that fly in mid-heaven , " Come , gather yourselves together to the great supper of God ,
66019018	to eat the flesh of kings , the flesh of generals , the flesh of horses and their riders , and the flesh of all men , bond and free , small and great . "
66019019	And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war on him who sat on the horse and on his army .
66019020	And the beast was seized , and with him the false prophet who performed miracles in his presence to deceive those who had received the brand of the beast , and those who worshiped his image . The two were thrown alive into the lake of fire , blazing with brimstone .
66019021	And the rest were slain with the sword of him who sat on the horse , that sword which issued from his lips . And all the birds gorged themselves with their flesh .
66020001	And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven , with the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand .
66020002	He gripped the dragon , that old serpent , who is the devil and Satan , and bound him for a thousand years ,
66020003	and flung him into the bottomless pit , and shut and sealed it over him , so that he should seduce the nations no more , until the thousand years were completed . After that it is necessary to loose him for a little while .
66020004	And I saw thrones , and those who sat on them , and they were permitted to judge ; and I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus , and for the Word of God , those who did not worship the beast nor his image , and who did not receive his brand upon their brow , or hands . And they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years .
66020005	The rest of the dead did not live until the thousand years were completed . This is the first resurrection .
66020006	Blessed and holy is he who has a part in the first resurrection ; on such the second death has no power , but they will be Gods priests , and Christs ; and will reign with him for a thousand years .
66020007	And when the thousand years have been completed , Satan will be loosed out of his prison ,
66020008	and will go forth to seduce the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth , Gog and Magog , to marshal them for war - their number is like the sands of the sea .
66020009	And they went up over the broad earth , and surrounded the encampment of the saints , and the beloved city . Then fire fell from the sky and consumed them ;
66020010	and the devil who had been deceiving them was hurled into the lake of fire and brimstone , where lie also the beast and the false prophet . And they will be tortured day and night , forever and ever .
66020011	And I saw a great white throne , and One who sat thereon ; from his presence fled earth and sky , and no place was found for them .
66020012	And I saw the dead , great and small , standing before the throne ; and books were opened , and another book - the Book of Life - was opened ; and the dead were judged according to their deeds , by what was written in the books .
66020013	The sea gave up the dead who were in it . Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them .
66020014	And all were judged according to their deeds . And Death and Hades were hurled into the lake of fire . This is the second death , the lake of fire .
66020015	And if any one was found who was not written in the Book of Life , he was hurled into the lake of fire .
66021001	Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth , for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away ; and the sea is no more .
66021002	And I saw the Holy City , the New Jerusalem , descending out of heaven from God , made ready like a bride adorned for her husband .
66021003	And I heard a loud voice out of the throne , crying . " Behold , Gods tent is with men , And he will tent with them , And they will be his peoples . And God himself will be with them ,
66021004	And he will wipe away every tear from their eyes . Death will be no more , Nor will there be mourning , Nor crying , nor pain any more . Because the first things have passed away . "
66021005	And He who sat on the throne said , " Behold , I am making all things new . " And He said to me , " Write this , for these words are trustworthy and genuine . "
66021006	He also said . " It has now come to pass . I am the Alpha and the Omega , The Beginning and the End . To him who thirsts I will freely give Of the spring of the Water of life .
66021007	He who overcomes will inherit these , And I will be his God , And he shall be my son .
66021008	But as for the cowards , the faithless , the abominable , And for the murderers , fornicators , sorcerers , Idolaters , and all liars , Their part will be in the lake that blazes with fire and brimstone . " This is the second death . "
66021009	And there came to me one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls filled with the last plagues , and he spoke to me , saying . " Come hither ! I will show you the bride , the Lambs wife . "
66021010	And he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain , huge and high ; and he showed me the Holy City , Jerusalem , descending out of heaven from God .
66021011	It had the glory of God . Its light was like some precious stone , like jasper , clear as crystal ;
66021012	with a wall great and high , and twelve gates , and at the gates twelve angels ; and names written thereon , the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel .
66021013	On the east were three gates ; and on the north , three gates ; and on the south , three gates ; and on the west , three gates .
66021014	And the wall of the city had twelve foundations , and on them were the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb .
66021015	And he who spoke had a golden reed , as a measure , to measure the city and its gates and walls .
66021016	And the city lies foursquare ; the length of it is as great as the breadth . Then he measured the city with the reed , fifteen hundred miles ; the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal .
66021017	And he measured its wall , two hundred and sixteen feet , mans measure , which is an angels .
66021018	And its wall is made of jasper ; but the city is of pure gold , like pure glass .
66021019	The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with all kings of precious stones . The first foundation-stone was jasper , the second sapphire , the third chalcedony , the fourth emerald ,
66021020	the fifth sardonyx , the sixth sardius , the seventh chrysolite , the eighth beryl , the ninth topaz , the tenth chrysoprase , the eleventh jacinth , the twelfth amethyst .
66021021	And the twelve gates were twelve pearls ; each gate of one pearl . And the broad street of the city was of pure gold , transparent like glass .
66021022	And I saw no temple in the city ; For the temple is the Lord God , the Almighty , And the Lamb .
66021023	And the city has no need of the sun , Nor of the moon , to shine upon it ; For the glory of God has lightened it , And its lamp is the Lamb .
66021024	And the nations will walk by its light . And into it the kings of the earth will bring their glory ;
66021025	And its gates will not be shut by day , ( For there is no night there ) ;
66021026	And they will bring the glory and honor Of the nations into it .
66021027	There will not enter it anything profane , Nor any who work abominations and a lie ; But only those who are written In the Lambs Book of Life .
66022001	And he showed me the river of the Water of Life , clear as crystal , Flowing out from the throne of God , and of the Lamb ,
66022002	In the middle of the broad street of the City . On each side of the river was a Tree of Life , Bearing twelve kinds of fruit , Each month yielding its own fruit . And the leaves of the tree Were for the healing of the nations .
66022003	And there will be no more curse But in it will be the throne of God and of the Lamb .
66022004	And his slaves will serve and worship him . They will see his face .
66022005	His name will need no lamplight nor sunlight , Because the Lord God will give them light ; And they will reign forever and ever .
66022006	Then he said to me . " These words may be trusted , and are true . the Lord , the God of the spirits of the prophets , has sent his angel to show his slaves what must soon take place .
66022007	" And behold , I am coming quickly . Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book . "
66022008	And I , John , am he who heard and saw these things . And after I heard and saw them , I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed them to me .
66022009	But he said to me . " See thou do it not . I am only a fellow slave with you and your brothers , the prophets , and with those who keep the words of this Book . " WORSHIP GOD ! "
66022010	And he said to me , " Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book ; for the crisis is near .
66022011	He who is wicked , let him be wicked still ; He who is filthy , let him be filthy still ; He who is righteous , lit him practise righteousness still ; And he who is holy , let him be made holy still .
66022012	Behold , I come quickly ; and my reward is with me , To give to each man what his actions merit .
66022013	I am the Alpha and the Omega , The First and the Last , The Beginning and the End .
66022014	" Blessed are they who wash their robes , so that they may have right to the Tree of Life , and may enter in by the gates into the City .
66022015	Without are the dogs , the sorcerers , the immoral , the murderers , the idolaters , and all who live and make a lie .
66022016	" I , Jesus , have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches . I am the root and offspring of David , the bright and morning Star .
66022017	" And the Spirit and the Bride say Come ! And let him who hears , say Come ! And let him who thirsts , come ; And whoever wills , let him take the Water of Life freely . "
66022018	I testify to every man who hears the words of the prophecy of this book . If any man shall add to them , God will add to him the plagues which are written in this book ;
66022019	and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy , God will take away his share in the Tree of Life , and in the Holy City , about which this book is written .
66022020	He who testifies this says , " Yea , I am coming quickly . " Amen ! Come , Lord Jesus !
66022021	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with the saints !
