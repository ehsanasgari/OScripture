40001001	This is the list of the ancestors of Jesus Christ , a descendant of David , who was a descendant of Abraham .
40001017	So then , there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David , and fourteen from David to the exile in Babylon , and fourteen from then to the birth of the Messiah .
40001018	This was how the birth of Jesus Christ took place . His mother Mary was engaged to Joseph , but before they were married , she found out that she was going to have a baby by the Holy Spirit .
40001019	Joseph was a man who always did what was right , but he did not want to disgrace Mary publicly ; so he made plans to break the engagement privately .
40001020	While he was thinking about this , an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said , “ Joseph , descendant of David , do not be afraid to take Mary to be your wife . For it is by the Holy Spirit that she has conceived .
40001021	She will have a son , and you will name him Jesus—because he will save his people from their sins . ”
40001022	Now all this happened in order to make come true what the Lord had said through the prophet ,
40001023	“ A virgin will become pregnant and have a son , and he will be called Immanuel ” ( which means , “ God is with us ” ) .
40001024	So when Joseph woke up , he married Mary , as the angel of the Lord had told him to .
40001025	But he had no sexual relations with her before she gave birth to her son . And Joseph named him Jesus .
40002001	Jesus was born in the town of Bethlehem in Judea , during the time when Herod was king . Soon afterward , some men who studied the stars came from the East to Jerusalem
40002002	and asked , “ Where is the baby born to be the king of the Jews ? We saw his star when it came up in the east , and we have come to worship him . ”
40002003	When King Herod heard about this , he was very upset , and so was everyone else in Jerusalem .
40002004	He called together all the chief priests and the teachers of the Law and asked them , “ Where will the Messiah be born ? ”
40002005	“ In the town of Bethlehem in Judea , ” they answered . “ For this is what the prophet wrote :
40002006	‘ Bethlehem in the land of Judah , you are by no means the least of the leading cities of Judah ; for from you will come a leader who will guide my people Israel . ’ ”
40002007	So Herod called the visitors from the East to a secret meeting and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared .
40002008	Then he sent them to Bethlehem with these instructions : “ Go and make a careful search for the child ; and when you find him , let me know , so that I too may go and worship him . ”
40002011	They went into the house , and when they saw the child with his mother Mary , they knelt down and worshiped him . They brought out their gifts of gold , frankincense , and myrrh , and presented them to him .
40002012	Then they returned to their country by another road , since God had warned them in a dream not to go back to Herod .
40002013	After they had left , an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph and said , “ Herod will be looking for the child in order to kill him . So get up , take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt , and stay there until I tell you to leave . ”
40002014	Joseph got up , took the child and his mother , and left during the night for Egypt ,
40002015	where he stayed until Herod died . This was done to make come true what the Lord had said through the prophet , “ I called my Son out of Egypt . ”
40002016	When Herod realized that the visitors from the East had tricked him , he was furious . He gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its neighborhood who were two years old and younger—this was done in accordance with what he had learned from the visitors about the time when the star had appeared .
40002017	In this way what the prophet Jeremiah had said came true :
40002018	“ A sound is heard in Ramah , the sound of bitter weeping . Rachel is crying for her children ; she refuses to be comforted , for they are dead . ”
40002019	After Herod died , an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt
40002020	and said , “ Get up , take the child and his mother , and go back to the land of Israel , because those who tried to kill the child are dead . ”
40002021	So Joseph got up , took the child and his mother , and went back to Israel .
40002022	But when Joseph heard that Archelaus had succeeded his father Herod as king of Judea , he was afraid to go there . He was given more instructions in a dream , so he went to the province of Galilee
40002023	and made his home in a town named Nazareth . And so what the prophets had said came true : “ He will be called a Nazarene . ”
40003001	At that time John the Baptist came to the desert of Judea and started preaching .
40003002	“ Turn away from your sins , ” he said , “ because the Kingdom of heaven is near ! ”
40003003	John was the man the prophet Isaiah was talking about when he said , “ Someone is shouting in the desert , ‘ Prepare a road for the Lord ; make a straight path for him to travel ! ’ ”
40003004	John's clothes were made of camel's hair ; he wore a leather belt around his waist , and his food was locusts and wild honey .
40003005	People came to him from Jerusalem , from the whole province of Judea , and from all over the country near the Jordan River .
40003006	They confessed their sins , and he baptized them in the Jordan .
40003007	When John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to him to be baptized , he said to them , “ You snakes—who told you that you could escape from the punishment God is about to send ?
40003008	Do those things that will show that you have turned from your sins .
40003009	And don't think you can escape punishment by saying that Abraham is your ancestor . I tell you that God can take these rocks and make descendants for Abraham !
40003010	The ax is ready to cut down the trees at the roots ; every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown in the fire .
40003011	I baptize you with water to show that you have repented , but the one who will come after me will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire . He is much greater than I am ; and I am not good enough even to carry his sandals .
40003012	He has his winnowing shovel with him to thresh out all the grain . He will gather his wheat into his barn , but he will burn the chaff in a fire that never goes out . ”
40003013	At that time Jesus arrived from Galilee and came to John at the Jordan to be baptized by him .
40003014	But John tried to make him change his mind . “ I ought to be baptized by you , ” John said , “ and yet you have come to me ! ”
40003015	But Jesus answered him , “ Let it be so for now . For in this way we shall do all that God requires . ” So John agreed .
40003016	As soon as Jesus was baptized , he came up out of the water . Then heaven was opened to him , and he saw the Spirit of God coming down like a dove and lighting on him .
40003017	Then a voice said from heaven , “ This is my own dear Son , with whom I am pleased . ”
40004001	Then the Spirit led Jesus into the desert to be tempted by the Devil .
40004002	After spending forty days and nights without food , Jesus was hungry .
40004003	Then the Devil came to him and said , “ If you are God's Son , order these stones to turn into bread . ”
40004004	But Jesus answered , “ The scripture says , ‘ Human beings cannot live on bread alone , but need every word that God speaks . ’ ”
40004005	Then the Devil took Jesus to Jerusalem , the Holy City , set him on the highest point of the Temple ,
40004006	and said to him , “ If you are God's Son , throw yourself down , for the scripture says , ‘ God will give orders to his angels about you ; they will hold you up with their hands , so that not even your feet will be hurt on the stones . ’ ”
40004007	Jesus answered , “ But the scripture also says , ‘ Do not put the Lord your God to the test . ’ ”
40004008	Then the Devil took Jesus to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in all their greatness .
40004009	“ All this I will give you , ” the Devil said , “ if you kneel down and worship me . ”
40004010	Then Jesus answered , “ Go away , Satan ! The scripture says , ‘ Worship the Lord your God and serve only him ! ’ ”
40004011	Then the Devil left Jesus ; and angels came and helped him .
40004012	When Jesus heard that John had been put in prison , he went away to Galilee .
40004013	He did not stay in Nazareth , but went to live in Capernaum , a town by Lake Galilee , in the territory of Zebulun and Naphtali .
40004014	This was done to make come true what the prophet Isaiah had said ,
40004015	“ Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali , on the road to the sea , on the other side of the Jordan , Galilee , land of the Gentiles !
40004016	The people who live in darkness will see a great light . On those who live in the dark land of death the light will shine . ”
40004017	From that time Jesus began to preach his message : “ Turn away from your sins , because the Kingdom of heaven is near ! ”
40004018	As Jesus walked along the shore of Lake Galilee , he saw two brothers who were fishermen , Simon ( called Peter ) and his brother Andrew , catching fish in the lake with a net .
40004019	Jesus said to them , “ Come with me , and I will teach you to catch people . ”
40004020	At once they left their nets and went with him .
40004021	He went on and saw two other brothers , James and John , the sons of Zebedee . They were in their boat with their father Zebedee , getting their nets ready . Jesus called them ,
40004022	and at once they left the boat and their father , and went with him .
40004023	Jesus went all over Galilee , teaching in the synagogues , preaching the Good News about the Kingdom , and healing people who had all kinds of disease and sickness .
40004024	The news about him spread through the whole country of Syria , so that people brought to him all those who were sick , suffering from all kinds of diseases and disorders : people with demons , and epileptics , and paralyzed people—and Jesus healed them all .
40004025	Large crowds followed him from Galilee and the Ten Towns , from Jerusalem , Judea , and the land on the other side of the Jordan .
40005001	Jesus saw the crowds and went up a hill , where he sat down . His disciples gathered around him ,
40005002	and he began to teach them :
40005003	“ Happy are those who know they are spiritually poor ; the Kingdom of heaven belongs to them !
40005004	“ Happy are those who mourn ; God will comfort them !
40005005	“ Happy are those who are humble ; they will receive what God has promised !
40005006	“ Happy are those whose greatest desire is to do what God requires ; God will satisfy them fully !
40005007	“ Happy are those who are merciful to others ; God will be merciful to them !
40005008	“ Happy are the pure in heart ; they will see God !
40005009	“ Happy are those who work for peace ; God will call them his children !
40005010	“ Happy are those who are persecuted because they do what God requires ; the Kingdom of heaven belongs to them !
40005011	“ Happy are you when people insult you and persecute you and tell all kinds of evil lies against you because you are my followers .
40005012	Be happy and glad , for a great reward is kept for you in heaven . This is how the prophets who lived before you were persecuted .
40005013	“ You are like salt for the whole human race . But if salt loses its saltiness , there is no way to make it salty again . It has become worthless , so it is thrown out and people trample on it .
40005014	“ You are like light for the whole world . A city built on a hill cannot be hid .
40005015	No one lights a lamp and puts it under a bowl ; instead it is put on the lampstand , where it gives light for everyone in the house .
40005016	In the same way your light must shine before people , so that they will see the good things you do and praise your Father in heaven .
40005017	“ Do not think that I have come to do away with the Law of Moses and the teachings of the prophets . I have not come to do away with them , but to make their teachings come true .
40005018	Remember that as long as heaven and earth last , not the least point nor the smallest detail of the Law will be done away with—not until the end of all things .
40005019	So then , whoever disobeys even the least important of the commandments and teaches others to do the same , will be least in the Kingdom of heaven . On the other hand , whoever obeys the Law and teaches others to do the same , will be great in the Kingdom of heaven .
40005020	I tell you , then , that you will be able to enter the Kingdom of heaven only if you are more faithful than the teachers of the Law and the Pharisees in doing what God requires .
40005021	“ You have heard that people were told in the past , ‘ Do not commit murder ; anyone who does will be brought to trial . ’
40005022	But now I tell you : if you are angry with your brother you will be brought to trial , if you call your brother ‘ You good-for-nothing ! ’ you will be brought before the Council , and if you call your brother a worthless fool you will be in danger of going to the fire of hell .
40005023	So if you are about to offer your gift to God at the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you ,
40005024	leave your gift there in front of the altar , go at once and make peace with your brother , and then come back and offer your gift to God .
40005025	“ If someone brings a lawsuit against you and takes you to court , settle the dispute while there is time , before you get to court . Once you are there , you will be turned over to the judge , who will hand you over to the police , and you will be put in jail .
40005026	There you will stay , I tell you , until you pay the last penny of your fine .
40005027	“ You have heard that it was said , ‘ Do not commit adultery . ’
40005028	But now I tell you : anyone who looks at a woman and wants to possess her is guilty of committing adultery with her in his heart .
40005029	So if your right eye causes you to sin , take it out and throw it away ! It is much better for you to lose a part of your body than to have your whole body thrown into hell .
40005030	If your right hand causes you to sin , cut it off and throw it away ! It is much better for you to lose one of your limbs than to have your whole body go off to hell .
40005031	“ It was also said , ‘ Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a written notice of divorce . ’
40005032	But now I tell you : if a man divorces his wife for any cause other than her unfaithfulness , then he is guilty of making her commit adultery if she marries again ; and the man who marries her commits adultery also .
40005033	“ You have also heard that people were told in the past , ‘ Do not break your promise , but do what you have vowed to the Lord to do . ’
40005034	But now I tell you : do not use any vow when you make a promise . Do not swear by heaven , for it is God's throne ;
40005035	nor by earth , for it is the resting place for his feet ; nor by Jerusalem , for it is the city of the great King .
40005036	Do not even swear by your head , because you cannot make a single hair white or black .
40005037	Just say ‘ Yes ’ or ‘ No ’ —anything else you say comes from the Evil One .
40005038	“ You have heard that it was said , ‘ An eye for an eye , and a tooth for a tooth . ’
40005039	But now I tell you : do not take revenge on someone who wrongs you . If anyone slaps you on the right cheek , let him slap your left cheek too .
40005040	And if someone takes you to court to sue you for your shirt , let him have your coat as well .
40005041	And if one of the occupation troops forces you to carry his pack one mile , carry it two miles .
40005042	When someone asks you for something , give it to him ; when someone wants to borrow something , lend it to him .
40005043	“ You have heard that it was said , ‘ Love your friends , hate your enemies . ’
40005044	But now I tell you : love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you ,
40005045	so that you may become the children of your Father in heaven . For he makes his sun to shine on bad and good people alike , and gives rain to those who do good and to those who do evil .
40005046	Why should God reward you if you love only the people who love you ? Even the tax collectors do that !
40005047	And if you speak only to your friends , have you done anything out of the ordinary ? Even the pagans do that !
40005048	You must be perfect—just as your Father in heaven is perfect .
40006001	“ Make certain you do not perform your religious duties in public so that people will see what you do . If you do these things publicly , you will not have any reward from your Father in heaven .
40006002	“ So when you give something to a needy person , do not make a big show of it , as the hypocrites do in the houses of worship and on the streets . They do it so that people will praise them . I assure you , they have already been paid in full .
40006003	But when you help a needy person , do it in such a way that even your closest friend will not know about it .
40006004	Then it will be a private matter . And your Father , who sees what you do in private , will reward you .
40006005	“ When you pray , do not be like the hypocrites ! They love to stand up and pray in the houses of worship and on the street corners , so that everyone will see them . I assure you , they have already been paid in full .
40006006	But when you pray , go to your room , close the door , and pray to your Father , who is unseen . And your Father , who sees what you do in private , will reward you .
40006007	“ When you pray , do not use a lot of meaningless words , as the pagans do , who think that their gods will hear them because their prayers are long .
40006008	Do not be like them . Your Father already knows what you need before you ask him .
40006009	This , then , is how you should pray : ‘ Our Father in heaven : May your holy name be honored ;
40006010	may your Kingdom come ; may your will be done on earth as it is in heaven .
40006011	Give us today the food we need .
40006012	Forgive us the wrongs we have done , as we forgive the wrongs that others have done to us .
40006013	Do not bring us to hard testing , but keep us safe from the Evil One . ’
40006014	“ If you forgive others the wrongs they have done to you , your Father in heaven will also forgive you .
40006015	But if you do not forgive others , then your Father will not forgive the wrongs you have done .
40006016	“ And when you fast , do not put on a sad face as the hypocrites do . They neglect their appearance so that everyone will see that they are fasting . I assure you , they have already been paid in full .
40006017	When you go without food , wash your face and comb your hair ,
40006018	so that others cannot know that you are fasting—only your Father , who is unseen , will know . And your Father , who sees what you do in private , will reward you .
40006019	“ Do not store up riches for yourselves here on earth , where moths and rust destroy , and robbers break in and steal .
40006020	Instead , store up riches for yourselves in heaven , where moths and rust cannot destroy , and robbers cannot break in and steal .
40006021	For your heart will always be where your riches are .
40006022	“ The eyes are like a lamp for the body . If your eyes are sound , your whole body will be full of light ;
40006023	but if your eyes are no good , your body will be in darkness . So if the light in you is darkness , how terribly dark it will be !
40006024	“ You cannot be a slave of two masters ; you will hate one and love the other ; you will be loyal to one and despise the other . You cannot serve both God and money .
40006025	“ This is why I tell you : do not be worried about the food and drink you need in order to stay alive , or about clothes for your body . After all , isn't life worth more than food ? And isn't the body worth more than clothes ?
40006026	Look at the birds : they do not plant seeds , gather a harvest and put it in barns ; yet your Father in heaven takes care of them ! Aren't you worth much more than birds ?
40006027	Can any of you live a bit longer by worrying about it ?
40006028	“ And why worry about clothes ? Look how the wild flowers grow : they do not work or make clothes for themselves .
40006029	But I tell you that not even King Solomon with all his wealth had clothes as beautiful as one of these flowers .
40006030	It is God who clothes the wild grass—grass that is here today and gone tomorrow , burned up in the oven . Won't he be all the more sure to clothe you ? What little faith you have !
40006031	“ So do not start worrying : ‘ Where will my food come from ? or my drink ? or my clothes ? ’
40006032	( These are the things the pagans are always concerned about . ) Your Father in heaven knows that you need all these things .
40006033	Instead , be concerned above everything else with the Kingdom of God and with what he requires of you , and he will provide you with all these other things .
40006034	So do not worry about tomorrow ; it will have enough worries of its own . There is no need to add to the troubles each day brings .
40007001	“ Do not judge others , so that God will not judge you ,
40007002	for God will judge you in the same way you judge others , and he will apply to you the same rules you apply to others .
40007003	Why , then , do you look at the speck in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the log in your own eye ?
40007004	How dare you say to your brother , ‘ Please , let me take that speck out of your eye , ’ when you have a log in your own eye ?
40007005	You hypocrite ! First take the log out of your own eye , and then you will be able to see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye .
40007006	“ Do not give what is holy to dogs—they will only turn and attack you . Do not throw your pearls in front of pigs—they will only trample them underfoot .
40007007	“ Ask , and you will receive ; seek , and you will find ; knock , and the door will be opened to you .
40007008	For everyone who asks will receive , and anyone who seeks will find , and the door will be opened to those who knock .
40007009	Would any of you who are fathers give your son a stone when he asks for bread ?
40007010	Or would you give him a snake when he asks for a fish ?
40007011	As bad as you are , you know how to give good things to your children . How much more , then , will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask him !
40007012	“ Do for others what you want them to do for you : this is the meaning of the Law of Moses and of the teachings of the prophets .
40007013	“ Go in through the narrow gate , because the gate to hell is wide and the road that leads to it is easy , and there are many who travel it .
40007014	But the gate to life is narrow and the way that leads to it is hard , and there are few people who find it .
40007015	“ Be on your guard against false prophets ; they come to you looking like sheep on the outside , but on the inside they are really like wild wolves .
40007016	You will know them by what they do . Thorn bushes do not bear grapes , and briers do not bear figs .
40007017	A healthy tree bears good fruit , but a poor tree bears bad fruit .
40007018	A healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit , and a poor tree cannot bear good fruit .
40007019	And any tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown in the fire .
40007020	So then , you will know the false prophets by what they do .
40007021	“ Not everyone who calls me ‘ Lord , Lord ’ will enter the Kingdom of heaven , but only those who do what my Father in heaven wants them to do .
40007022	When the Judgment Day comes , many will say to me , ‘ Lord , Lord ! In your name we spoke God's message , by your name we drove out many demons and performed many miracles ! ’
40007023	Then I will say to them , ‘ I never knew you . Get away from me , you wicked people ! ’
40007024	“ So then , anyone who hears these words of mine and obeys them is like a wise man who built his house on rock .
40007025	The rain poured down , the rivers flooded over , and the wind blew hard against that house . But it did not fall , because it was built on rock .
40007026	“ But anyone who hears these words of mine and does not obey them is like a foolish man who built his house on sand .
40007027	The rain poured down , the rivers flooded over , the wind blew hard against that house , and it fell . And what a terrible fall that was ! ”
40007028	When Jesus finished saying these things , the crowd was amazed at the way he taught .
40007029	He wasn't like the teachers of the Law ; instead , he taught with authority .
40008001	When Jesus came down from the hill , large crowds followed him .
40008002	Then a man suffering from a dreaded skin disease came to him , knelt down before him , and said , “ Sir , if you want to , you can make me clean . ”
40008003	Jesus reached out and touched him . “ I do want to , ” he answered . “ Be clean ! ” At once the man was healed of his disease .
40008004	Then Jesus said to him , “ Listen ! Don't tell anyone , but go straight to the priest and let him examine you ; then in order to prove to everyone that you are cured , offer the sacrifice that Moses ordered . ”
40008005	When Jesus entered Capernaum , a Roman officer met him and begged for help :
40008006	“ Sir , my servant is sick in bed at home , unable to move and suffering terribly . ”
40008007	“ I will go and make him well , ” Jesus said .
40008008	“ Oh no , sir , ” answered the officer . “ I do not deserve to have you come into my house . Just give the order , and my servant will get well .
40008009	I , too , am a man under the authority of superior officers , and I have soldiers under me . I order this one , ‘ Go ! ’ and he goes ; and I order that one , ‘ Come ! ’ and he comes ; and I order my slave , ‘ Do this ! ’ and he does it . ”
40008010	When Jesus heard this , he was surprised and said to the people following him , “ I tell you , I have never found anyone in Israel with faith like this .
40008011	I assure you that many will come from the east and the west and sit down with Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob at the feast in the Kingdom of heaven .
40008012	But those who should be in the Kingdom will be thrown out into the darkness , where they will cry and gnash their teeth . ”
40008013	Then Jesus said to the officer , “ Go home , and what you believe will be done for you . ” And the officer's servant was healed that very moment .
40008014	Jesus went to Peter's home , and there he saw Peter's mother-in-law sick in bed with a fever .
40008015	He touched her hand ; the fever left her , and she got up and began to wait on him .
40008016	When evening came , people brought to Jesus many who had demons in them . Jesus drove out the evil spirits with a word and healed all who were sick .
40008017	He did this to make come true what the prophet Isaiah had said , “ He himself took our sickness and carried away our diseases . ”
40008018	When Jesus noticed the crowd around him , he ordered his disciples to go to the other side of the lake .
40008019	A teacher of the Law came to him . “ Teacher , ” he said , “ I am ready to go with you wherever you go . ”
40008020	Jesus answered him , “ Foxes have holes , and birds have nests , but the Son of Man has no place to lie down and rest . ”
40008021	Another man , who was a disciple , said , “ Sir , first let me go back and bury my father . ”
40008022	“ Follow me , ” Jesus answered , “ and let the dead bury their own dead . ”
40008023	Jesus got into a boat , and his disciples went with him .
40008024	Suddenly a fierce storm hit the lake , and the boat was in danger of sinking . But Jesus was asleep .
40008025	The disciples went to him and woke him up . “ Save us , Lord ! ” they said . “ We are about to die ! ”
40008026	“ Why are you so frightened ? ” Jesus answered . “ What little faith you have ! ” Then he got up and ordered the winds and the waves to stop , and there was a great calm .
40008027	Everyone was amazed . “ What kind of man is this ? ” they said . “ Even the winds and the waves obey him ! ”
40008028	When Jesus came to the territory of Gadara on the other side of the lake , he was met by two men who came out of the burial caves there . These men had demons in them and were so fierce that no one dared travel on that road .
40008029	At once they screamed , “ What do you want with us , you Son of God ? Have you come to punish us before the right time ? ”
40008030	Not far away there was a large herd of pigs feeding .
40008031	So the demons begged Jesus , “ If you are going to drive us out , send us into that herd of pigs . ”
40008032	“ Go , ” Jesus told them ; so they left and went off into the pigs . The whole herd rushed down the side of the cliff into the lake and was drowned .
40008033	The men who had been taking care of the pigs ran away and went into the town , where they told the whole story and what had happened to the men with the demons .
40008034	So everyone from the town went out to meet Jesus ; and when they saw him , they begged him to leave their territory .
40009001	Jesus got into the boat and went back across the lake to his own town ,
40009002	where some people brought to him a paralyzed man , lying on a bed . When Jesus saw how much faith they had , he said to the paralyzed man , “ Courage , my son ! Your sins are forgiven . ”
40009003	Then some teachers of the Law said to themselves , “ This man is speaking blasphemy ! ”
40009004	Jesus perceived what they were thinking , and so he said , “ Why are you thinking such evil things ?
40009005	Is it easier to say , ‘ Your sins are forgiven , ’ or to say , ‘ Get up and walk ’ ?
40009006	I will prove to you , then , that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins . ” So he said to the paralyzed man , “ Get up , pick up your bed , and go home ! ”
40009007	The man got up and went home .
40009008	When the people saw it , they were afraid , and praised God for giving such authority to people .
40009009	Jesus left that place , and as he walked along , he saw a tax collector , named Matthew , sitting in his office . He said to him , “ Follow me . ” Matthew got up and followed him .
40009010	While Jesus was having a meal in Matthew's house , many tax collectors and other outcasts came and joined Jesus and his disciples at the table .
40009011	Some Pharisees saw this and asked his disciples , “ Why does your teacher eat with such people ? ”
40009012	Jesus heard them and answered , “ People who are well do not need a doctor , but only those who are sick .
40009013	Go and find out what is meant by the scripture that says : ‘ It is kindness that I want , not animal sacrifices . ’ I have not come to call respectable people , but outcasts . ”
40009014	Then the followers of John the Baptist came to Jesus , asking , “ Why is it that we and the Pharisees fast often , but your disciples don't fast at all ? ”
40009015	Jesus answered , “ Do you expect the guests at a wedding party to be sad as long as the bridegroom is with them ? Of course not ! But the day will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them , and then they will fast .
40009016	“ No one patches up an old coat with a piece of new cloth , for the new patch will shrink and make an even bigger hole in the coat .
40009017	Nor does anyone pour new wine into used wineskins , for the skins will burst , the wine will pour out , and the skins will be ruined . Instead , new wine is poured into fresh wineskins , and both will keep in good condition . ”
40009018	While Jesus was saying this , a Jewish official came to him , knelt down before him , and said , “ My daughter has just died ; but come and place your hands on her , and she will live . ”
40009019	So Jesus got up and followed him , and his disciples went along with him .
40009020	A woman who had suffered from severe bleeding for twelve years came up behind Jesus and touched the edge of his cloak .
40009021	She said to herself , “ If only I touch his cloak , I will get well . ”
40009022	Jesus turned around and saw her , and said , “ Courage , my daughter ! Your faith has made you well . ” At that very moment the woman became well .
40009023	Then Jesus went into the official's house . When he saw the musicians for the funeral and the people all stirred up ,
40009024	he said , “ Get out , everybody ! The little girl is not dead—she is only sleeping ! ” Then they all started making fun of him .
40009025	But as soon as the people had been put out , Jesus went into the girl's room and took hold of her hand , and she got up .
40009026	The news about this spread all over that part of the country .
40009027	Jesus left that place , and as he walked along , two blind men started following him . “ Have mercy on us , Son of David ! ” they shouted .
40009028	When Jesus had gone indoors , the two blind men came to him , and he asked them , “ Do you believe that I can heal you ? ” “ Yes , sir ! ” they answered .
40009029	Then Jesus touched their eyes and said , “ Let it happen , then , just as you believe ! ” —
40009030	and their sight was restored . Jesus spoke sternly to them , “ Don't tell this to anyone ! ”
40009031	But they left and spread the news about Jesus all over that part of the country .
40009032	As the men were leaving , some people brought to Jesus a man who could not talk because he had a demon .
40009033	But as soon as the demon was driven out , the man started talking , and everyone was amazed . “ We have never seen anything like this in Israel ! ” they exclaimed .
40009034	But the Pharisees said , “ It is the chief of the demons who gives Jesus the power to drive out demons . ”
40009035	Jesus went around visiting all the towns and villages . He taught in the synagogues , preached the Good News about the Kingdom , and healed people with every kind of disease and sickness .
40009036	As he saw the crowds , his heart was filled with pity for them , because they were worried and helpless , like sheep without a shepherd .
40009037	So he said to his disciples , “ The harvest is large , but there are few workers to gather it in .
40009038	Pray to the owner of the harvest that he will send out workers to gather in his harvest . ”
40010001	Jesus called his twelve disciples together and gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every disease and every sickness .
40010002	These are the names of the twelve apostles : first , Simon ( called Peter ) and his brother Andrew ; James and his brother John , the sons of Zebedee ;
40010003	Philip and Bartholomew ; Thomas and Matthew , the tax collector ; James son of Alphaeus , and Thaddaeus ;
40010004	Simon the Patriot , and Judas Iscariot , who betrayed Jesus .
40010005	These twelve men were sent out by Jesus with the following instructions : “ Do not go to any Gentile territory or any Samaritan towns .
40010006	Instead , you are to go to the lost sheep of the people of Israel .
40010007	Go and preach , ‘ The Kingdom of heaven is near ! ’
40010008	Heal the sick , bring the dead back to life , heal those who suffer from dreaded skin diseases , and drive out demons . You have received without paying , so give without being paid .
40010009	Do not carry any gold , silver , or copper money in your pockets ;
40010010	do not carry a beggar's bag for the trip or an extra shirt or shoes or a walking stick . Workers should be given what they need .
40010011	“ When you come to a town or village , go in and look for someone who is willing to welcome you , and stay with him until you leave that place .
40010012	When you go into a house , say , ‘ Peace be with you . ’
40010013	If the people in that house welcome you , let your greeting of peace remain ; but if they do not welcome you , then take back your greeting .
40010014	And if some home or town will not welcome you or listen to you , then leave that place and shake the dust off your feet .
40010015	I assure you that on the Judgment Day God will show more mercy to the people of Sodom and Gomorrah than to the people of that town !
40010016	“ Listen ! I am sending you out just like sheep to a pack of wolves . You must be as cautious as snakes and as gentle as doves .
40010017	Watch out , for there will be those who will arrest you and take you to court , and they will whip you in the synagogues .
40010018	For my sake you will be brought to trial before rulers and kings , to tell the Good News to them and to the Gentiles .
40010019	When they bring you to trial , do not worry about what you are going to say or how you will say it ; when the time comes , you will be given what you will say .
40010020	For the words you will speak will not be yours ; they will come from the Spirit of your Father speaking through you .
40010021	“ People will hand over their own brothers to be put to death , and fathers will do the same to their children ; children will turn against their parents and have them put to death .
40010022	Everyone will hate you because of me . But whoever holds out to the end will be saved .
40010023	When they persecute you in one town , run away to another one . I assure you that you will not finish your work in all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes .
40010024	“ No pupil is greater than his teacher ; no slave is greater than his master .
40010025	So a pupil should be satisfied to become like his teacher , and a slave like his master . If the head of the family is called Beelzebul , the members of the family will be called even worse names !
40010026	“ So do not be afraid of people . Whatever is now covered up will be uncovered , and every secret will be made known .
40010027	What I am telling you in the dark you must repeat in broad daylight , and what you have heard in private you must announce from the housetops .
40010028	Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul ; rather be afraid of God , who can destroy both body and soul in hell .
40010029	For only a penny you can buy two sparrows , yet not one sparrow falls to the ground without your Father's consent .
40010030	As for you , even the hairs of your head have all been counted .
40010031	So do not be afraid ; you are worth much more than many sparrows !
40010032	“ Those who declare publicly that they belong to me , I will do the same for them before my Father in heaven .
40010033	But those who reject me publicly , I will reject before my Father in heaven .
40010034	“ Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the world . No , I did not come to bring peace , but a sword .
40010035	I came to set sons against their fathers , daughters against their mothers , daughters-in-law against their mothers-in-law ;
40010036	your worst enemies will be the members of your own family .
40010037	“ Those who love their father or mother more than me are not fit to be my disciples ; those who love their son or daughter more than me are not fit to be my disciples .
40010038	Those who do not take up their cross and follow in my steps are not fit to be my disciples .
40010039	Those who try to gain their own life will lose it ; but those who lose their life for my sake will gain it .
40010040	“ Whoever welcomes you welcomes me ; and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me .
40010041	Whoever welcomes God's messenger because he is God's messenger , will share in his reward . And whoever welcomes a good man because he is good , will share in his reward .
40010042	You can be sure that whoever gives even a drink of cold water to one of the least of these my followers because he is my follower , will certainly receive a reward . ”
40011001	When Jesus finished giving these instructions to his twelve disciples , he left that place and went off to teach and preach in the towns near there .
40011002	When John the Baptist heard in prison about the things that Christ was doing , he sent some of his disciples to him .
40011003	“ Tell us , ” they asked Jesus , “ are you the one John said was going to come , or should we expect someone else ? ”
40011004	Jesus answered , “ Go back and tell John what you are hearing and seeing :
40011005	the blind can see , the lame can walk , those who suffer from dreaded skin diseases are made clean , the deaf hear , the dead are brought back to life , and the Good News is preached to the poor .
40011006	How happy are those who have no doubts about me ! ”
40011007	While John's disciples were leaving , Jesus spoke about him to the crowds : “ When you went out to John in the desert , what did you expect to see ? A blade of grass bending in the wind ?
40011008	What did you go out to see ? A man dressed up in fancy clothes ? People who dress like that live in palaces !
40011009	Tell me , what did you go out to see ? A prophet ? Yes indeed , but you saw much more than a prophet .
40011010	For John is the one of whom the scripture says : ‘ God said , I will send my messenger ahead of you to open the way for you . ’
40011011	I assure you that John the Baptist is greater than anyone who has ever lived . But the one who is least in the Kingdom of heaven is greater than John .
40011012	From the time John preached his message until this very day the Kingdom of heaven has suffered violent attacks , and violent men try to seize it .
40011013	Until the time of John all the prophets and the Law of Moses spoke about the Kingdom ;
40011014	and if you are willing to believe their message , John is Elijah , whose coming was predicted .
40011015	Listen , then , if you have ears !
40011016	“ Now , to what can I compare the people of this day ? They are like children sitting in the marketplace . One group shouts to the other ,
40011017	‘ We played wedding music for you , but you wouldn't dance ! We sang funeral songs , but you wouldn't cry ! ’
40011018	When John came , he fasted and drank no wine , and everyone said , ‘ He has a demon in him ! ’
40011019	When the Son of Man came , he ate and drank , and everyone said , ‘ Look at this man ! He is a glutton and wine drinker , a friend of tax collectors and other outcasts ! ’ God's wisdom , however , is shown to be true by its results . ”
40011020	The people in the towns where Jesus had performed most of his miracles did not turn from their sins , so he reproached those towns .
40011021	“ How terrible it will be for you , Chorazin ! How terrible for you too , Bethsaida ! If the miracles which were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon , the people there would have long ago put on sackcloth and sprinkled ashes on themselves , to show that they had turned from their sins !
40011022	I assure you that on the Judgment Day God will show more mercy to the people of Tyre and Sidon than to you !
40011023	And as for you , Capernaum ! Did you want to lift yourself up to heaven ? You will be thrown down to hell ! If the miracles which were performed in you had been performed in Sodom , it would still be in existence today !
40011024	You can be sure that on the Judgment Day God will show more mercy to Sodom than to you ! ”
40011025	At that time Jesus said , “ Father , Lord of heaven and earth ! I thank you because you have shown to the unlearned what you have hidden from the wise and learned .
40011026	Yes , Father , this was how you were pleased to have it happen .
40011027	“ My Father has given me all things . No one knows the Son except the Father , and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him .
40011028	“ Come to me , all of you who are tired from carrying heavy loads , and I will give you rest .
40011029	Take my yoke and put it on you , and learn from me , because I am gentle and humble in spirit ; and you will find rest .
40011030	For the yoke I will give you is easy , and the load I will put on you is light . ”
40012001	Not long afterward Jesus was walking through some wheat fields on a Sabbath . His disciples were hungry , so they began to pick heads of wheat and eat the grain .
40012002	When the Pharisees saw this , they said to Jesus , “ Look , it is against our Law for your disciples to do this on the Sabbath ! ”
40012003	Jesus answered , “ Have you never read what David did that time when he and his men were hungry ?
40012004	He went into the house of God , and he and his men ate the bread offered to God , even though it was against the Law for them to eat it—only the priests were allowed to eat that bread .
40012005	Or have you not read in the Law of Moses that every Sabbath the priests in the Temple actually break the Sabbath law , yet they are not guilty ?
40012006	I tell you that there is something here greater than the Temple .
40012007	The scripture says , ‘ It is kindness that I want , not animal sacrifices . ’ If you really knew what this means , you would not condemn people who are not guilty ;
40012008	for the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath . ”
40012009	Jesus left that place and went to a synagogue ,
40012010	where there was a man who had a paralyzed hand . Some people were there who wanted to accuse Jesus of doing wrong , so they asked him , “ Is it against our Law to heal on the Sabbath ? ”
40012011	Jesus answered , “ What if one of you has a sheep and it falls into a deep hole on the Sabbath ? Will you not take hold of it and lift it out ?
40012012	And a human being is worth much more than a sheep ! So then , our Law does allow us to help someone on the Sabbath . ”
40012013	Then he said to the man with the paralyzed hand , “ Stretch out your hand . ” He stretched it out , and it became well again , just like the other one .
40012014	Then the Pharisees left and made plans to kill Jesus .
40012015	When Jesus heard about the plot against him , he went away from that place ; and large crowds followed him . He healed all the sick
40012016	and gave them orders not to tell others about him .
40012017	He did this so as to make come true what God had said through the prophet Isaiah :
40012018	“ Here is my servant , whom I have chosen , the one I love , and with whom I am pleased . I will send my Spirit upon him , and he will announce my judgment to the nations .
40012019	He will not argue or shout , or make loud speeches in the streets .
40012020	He will not break off a bent reed , nor put out a flickering lamp . He will persist until he causes justice to triumph ,
40012021	and on him all peoples will put their hope . ”
40012022	Then some people brought to Jesus a man who was blind and could not talk because he had a demon . Jesus healed the man , so that he was able to talk and see .
40012023	The crowds were all amazed at what Jesus had done . “ Could he be the Son of David ? ” they asked .
40012024	When the Pharisees heard this , they replied , “ He drives out demons only because their ruler Beelzebul gives him power to do so . ”
40012025	Jesus knew what they were thinking , and so he said to them , “ Any country that divides itself into groups which fight each other will not last very long . And any town or family that divides itself into groups which fight each other will fall apart .
40012026	So if one group is fighting another in Satan's kingdom , this means that it is already divided into groups and will soon fall apart !
40012027	You say that I drive out demons because Beelzebul gives me the power to do so . Well , then , who gives your followers the power to drive them out ? What your own followers do proves that you are wrong !
40012028	No , it is not Beelzebul , but God's Spirit , who gives me the power to drive out demons , which proves that the Kingdom of God has already come upon you .
40012029	“ No one can break into a strong man's house and take away his belongings unless he first ties up the strong man ; then he can plunder his house .
40012030	“ Anyone who is not for me is really against me ; anyone who does not help me gather is really scattering .
40012031	For this reason I tell you : people can be forgiven any sin and any evil thing they say ; but whoever says evil things against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven .
40012032	Anyone who says something against the Son of Man can be forgiven ; but whoever says something against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven—now or ever .
40012033	“ To have good fruit you must have a healthy tree ; if you have a poor tree , you will have bad fruit . A tree is known by the kind of fruit it bears .
40012034	You snakes—how can you say good things when you are evil ? For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of .
40012035	A good person brings good things out of a treasure of good things ; a bad person brings bad things out of a treasure of bad things .
40012036	“ You can be sure that on the Judgment Day you will have to give account of every useless word you have ever spoken .
40012037	Your words will be used to judge you—to declare you either innocent or guilty . ”
40012038	Then some teachers of the Law and some Pharisees spoke up . “ Teacher , ” they said , “ we want to see you perform a miracle . ”
40012039	“ How evil and godless are the people of this day ! ” Jesus exclaimed . “ You ask me for a miracle ? No ! The only miracle you will be given is the miracle of the prophet Jonah .
40012040	In the same way that Jonah spent three days and nights in the big fish , so will the Son of Man spend three days and nights in the depths of the earth .
40012041	On the Judgment Day the people of Nineveh will stand up and accuse you , because they turned from their sins when they heard Jonah preach ; and I tell you that there is something here greater than Jonah !
40012042	On the Judgment Day the Queen of Sheba will stand up and accuse you , because she traveled all the way from her country to listen to King Solomon's wise teaching ; and I assure you that there is something here greater than Solomon !
40012043	“ When an evil spirit goes out of a person , it travels over dry country looking for a place to rest . If it can't find one ,
40012044	it says to itself , ‘ I will go back to my house . ’ So it goes back and finds the house empty , clean , and all fixed up .
40012045	Then it goes out and brings along seven other spirits even worse than itself , and they come and live there . So when it is all over , that person is in worse shape than at the beginning . This is what will happen to the evil people of this day . ”
40012046	Jesus was still talking to the people when his mother and brothers arrived . They stood outside , asking to speak with him .
40012047	So one of the people there said to him , “ Look , your mother and brothers are standing outside , and they want to speak with you . ”
40012048	Jesus answered , “ Who is my mother ? Who are my brothers ? ”
40012049	Then he pointed to his disciples and said , “ Look ! Here are my mother and my brothers !
40012050	Whoever does what my Father in heaven wants is my brother , my sister , and my mother . ”
40013001	That same day Jesus left the house and went to the lakeside , where he sat down to teach .
40013002	The crowd that gathered around him was so large that he got into a boat and sat in it , while the crowd stood on the shore .
40013003	He used parables to tell them many things . “ Once there was a man who went out to sow grain .
40013004	As he scattered the seed in the field , some of it fell along the path , and the birds came and ate it up .
40013005	Some of it fell on rocky ground , where there was little soil . The seeds soon sprouted , because the soil wasn't deep .
40013006	But when the sun came up , it burned the young plants ; and because the roots had not grown deep enough , the plants soon dried up .
40013007	Some of the seed fell among thorn bushes , which grew up and choked the plants .
40013008	But some seeds fell in good soil , and the plants bore grain : some had one hundred grains , others sixty , and others thirty . ”
40013009	And Jesus concluded , “ Listen , then , if you have ears ! ”
40013010	Then the disciples came to Jesus and asked him , “ Why do you use parables when you talk to the people ? ”
40013011	Jesus answered , “ The knowledge about the secrets of the Kingdom of heaven has been given to you , but not to them .
40013012	For the person who has something will be given more , so that he will have more than enough ; but the person who has nothing will have taken away from him even the little he has .
40013013	The reason I use parables in talking to them is that they look , but do not see , and they listen , but do not hear or understand .
40013014	So the prophecy of Isaiah applies to them : ‘ This people will listen and listen , but not understand ; they will look and look , but not see ,
40013015	because their minds are dull , and they have stopped up their ears and have closed their eyes . Otherwise , their eyes would see , their ears would hear , their minds would understand , and they would turn to me , says God , and I would heal them . ’
40013016	“ As for you , how fortunate you are ! Your eyes see and your ears hear .
40013017	I assure you that many prophets and many of God's people wanted very much to see what you see , but they could not , and to hear what you hear , but they did not .
40013018	“ Listen , then , and learn what the parable of the sower means .
40013019	Those who hear the message about the Kingdom but do not understand it are like the seeds that fell along the path . The Evil One comes and snatches away what was sown in them .
40013020	The seeds that fell on rocky ground stand for those who receive the message gladly as soon as they hear it .
40013021	But it does not sink deep into them , and they don't last long . So when trouble or persecution comes because of the message , they give up at once .
40013022	The seeds that fell among thorn bushes stand for those who hear the message ; but the worries about this life and the love for riches choke the message , and they don't bear fruit .
40013023	And the seeds sown in the good soil stand for those who hear the message and understand it : they bear fruit , some as much as one hundred , others sixty , and others thirty . ”
40013024	Jesus told them another parable : “ The Kingdom of heaven is like this . A man sowed good seed in his field .
40013025	One night , when everyone was asleep , an enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away .
40013026	When the plants grew and the heads of grain began to form , then the weeds showed up .
40013027	The man's servants came to him and said , ‘ Sir , it was good seed you sowed in your field ; where did the weeds come from ? ’
40013028	‘ It was some enemy who did this , ’ he answered . ‘ Do you want us to go and pull up the weeds ? ’ they asked him .
40013029	‘ No , ’ he answered , ‘ because as you gather the weeds you might pull up some of the wheat along with them .
40013030	Let the wheat and the weeds both grow together until harvest . Then I will tell the harvest workers to pull up the weeds first , tie them in bundles and burn them , and then to gather in the wheat and put it in my barn . ’ ”
40013031	Jesus told them another parable : “ The Kingdom of heaven is like this . A man takes a mustard seed and sows it in his field .
40013032	It is the smallest of all seeds , but when it grows up , it is the biggest of all plants . It becomes a tree , so that birds come and make their nests in its branches . ”
40013033	Jesus told them still another parable : “ The Kingdom of heaven is like this . A woman takes some yeast and mixes it with a bushel of flour until the whole batch of dough rises . ”
40013034	Jesus used parables to tell all these things to the crowds ; he would not say a thing to them without using a parable .
40013035	He did this to make come true what the prophet had said , “ I will use parables when I speak to them ; I will tell them things unknown since the creation of the world . ”
40013036	When Jesus had left the crowd and gone indoors , his disciples came to him and said , “ Tell us what the parable about the weeds in the field means . ”
40013037	Jesus answered , “ The man who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man ;
40013038	the field is the world ; the good seed is the people who belong to the Kingdom ; the weeds are the people who belong to the Evil One ;
40013039	and the enemy who sowed the weeds is the Devil . The harvest is the end of the age , and the harvest workers are angels .
40013040	Just as the weeds are gathered up and burned in the fire , so the same thing will happen at the end of the age :
40013041	the Son of Man will send out his angels to gather up out of his Kingdom all those who cause people to sin and all others who do evil things ,
40013042	and they will throw them into the fiery furnace , where they will cry and gnash their teeth .
40013043	Then God's people will shine like the sun in their Father's Kingdom . Listen , then , if you have ears !
40013044	“ The Kingdom of heaven is like this . A man happens to find a treasure hidden in a field . He covers it up again , and is so happy that he goes and sells everything he has , and then goes back and buys that field .
40013045	“ Also , the Kingdom of heaven is like this . A man is looking for fine pearls ,
40013046	and when he finds one that is unusually fine , he goes and sells everything he has , and buys that pearl .
40013047	“ Also , the Kingdom of heaven is like this . Some fishermen throw their net out in the lake and catch all kinds of fish .
40013048	When the net is full , they pull it to shore and sit down to divide the fish : the good ones go into the buckets , the worthless ones are thrown away .
40013049	It will be like this at the end of the age : the angels will go out and gather up the evil people from among the good
40013050	and will throw them into the fiery furnace , where they will cry and gnash their teeth .
40013051	“ Do you understand these things ? ” Jesus asked them . “ Yes , ” they answered .
40013052	So he replied , “ This means , then , that every teacher of the Law who becomes a disciple in the Kingdom of heaven is like a homeowner who takes new and old things out of his storage room . ”
40013053	When Jesus finished telling these parables , he left that place
40013054	and went back to his hometown . He taught in the synagogue , and those who heard him were amazed . “ Where did he get such wisdom ? ” they asked . “ And what about his miracles ?
40013055	Isn't he the carpenter's son ? Isn't Mary his mother , and aren't James , Joseph , Simon , and Judas his brothers ?
40013056	Aren't all his sisters living here ? Where did he get all this ? ”
40013057	And so they rejected him . Jesus said to them , “ A prophet is respected everywhere except in his hometown and by his own family . ”
40013058	Because they did not have faith , he did not perform many miracles there .
40014001	At that time Herod , the ruler of Galilee , heard about Jesus .
40014002	“ He is really John the Baptist , who has come back to life , ” he told his officials . “ That is why he has this power to perform miracles . ”
40014003	For Herod had earlier ordered John's arrest , and he had him tied up and put in prison . He had done this because of Herodias , his brother Philip's wife .
40014004	For some time John the Baptist had told Herod , “ It isn't right for you to be married to Herodias ! ”
40014005	Herod wanted to kill him , but he was afraid of the Jewish people , because they considered John to be a prophet .
40014006	On Herod's birthday the daughter of Herodias danced in front of the whole group . Herod was so pleased
40014007	that he promised her , “ I swear that I will give you anything you ask for ! ”
40014008	At her mother's suggestion she asked him , “ Give me here and now the head of John the Baptist on a plate ! ”
40014009	The king was sad , but because of the promise he had made in front of all his guests he gave orders that her wish be granted .
40014010	So he had John beheaded in prison .
40014011	The head was brought in on a plate and given to the girl , who took it to her mother .
40014012	John's disciples came , carried away his body , and buried it ; then they went and told Jesus .
40014013	When Jesus heard the news about John , he left there in a boat and went to a lonely place by himself . The people heard about it , and so they left their towns and followed him by land .
40014014	Jesus got out of the boat , and when he saw the large crowd , his heart was filled with pity for them , and he healed their sick .
40014015	That evening his disciples came to him and said , “ It is already very late , and this is a lonely place . Send the people away and let them go to the villages to buy food for themselves . ”
40014016	“ They don't have to leave , ” answered Jesus . “ You yourselves give them something to eat ! ”
40014017	“ All we have here are five loaves and two fish , ” they replied .
40014018	“ Then bring them here to me , ” Jesus said .
40014019	He ordered the people to sit down on the grass ; then he took the five loaves and the two fish , looked up to heaven , and gave thanks to God . He broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples , and the disciples gave them to the people .
40014020	Everyone ate and had enough . Then the disciples took up twelve baskets full of what was left over .
40014021	The number of men who ate was about five thousand , not counting the women and children .
40014022	Then Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side of the lake , while he sent the people away .
40014023	After sending the people away , he went up a hill by himself to pray . When evening came , Jesus was there alone ;
40014024	and by this time the boat was far out in the lake , tossed about by the waves , because the wind was blowing against it .
40014025	Between three and six o'clock in the morning Jesus came to the disciples , walking on the water .
40014026	When they saw him walking on the water , they were terrified . “ It's a ghost ! ” they said , and screamed with fear .
40014027	Jesus spoke to them at once . “ Courage ! ” he said . “ It is I . Don't be afraid ! ”
40014028	Then Peter spoke up . “ Lord , if it is really you , order me to come out on the water to you . ”
40014029	“ Come ! ” answered Jesus . So Peter got out of the boat and started walking on the water to Jesus .
40014030	But when he noticed the strong wind , he was afraid and started to sink down in the water . “ Save me , Lord ! ” he cried .
40014031	At once Jesus reached out and grabbed hold of him and said , “ What little faith you have ! Why did you doubt ? ”
40014032	They both got into the boat , and the wind died down .
40014033	Then the disciples in the boat worshiped Jesus . “ Truly you are the Son of God ! ” they exclaimed .
40014034	They crossed the lake and came to land at Gennesaret ,
40014035	where the people recognized Jesus . So they sent for the sick people in all the surrounding country and brought them to Jesus .
40014036	They begged him to let the sick at least touch the edge of his cloak ; and all who touched it were made well .
40015001	Then some Pharisees and teachers of the Law came from Jerusalem to Jesus and asked him ,
40015002	“ Why is it that your disciples disobey the teaching handed down by our ancestors ? They don't wash their hands in the proper way before they eat ! ”
40015003	Jesus answered , “ And why do you disobey God's command and follow your own teaching ?
40015004	For God said , ‘ Respect your father and your mother , ’ and ‘ If you curse your father or your mother , you are to be put to death . ’
40015005	But you teach that if people have something they could use to help their father or mother , but say , ‘ This belongs to God , ’
40015006	they do not need to honor their father . In this way you disregard God's command , in order to follow your own teaching .
40015007	You hypocrites ! How right Isaiah was when he prophesied about you !
40015008	‘ These people , says God , honor me with their words , but their heart is really far away from me .
40015009	It is no use for them to worship me , because they teach human rules as though they were my laws ! ’ ”
40015010	Then Jesus called the crowd to him and said to them , “ Listen and understand !
40015011	It is not what goes into your mouth that makes you ritually unclean ; rather , what comes out of it makes you unclean . ”
40015012	Then the disciples came to him and said , “ Do you know that the Pharisees had their feelings hurt by what you said ? ”
40015013	“ Every plant which my Father in heaven did not plant will be pulled up , ” answered Jesus .
40015014	“ Don't worry about them ! They are blind leaders of the blind ; and when one blind man leads another , both fall into a ditch . ”
40015015	Peter spoke up , “ Explain this saying to us . ”
40015016	Jesus said to them , “ You are still no more intelligent than the others .
40015017	Don't you understand ? Anything that goes into your mouth goes into your stomach and then on out of your body .
40015018	But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart , and these are the things that make you ritually unclean .
40015019	For from your heart come the evil ideas which lead you to kill , commit adultery , and do other immoral things ; to rob , lie , and slander others .
40015020	These are the things that make you unclean . But to eat without washing your hands as they say you should—this doesn't make you unclean . ”
40015021	Jesus left that place and went off to the territory near the cities of Tyre and Sidon .
40015022	A Canaanite woman who lived in that region came to him . “ Son of David ! ” she cried out . “ Have mercy on me , sir ! My daughter has a demon and is in a terrible condition . ”
40015023	But Jesus did not say a word to her . His disciples came to him and begged him , “ Send her away ! She is following us and making all this noise ! ”
40015024	Then Jesus replied , “ I have been sent only to the lost sheep of the people of Israel . ”
40015025	At this the woman came and fell at his feet . “ Help me , sir ! ” she said .
40015026	Jesus answered , “ It isn't right to take the children's food and throw it to the dogs . ”
40015027	“ That's true , sir , ” she answered , “ but even the dogs eat the leftovers that fall from their masters' table . ”
40015028	So Jesus answered her , “ You are a woman of great faith ! What you want will be done for you . ” And at that very moment her daughter was healed .
40015029	Jesus left there and went along by Lake Galilee . He climbed a hill and sat down .
40015030	Large crowds came to him , bringing with them the lame , the blind , the crippled , the dumb , and many other sick people , whom they placed at Jesus' feet ; and he healed them .
40015031	The people were amazed as they saw the dumb speaking , the crippled made whole , the lame walking , and the blind seeing ; and they praised the God of Israel .
40015032	Jesus called his disciples to him and said , “ I feel sorry for these people , because they have been with me for three days and now have nothing to eat . I don't want to send them away without feeding them , for they might faint on their way home . ”
40015033	The disciples asked him , “ Where will we find enough food in this desert to feed this crowd ? ”
40015034	“ How much bread do you have ? ” Jesus asked . “ Seven loaves , ” they answered , “ and a few small fish . ”
40015035	So Jesus ordered the crowd to sit down on the ground .
40015036	Then he took the seven loaves and the fish , gave thanks to God , broke them , and gave them to the disciples ; and the disciples gave them to the people .
40015037	They all ate and had enough . Then the disciples took up seven baskets full of pieces left over .
40015038	The number of men who ate was four thousand , not counting the women and children .
40015039	Then Jesus sent the people away , got into a boat , and went to the territory of Magadan .
40016001	Some Pharisees and Sadducees who came to Jesus wanted to trap him , so they asked him to perform a miracle for them , to show that God approved of him .
40016002	But Jesus answered , “ When the sun is setting , you say , ‘ We are going to have fine weather , because the sky is red . ’
40016003	And early in the morning you say , ‘ It is going to rain , because the sky is red and dark . ’ You can predict the weather by looking at the sky , but you cannot interpret the signs concerning these times !
40016004	How evil and godless are the people of this day ! You ask me for a miracle ? No ! The only miracle you will be given is the miracle of Jonah . ” So he left them and went away .
40016005	When the disciples crossed over to the other side of the lake , they forgot to take any bread .
40016006	Jesus said to them , “ Take care ; be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees . ”
40016007	They started discussing among themselves , “ He says this because we didn't bring any bread . ”
40016008	Jesus knew what they were saying , so he asked them , “ Why are you discussing among yourselves about not having any bread ? What little faith you have !
40016009	Don't you understand yet ? Don't you remember when I broke the five loaves for the five thousand men ? How many baskets did you fill ?
40016010	And what about the seven loaves for the four thousand men ? How many baskets did you fill ?
40016011	How is it that you don't understand that I was not talking to you about bread ? Guard yourselves from the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees ! ”
40016012	Then the disciples understood that he was not warning them to guard themselves from the yeast used in bread but from the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees .
40016013	Jesus went to the territory near the town of Caesarea Philippi , where he asked his disciples , “ Who do people say the Son of Man is ? ”
40016014	“ Some say John the Baptist , ” they answered . “ Others say Elijah , while others say Jeremiah or some other prophet . ”
40016015	“ What about you ? ” he asked them . “ Who do you say I am ? ”
40016016	Simon Peter answered , “ You are the Messiah , the Son of the living God . ”
40016017	“ Good for you , Simon son of John ! ” answered Jesus . “ For this truth did not come to you from any human being , but it was given to you directly by my Father in heaven .
40016018	And so I tell you , Peter : you are a rock , and on this rock foundation I will build my church , and not even death will ever be able to overcome it .
40016019	I will give you the keys of the Kingdom of heaven ; what you prohibit on earth will be prohibited in heaven , and what you permit on earth will be permitted in heaven . ”
40016020	Then Jesus ordered his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah .
40016021	From that time on Jesus began to say plainly to his disciples , “ I must go to Jerusalem and suffer much from the elders , the chief priests , and the teachers of the Law . I will be put to death , but three days later I will be raised to life . ”
40016022	Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him . “ God forbid it , Lord ! ” he said . “ That must never happen to you ! ”
40016023	Jesus turned around and said to Peter , “ Get away from me , Satan ! You are an obstacle in my way , because these thoughts of yours don't come from God , but from human nature . ”
40016024	Then Jesus said to his disciples , “ If any of you want to come with me , you must forget yourself , carry your cross , and follow me .
40016025	For if you want to save your own life , you will lose it ; but if you lose your life for my sake , you will find it .
40016026	Will you gain anything if you win the whole world but lose your life ? Of course not ! There is nothing you can give to regain your life .
40016027	For the Son of Man is about to come in the glory of his Father with his angels , and then he will reward each one according to his deeds .
40016028	I assure you that there are some here who will not die until they have seen the Son of Man come as King . ”
40017001	Six days later Jesus took with him Peter and the brothers James and John and led them up a high mountain where they were alone .
40017002	As they looked on , a change came over Jesus : his face was shining like the sun , and his clothes were dazzling white .
40017003	Then the three disciples saw Moses and Elijah talking with Jesus .
40017004	So Peter spoke up and said to Jesus , “ Lord , how good it is that we are here ! If you wish , I will make three tents here , one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . ”
40017005	While he was talking , a shining cloud came over them , and a voice from the cloud said , “ This is my own dear Son , with whom I am pleased—listen to him ! ”
40017006	When the disciples heard the voice , they were so terrified that they threw themselves face downward on the ground .
40017007	Jesus came to them and touched them . “ Get up , ” he said . “ Don't be afraid ! ”
40017008	So they looked up and saw no one there but Jesus .
40017009	As they came down the mountain , Jesus ordered them , “ Don't tell anyone about this vision you have seen until the Son of Man has been raised from death . ”
40017010	Then the disciples asked Jesus , “ Why do the teachers of the Law say that Elijah has to come first ? ”
40017011	“ Elijah is indeed coming first , ” answered Jesus , “ and he will get everything ready .
40017012	But I tell you that Elijah has already come and people did not recognize him , but treated him just as they pleased . In the same way they will also mistreat the Son of Man . ”
40017013	Then the disciples understood that he was talking to them about John the Baptist .
40017014	When they returned to the crowd , a man came to Jesus , knelt before him ,
40017015	and said , “ Sir , have mercy on my son ! He is an epileptic and has such terrible attacks that he often falls in the fire or into water .
40017016	I brought him to your disciples , but they could not heal him . ”
40017017	Jesus answered , “ How unbelieving and wrong you people are ! How long must I stay with you ? How long do I have to put up with you ? Bring the boy here to me ! ”
40017018	Jesus gave a command to the demon , and it went out of the boy , and at that very moment he was healed .
40017019	Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked him , “ Why couldn't we drive the demon out ? ”
40017020	“ It was because you do not have enough faith , ” answered Jesus . “ I assure you that if you have faith as big as a mustard seed , you can say to this hill , ‘ Go from here to there ! ’ and it will go . You could do anything ! ”
40017022	When the disciples all came together in Galilee , Jesus said to them , “ The Son of Man is about to be handed over to those
40017023	who will kill him ; but three days later he will be raised to life . ” The disciples became very sad .
40017024	When Jesus and his disciples came to Capernaum , the collectors of the Temple tax came to Peter and asked , “ Does your teacher pay the Temple tax ? ”
40017025	“ Of course , ” Peter answered . When Peter went into the house , Jesus spoke up first , “ Simon , what is your opinion ? Who pays duties or taxes to the kings of this world ? The citizens of the country or the foreigners ? ”
40017026	“ The foreigners , ” answered Peter . “ Well , then , ” replied Jesus , “ that means that the citizens don't have to pay .
40017027	But we don't want to offend these people . So go to the lake and drop in a line . Pull up the first fish you hook , and in its mouth you will find a coin worth enough for my Temple tax and yours . Take it and pay them our taxes . ”
40018001	At that time the disciples came to Jesus , asking , “ Who is the greatest in the Kingdom of heaven ? ”
40018002	So Jesus called a child to come and stand in front of them ,
40018003	and said , “ I assure you that unless you change and become like children , you will never enter the Kingdom of heaven .
40018004	The greatest in the Kingdom of heaven is the one who humbles himself and becomes like this child .
40018005	And whoever welcomes in my name one such child as this , welcomes me .
40018006	“ If anyone should cause one of these little ones to lose his faith in me , it would be better for that person to have a large millstone tied around his neck and be drowned in the deep sea .
40018007	How terrible for the world that there are things that make people lose their faith ! Such things will always happen—but how terrible for the one who causes them !
40018008	“ If your hand or your foot makes you lose your faith , cut it off and throw it away ! It is better for you to enter life without a hand or a foot than to keep both hands and both feet and be thrown into the eternal fire .
40018009	And if your eye makes you lose your faith , take it out and throw it away ! It is better for you to enter life with only one eye than to keep both eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell .
40018010	“ See that you don't despise any of these little ones . Their angels in heaven , I tell you , are always in the presence of my Father in heaven .
40018012	“ What do you think a man does who has one hundred sheep and one of them gets lost ? He will leave the other ninety-nine grazing on the hillside and go and look for the lost sheep .
40018013	When he finds it , I tell you , he feels far happier over this one sheep than over the ninety-nine that did not get lost .
40018014	In just the same way your Father in heaven does not want any of these little ones to be lost .
40018015	“ If your brother sins against you , go to him and show him his fault . But do it privately , just between yourselves . If he listens to you , you have won your brother back .
40018016	But if he will not listen to you , take one or two other persons with you , so that ‘ every accusation may be upheld by the testimony of two or more witnesses , ’ as the scripture says .
40018017	And if he will not listen to them , then tell the whole thing to the church . Finally , if he will not listen to the church , treat him as though he were a pagan or a tax collector .
40018018	“ And so I tell all of you : what you prohibit on earth will be prohibited in heaven , and what you permit on earth will be permitted in heaven .
40018019	“ And I tell you more : whenever two of you on earth agree about anything you pray for , it will be done for you by my Father in heaven .
40018020	For where two or three come together in my name , I am there with them . ”
40018021	Then Peter came to Jesus and asked , “ Lord , if my brother keeps on sinning against me , how many times do I have to forgive him ? Seven times ? ”
40018022	“ No , not seven times , ” answered Jesus , “ but seventy times seven ,
40018023	because the Kingdom of heaven is like this . Once there was a king who decided to check on his servants' accounts .
40018024	He had just begun to do so when one of them was brought in who owed him millions of dollars .
40018025	The servant did not have enough to pay his debt , so the king ordered him to be sold as a slave , with his wife and his children and all that he had , in order to pay the debt .
40018026	The servant fell on his knees before the king . ‘ Be patient with me , ’ he begged , ‘ and I will pay you everything ! ’
40018027	The king felt sorry for him , so he forgave him the debt and let him go .
40018028	“ Then the man went out and met one of his fellow servants who owed him a few dollars . He grabbed him and started choking him . ‘ Pay back what you owe me ! ’ he said .
40018029	His fellow servant fell down and begged him , ‘ Be patient with me , and I will pay you back ! ’
40018030	But he refused ; instead , he had him thrown into jail until he should pay the debt .
40018031	When the other servants saw what had happened , they were very upset and went to the king and told him everything .
40018032	So he called the servant in . ‘ You worthless slave ! ’ he said . ‘ I forgave you the whole amount you owed me , just because you asked me to .
40018033	You should have had mercy on your fellow servant , just as I had mercy on you . ’
40018034	The king was very angry , and he sent the servant to jail to be punished until he should pay back the whole amount . ”
40018035	And Jesus concluded , “ That is how my Father in heaven will treat every one of you unless you forgive your brother from your heart . ”
40019001	When Jesus finished saying these things , he left Galilee and went to the territory of Judea on the other side of the Jordan River .
40019002	Large crowds followed him , and he healed them there .
40019003	Some Pharisees came to him and tried to trap him by asking , “ Does our Law allow a man to divorce his wife for whatever reason he wishes ? ”
40019004	Jesus answered , “ Haven't you read the scripture that says that in the beginning the Creator made people male and female ?
40019005	And God said , ‘ For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and unite with his wife , and the two will become one . ’
40019006	So they are no longer two , but one . No human being must separate , then , what God has joined together . ”
40019007	The Pharisees asked him , “ Why , then , did Moses give the law for a man to hand his wife a divorce notice and send her away ? ”
40019008	Jesus answered , “ Moses gave you permission to divorce your wives because you are so hard to teach . But it was not like that at the time of creation .
40019009	I tell you , then , that any man who divorces his wife for any cause other than her unfaithfulness , commits adultery if he marries some other woman . ”
40019010	His disciples said to him , “ If this is how it is between a man and his wife , it is better not to marry . ”
40019011	Jesus answered , “ This teaching does not apply to everyone , but only to those to whom God has given it .
40019012	For there are different reasons why men cannot marry : some , because they were born that way ; others , because men made them that way ; and others do not marry for the sake of the Kingdom of heaven . Let him who can accept this teaching do so . ”
40019013	Some people brought children to Jesus for him to place his hands on them and to pray for them , but the disciples scolded the people .
40019014	Jesus said , “ Let the children come to me and do not stop them , because the Kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these . ”
40019015	He placed his hands on them and then went away .
40019016	Once a man came to Jesus . “ Teacher , ” he asked , “ what good thing must I do to receive eternal life ? ”
40019017	“ Why do you ask me concerning what is good ? ” answered Jesus . “ There is only One who is good . Keep the commandments if you want to enter life . ”
40019018	“ What commandments ? ” he asked . Jesus answered , “ Do not commit murder ; do not commit adultery ; do not steal ; do not accuse anyone falsely ;
40019019	respect your father and your mother ; and love your neighbor as you love yourself . ”
40019020	“ I have obeyed all these commandments , ” the young man replied . “ What else do I need to do ? ”
40019021	Jesus said to him , “ If you want to be perfect , go and sell all you have and give the money to the poor , and you will have riches in heaven ; then come and follow me . ”
40019022	When the young man heard this , he went away sad , because he was very rich .
40019023	Jesus then said to his disciples , “ I assure you : it will be very hard for rich people to enter the Kingdom of heaven .
40019024	I repeat : it is much harder for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of God than for a camel to go through the eye of a needle . ”
40019025	When the disciples heard this , they were completely amazed . “ Who , then , can be saved ? ” they asked .
40019026	Jesus looked straight at them and answered , “ This is impossible for human beings , but for God everything is possible . ”
40019027	Then Peter spoke up . “ Look , ” he said , “ we have left everything and followed you . What will we have ? ”
40019028	Jesus said to them , “ You can be sure that when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne in the New Age , then you twelve followers of mine will also sit on thrones , to rule the twelve tribes of Israel .
40019029	And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake , will receive a hundred times more and will be given eternal life .
40019030	But many who now are first will be last , and many who now are last will be first .
40020001	“ The Kingdom of heaven is like this . Once there was a man who went out early in the morning to hire some men to work in his vineyard .
40020002	He agreed to pay them the regular wage , a silver coin a day , and sent them to work in his vineyard .
40020003	He went out again to the marketplace at nine o'clock and saw some men standing there doing nothing ,
40020004	so he told them , ‘ You also go and work in the vineyard , and I will pay you a fair wage . ’
40020005	So they went . Then at twelve o'clock and again at three o'clock he did the same thing .
40020006	It was nearly five o'clock when he went to the marketplace and saw some other men still standing there . ‘ Why are you wasting the whole day here doing nothing ? ’ he asked them .
40020007	‘ No one hired us , ’ they answered . ‘ Well , then , you go and work in the vineyard , ’ he told them .
40020008	“ When evening came , the owner told his foreman , ‘ Call the workers and pay them their wages , starting with those who were hired last and ending with those who were hired first . ’
40020009	The men who had begun to work at five o'clock were paid a silver coin each .
40020010	So when the men who were the first to be hired came to be paid , they thought they would get more ; but they too were given a silver coin each .
40020011	They took their money and started grumbling against the employer .
40020012	‘ These men who were hired last worked only one hour , ’ they said , ‘ while we put up with a whole day's work in the hot sun—yet you paid them the same as you paid us ! ’
40020013	‘ Listen , friend , ’ the owner answered one of them , ‘ I have not cheated you . After all , you agreed to do a day's work for one silver coin .
40020014	Now take your pay and go home . I want to give this man who was hired last as much as I gave you .
40020015	Don't I have the right to do as I wish with my own money ? Or are you jealous because I am generous ? ’ ”
40020016	And Jesus concluded , “ So those who are last will be first , and those who are first will be last . ”
40020017	As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem , he took the twelve disciples aside and spoke to them privately , as they walked along .
40020018	“ Listen , ” he told them , “ we are going up to Jerusalem , where the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the Law . They will condemn him to death
40020019	and then hand him over to the Gentiles , who will make fun of him , whip him , and crucify him ; but three days later he will be raised to life . ”
40020020	Then the wife of Zebedee came to Jesus with her two sons , bowed before him , and asked him for a favor .
40020021	“ What do you want ? ” Jesus asked her . She answered , “ Promise me that these two sons of mine will sit at your right and your left when you are King . ”
40020022	“ You don't know what you are asking for , ” Jesus answered the sons . “ Can you drink the cup of suffering that I am about to drink ? ” “ We can , ” they answered .
40020023	“ You will indeed drink from my cup , ” Jesus told them , “ but I do not have the right to choose who will sit at my right and my left . These places belong to those for whom my Father has prepared them . ”
40020024	When the other ten disciples heard about this , they became angry with the two brothers .
40020025	So Jesus called them all together and said , “ You know that the rulers of the heathen have power over them , and the leaders have complete authority .
40020026	This , however , is not the way it shall be among you . If one of you wants to be great , you must be the servant of the rest ;
40020027	and if one of you wants to be first , you must be the slave of the others—
40020028	like the Son of Man , who did not come to be served , but to serve and to give his life to redeem many people . ”
40020029	As Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho , a large crowd was following .
40020030	Two blind men who were sitting by the road heard that Jesus was passing by , so they began to shout , “ Son of David ! Have mercy on us , sir ! ”
40020031	The crowd scolded them and told them to be quiet . But they shouted even more loudly , “ Son of David ! Have mercy on us , sir ! ”
40020032	Jesus stopped and called them . “ What do you want me to do for you ? ” he asked them .
40020033	“ Sir , ” they answered , “ we want you to give us our sight ! ”
40020034	Jesus had pity on them and touched their eyes ; at once they were able to see , and they followed him .
40021001	As Jesus and his disciples approached Jerusalem , they came to Bethphage at the Mount of Olives . There Jesus sent two of the disciples on ahead
40021002	with these instructions : “ Go to the village there ahead of you , and at once you will find a donkey tied up with her colt beside her . Untie them and bring them to me .
40021003	And if anyone says anything , tell him , ‘ The Master needs them ’ ; and then he will let them go at once . ”
40021004	This happened in order to make come true what the prophet had said :
40021005	“ Tell the city of Zion , Look , your king is coming to you ! He is humble and rides on a donkey and on a colt , the foal of a donkey . ”
40021006	So the disciples went and did what Jesus had told them to do :
40021007	they brought the donkey and the colt , threw their cloaks over them , and Jesus got on .
40021008	A large crowd of people spread their cloaks on the road while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road .
40021009	The crowds walking in front of Jesus and those walking behind began to shout , “ Praise to David's Son ! God bless him who comes in the name of the Lord ! Praise be to God ! ”
40021010	When Jesus entered Jerusalem , the whole city was thrown into an uproar . “ Who is he ? ” the people asked .
40021011	“ This is the prophet Jesus , from Nazareth in Galilee , ” the crowds answered .
40021012	Jesus went into the Temple and drove out all those who were buying and selling there . He overturned the tables of the moneychangers and the stools of those who sold pigeons ,
40021013	and said to them , “ It is written in the Scriptures that God said , ‘ My Temple will be called a house of prayer . ’ But you are making it a hideout for thieves ! ”
40021014	The blind and the crippled came to him in the Temple , and he healed them .
40021015	The chief priests and the teachers of the Law became angry when they saw the wonderful things he was doing and the children shouting in the Temple , “ Praise to David's Son ! ”
40021016	So they asked Jesus , “ Do you hear what they are saying ? ” “ Indeed I do , ” answered Jesus . “ Haven't you ever read this scripture ? ‘ You have trained children and babies to offer perfect praise . ’ ”
40021017	Jesus left them and went out of the city to Bethany , where he spent the night .
40021018	On his way back to the city early next morning , Jesus was hungry .
40021019	He saw a fig tree by the side of the road and went to it , but found nothing on it except leaves . So he said to the tree , “ You will never again bear fruit ! ” At once the fig tree dried up .
40021020	The disciples saw this and were astounded . “ How did the fig tree dry up so quickly ? ” they asked .
40021021	Jesus answered , “ I assure you that if you believe and do not doubt , you will be able to do what I have done to this fig tree . And not only this , but you will even be able to say to this hill , ‘ Get up and throw yourself in the sea , ’ and it will .
40021022	If you believe , you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer . ”
40021023	Jesus came back to the Temple ; and as he taught , the chief priests and the elders came to him and asked , “ What right do you have to do these things ? Who gave you such right ? ”
40021024	Jesus answered them , “ I will ask you just one question , and if you give me an answer , I will tell you what right I have to do these things .
40021025	Where did John's right to baptize come from : was it from God or from human beings ? ” They started to argue among themselves , “ What shall we say ? If we answer , ‘ From God , ’ he will say to us , ‘ Why , then , did you not believe John ? ’
40021026	But if we say , ‘ From human beings , ’ we are afraid of what the people might do , because they are all convinced that John was a prophet . ”
40021027	So they answered Jesus , “ We don't know . ” And he said to them , “ Neither will I tell you , then , by what right I do these things .
40021028	“ Now , what do you think ? There was once a man who had two sons . He went to the older one and said , ‘ Son , go and work in the vineyard today . ’
40021029	‘ I don't want to , ’ he answered , but later he changed his mind and went .
40021030	Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing . ‘ Yes , sir , ’ he answered , but he did not go .
40021031	Which one of the two did what his father wanted ? ” “ The older one , ” they answered . So Jesus said to them , “ I tell you : the tax collectors and the prostitutes are going into the Kingdom of God ahead of you .
40021032	For John the Baptist came to you showing you the right path to take , and you would not believe him ; but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him . Even when you saw this , you did not later change your minds and believe him .
40021033	“ Listen to another parable , ” Jesus said . “ There was once a landowner who planted a vineyard , put a fence around it , dug a hole for the wine press , and built a watchtower . Then he rented the vineyard to tenants and left home on a trip .
40021034	When the time came to gather the grapes , he sent his slaves to the tenants to receive his share of the harvest .
40021035	The tenants grabbed his slaves , beat one , killed another , and stoned another .
40021036	Again the man sent other slaves , more than the first time , and the tenants treated them the same way .
40021037	Last of all he sent his son to them . ‘ Surely they will respect my son , ’ he said .
40021038	But when the tenants saw the son , they said to themselves , ‘ This is the owner's son . Come on , let's kill him , and we will get his property ! ’
40021039	So they grabbed him , threw him out of the vineyard , and killed him .
40021040	“ Now , when the owner of the vineyard comes , what will he do to those tenants ? ” Jesus asked .
40021041	“ He will certainly kill those evil men , ” they answered , “ and rent the vineyard out to other tenants , who will give him his share of the harvest at the right time . ”
40021042	Jesus said to them , “ Haven't you ever read what the Scriptures say ? ‘ The stone which the builders rejected as worthless turned out to be the most important of all . This was done by the Lord ; what a wonderful sight it is ! ’
40021043	“ And so I tell you , ” added Jesus , “ the Kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce the proper fruits . ”
40021045	The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' parables and knew that he was talking about them ,
40021046	so they tried to arrest him . But they were afraid of the crowds , who considered Jesus to be a prophet .
40022001	Jesus again used parables in talking to the people .
40022002	“ The Kingdom of heaven is like this . Once there was a king who prepared a wedding feast for his son .
40022003	He sent his servants to tell the invited guests to come to the feast , but they did not want to come .
40022004	So he sent other servants with this message for the guests : ‘ My feast is ready now ; my steers and prize calves have been butchered , and everything is ready . Come to the wedding feast ! ’
40022005	But the invited guests paid no attention and went about their business : one went to his farm , another to his store ,
40022006	while others grabbed the servants , beat them , and killed them .
40022007	The king was very angry ; so he sent his soldiers , who killed those murderers and burned down their city .
40022008	Then he called his servants and said to them , ‘ My wedding feast is ready , but the people I invited did not deserve it .
40022009	Now go to the main streets and invite to the feast as many people as you find . ’
40022010	So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find , good and bad alike ; and the wedding hall was filled with people .
40022011	“ The king went in to look at the guests and saw a man who was not wearing wedding clothes .
40022012	‘ Friend , how did you get in here without wedding clothes ? ’ the king asked him . But the man said nothing .
40022013	Then the king told the servants , ‘ Tie him up hand and foot , and throw him outside in the dark . There he will cry and gnash his teeth . ’ ”
40022014	And Jesus concluded , “ Many are invited , but few are chosen . ”
40022015	The Pharisees went off and made a plan to trap Jesus with questions .
40022016	Then they sent to him some of their disciples and some members of Herod's party . “ Teacher , ” they said , “ we know that you tell the truth . You teach the truth about God's will for people , without worrying about what others think , because you pay no attention to anyone's status .
40022017	Tell us , then , what do you think ? Is it against our Law to pay taxes to the Roman Emperor , or not ? ”
40022018	Jesus , however , was aware of their evil plan , and so he said , “ You hypocrites ! Why are you trying to trap me ?
40022019	Show me the coin for paying the tax ! ” They brought him the coin ,
40022020	and he asked them , “ Whose face and name are these ? ”
40022021	“ The Emperor's , ” they answered . So Jesus said to them , “ Well , then , pay to the Emperor what belongs to the Emperor , and pay to God what belongs to God . ”
40022022	When they heard this , they were amazed ; and they left him and went away .
40022023	That same day some Sadducees came to Jesus and claimed that people will not rise from death .
40022024	“ Teacher , ” they said , “ Moses said that if a man who has no children dies , his brother must marry the widow so that they can have children who will be considered the dead man's children .
40022025	Now , there were seven brothers who used to live here . The oldest got married and died without having children , so he left his widow to his brother .
40022026	The same thing happened to the second brother , to the third , and finally to all seven .
40022027	Last of all , the woman died .
40022028	Now , on the day when the dead rise to life , whose wife will she be ? All of them had married her . ”
40022029	Jesus answered them , “ How wrong you are ! It is because you don't know the Scriptures or God's power .
40022030	For when the dead rise to life , they will be like the angels in heaven and will not marry .
40022031	Now , as for the dead rising to life : haven't you ever read what God has told you ? He said ,
40022032	‘ I am the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . ’ He is the God of the living , not of the dead . ”
40022033	When the crowds heard this , they were amazed at his teaching .
40022034	When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees , they came together ,
40022035	and one of them , a teacher of the Law , tried to trap him with a question .
40022036	“ Teacher , ” he asked , “ which is the greatest commandment in the Law ? ”
40022037	Jesus answered , “ ‘ Love the Lord your God with all your heart , with all your soul , and with all your mind . ’
40022038	This is the greatest and the most important commandment .
40022039	The second most important commandment is like it : ‘ Love your neighbor as you love yourself . ’
40022040	The whole Law of Moses and the teachings of the prophets depend on these two commandments . ”
40022041	When some Pharisees gathered together , Jesus asked them ,
40022042	“ What do you think about the Messiah ? Whose descendant is he ? ” “ He is David's descendant , ” they answered .
40022043	“ Why , then , ” Jesus asked , “ did the Spirit inspire David to call him ‘ Lord ’ ? David said ,
40022044	‘ The Lord said to my Lord : Sit here at my right side until I put your enemies under your feet . ’
40022046	No one was able to give Jesus any answer , and from that day on no one dared to ask him any more questions .
40023001	Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples .
40023002	“ The teachers of the Law and the Pharisees are the authorized interpreters of Moses' Law .
40023003	So you must obey and follow everything they tell you to do ; do not , however , imitate their actions , because they don't practice what they preach .
40023004	They tie onto people's backs loads that are heavy and hard to carry , yet they aren't willing even to lift a finger to help them carry those loads .
40023005	They do everything so that people will see them . Look at the straps with scripture verses on them which they wear on their foreheads and arms , and notice how large they are ! Notice also how long are the tassels on their cloaks !
40023006	They love the best places at feasts and the reserved seats in the synagogues ;
40023007	they love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to have people call them ‘ Teacher . ’
40023008	You must not be called ‘ Teacher , ’ because you are all equal and have only one Teacher .
40023009	And you must not call anyone here on earth ‘ Father , ’ because you have only the one Father in heaven .
40023010	Nor should you be called ‘ Leader , ’ because your one and only leader is the Messiah .
40023011	The greatest one among you must be your servant .
40023012	Whoever makes himself great will be humbled , and whoever humbles himself will be made great .
40023013	“ How terrible for you , teachers of the Law and Pharisees ! You hypocrites ! You lock the door to the Kingdom of heaven in people's faces , but you yourselves don't go in , nor do you allow in those who are trying to enter !
40023015	“ How terrible for you , teachers of the Law and Pharisees ! You hypocrites ! You sail the seas and cross whole countries to win one convert ; and when you succeed , you make him twice as deserving of going to hell as you yourselves are !
40023016	“ How terrible for you , blind guides ! You teach , ‘ If someone swears by the Temple , he isn't bound by his vow ; but if he swears by the gold in the Temple , he is bound . ’
40023017	Blind fools ! Which is more important , the gold or the Temple which makes the gold holy ?
40023018	You also teach , ‘ If someone swears by the altar , he isn't bound by his vow ; but if he swears by the gift on the altar , he is bound . ’
40023019	How blind you are ! Which is the more important , the gift or the altar which makes the gift holy ?
40023020	So then , when a person swears by the altar , he is swearing by it and by all the gifts on it ;
40023021	and when he swears by the Temple , he is swearing by it and by God , who lives there ;
40023022	and when someone swears by heaven , he is swearing by God's throne and by him who sits on it .
40023023	“ How terrible for you , teachers of the Law and Pharisees ! You hypocrites ! You give to God one tenth even of the seasoning herbs , such as mint , dill , and cumin , but you neglect to obey the really important teachings of the Law , such as justice and mercy and honesty . These you should practice , without neglecting the others .
40023024	Blind guides ! You strain a fly out of your drink , but swallow a camel !
40023025	“ How terrible for you , teachers of the Law and Pharisees ! You hypocrites ! You clean the outside of your cup and plate , while the inside is full of what you have gotten by violence and selfishness .
40023026	Blind Pharisee ! Clean what is inside the cup first , and then the outside will be clean too !
40023027	“ How terrible for you , teachers of the Law and Pharisees ! You hypocrites ! You are like whitewashed tombs , which look fine on the outside but are full of bones and decaying corpses on the inside .
40023028	In the same way , on the outside you appear good to everybody , but inside you are full of hypocrisy and sins .
40023029	“ How terrible for you , teachers of the Law and Pharisees ! You hypocrites ! You make fine tombs for the prophets and decorate the monuments of those who lived good lives ;
40023030	and you claim that if you had lived during the time of your ancestors , you would not have done what they did and killed the prophets .
40023031	So you actually admit that you are the descendants of those who murdered the prophets !
40023032	Go on , then , and finish up what your ancestors started !
40023033	You snakes and children of snakes ! How do you expect to escape from being condemned to hell ?
40023034	And so I tell you that I will send you prophets and wise men and teachers ; you will kill some of them , crucify others , and whip others in the synagogues and chase them from town to town .
40023035	As a result , the punishment for the murder of all innocent people will fall on you , from the murder of innocent Abel to the murder of Zechariah son of Berechiah , whom you murdered between the Temple and the altar .
40023036	I tell you indeed : the punishment for all these murders will fall on the people of this day !
40023037	“ Jerusalem , Jerusalem ! You kill the prophets and stone the messengers God has sent you ! How many times I wanted to put my arms around all your people , just as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings , but you would not let me !
40023038	And so your Temple will be abandoned and empty .
40023039	From now on , I tell you , you will never see me again until you say , ‘ God bless him who comes in the name of the Lord . ’ ”
40024001	Jesus left and was going away from the Temple when his disciples came to him to call his attention to its buildings .
40024002	“ Yes , ” he said , “ you may well look at all these . I tell you this : not a single stone here will be left in its place ; every one of them will be thrown down . ”
40024003	As Jesus sat on the Mount of Olives , the disciples came to him in private . “ Tell us when all this will be , ” they asked , “ and what will happen to show that it is the time for your coming and the end of the age . ”
40024004	Jesus answered , “ Watch out , and do not let anyone fool you .
40024005	Many men , claiming to speak for me , will come and say , ‘ I am the Messiah ! ’ and they will fool many people .
40024006	You are going to hear the noise of battles close by and the news of battles far away ; but do not be troubled . Such things must happen , but they do not mean that the end has come .
40024007	Countries will fight each other ; kingdoms will attack one another . There will be famines and earthquakes everywhere .
40024008	All these things are like the first pains of childbirth .
40024009	“ Then you will be arrested and handed over to be punished and be put to death . Everyone will hate you because of me .
40024010	Many will give up their faith at that time ; they will betray one another and hate one another .
40024011	Then many false prophets will appear and fool many people .
40024012	Such will be the spread of evil that many people's love will grow cold .
40024013	But whoever holds out to the end will be saved .
40024014	And this Good News about the Kingdom will be preached through all the world for a witness to all people ; and then the end will come .
40024015	“ You will see ‘ The Awful Horror ’ of which the prophet Daniel spoke . It will be standing in the holy place . ” ( Note to the reader : understand what this means ! )
40024016	“ Then those who are in Judea must run away to the hills .
40024017	Someone who is on the roof of a house must not take the time to go down and get any belongings from the house .
40024018	Someone who is in the field must not go back to get a cloak .
40024019	How terrible it will be in those days for women who are pregnant and for mothers with little babies !
40024020	Pray to God that you will not have to run away during the winter or on a Sabbath !
40024021	For the trouble at that time will be far more terrible than any there has ever been , from the beginning of the world to this very day . Nor will there ever be anything like it again .
40024022	But God has already reduced the number of days ; had he not done so , nobody would survive . For the sake of his chosen people , however , God will reduce the days .
40024023	“ Then , if anyone says to you , ‘ Look , here is the Messiah ! ’ or ‘ There he is ! ’ —do not believe it .
40024024	For false Messiahs and false prophets will appear ; they will perform great miracles and wonders in order to deceive even God's chosen people , if possible .
40024025	Listen ! I have told you this ahead of time .
40024026	“ Or , if people should tell you , ‘ Look , he is out in the desert ! ’ —don't go there ; or if they say , ‘ Look , he is hiding here ! ’ —don't believe it .
40024027	For the Son of Man will come like the lightning which flashes across the whole sky from the east to the west .
40024028	“ Wherever there is a dead body , the vultures will gather .
40024029	“ Soon after the trouble of those days , the sun will grow dark , the moon will no longer shine , the stars will fall from heaven , and the powers in space will be driven from their courses .
40024030	Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky ; and all the peoples of earth will weep as they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory .
40024031	The great trumpet will sound , and he will send out his angels to the four corners of the earth , and they will gather his chosen people from one end of the world to the other .
40024032	“ Let the fig tree teach you a lesson . When its branches become green and tender and it starts putting out leaves , you know that summer is near .
40024033	In the same way , when you see all these things , you will know that the time is near , ready to begin .
40024034	Remember that all these things will happen before the people now living have all died .
40024035	Heaven and earth will pass away , but my words will never pass away .
40024036	“ No one knows , however , when that day and hour will come—neither the angels in heaven nor the Son ; the Father alone knows .
40024037	The coming of the Son of Man will be like what happened in the time of Noah .
40024038	In the days before the flood people ate and drank , men and women married , up to the very day Noah went into the boat ;
40024039	yet they did not realize what was happening until the flood came and swept them all away . That is how it will be when the Son of Man comes .
40024040	At that time two men will be working in a field : one will be taken away , the other will be left behind .
40024041	Two women will be at a mill grinding meal : one will be taken away , the other will be left behind .
40024042	Watch out , then , because you do not know what day your Lord will come .
40024043	If the owner of a house knew the time when the thief would come , you can be sure that he would stay awake and not let the thief break into his house .
40024044	So then , you also must always be ready , because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you are not expecting him .
40024045	“ Who , then , is a faithful and wise servant ? It is the one that his master has placed in charge of the other servants to give them their food at the proper time .
40024046	How happy that servant is if his master finds him doing this when he comes home !
40024047	Indeed , I tell you , the master will put that servant in charge of all his property .
40024048	But if he is a bad servant , he will tell himself that his master will not come back for a long time ,
40024049	and he will begin to beat his fellow servants and to eat and drink with drunkards .
40024050	Then that servant's master will come back one day when the servant does not expect him and at a time he does not know .
40024051	The master will cut him in pieces and make him share the fate of the hypocrites . There he will cry and gnash his teeth .
40025001	“ At that time the Kingdom of heaven will be like this . Once there were ten young women who took their oil lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom .
40025002	Five of them were foolish , and the other five were wise .
40025003	The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take any extra oil with them ,
40025004	while the wise ones took containers full of oil for their lamps .
40025005	The bridegroom was late in coming , so they began to nod and fall asleep .
40025006	“ It was already midnight when the cry rang out , ‘ Here is the bridegroom ! Come and meet him ! ’
40025007	The ten young women woke up and trimmed their lamps .
40025008	Then the foolish ones said to the wise ones , ‘ Let us have some of your oil , because our lamps are going out . ’
40025009	‘ No , indeed , ’ the wise ones answered , ‘ there is not enough for you and for us . Go to the store and buy some for yourselves . ’
40025010	So the foolish ones went off to buy some oil ; and while they were gone , the bridegroom arrived . The five who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast , and the door was closed .
40025011	“ Later the others arrived . ‘ Sir , sir ! Let us in ! ’ they cried out .
40025012	‘ Certainly not ! I don't know you , ’ the bridegroom answered . ”
40025013	And Jesus concluded , “ Watch out , then , because you do not know the day or the hour .
40025014	“ At that time the Kingdom of heaven will be like this . Once there was a man who was about to leave home on a trip ; he called his servants and put them in charge of his property .
40025015	He gave to each one according to his ability : to one he gave five thousand gold coins , to another he gave two thousand , and to another he gave one thousand . Then he left on his trip .
40025016	The servant who had received five thousand coins went at once and invested his money and earned another five thousand .
40025017	In the same way the servant who had received two thousand coins earned another two thousand .
40025018	But the servant who had received one thousand coins went off , dug a hole in the ground , and hid his master's money .
40025019	“ After a long time the master of those servants came back and settled accounts with them .
40025020	The servant who had received five thousand coins came in and handed over the other five thousand . ‘ You gave me five thousand coins , sir , ’ he said . ‘ Look ! Here are another five thousand that I have earned . ’
40025021	‘ Well done , you good and faithful servant ! ’ said his master . ‘ You have been faithful in managing small amounts , so I will put you in charge of large amounts . Come on in and share my happiness ! ’
40025022	Then the servant who had been given two thousand coins came in and said , ‘ You gave me two thousand coins , sir . Look ! Here are another two thousand that I have earned . ’
40025023	‘ Well done , you good and faithful servant ! ’ said his master . ‘ You have been faithful in managing small amounts , so I will put you in charge of large amounts . Come on in and share my happiness ! ’
40025024	Then the servant who had received one thousand coins came in and said , ‘ Sir , I know you are a hard man ; you reap harvests where you did not plant , and you gather crops where you did not scatter seed .
40025025	I was afraid , so I went off and hid your money in the ground . Look ! Here is what belongs to you . ’
40025026	‘ You bad and lazy servant ! ’ his master said . ‘ You knew , did you , that I reap harvests where I did not plant , and gather crops where I did not scatter seed ?
40025027	Well , then , you should have deposited my money in the bank , and I would have received it all back with interest when I returned .
40025028	Now , take the money away from him and give it to the one who has ten thousand coins .
40025029	For to every person who has something , even more will be given , and he will have more than enough ; but the person who has nothing , even the little that he has will be taken away from him .
40025030	As for this useless servant—throw him outside in the darkness ; there he will cry and gnash his teeth . ’
40025031	“ When the Son of Man comes as King and all the angels with him , he will sit on his royal throne ,
40025032	and the people of all the nations will be gathered before him . Then he will divide them into two groups , just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats .
40025033	He will put the righteous people at his right and the others at his left .
40025034	Then the King will say to the people on his right , ‘ Come , you that are blessed by my Father ! Come and possess the kingdom which has been prepared for you ever since the creation of the world .
40025035	I was hungry and you fed me , thirsty and you gave me a drink ; I was a stranger and you received me in your homes ,
40025036	naked and you clothed me ; I was sick and you took care of me , in prison and you visited me . ’
40025037	The righteous will then answer him , ‘ When , Lord , did we ever see you hungry and feed you , or thirsty and give you a drink ?
40025038	When did we ever see you a stranger and welcome you in our homes , or naked and clothe you ?
40025039	When did we ever see you sick or in prison , and visit you ? ’
40025040	The King will reply , ‘ I tell you , whenever you did this for one of the least important of these followers of mine , you did it for me ! ’
40025041	“ Then he will say to those on his left , ‘ Away from me , you that are under God's curse ! Away to the eternal fire which has been prepared for the Devil and his angels !
40025042	I was hungry but you would not feed me , thirsty but you would not give me a drink ;
40025043	I was a stranger but you would not welcome me in your homes , naked but you would not clothe me ; I was sick and in prison but you would not take care of me . ’
40025044	Then they will answer him , ‘ When , Lord , did we ever see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison , and we would not help you ? ’
40025045	The King will reply , ‘ I tell you , whenever you refused to help one of these least important ones , you refused to help me . ’
40025046	These , then , will be sent off to eternal punishment , but the righteous will go to eternal life . ”
40026001	When Jesus had finished teaching all these things , he said to his disciples ,
40026002	“ In two days , as you know , it will be the Passover Festival , and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified . ”
40026003	Then the chief priests and the elders met together in the palace of Caiaphas , the High Priest ,
40026004	and made plans to arrest Jesus secretly and put him to death .
40026005	“ We must not do it during the festival , ” they said , “ or the people will riot . ”
40026006	Jesus was in Bethany at the house of Simon , a man who had suffered from a dreaded skin disease .
40026007	While Jesus was eating , a woman came to him with an alabaster jar filled with an expensive perfume , which she poured on his head .
40026008	The disciples saw this and became angry . “ Why all this waste ? ” they asked .
40026009	“ This perfume could have been sold for a large amount and the money given to the poor ! ”
40026010	Jesus knew what they were saying , and so he said to them , “ Why are you bothering this woman ? It is a fine and beautiful thing that she has done for me .
40026011	You will always have poor people with you , but you will not always have me .
40026012	What she did was to pour this perfume on my body to get me ready for burial .
40026013	Now , I assure you that wherever this gospel is preached all over the world , what she has done will be told in memory of her . ”
40026014	Then one of the twelve disciples—the one named Judas Iscariot—went to the chief priests
40026015	and asked , “ What will you give me if I betray Jesus to you ? ” They counted out thirty silver coins and gave them to him .
40026016	From then on Judas was looking for a good chance to hand Jesus over to them .
40026017	On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus and asked him , “ Where do you want us to get the Passover meal ready for you ? ”
40026018	“ Go to a certain man in the city , ” he said to them , “ and tell him : ‘ The Teacher says , My hour has come ; my disciples and I will celebrate the Passover at your house . ’ ”
40026019	The disciples did as Jesus had told them and prepared the Passover meal .
40026020	When it was evening , Jesus and the twelve disciples sat down to eat .
40026021	During the meal Jesus said , “ I tell you , one of you will betray me . ”
40026022	The disciples were very upset and began to ask him , one after the other , “ Surely , Lord , you don't mean me ? ”
40026023	Jesus answered , “ One who dips his bread in the dish with me will betray me .
40026024	The Son of Man will die as the Scriptures say he will , but how terrible for that man who will betray the Son of Man ! It would have been better for that man if he had never been born ! ”
40026025	Judas , the traitor , spoke up . “ Surely , Teacher , you don't mean me ? ” he asked . Jesus answered , “ So you say . ”
40026026	While they were eating , Jesus took a piece of bread , gave a prayer of thanks , broke it , and gave it to his disciples . “ Take and eat it , ” he said ; “ this is my body . ”
40026027	Then he took a cup , gave thanks to God , and gave it to them . “ Drink it , all of you , ” he said ;
40026028	“ this is my blood , which seals God's covenant , my blood poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins .
40026029	I tell you , I will never again drink this wine until the day I drink the new wine with you in my Father's Kingdom . ”
40026030	Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives .
40026031	Then Jesus said to them , “ This very night all of you will run away and leave me , for the scripture says , ‘ God will kill the shepherd , and the sheep of the flock will be scattered . ’
40026032	But after I am raised to life , I will go to Galilee ahead of you . ”
40026033	Peter spoke up and said to Jesus , “ I will never leave you , even though all the rest do ! ”
40026034	Jesus said to Peter , “ I tell you that before the rooster crows tonight , you will say three times that you do not know me . ”
40026035	Peter answered , “ I will never say that , even if I have to die with you ! ” And all the other disciples said the same thing .
40026036	Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane , and he said to them , “ Sit here while I go over there and pray . ”
40026037	He took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee . Grief and anguish came over him ,
40026038	and he said to them , “ The sorrow in my heart is so great that it almost crushes me . Stay here and keep watch with me . ”
40026039	He went a little farther on , threw himself face downward on the ground , and prayed , “ My Father , if it is possible , take this cup of suffering from me ! Yet not what I want , but what you want . ”
40026040	Then he returned to the three disciples and found them asleep ; and he said to Peter , “ How is it that you three were not able to keep watch with me for even one hour ?
40026041	Keep watch and pray that you will not fall into temptation . The spirit is willing , but the flesh is weak . ”
40026042	Once more Jesus went away and prayed , “ My Father , if this cup of suffering cannot be taken away unless I drink it , your will be done . ”
40026043	He returned once more and found the disciples asleep ; they could not keep their eyes open .
40026044	Again Jesus left them , went away , and prayed the third time , saying the same words .
40026045	Then he returned to the disciples and said , “ Are you still sleeping and resting ? Look ! The hour has come for the Son of Man to be handed over to the power of sinners .
40026046	Get up , let us go . Look , here is the man who is betraying me ! ”
40026047	Jesus was still speaking when Judas , one of the twelve disciples , arrived . With him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs and sent by the chief priests and the elders .
40026048	The traitor had given the crowd a signal : “ The man I kiss is the one you want . Arrest him ! ”
40026049	Judas went straight to Jesus and said , “ Peace be with you , Teacher , ” and kissed him .
40026050	Jesus answered , “ Be quick about it , friend ! ” Then they came up , arrested Jesus , and held him tight .
40026051	One of those who were with Jesus drew his sword and struck at the High Priest's slave , cutting off his ear .
40026052	“ Put your sword back in its place , ” Jesus said to him . “ All who take the sword will die by the sword .
40026053	Don't you know that I could call on my Father for help , and at once he would send me more than twelve armies of angels ?
40026054	But in that case , how could the Scriptures come true which say that this is what must happen ? ”
40026055	Then Jesus spoke to the crowd , “ Did you have to come with swords and clubs to capture me , as though I were an outlaw ? Every day I sat down and taught in the Temple , and you did not arrest me .
40026056	But all this has happened in order to make come true what the prophets wrote in the Scriptures . ” Then all the disciples left him and ran away .
40026057	Those who had arrested Jesus took him to the house of Caiaphas , the High Priest , where the teachers of the Law and the elders had gathered together .
40026058	Peter followed from a distance , as far as the courtyard of the High Priest's house . He went into the courtyard and sat down with the guards to see how it would all come out .
40026059	The chief priests and the whole Council tried to find some false evidence against Jesus to put him to death ;
40026060	but they could not find any , even though many people came forward and told lies about him . Finally two men stepped up
40026061	and said , “ This man said , ‘ I am able to tear down God's Temple and three days later build it back up . ’ ”
40026062	The High Priest stood up and said to Jesus , “ Have you no answer to give to this accusation against you ? ”
40026063	But Jesus kept quiet . Again the High Priest spoke to him , “ In the name of the living God I now put you under oath : tell us if you are the Messiah , the Son of God . ”
40026064	Jesus answered him , “ So you say . But I tell all of you : from this time on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right side of the Almighty and coming on the clouds of heaven ! ”
40026065	At this the High Priest tore his clothes and said , “ Blasphemy ! We don't need any more witnesses ! You have just heard his blasphemy !
40026066	What do you think ? ” They answered , “ He is guilty and must die . ”
40026067	Then they spat in his face and beat him ; and those who slapped him
40026068	said , “ Prophesy for us , Messiah ! Guess who hit you ! ”
40026069	Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard when one of the High Priest's servant women came to him and said , “ You , too , were with Jesus of Galilee . ”
40026070	But he denied it in front of them all . “ I don't know what you are talking about , ” he answered ,
40026071	and went on out to the entrance of the courtyard . Another servant woman saw him and said to the men there , “ He was with Jesus of Nazareth . ”
40026072	Again Peter denied it and answered , “ I swear that I don't know that man ! ”
40026073	After a little while the men standing there came to Peter . “ Of course you are one of them , ” they said . “ After all , the way you speak gives you away ! ”
40026074	Then Peter said , “ I swear that I am telling the truth ! May God punish me if I am not ! I do not know that man ! ” Just then a rooster crowed ,
40026075	and Peter remembered what Jesus had told him : “ Before the rooster crows , you will say three times that you do not know me . ” He went out and wept bitterly .
40027001	Early in the morning all the chief priests and the elders made their plans against Jesus to put him to death .
40027002	They put him in chains , led him off , and handed him over to Pilate , the Roman governor .
40027003	When Judas , the traitor , learned that Jesus had been condemned , he repented and took back the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and the elders .
40027004	“ I have sinned by betraying an innocent man to death ! ” he said . “ What do we care about that ? ” they answered . “ That is your business ! ”
40027005	Judas threw the coins down in the Temple and left ; then he went off and hanged himself .
40027006	The chief priests picked up the coins and said , “ This is blood money , and it is against our Law to put it in the Temple treasury . ”
40027007	After reaching an agreement about it , they used the money to buy Potter's Field , as a cemetery for foreigners .
40027008	That is why that field is called “ Field of Blood ” to this very day .
40027009	Then what the prophet Jeremiah had said came true : “ They took the thirty silver coins , the amount the people of Israel had agreed to pay for him ,
40027010	and used the money to buy the potter's field , as the Lord had commanded me . ”
40027011	Jesus stood before the Roman governor , who questioned him . “ Are you the king of the Jews ? ” he asked . “ So you say , ” answered Jesus .
40027012	But he said nothing in response to the accusations of the chief priests and elders .
40027013	So Pilate said to him , “ Don't you hear all these things they accuse you of ? ”
40027014	But Jesus refused to answer a single word , with the result that the Governor was greatly surprised .
40027015	At every Passover Festival the Roman governor was in the habit of setting free any one prisoner the crowd asked for .
40027016	At that time there was a well-known prisoner named Jesus Barabbas .
40027017	So when the crowd gathered , Pilate asked them , “ Which one do you want me to set free for you ? Jesus Barabbas or Jesus called the Messiah ? ”
40027018	He knew very well that the Jewish authorities had handed Jesus over to him because they were jealous .
40027019	While Pilate was sitting in the judgment hall , his wife sent him a message : “ Have nothing to do with that innocent man , because in a dream last night I suffered much on account of him . ”
40027020	The chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask Pilate to set Barabbas free and have Jesus put to death .
40027021	But Pilate asked the crowd , “ Which one of these two do you want me to set free for you ? ” “ Barabbas ! ” they answered .
40027022	“ What , then , shall I do with Jesus called the Messiah ? ” Pilate asked them . “ Crucify him ! ” they all answered .
40027023	But Pilate asked , “ What crime has he committed ? ” Then they started shouting at the top of their voices : “ Crucify him ! ”
40027024	When Pilate saw that it was no use to go on , but that a riot might break out , he took some water , washed his hands in front of the crowd , and said , “ I am not responsible for the death of this man ! This is your doing ! ”
40027025	The whole crowd answered , “ Let the responsibility for his death fall on us and on our children ! ”
40027026	Then Pilate set Barabbas free for them ; and after he had Jesus whipped , he handed him over to be crucified .
40027027	Then Pilate's soldiers took Jesus into the governor's palace , and the whole company gathered around him .
40027028	They stripped off his clothes and put a scarlet robe on him .
40027029	Then they made a crown out of thorny branches and placed it on his head , and put a stick in his right hand ; then they knelt before him and made fun of him . “ Long live the King of the Jews ! ” they said .
40027030	They spat on him , and took the stick and hit him over the head .
40027031	When they had finished making fun of him , they took the robe off and put his own clothes back on him . Then they led him out to crucify him .
40027032	As they were going out , they met a man from Cyrene named Simon , and the soldiers forced him to carry Jesus' cross .
40027033	They came to a place called Golgotha , which means , “ The Place of the Skull . ”
40027034	There they offered Jesus wine mixed with a bitter substance ; but after tasting it , he would not drink it .
40027035	They crucified him and then divided his clothes among them by throwing dice .
40027036	After that they sat there and watched him .
40027037	Above his head they put the written notice of the accusation against him : “ This is Jesus , the King of the Jews . ”
40027038	Then they crucified two bandits with Jesus , one on his right and the other on his left .
40027039	People passing by shook their heads and hurled insults at Jesus :
40027040	“ You were going to tear down the Temple and build it back up in three days ! Save yourself if you are God's Son ! Come on down from the cross ! ”
40027041	In the same way the chief priests and the teachers of the Law and the elders made fun of him :
40027042	“ He saved others , but he cannot save himself ! Isn't he the king of Israel ? If he will come down off the cross now , we will believe in him !
40027043	He trusts in God and claims to be God's Son . Well , then , let us see if God wants to save him now ! ”
40027044	Even the bandits who had been crucified with him insulted him in the same way .
40027045	At noon the whole country was covered with darkness , which lasted for three hours .
40027046	At about three o'clock Jesus cried out with a loud shout , “ Eli , Eli , lema sabachthani ? ” which means , “ My God , my God , why did you abandon me ? ”
40027047	Some of the people standing there heard him and said , “ He is calling for Elijah ! ”
40027048	One of them ran up at once , took a sponge , soaked it in cheap wine , put it on the end of a stick , and tried to make him drink it .
40027049	But the others said , “ Wait , let us see if Elijah is coming to save him ! ”
40027050	Jesus again gave a loud cry and breathed his last .
40027051	Then the curtain hanging in the Temple was torn in two from top to bottom . The earth shook , the rocks split apart ,
40027052	the graves broke open , and many of God's people who had died were raised to life .
40027053	They left the graves , and after Jesus rose from death , they went into the Holy City , where many people saw them .
40027054	When the army officer and the soldiers with him who were watching Jesus saw the earthquake and everything else that happened , they were terrified and said , “ He really was the Son of God ! ”
40027055	There were many women there , looking on from a distance , who had followed Jesus from Galilee and helped him .
40027056	Among them were Mary Magdalene , Mary the mother of James and Joseph , and the wife of Zebedee .
40027057	When it was evening , a rich man from Arimathea arrived ; his name was Joseph , and he also was a disciple of Jesus .
40027058	He went into the presence of Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus . Pilate gave orders for the body to be given to Joseph .
40027059	So Joseph took it , wrapped it in a new linen sheet ,
40027060	and placed it in his own tomb , which he had just recently dug out of solid rock . Then he rolled a large stone across the entrance to the tomb and went away .
40027061	Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there , facing the tomb .
40027062	The next day , which was a Sabbath , the chief priests and the Pharisees met with Pilate
40027063	and said , “ Sir , we remember that while that liar was still alive he said , ‘ I will be raised to life three days later . ’
40027064	Give orders , then , for his tomb to be carefully guarded until the third day , so that his disciples will not be able to go and steal the body , and then tell the people that he was raised from death . This last lie would be even worse than the first one . ”
40027065	“ Take a guard , ” Pilate told them ; “ go and make the tomb as secure as you can . ”
40027066	So they left and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and leaving the guard on watch .
40028001	After the Sabbath , as Sunday morning was dawning , Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb .
40028002	Suddenly there was a violent earthquake ; an angel of the Lord came down from heaven , rolled the stone away , and sat on it .
40028003	His appearance was like lightning , and his clothes were white as snow .
40028004	The guards were so afraid that they trembled and became like dead men .
40028005	The angel spoke to the women . “ You must not be afraid , ” he said . “ I know you are looking for Jesus , who was crucified .
40028006	He is not here ; he has been raised , just as he said . Come here and see the place where he was lying .
40028007	Go quickly now , and tell his disciples , ‘ He has been raised from death , and now he is going to Galilee ahead of you ; there you will see him ! ’ Remember what I have told you . ”
40028008	So they left the tomb in a hurry , afraid and yet filled with joy , and ran to tell his disciples .
40028009	Suddenly Jesus met them and said , “ Peace be with you . ” They came up to him , took hold of his feet , and worshiped him .
40028010	“ Do not be afraid , ” Jesus said to them . “ Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee , and there they will see me . ”
40028011	While the women went on their way , some of the soldiers guarding the tomb went back to the city and told the chief priests everything that had happened .
40028012	The chief priests met with the elders and made their plan ; they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers
40028013	and said , “ You are to say that his disciples came during the night and stole his body while you were asleep .
40028014	And if the Governor should hear of this , we will convince him that you are innocent , and you will have nothing to worry about . ”
40028015	The guards took the money and did what they were told to do . And so that is the report spread around by the Jews to this very day .
40028016	The eleven disciples went to the hill in Galilee where Jesus had told them to go .
40028017	When they saw him , they worshiped him , even though some of them doubted .
40028018	Jesus drew near and said to them , “ I have been given all authority in heaven and on earth .
40028019	Go , then , to all peoples everywhere and make them my disciples : baptize them in the name of the Father , the Son , and the Holy Spirit ,
40028020	and teach them to obey everything I have commanded you . And I will be with you always , to the end of the age . ”
41001001	This is the Good News about Jesus Christ , the Son of God .
41001002	It began as the prophet Isaiah had written : “ God said , ‘ I will send my messenger ahead of you to open the way for you . ’
41001003	Someone is shouting in the desert , ‘ Get the road ready for the Lord ; make a straight path for him to travel ! ’ ”
41001004	So John appeared in the desert , baptizing and preaching . “ Turn away from your sins and be baptized , ” he told the people , “ and God will forgive your sins . ”
41001005	Many people from the province of Judea and the city of Jerusalem went out to hear John . They confessed their sins , and he baptized them in the Jordan River .
41001006	John wore clothes made of camel's hair , with a leather belt around his waist , and his food was locusts and wild honey .
41001007	He announced to the people , “ The man who will come after me is much greater than I am . I am not good enough even to bend down and untie his sandals .
41001008	I baptize you with water , but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit . ”
41001009	Not long afterward Jesus came from Nazareth in the province of Galilee , and was baptized by John in the Jordan .
41001010	As soon as Jesus came up out of the water , he saw heaven opening and the Spirit coming down on him like a dove .
41001011	And a voice came from heaven , “ You are my own dear Son . I am pleased with you . ”
41001012	At once the Spirit made him go into the desert ,
41001013	where he stayed forty days , being tempted by Satan . Wild animals were there also , but angels came and helped him .
41001014	After John had been put in prison , Jesus went to Galilee and preached the Good News from God .
41001015	“ The right time has come , ” he said , “ and the Kingdom of God is near ! Turn away from your sins and believe the Good News ! ”
41001016	As Jesus walked along the shore of Lake Galilee , he saw two fishermen , Simon and his brother Andrew , catching fish with a net .
41001017	Jesus said to them , “ Come with me , and I will teach you to catch people . ”
41001018	At once they left their nets and went with him .
41001019	He went a little farther on and saw two other brothers , James and John , the sons of Zebedee . They were in their boat getting their nets ready .
41001020	As soon as Jesus saw them , he called them ; they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and went with Jesus .
41001021	Jesus and his disciples came to the town of Capernaum , and on the next Sabbath Jesus went to the synagogue and began to teach .
41001022	The people who heard him were amazed at the way he taught , for he wasn't like the teachers of the Law ; instead , he taught with authority .
41001023	Just then a man with an evil spirit came into the synagogue and screamed ,
41001024	“ What do you want with us , Jesus of Nazareth ? Are you here to destroy us ? I know who you are—you are God's holy messenger ! ”
41001025	Jesus ordered the spirit , “ Be quiet , and come out of the man ! ”
41001026	The evil spirit shook the man hard , gave a loud scream , and came out of him .
41001027	The people were all so amazed that they started saying to one another , “ What is this ? Is it some kind of new teaching ? This man has authority to give orders to the evil spirits , and they obey him ! ”
41001028	And so the news about Jesus spread quickly everywhere in the province of Galilee .
41001029	Jesus and his disciples , including James and John , left the synagogue and went straight to the home of Simon and Andrew .
41001030	Simon's mother-in-law was sick in bed with a fever , and as soon as Jesus arrived , he was told about her .
41001031	He went to her , took her by the hand , and helped her up . The fever left her , and she began to wait on them .
41001032	After the sun had set and evening had come , people brought to Jesus all the sick and those who had demons .
41001033	All the people of the town gathered in front of the house .
41001034	Jesus healed many who were sick with all kinds of diseases and drove out many demons . He would not let the demons say anything , because they knew who he was .
41001035	Very early the next morning , long before daylight , Jesus got up and left the house . He went out of town to a lonely place , where he prayed .
41001036	But Simon and his companions went out searching for him ,
41001037	and when they found him , they said , “ Everyone is looking for you . ”
41001038	But Jesus answered , “ We must go on to the other villages around here . I have to preach in them also , because that is why I came . ”
41001039	So he traveled all over Galilee , preaching in the synagogues and driving out demons .
41001040	A man suffering from a dreaded skin disease came to Jesus , knelt down , and begged him for help . “ If you want to , ” he said , “ you can make me clean . ”
41001041	Jesus was filled with pity , and reached out and touched him . “ I do want to , ” he answered . “ Be clean ! ”
41001042	At once the disease left the man , and he was clean .
41001043	Then Jesus spoke sternly to him and sent him away at once ,
41001044	after saying to him , “ Listen , don't tell anyone about this . But go straight to the priest and let him examine you ; then in order to prove to everyone that you are cured , offer the sacrifice that Moses ordered . ”
41001045	But the man went away and began to spread the news everywhere . Indeed , he talked so much that Jesus could not go into a town publicly . Instead , he stayed out in lonely places , and people came to him from everywhere .
41002001	A few days later Jesus went back to Capernaum , and the news spread that he was at home .
41002002	So many people came together that there was no room left , not even out in front of the door . Jesus was preaching the message to them
41002003	when four men arrived , carrying a paralyzed man to Jesus .
41002004	Because of the crowd , however , they could not get the man to him . So they made a hole in the roof right above the place where Jesus was . When they had made an opening , they let the man down , lying on his mat .
41002005	Seeing how much faith they had , Jesus said to the paralyzed man , “ My son , your sins are forgiven . ”
41002006	Some teachers of the Law who were sitting there thought to themselves ,
41002007	“ How does he dare talk like this ? This is blasphemy ! God is the only one who can forgive sins ! ”
41002008	At once Jesus knew what they were thinking , so he said to them , “ Why do you think such things ?
41002009	Is it easier to say to this paralyzed man , ‘ Your sins are forgiven , ’ or to say , ‘ Get up , pick up your mat , and walk ’ ?
41002010	I will prove to you , then , that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins . ” So he said to the paralyzed man ,
41002011	“ I tell you , get up , pick up your mat , and go home ! ”
41002012	While they all watched , the man got up , picked up his mat , and hurried away . They were all completely amazed and praised God , saying , “ We have never seen anything like this ! ”
41002013	Jesus went back again to the shore of Lake Galilee . A crowd came to him , and he started teaching them .
41002014	As he walked along , he saw a tax collector , Levi son of Alphaeus , sitting in his office . Jesus said to him , “ Follow me . ” Levi got up and followed him .
41002015	Later on Jesus was having a meal in Levi's house . A large number of tax collectors and other outcasts was following Jesus , and many of them joined him and his disciples at the table .
41002016	Some teachers of the Law , who were Pharisees , saw that Jesus was eating with these outcasts and tax collectors , so they asked his disciples , “ Why does he eat with such people ? ”
41002017	Jesus heard them and answered , “ People who are well do not need a doctor , but only those who are sick . I have not come to call respectable people , but outcasts . ”
41002018	On one occasion the followers of John the Baptist and the Pharisees were fasting . Some people came to Jesus and asked him , “ Why is it that the disciples of John the Baptist and the disciples of the Pharisees fast , but yours do not ? ”
41002019	Jesus answered , “ Do you expect the guests at a wedding party to go without food ? Of course not ! As long as the bridegroom is with them , they will not do that .
41002020	But the day will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them , and then they will fast .
41002021	“ No one uses a piece of new cloth to patch up an old coat , because the new patch will shrink and tear off some of the old cloth , making an even bigger hole .
41002022	Nor does anyone pour new wine into used wineskins , because the wine will burst the skins , and both the wine and the skins will be ruined . Instead , new wine must be poured into fresh wineskins . ”
41002023	Jesus was walking through some wheat fields on a Sabbath . As his disciples walked along with him , they began to pick the heads of wheat .
41002024	So the Pharisees said to Jesus , “ Look , it is against our Law for your disciples to do that on the Sabbath ! ”
41002025	Jesus answered , “ Have you never read what David did that time when he needed something to eat ? He and his men were hungry ,
41002026	so he went into the house of God and ate the bread offered to God . This happened when Abiathar was the High Priest . According to our Law only the priests may eat this bread—but David ate it and even gave it to his men . ”
41002027	And Jesus concluded , “ The Sabbath was made for the good of human beings ; they were not made for the Sabbath .
41002028	So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath . ”
41003001	Then Jesus went back to the synagogue , where there was a man who had a paralyzed hand .
41003002	Some people were there who wanted to accuse Jesus of doing wrong ; so they watched him closely to see whether he would cure the man on the Sabbath .
41003003	Jesus said to the man , “ Come up here to the front . ”
41003004	Then he asked the people , “ What does our Law allow us to do on the Sabbath ? To help or to harm ? To save someone's life or to destroy it ? ” But they did not say a thing .
41003005	Jesus was angry as he looked around at them , but at the same time he felt sorry for them , because they were so stubborn and wrong . Then he said to the man , “ Stretch out your hand . ” He stretched it out , and it became well again .
41003006	So the Pharisees left the synagogue and met at once with some members of Herod's party , and they made plans to kill Jesus .
41003007	Jesus and his disciples went away to Lake Galilee , and a large crowd followed him . They had come from Galilee , from Judea ,
41003008	from Jerusalem , from the territory of Idumea , from the territory on the east side of the Jordan , and from the region around the cities of Tyre and Sidon . All these people came to Jesus because they had heard of the things he was doing .
41003009	The crowd was so large that Jesus told his disciples to get a boat ready for him , so that the people would not crush him .
41003010	He had healed many people , and all the sick kept pushing their way to him in order to touch him .
41003011	And whenever the people who had evil spirits in them saw him , they would fall down before him and scream , “ You are the Son of God ! ”
41003012	Jesus sternly ordered the evil spirits not to tell anyone who he was .
41003013	Then Jesus went up a hill and called to himself the men he wanted . They came to him ,
41003014	and he chose twelve , whom he named apostles . “ I have chosen you to be with me , ” he told them . “ I will also send you out to preach ,
41003015	and you will have authority to drive out demons . ”
41003016	These are the twelve he chose : Simon ( Jesus gave him the name Peter ) ;
41003017	James and his brother John , the sons of Zebedee ( Jesus gave them the name Boanerges , which means “ Men of Thunder ” ) ;
41003018	Andrew , Philip , Bartholomew , Matthew , Thomas , James son of Alphaeus , Thaddaeus , Simon the Patriot ,
41003019	and Judas Iscariot , who betrayed Jesus .
41003020	Then Jesus went home . Again such a large crowd gathered that Jesus and his disciples had no time to eat .
41003021	When his family heard about it , they set out to take charge of him , because people were saying , “ He's gone mad ! ”
41003022	Some teachers of the Law who had come from Jerusalem were saying , “ He has Beelzebul in him ! It is the chief of the demons who gives him the power to drive them out . ”
41003023	So Jesus called them to him and spoke to them in parables : “ How can Satan drive out Satan ?
41003024	If a country divides itself into groups which fight each other , that country will fall apart .
41003025	If a family divides itself into groups which fight each other , that family will fall apart .
41003026	So if Satan's kingdom divides into groups , it cannot last , but will fall apart and come to an end .
41003027	“ No one can break into a strong man's house and take away his belongings unless he first ties up the strong man ; then he can plunder his house .
41003028	“ I assure you that people can be forgiven all their sins and all the evil things they may say .
41003029	But whoever says evil things against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven , because he has committed an eternal sin . ” (
41003030	Jesus said this because some people were saying , “ He has an evil spirit in him . ” )
41003031	Then Jesus' mother and brothers arrived . They stood outside the house and sent in a message , asking for him .
41003032	A crowd was sitting around Jesus , and they said to him , “ Look , your mother and your brothers and sisters are outside , and they want you . ”
41003033	Jesus answered , “ Who is my mother ? Who are my brothers ? ”
41003034	He looked at the people sitting around him and said , “ Look ! Here are my mother and my brothers !
41003035	Whoever does what God wants is my brother , my sister , my mother . ”
41004001	Again Jesus began to teach beside Lake Galilee . The crowd that gathered around him was so large that he got into a boat and sat in it . The boat was out in the water , and the crowd stood on the shore at the water's edge .
41004002	He used parables to teach them many things , saying to them :
41004003	“ Listen ! Once there was a man who went out to sow grain .
41004004	As he scattered the seed in the field , some of it fell along the path , and the birds came and ate it up .
41004005	Some of it fell on rocky ground , where there was little soil . The seeds soon sprouted , because the soil wasn't deep .
41004006	Then , when the sun came up , it burned the young plants ; and because the roots had not grown deep enough , the plants soon dried up .
41004007	Some of the seed fell among thorn bushes , which grew up and choked the plants , and they didn't bear grain .
41004008	But some seeds fell in good soil , and the plants sprouted , grew , and bore grain : some had thirty grains , others sixty , and others one hundred . ”
41004009	And Jesus concluded , “ Listen , then , if you have ears ! ”
41004010	When Jesus was alone , some of those who had heard him came to him with the twelve disciples and asked him to explain the parables .
41004011	“ You have been given the secret of the Kingdom of God , ” Jesus answered . “ But the others , who are on the outside , hear all things by means of parables ,
41004012	so that , ‘ They may look and look , yet not see ; they may listen and listen , yet not understand . For if they did , they would turn to God , and he would forgive them . ’ ”
41004013	Then Jesus asked them , “ Don't you understand this parable ? How , then , will you ever understand any parable ?
41004014	The sower sows God's message .
41004015	Some people are like the seeds that fall along the path ; as soon as they hear the message , Satan comes and takes it away .
41004016	Other people are like the seeds that fall on rocky ground . As soon as they hear the message , they receive it gladly .
41004017	But it does not sink deep into them , and they don't last long . So when trouble or persecution comes because of the message , they give up at once .
41004018	Other people are like the seeds sown among the thorn bushes . These are the ones who hear the message ,
41004019	but the worries about this life , the love for riches , and all other kinds of desires crowd in and choke the message , and they don't bear fruit .
41004020	But other people are like seeds sown in good soil . They hear the message , accept it , and bear fruit : some thirty , some sixty , and some one hundred . ”
41004021	Jesus continued , “ Does anyone ever bring in a lamp and put it under a bowl or under the bed ? Isn't it put on the lampstand ?
41004022	Whatever is hidden away will be brought out into the open , and whatever is covered up will be uncovered .
41004023	Listen , then , if you have ears ! ”
41004024	He also said to them , “ Pay attention to what you hear ! The same rules you use to judge others will be used by God to judge you—but with even greater severity .
41004025	Those who have something will be given more , and those who have nothing will have taken away from them even the little they have . ”
41004026	Jesus went on to say , “ The Kingdom of God is like this . A man scatters seed in his field .
41004027	He sleeps at night , is up and about during the day , and all the while the seeds are sprouting and growing . Yet he does not know how it happens .
41004028	The soil itself makes the plants grow and bear fruit ; first the tender stalk appears , then the head , and finally the head full of grain .
41004029	When the grain is ripe , the man starts cutting it with his sickle , because harvest time has come .
41004030	“ What shall we say the Kingdom of God is like ? ” asked Jesus . “ What parable shall we use to explain it ?
41004031	It is like this . A man takes a mustard seed , the smallest seed in the world , and plants it in the ground .
41004032	After a while it grows up and becomes the biggest of all plants . It puts out such large branches that the birds come and make their nests in its shade . ”
41004033	Jesus preached his message to the people , using many other parables like these ; he told them as much as they could understand .
41004034	He would not speak to them without using parables , but when he was alone with his disciples , he would explain everything to them .
41004035	On the evening of that same day Jesus said to his disciples , “ Let us go across to the other side of the lake . ”
41004036	So they left the crowd ; the disciples got into the boat in which Jesus was already sitting , and they took him with them . Other boats were there too .
41004037	Suddenly a strong wind blew up , and the waves began to spill over into the boat , so that it was about to fill with water .
41004038	Jesus was in the back of the boat , sleeping with his head on a pillow . The disciples woke him up and said , “ Teacher , don't you care that we are about to die ? ”
41004039	Jesus stood up and commanded the wind , “ Be quiet ! ” and he said to the waves , “ Be still ! ” The wind died down , and there was a great calm .
41004040	Then Jesus said to his disciples , “ Why are you frightened ? Do you still have no faith ? ”
41004041	But they were terribly afraid and began to say to one another , “ Who is this man ? Even the wind and the waves obey him ! ”
41005001	Jesus and his disciples arrived on the other side of Lake Galilee , in the territory of Gerasa .
41005002	As soon as Jesus got out of the boat , he was met by a man who came out of the burial caves there . This man had an evil spirit in him
41005003	and lived among the tombs . Nobody could keep him tied with chains any more ;
41005004	many times his feet and his hands had been tied , but every time he broke the chains and smashed the irons on his feet . He was too strong for anyone to control him .
41005005	Day and night he wandered among the tombs and through the hills , screaming and cutting himself with stones .
41005006	He was some distance away when he saw Jesus ; so he ran , fell on his knees before him ,
41005007	and screamed in a loud voice , “ Jesus , Son of the Most High God ! What do you want with me ? For God's sake , I beg you , don't punish me ! ” (
41005008	He said this because Jesus was saying , “ Evil spirit , come out of this man ! ” )
41005009	So Jesus asked him , “ What is your name ? ” The man answered , “ My name is ‘ Mob ’ —there are so many of us ! ”
41005010	And he kept begging Jesus not to send the evil spirits out of that region .
41005011	There was a large herd of pigs near by , feeding on a hillside .
41005012	So the spirits begged Jesus , “ Send us to the pigs , and let us go into them . ”
41005013	He let them go , and the evil spirits went out of the man and entered the pigs . The whole herd—about two thousand pigs in all—rushed down the side of the cliff into the lake and was drowned .
41005014	The men who had been taking care of the pigs ran away and spread the news in the town and among the farms . People went out to see what had happened ,
41005015	and when they came to Jesus , they saw the man who used to have the mob of demons in him . He was sitting there , clothed and in his right mind ; and they were all afraid .
41005016	Those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the man with the demons , and about the pigs .
41005017	So they asked Jesus to leave their territory .
41005018	As Jesus was getting into the boat , the man who had had the demons begged him , “ Let me go with you ! ”
41005019	But Jesus would not let him . Instead , he told him , “ Go back home to your family and tell them how much the Lord has done for you and how kind he has been to you . ”
41005020	So the man left and went all through the Ten Towns , telling what Jesus had done for him . And all who heard it were amazed .
41005021	Jesus went back across to the other side of the lake . There at the lakeside a large crowd gathered around him .
41005022	Jairus , an official of the local synagogue , arrived , and when he saw Jesus , he threw himself down at his feet
41005023	and begged him earnestly , “ My little daughter is very sick . Please come and place your hands on her , so that she will get well and live ! ”
41005024	Then Jesus started off with him . So many people were going along with Jesus that they were crowding him from every side .
41005025	There was a woman who had suffered terribly from severe bleeding for twelve years ,
41005026	even though she had been treated by many doctors . She had spent all her money , but instead of getting better she got worse all the time .
41005027	She had heard about Jesus , so she came in the crowd behind him ,
41005028	saying to herself , “ If I just touch his clothes , I will get well . ”
41005029	She touched his cloak , and her bleeding stopped at once ; and she had the feeling inside herself that she was healed of her trouble .
41005030	At once Jesus knew that power had gone out of him , so he turned around in the crowd and asked , “ Who touched my clothes ? ”
41005031	His disciples answered , “ You see how the people are crowding you ; why do you ask who touched you ? ”
41005032	But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it .
41005033	The woman realized what had happened to her , so she came , trembling with fear , knelt at his feet , and told him the whole truth .
41005034	Jesus said to her , “ My daughter , your faith has made you well . Go in peace , and be healed of your trouble . ”
41005035	While Jesus was saying this , some messengers came from Jairus' house and told him , “ Your daughter has died . Why bother the Teacher any longer ? ”
41005036	Jesus paid no attention to what they said , but told him , “ Don't be afraid , only believe . ”
41005037	Then he did not let anyone else go on with him except Peter and James and his brother John .
41005038	They arrived at Jairus' house , where Jesus saw the confusion and heard all the loud crying and wailing .
41005039	He went in and said to them , “ Why all this confusion ? Why are you crying ? The child is not dead—she is only sleeping ! ”
41005040	They started making fun of him , so he put them all out , took the child's father and mother and his three disciples , and went into the room where the child was lying .
41005041	He took her by the hand and said to her , “ Talitha , koum , ” which means , “ Little girl , I tell you to get up ! ”
41005042	She got up at once and started walking around . ( She was twelve years old . ) When this happened , they were completely amazed .
41005043	But Jesus gave them strict orders not to tell anyone , and he said , “ Give her something to eat . ”
41006001	Jesus left that place and went back to his hometown , followed by his disciples .
41006002	On the Sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue . Many people were there ; and when they heard him , they were all amazed . “ Where did he get all this ? ” they asked . “ What wisdom is this that has been given him ? How does he perform miracles ?
41006003	Isn't he the carpenter , the son of Mary , and the brother of James , Joseph , Judas , and Simon ? Aren't his sisters living here ? ” And so they rejected him .
41006004	Jesus said to them , “ Prophets are respected everywhere except in their own hometown and by their relatives and their family . ”
41006005	He was not able to perform any miracles there , except that he placed his hands on a few sick people and healed them .
41006006	He was greatly surprised , because the people did not have faith . Then Jesus went to the villages around there , teaching the people .
41006007	He called the twelve disciples together and sent them out two by two . He gave them authority over the evil spirits
41006008	and ordered them , “ Don't take anything with you on the trip except a walking stick—no bread , no beggar's bag , no money in your pockets .
41006009	Wear sandals , but don't carry an extra shirt . ”
41006010	He also told them , “ Wherever you are welcomed , stay in the same house until you leave that place .
41006011	If you come to a town where people do not welcome you or will not listen to you , leave it and shake the dust off your feet . That will be a warning to them ! ”
41006012	So they went out and preached that people should turn away from their sins .
41006013	They drove out many demons , and rubbed olive oil on many sick people and healed them .
41006014	Now King Herod heard about all this , because Jesus' reputation had spread everywhere . Some people were saying , “ John the Baptist has come back to life ! That is why he has this power to perform miracles . ”
41006015	Others , however , said , “ He is Elijah . ” Others said , “ He is a prophet , like one of the prophets of long ago . ”
41006016	When Herod heard it , he said , “ He is John the Baptist ! I had his head cut off , but he has come back to life ! ”
41006017	Herod himself had ordered John's arrest , and he had him tied up and put in prison . Herod did this because of Herodias , whom he had married , even though she was the wife of his brother Philip .
41006018	John the Baptist kept telling Herod , “ It isn't right for you to marry your brother's wife ! ”
41006019	So Herodias held a grudge against John and wanted to kill him , but she could not because of Herod .
41006020	Herod was afraid of John because he knew that John was a good and holy man , and so he kept him safe . He liked to listen to him , even though he became greatly disturbed every time he heard him .
41006021	Finally Herodias got her chance . It was on Herod's birthday , when he gave a feast for all the top government officials , the military chiefs , and the leading citizens of Galilee .
41006022	The daughter of Herodias came in and danced , and pleased Herod and his guests . So the king said to the girl , “ What would you like to have ? I will give you anything you want . ”
41006023	With many vows he said to her , “ I swear that I will give you anything you ask for , even as much as half my kingdom ! ”
41006024	So the girl went out and asked her mother , “ What shall I ask for ? ” “ The head of John the Baptist , ” she answered .
41006025	The girl hurried back at once to the king and demanded , “ I want you to give me here and now the head of John the Baptist on a plate ! ”
41006026	This made the king very sad , but he could not refuse her because of the vows he had made in front of all his guests .
41006027	So he sent off a guard at once with orders to bring John's head . The guard left , went to the prison , and cut John's head off ;
41006028	then he brought it on a plate and gave it to the girl , who gave it to her mother .
41006029	When John's disciples heard about this , they came and got his body , and buried it .
41006030	The apostles returned and met with Jesus , and told him all they had done and taught .
41006031	There were so many people coming and going that Jesus and his disciples didn't even have time to eat . So he said to them , “ Let us go off by ourselves to some place where we will be alone and you can rest a while . ”
41006032	So they started out in a boat by themselves to a lonely place .
41006033	Many people , however , saw them leave and knew at once who they were ; so they went from all the towns and ran ahead by land and arrived at the place ahead of Jesus and his disciples .
41006034	When Jesus got out of the boat , he saw this large crowd , and his heart was filled with pity for them , because they were like sheep without a shepherd . So he began to teach them many things .
41006035	When it was getting late , his disciples came to him and said , “ It is already very late , and this is a lonely place .
41006036	Send the people away , and let them go to the nearby farms and villages in order to buy themselves something to eat . ”
41006037	“ You yourselves give them something to eat , ” Jesus answered . They asked , “ Do you want us to go and spend two hundred silver coins on bread in order to feed them ? ”
41006038	So Jesus asked them , “ How much bread do you have ? Go and see . ” When they found out , they told him , “ Five loaves and also two fish . ”
41006039	Jesus then told his disciples to make all the people divide into groups and sit down on the green grass .
41006040	So the people sat down in rows , in groups of a hundred and groups of fifty .
41006041	Then Jesus took the five loaves and the two fish , looked up to heaven , and gave thanks to God . He broke the loaves and gave them to his disciples to distribute to the people . He also divided the two fish among them all .
41006042	Everyone ate and had enough .
41006043	Then the disciples took up twelve baskets full of what was left of the bread and the fish .
41006044	The number of men who were fed was five thousand .
41006045	At once Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to Bethsaida , on the other side of the lake , while he sent the crowd away .
41006046	After saying good-bye to the people , he went away to a hill to pray .
41006047	When evening came , the boat was in the middle of the lake , while Jesus was alone on land .
41006048	He saw that his disciples were straining at the oars , because they were rowing against the wind ; so sometime between three and six o'clock in the morning , he came to them , walking on the water . He was going to pass them by ,
41006049	but they saw him walking on the water . “ It's a ghost ! ” they thought , and screamed .
41006050	They were all terrified when they saw him . Jesus spoke to them at once , “ Courage ! ” he said . “ It is I . Don't be afraid ! ”
41006051	Then he got into the boat with them , and the wind died down . The disciples were completely amazed ,
41006052	because they had not understood the real meaning of the feeding of the five thousand ; their minds could not grasp it .
41006053	They crossed the lake and came to land at Gennesaret , where they tied up the boat .
41006054	As they left the boat , people recognized Jesus at once .
41006055	So they ran throughout the whole region ; and wherever they heard he was , they brought to him the sick lying on their mats .
41006056	And everywhere Jesus went , to villages , towns , or farms , people would take their sick to the marketplaces and beg him to let the sick at least touch the edge of his cloak . And all who touched it were made well .
41007001	Some Pharisees and teachers of the Law who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus .
41007002	They noticed that some of his disciples were eating their food with hands that were ritually unclean—that is , they had not washed them in the way the Pharisees said people should . (
41007003	For the Pharisees , as well as the rest of the Jews , follow the teaching they received from their ancestors : they do not eat unless they wash their hands in the proper way ;
41007004	nor do they eat anything that comes from the market unless they wash it first . And they follow many other rules which they have received , such as the proper way to wash cups , pots , copper bowls , and beds . )
41007005	So the Pharisees and the teachers of the Law asked Jesus , “ Why is it that your disciples do not follow the teaching handed down by our ancestors , but instead eat with ritually unclean hands ? ”
41007006	Jesus answered them , “ How right Isaiah was when he prophesied about you ! You are hypocrites , just as he wrote : ‘ These people , says God , honor me with their words , but their heart is really far away from me .
41007007	It is no use for them to worship me , because they teach human rules as though they were my laws ! ’
41007008	“ You put aside God's command and obey human teachings . ”
41007009	And Jesus continued , “ You have a clever way of rejecting God's law in order to uphold your own teaching .
41007010	For Moses commanded , ‘ Respect your father and your mother , ’ and , ‘ If you curse your father or your mother , you are to be put to death . ’
41007011	But you teach that if people have something they could use to help their father or mother , but say , ‘ This is Corban ’ ( which means , it belongs to God ) ,
41007012	they are excused from helping their father or mother .
41007013	In this way the teaching you pass on to others cancels out the word of God . And there are many other things like this that you do . ”
41007014	Then Jesus called the crowd to him once more and said to them , “ Listen to me , all of you , and understand .
41007015	There is nothing that goes into you from the outside which can make you ritually unclean . Rather , it is what comes out of you that makes you unclean . ”
41007017	When he left the crowd and went into the house , his disciples asked him to explain this saying .
41007018	“ You are no more intelligent than the others , ” Jesus said to them . “ Don't you understand ? Nothing that goes into you from the outside can really make you unclean ,
41007019	because it does not go into your heart but into your stomach and then goes on out of the body . ” ( In saying this , Jesus declared that all foods are fit to be eaten . )
41007020	And he went on to say , “ It is what comes out of you that makes you unclean .
41007021	For from the inside , from your heart , come the evil ideas which lead you to do immoral things , to rob , kill ,
41007022	commit adultery , be greedy , and do all sorts of evil things ; deceit , indecency , jealousy , slander , pride , and folly—
41007023	all these evil things come from inside you and make you unclean . ”
41007024	Then Jesus left and went away to the territory near the city of Tyre . He went into a house and did not want anyone to know he was there , but he could not stay hidden .
41007025	A woman , whose daughter had an evil spirit in her , heard about Jesus and came to him at once and fell at his feet .
41007026	The woman was a Gentile , born in the region of Phoenicia in Syria . She begged Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter .
41007027	But Jesus answered , “ Let us first feed the children . It isn't right to take the children's food and throw it to the dogs . ”
41007028	“ Sir , ” she answered , “ even the dogs under the table eat the children's leftovers ! ”
41007029	So Jesus said to her , “ Because of that answer , go back home , where you will find that the demon has gone out of your daughter ! ”
41007030	She went home and found her child lying on the bed ; the demon had indeed gone out of her .
41007031	Jesus then left the neighborhood of Tyre and went on through Sidon to Lake Galilee , going by way of the territory of the Ten Towns .
41007032	Some people brought him a man who was deaf and could hardly speak , and they begged Jesus to place his hands on him .
41007033	So Jesus took him off alone , away from the crowd , put his fingers in the man's ears , spat , and touched the man's tongue .
41007034	Then Jesus looked up to heaven , gave a deep groan , and said to the man , “ Ephphatha , ” which means , “ Open up ! ”
41007035	At once the man was able to hear , his speech impediment was removed , and he began to talk without any trouble .
41007036	Then Jesus ordered the people not to speak of it to anyone ; but the more he ordered them not to , the more they told it .
41007037	And all who heard were completely amazed . “ How well he does everything ! ” they exclaimed . “ He even causes the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak ! ”
41008001	Not long afterward another large crowd came together . When the people had nothing left to eat , Jesus called the disciples to him and said ,
41008002	“ I feel sorry for these people , because they have been with me for three days and now have nothing to eat .
41008003	If I send them home without feeding them , they will faint as they go , because some of them have come a long way . ”
41008004	His disciples asked him , “ Where in this desert can anyone find enough food to feed all these people ? ”
41008005	“ How much bread do you have ? ” Jesus asked . “ Seven loaves , ” they answered .
41008006	He ordered the crowd to sit down on the ground . Then he took the seven loaves , gave thanks to God , broke them , and gave them to his disciples to distribute to the crowd ; and the disciples did so .
41008007	They also had a few small fish . Jesus gave thanks for these and told the disciples to distribute them too .
41008010	and at once got into a boat with his disciples and went to the district of Dalmanutha .
41008011	Some Pharisees came to Jesus and started to argue with him . They wanted to trap him , so they asked him to perform a miracle to show that God approved of him .
41008012	But Jesus gave a deep groan and said , “ Why do the people of this day ask for a miracle ? No , I tell you ! No such proof will be given to these people ! ”
41008013	He left them , got back into the boat , and started across to the other side of the lake .
41008014	The disciples had forgotten to bring enough bread and had only one loaf with them in the boat .
41008015	“ Take care , ” Jesus warned them , “ and be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod . ”
41008016	They started discussing among themselves : “ He says this because we don't have any bread . ”
41008017	Jesus knew what they were saying , so he asked them , “ Why are you discussing about not having any bread ? Don't you know or understand yet ? Are your minds so dull ?
41008018	You have eyes—can't you see ? You have ears—can't you hear ? Don't you remember
41008019	when I broke the five loaves for the five thousand people ? How many baskets full of leftover pieces did you take up ? ” “ Twelve , ” they answered .
41008020	“ And when I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand people , ” asked Jesus , “ how many baskets full of leftover pieces did you take up ? ” “ Seven , ” they answered .
41008021	“ And you still don't understand ? ” he asked them .
41008022	They came to Bethsaida , where some people brought a blind man to Jesus and begged him to touch him .
41008023	Jesus took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village . After spitting on the man's eyes , Jesus placed his hands on him and asked him , “ Can you see anything ? ”
41008024	The man looked up and said , “ Yes , I can see people , but they look like trees walking around . ”
41008025	Jesus again placed his hands on the man's eyes . This time the man looked intently , his eyesight returned , and he saw everything clearly .
41008026	Jesus then sent him home with the order , “ Don't go back into the village . ”
41008027	Then Jesus and his disciples went away to the villages near Caesarea Philippi . On the way he asked them , “ Tell me , who do people say I am ? ”
41008028	“ Some say that you are John the Baptist , ” they answered ; “ others say that you are Elijah , while others say that you are one of the prophets . ”
41008029	“ What about you ? ” he asked them . “ Who do you say I am ? ” Peter answered , “ You are the Messiah . ”
41008030	Then Jesus ordered them , “ Do not tell anyone about me . ”
41008031	Then Jesus began to teach his disciples : “ The Son of Man must suffer much and be rejected by the elders , the chief priests , and the teachers of the Law . He will be put to death , but three days later he will rise to life . ”
41008032	He made this very clear to them . So Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him .
41008033	But Jesus turned around , looked at his disciples , and rebuked Peter . “ Get away from me , Satan , ” he said . “ Your thoughts don't come from God but from human nature ! ”
41008034	Then Jesus called the crowd and his disciples to him . “ If any of you want to come with me , ” he told them , “ you must forget yourself , carry your cross , and follow me .
41008035	For if you want to save your own life , you will lose it ; but if you lose your life for me and for the gospel , you will save it .
41008036	Do you gain anything if you win the whole world but lose your life ? Of course not !
41008037	There is nothing you can give to regain your life .
41008038	If you are ashamed of me and of my teaching in this godless and wicked day , then the Son of Man will be ashamed of you when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels . ”
41009001	And he went on to say , “ I tell you , there are some here who will not die until they have seen the Kingdom of God come with power . ”
41009002	Six days later Jesus took with him Peter , James , and John , and led them up a high mountain , where they were alone . As they looked on , a change came over Jesus ,
41009003	and his clothes became shining white—whiter than anyone in the world could wash them .
41009004	Then the three disciples saw Elijah and Moses talking with Jesus .
41009005	Peter spoke up and said to Jesus , “ Teacher , how good it is that we are here ! We will make three tents , one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . ”
41009006	He and the others were so frightened that he did not know what to say .
41009007	Then a cloud appeared and covered them with its shadow , and a voice came from the cloud , “ This is my own dear Son—listen to him ! ”
41009008	They took a quick look around but did not see anyone else ; only Jesus was with them .
41009009	As they came down the mountain , Jesus ordered them , “ Don't tell anyone what you have seen , until the Son of Man has risen from death . ”
41009010	They obeyed his order , but among themselves they started discussing the matter , “ What does this ‘ rising from death ’ mean ? ”
41009011	And they asked Jesus , “ Why do the teachers of the Law say that Elijah has to come first ? ”
41009012	His answer was , “ Elijah is indeed coming first in order to get everything ready . Yet why do the Scriptures say that the Son of Man will suffer much and be rejected ?
41009013	I tell you , however , that Elijah has already come and that people treated him just as they pleased , as the Scriptures say about him . ”
41009014	When they joined the rest of the disciples , they saw a large crowd around them and some teachers of the Law arguing with them .
41009015	When the people saw Jesus , they were greatly surprised , and ran to him and greeted him .
41009016	Jesus asked his disciples , “ What are you arguing with them about ? ”
41009017	A man in the crowd answered , “ Teacher , I brought my son to you , because he has an evil spirit in him and cannot talk .
41009018	Whenever the spirit attacks him , it throws him to the ground , and he foams at the mouth , grits his teeth , and becomes stiff all over . I asked your disciples to drive the spirit out , but they could not . ”
41009019	Jesus said to them , “ How unbelieving you people are ! How long must I stay with you ? How long do I have to put up with you ? Bring the boy to me ! ”
41009020	They brought him to Jesus . As soon as the spirit saw Jesus , it threw the boy into a fit , so that he fell on the ground and rolled around , foaming at the mouth .
41009021	“ How long has he been like this ? ” Jesus asked the father . “ Ever since he was a child , ” he replied .
41009022	“ Many times the evil spirit has tried to kill him by throwing him in the fire and into water . Have pity on us and help us , if you possibly can ! ”
41009023	“ Yes , ” said Jesus , “ if you yourself can ! Everything is possible for the person who has faith . ”
41009024	The father at once cried out , “ I do have faith , but not enough . Help me have more ! ”
41009025	Jesus noticed that the crowd was closing in on them , so he gave a command to the evil spirit . “ Deaf and dumb spirit , ” he said , “ I order you to come out of the boy and never go into him again ! ”
41009026	The spirit screamed , threw the boy into a bad fit , and came out . The boy looked like a corpse , and everyone said , “ He is dead ! ”
41009027	But Jesus took the boy by the hand and helped him rise , and he stood up .
41009028	After Jesus had gone indoors , his disciples asked him privately , “ Why couldn't we drive the spirit out ? ”
41009029	“ Only prayer can drive this kind out , ” answered Jesus ; “ nothing else can . ”
41009030	Jesus and his disciples left that place and went on through Galilee . Jesus did not want anyone to know where he was ,
41009031	because he was teaching his disciples : “ The Son of Man will be handed over to those who will kill him . Three days later , however , he will rise to life . ”
41009032	But they did not understand what this teaching meant , and they were afraid to ask him .
41009033	They came to Capernaum , and after going indoors Jesus asked his disciples , “ What were you arguing about on the road ? ”
41009034	But they would not answer him , because on the road they had been arguing among themselves about who was the greatest .
41009035	Jesus sat down , called the twelve disciples , and said to them , “ Whoever wants to be first must place himself last of all and be the servant of all . ”
41009036	Then he took a child and had him stand in front of them . He put his arms around him and said to them ,
41009037	“ Whoever welcomes in my name one of these children , welcomes me ; and whoever welcomes me , welcomes not only me but also the one who sent me . ”
41009038	John said to him , “ Teacher , we saw a man who was driving out demons in your name , and we told him to stop , because he doesn't belong to our group . ”
41009039	“ Do not try to stop him , ” Jesus told them , “ because no one who performs a miracle in my name will be able soon afterward to say evil things about me .
41009040	For whoever is not against us is for us .
41009041	I assure you that anyone who gives you a drink of water because you belong to me will certainly receive a reward .
41009042	“ If anyone should cause one of these little ones to lose faith in me , it would be better for that person to have a large millstone tied around the neck and be thrown into the sea .
41009043	So if your hand makes you lose your faith , cut it off ! It is better for you to enter life without a hand than to keep both hands and go off to hell , to the fire that never goes out .
41009045	And if your foot makes you lose your faith , cut it off ! It is better for you to enter life without a foot than to keep both feet and be thrown into hell .
41009047	And if your eye makes you lose your faith , take it out ! It is better for you to enter the Kingdom of God with only one eye than to keep both eyes and be thrown into hell .
41009048	There ‘ the worms that eat them never die , and the fire that burns them is never put out . ’
41009049	“ Everyone will be purified by fire as a sacrifice is purified by salt .
41009050	“ Salt is good ; but if it loses its saltiness , how can you make it salty again ? “ Have the salt of friendship among yourselves , and live in peace with one another . ”
41010001	Then Jesus left that place , went to the province of Judea , and crossed the Jordan River . Crowds came flocking to him again , and he taught them , as he always did .
41010002	Some Pharisees came to him and tried to trap him . “ Tell us , ” they asked , “ does our Law allow a man to divorce his wife ? ”
41010003	Jesus answered with a question , “ What law did Moses give you ? ”
41010004	Their answer was , “ Moses gave permission for a man to write a divorce notice and send his wife away . ”
41010005	Jesus said to them , “ Moses wrote this law for you because you are so hard to teach .
41010006	But in the beginning , at the time of creation , ‘ God made them male and female , ’ as the scripture says .
41010007	‘ And for this reason a man will leave his father and mother and unite with his wife ,
41010008	and the two will become one . ’ So they are no longer two , but one .
41010009	No human being must separate , then , what God has joined together . ”
41010010	When they went back into the house , the disciples asked Jesus about this matter .
41010011	He said to them , “ A man who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against his wife .
41010012	In the same way , a woman who divorces her husband and marries another man commits adultery . ”
41010013	Some people brought children to Jesus for him to place his hands on them , but the disciples scolded the people .
41010014	When Jesus noticed this , he was angry and said to his disciples , “ Let the children come to me , and do not stop them , because the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these .
41010015	I assure you that whoever does not receive the Kingdom of God like a child will never enter it . ”
41010016	Then he took the children in his arms , placed his hands on each of them , and blessed them .
41010017	As Jesus was starting on his way again , a man ran up , knelt before him , and asked him , “ Good Teacher , what must I do to receive eternal life ? ”
41010018	“ Why do you call me good ? ” Jesus asked him . “ No one is good except God alone .
41010019	You know the commandments : ‘ Do not commit murder ; do not commit adultery ; do not steal ; do not accuse anyone falsely ; do not cheat ; respect your father and your mother . ’ ”
41010020	“ Teacher , ” the man said , “ ever since I was young , I have obeyed all these commandments . ”
41010021	Jesus looked straight at him with love and said , “ You need only one thing . Go and sell all you have and give the money to the poor , and you will have riches in heaven ; then come and follow me . ”
41010022	When the man heard this , gloom spread over his face , and he went away sad , because he was very rich .
41010023	Jesus looked around at his disciples and said to them , “ How hard it will be for rich people to enter the Kingdom of God ! ”
41010024	The disciples were shocked at these words , but Jesus went on to say , “ My children , how hard it is to enter the Kingdom of God !
41010025	It is much harder for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of God than for a camel to go through the eye of a needle . ”
41010026	At this the disciples were completely amazed and asked one another , “ Who , then , can be saved ? ”
41010027	Jesus looked straight at them and answered , “ This is impossible for human beings but not for God ; everything is possible for God . ”
41010028	Then Peter spoke up , “ Look , we have left everything and followed you . ”
41010029	“ Yes , ” Jesus said to them , “ and I tell you that those who leave home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and for the gospel ,
41010030	will receive much more in this present age . They will receive a hundred times more houses , brothers , sisters , mothers , children , and fields—and persecutions as well ; and in the age to come they will receive eternal life .
41010031	But many who are now first will be last , and many who are now last will be first . ”
41010032	Jesus and his disciples were now on the road going up to Jerusalem . Jesus was going ahead of the disciples , who were filled with alarm ; the people who followed behind were afraid . Once again Jesus took the twelve disciples aside and spoke of the things that were going to happen to him .
41010033	“ Listen , ” he told them , “ we are going up to Jerusalem where the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the Law . They will condemn him to death and then hand him over to the Gentiles ,
41010034	who will make fun of him , spit on him , whip him , and kill him ; but three days later he will rise to life . ”
41010035	Then James and John , the sons of Zebedee , came to Jesus . “ Teacher , ” they said , “ there is something we want you to do for us . ”
41010036	“ What is it ? ” Jesus asked them .
41010037	They answered , “ When you sit on your throne in your glorious Kingdom , we want you to let us sit with you , one at your right and one at your left . ”
41010038	Jesus said to them , “ You don't know what you are asking for . Can you drink the cup of suffering that I must drink ? Can you be baptized in the way I must be baptized ? ”
41010039	“ We can , ” they answered . Jesus said to them , “ You will indeed drink the cup I must drink and be baptized in the way I must be baptized .
41010040	But I do not have the right to choose who will sit at my right and my left . It is God who will give these places to those for whom he has prepared them . ”
41010041	When the other ten disciples heard about it , they became angry with James and John .
41010042	So Jesus called them all together to him and said , “ You know that those who are considered rulers of the heathen have power over them , and the leaders have complete authority .
41010043	This , however , is not the way it is among you . If one of you wants to be great , you must be the servant of the rest ;
41010044	and if one of you wants to be first , you must be the slave of all .
41010045	For even the Son of Man did not come to be served ; he came to serve and to give his life to redeem many people . ”
41010046	They came to Jericho , and as Jesus was leaving with his disciples and a large crowd , a blind beggar named Bartimaeus son of Timaeus was sitting by the road .
41010047	When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth , he began to shout , “ Jesus ! Son of David ! Have mercy on me ! ”
41010048	Many of the people scolded him and told him to be quiet . But he shouted even more loudly , “ Son of David , have mercy on me ! ”
41010049	Jesus stopped and said , “ Call him . ” So they called the blind man . “ Cheer up ! ” they said . “ Get up , he is calling you . ”
41010050	So he threw off his cloak , jumped up , and came to Jesus .
41010051	“ What do you want me to do for you ? ” Jesus asked him . “ Teacher , ” the blind man answered , “ I want to see again . ”
41010052	“ Go , ” Jesus told him , “ your faith has made you well . ” At once he was able to see and followed Jesus on the road .
41011001	As they approached Jerusalem , near the towns of Bethphage and Bethany , they came to the Mount of Olives . Jesus sent two of his disciples on ahead
41011002	with these instructions : “ Go to the village there ahead of you . As soon as you get there , you will find a colt tied up that has never been ridden . Untie it and bring it here .
41011003	And if someone asks you why you are doing that , say that the Master needs it and will send it back at once . ”
41011004	So they went and found a colt out in the street , tied to the door of a house . As they were untying it ,
41011005	some of the bystanders asked them , “ What are you doing , untying that colt ? ”
41011006	They answered just as Jesus had told them , and the crowd let them go .
41011007	They brought the colt to Jesus , threw their cloaks over the animal , and Jesus got on .
41011008	Many people spread their cloaks on the road , while others cut branches in the field and spread them on the road .
41011009	The people who were in front and those who followed behind began to shout , “ Praise God ! God bless him who comes in the name of the Lord !
41011010	God bless the coming kingdom of King David , our father ! Praise be to God ! ”
41011011	Jesus entered Jerusalem , went into the Temple , and looked around at everything . But since it was already late in the day , he went out to Bethany with the twelve disciples .
41011012	The next day , as they were coming back from Bethany , Jesus was hungry .
41011013	He saw in the distance a fig tree covered with leaves , so he went to see if he could find any figs on it . But when he came to it , he found only leaves , because it was not the right time for figs .
41011014	Jesus said to the fig tree , “ No one shall ever eat figs from you again ! ” And his disciples heard him .
41011015	When they arrived in Jerusalem , Jesus went to the Temple and began to drive out all those who were buying and selling . He overturned the tables of the moneychangers and the stools of those who sold pigeons ,
41011016	and he would not let anyone carry anything through the Temple courtyards .
41011017	He then taught the people : “ It is written in the Scriptures that God said , ‘ My Temple will be called a house of prayer for the people of all nations . ’ But you have turned it into a hideout for thieves ! ”
41011018	The chief priests and the teachers of the Law heard of this , so they began looking for some way to kill Jesus . They were afraid of him , because the whole crowd was amazed at his teaching .
41011019	When evening came , Jesus and his disciples left the city .
41011020	Early next morning , as they walked along the road , they saw the fig tree . It was dead all the way down to its roots .
41011021	Peter remembered what had happened and said to Jesus , “ Look , Teacher , the fig tree you cursed has died ! ”
41011022	Jesus answered them , “ Have faith in God .
41011023	I assure you that whoever tells this hill to get up and throw itself in the sea and does not doubt in his heart , but believes that what he says will happen , it will be done for him .
41011024	For this reason I tell you : When you pray and ask for something , believe that you have received it , and you will be given whatever you ask for .
41011025	And when you stand and pray , forgive anything you may have against anyone , so that your Father in heaven will forgive the wrongs you have done . ”
41011027	They arrived once again in Jerusalem . As Jesus was walking in the Temple , the chief priests , the teachers of the Law , and the elders came to him
41011028	and asked him , “ What right do you have to do these things ? Who gave you such right ? ”
41011029	Jesus answered them , “ I will ask you just one question , and if you give me an answer , I will tell you what right I have to do these things .
41011030	Tell me , where did John's right to baptize come from : was it from God or from human beings ? ”
41011031	They started to argue among themselves : “ What shall we say ? If we answer , ‘ From God , ’ he will say , ‘ Why , then , did you not believe John ? ’
41011032	But if we say , ‘ From human beings … ’ ” ( They were afraid of the people , because everyone was convinced that John had been a prophet . )
41011033	So their answer to Jesus was , “ We don't know . ” Jesus said to them , “ Neither will I tell you , then , by what right I do these things . ”
41012001	Then Jesus spoke to them in parables : “ Once there was a man who planted a vineyard , put a fence around it , dug a hole for the wine press , and built a watchtower . Then he rented the vineyard to tenants and left home on a trip .
41012002	When the time came to gather the grapes , he sent a slave to the tenants to receive from them his share of the harvest .
41012003	The tenants grabbed the slave , beat him , and sent him back without a thing .
41012004	Then the owner sent another slave ; the tenants beat him over the head and treated him shamefully .
41012005	The owner sent another slave , and they killed him ; and they treated many others the same way , beating some and killing others .
41012006	The only one left to send was the man's own dear son . Last of all , then , he sent his son to the tenants . ‘ I am sure they will respect my son , ’ he said .
41012007	But those tenants said to one another , ‘ This is the owner's son . Come on , let's kill him , and his property will be ours ! ’
41012008	So they grabbed the son and killed him and threw his body out of the vineyard .
41012009	“ What , then , will the owner of the vineyard do ? ” asked Jesus . “ He will come and kill those tenants and turn the vineyard over to others .
41012010	Surely you have read this scripture ? ‘ The stone which the builders rejected as worthless turned out to be the most important of all .
41012011	This was done by the Lord ; what a wonderful sight it is ! ’ ”
41012012	The Jewish leaders tried to arrest Jesus , because they knew that he had told this parable against them . But they were afraid of the crowd , so they left him and went away .
41012013	Some Pharisees and some members of Herod's party were sent to Jesus to trap him with questions .
41012014	They came to him and said , “ Teacher , we know that you tell the truth , without worrying about what people think . You pay no attention to anyone's status , but teach the truth about God's will for people . Tell us , is it against our Law to pay taxes to the Roman Emperor ? Should we pay them or not ? ”
41012015	But Jesus saw through their trick and answered , “ Why are you trying to trap me ? Bring a silver coin , and let me see it . ”
41012016	They brought him one , and he asked , “ Whose face and name are these ? ” “ The Emperor's , ” they answered .
41012017	So Jesus said , “ Well , then , pay to the Emperor what belongs to the Emperor , and pay to God what belongs to God . ” And they were amazed at Jesus .
41012018	Then some Sadducees , who say that people will not rise from death , came to Jesus and said ,
41012019	“ Teacher , Moses wrote this law for us : ‘ If a man dies and leaves a wife but no children , that man's brother must marry the widow so that they can have children who will be considered the dead man's children . ’
41012020	Once there were seven brothers ; the oldest got married and died without having children .
41012021	Then the second one married the woman , and he also died without having children . The same thing happened to the third brother ,
41012022	and then to the rest : all seven brothers married the woman and died without having children . Last of all , the woman died .
41012023	Now , when all the dead rise to life on the day of resurrection , whose wife will she be ? All seven of them had married her . ”
41012024	Jesus answered them , “ How wrong you are ! And do you know why ? It is because you don't know the Scriptures or God's power .
41012025	For when the dead rise to life , they will be like the angels in heaven and will not marry .
41012026	Now , as for the dead being raised : haven't you ever read in the Book of Moses the passage about the burning bush ? There it is written that God said to Moses , ‘ I am the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . ’
41012027	He is the God of the living , not of the dead . You are completely wrong ! ”
41012028	A teacher of the Law was there who heard the discussion . He saw that Jesus had given the Sadducees a good answer , so he came to him with a question : “ Which commandment is the most important of all ? ”
41012029	Jesus replied , “ The most important one is this : ‘ Listen , Israel ! The Lord our God is the only Lord .
41012030	Love the Lord your God with all your heart , with all your soul , with all your mind , and with all your strength . ’
41012031	The second most important commandment is this : ‘ Love your neighbor as you love yourself . ’ There is no other commandment more important than these two . ”
41012032	The teacher of the Law said to Jesus , “ Well done , Teacher ! It is true , as you say , that only the Lord is God and that there is no other god but he .
41012033	And you must love God with all your heart and with all your mind and with all your strength ; and you must love your neighbor as you love yourself . It is more important to obey these two commandments than to offer on the altar animals and other sacrifices to God . ”
41012034	Jesus noticed how wise his answer was , and so he told him , “ You are not far from the Kingdom of God . ” After this nobody dared to ask Jesus any more questions .
41012035	As Jesus was teaching in the Temple , he asked the question , “ How can the teachers of the Law say that the Messiah will be the descendant of David ?
41012036	The Holy Spirit inspired David to say : ‘ The Lord said to my Lord : Sit here at my right side until I put your enemies under your feet . ’ A large crowd was listening to Jesus gladly .
41012038	As he taught them , he said , “ Watch out for the teachers of the Law , who like to walk around in their long robes and be greeted with respect in the marketplace ,
41012039	who choose the reserved seats in the synagogues and the best places at feasts .
41012040	They take advantage of widows and rob them of their homes , and then make a show of saying long prayers . Their punishment will be all the worse ! ”
41012041	As Jesus sat near the Temple treasury , he watched the people as they dropped in their money . Many rich men dropped in a lot of money ;
41012042	then a poor widow came along and dropped in two little copper coins , worth about a penny .
41012043	He called his disciples together and said to them , “ I tell you that this poor widow put more in the offering box than all the others .
41012044	For the others put in what they had to spare of their riches ; but she , poor as she is , put in all she had—she gave all she had to live on . ”
41013001	As Jesus was leaving the Temple , one of his disciples said , “ Look , Teacher ! What wonderful stones and buildings ! ”
41013002	Jesus answered , “ You see these great buildings ? Not a single stone here will be left in its place ; every one of them will be thrown down . ”
41013003	Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives , across from the Temple , when Peter , James , John , and Andrew came to him in private .
41013004	“ Tell us when this will be , ” they said , “ and tell us what will happen to show that the time has come for all these things to take place . ”
41013005	Jesus said to them , “ Watch out , and don't let anyone fool you .
41013006	Many men , claiming to speak for me , will come and say , ‘ I am he ! ’ and they will fool many people .
41013007	And don't be troubled when you hear the noise of battles close by and news of battles far away . Such things must happen , but they do not mean that the end has come .
41013008	Countries will fight each other ; kingdoms will attack one another . There will be earthquakes everywhere , and there will be famines . These things are like the first pains of childbirth .
41013009	“ You yourselves must watch out . You will be arrested and taken to court . You will be beaten in the synagogues ; you will stand before rulers and kings for my sake to tell them the Good News .
41013010	But before the end comes , the gospel must be preached to all peoples .
41013011	And when you are arrested and taken to court , do not worry ahead of time about what you are going to say ; when the time comes , say whatever is then given to you . For the words you speak will not be yours ; they will come from the Holy Spirit .
41013012	Men will hand over their own brothers to be put to death , and fathers will do the same to their children . Children will turn against their parents and have them put to death .
41013013	Everyone will hate you because of me . But whoever holds out to the end will be saved .
41013014	“ You will see ‘ The Awful Horror ’ standing in the place where he should not be . ” ( Note to the reader : understand what this means ! ) “ Then those who are in Judea must run away to the hills .
41013015	Someone who is on the roof of a house must not lose time by going down into the house to get anything to take along .
41013016	Someone who is in the field must not go back to the house for a cloak .
41013017	How terrible it will be in those days for women who are pregnant and for mothers with little babies !
41013018	Pray to God that these things will not happen in the winter !
41013019	For the trouble of those days will be far worse than any the world has ever known from the very beginning when God created the world until the present time . Nor will there ever be anything like it again .
41013020	But the Lord has reduced the number of those days ; if he had not , nobody would survive . For the sake of his chosen people , however , he has reduced those days .
41013021	“ Then , if anyone says to you , ‘ Look , here is the Messiah ! ’ or , ‘ Look , there he is ! ’ —do not believe it .
41013022	For false Messiahs and false prophets will appear . They will perform miracles and wonders in order to deceive even God's chosen people , if possible .
41013023	Be on your guard ! I have told you everything ahead of time .
41013024	“ In the days after that time of trouble the sun will grow dark , the moon will no longer shine ,
41013025	the stars will fall from heaven , and the powers in space will be driven from their courses .
41013026	Then the Son of Man will appear , coming in the clouds with great power and glory .
41013027	He will send the angels out to the four corners of the earth to gather God's chosen people from one end of the world to the other .
41013028	“ Let the fig tree teach you a lesson . When its branches become green and tender and it starts putting out leaves , you know that summer is near .
41013029	In the same way , when you see these things happening , you will know that the time is near , ready to begin .
41013030	Remember that all these things will happen before the people now living have all died .
41013031	Heaven and earth will pass away , but my words will never pass away .
41013032	“ No one knows , however , when that day or hour will come—neither the angels in heaven , nor the Son ; only the Father knows .
41013033	Be on watch , be alert , for you do not know when the time will come .
41013034	It will be like a man who goes away from home on a trip and leaves his servants in charge , after giving to each one his own work to do and after telling the doorkeeper to keep watch .
41013035	Watch , then , because you do not know when the master of the house is coming—it might be in the evening or at midnight or before dawn or at sunrise .
41013036	If he comes suddenly , he must not find you asleep .
41013037	What I say to you , then , I say to all : Watch ! ”
41014001	It was now two days before the Festival of Passover and Unleavened Bread . The chief priests and the teachers of the Law were looking for a way to arrest Jesus secretly and put him to death .
41014002	“ We must not do it during the festival , ” they said , “ or the people might riot . ”
41014003	Jesus was in Bethany at the house of Simon , a man who had suffered from a dreaded skin disease . While Jesus was eating , a woman came in with an alabaster jar full of a very expensive perfume made of pure nard . She broke the jar and poured the perfume on Jesus' head .
41014004	Some of the people there became angry and said to one another , “ What was the use of wasting the perfume ?
41014005	It could have been sold for more than three hundred silver coins and the money given to the poor ! ” And they criticized her harshly .
41014006	But Jesus said , “ Leave her alone ! Why are you bothering her ? She has done a fine and beautiful thing for me .
41014007	You will always have poor people with you , and any time you want to , you can help them . But you will not always have me .
41014008	She did what she could ; she poured perfume on my body to prepare it ahead of time for burial .
41014009	Now , I assure you that wherever the gospel is preached all over the world , what she has done will be told in memory of her . ”
41014010	Then Judas Iscariot , one of the twelve disciples , went off to the chief priests in order to betray Jesus to them .
41014011	They were pleased to hear what he had to say , and promised to give him money . So Judas started looking for a good chance to hand Jesus over to them .
41014012	On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread , the day the lambs for the Passover meal were killed , Jesus' disciples asked him , “ Where do you want us to go and get the Passover meal ready for you ? ”
41014013	Then Jesus sent two of them with these instructions : “ Go into the city , and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you . Follow him
41014014	to the house he enters , and say to the owner of the house : ‘ The Teacher says , Where is the room where my disciples and I will eat the Passover meal ? ’
41014015	Then he will show you a large upstairs room , fixed up and furnished , where you will get everything ready for us . ”
41014016	The disciples left , went to the city , and found everything just as Jesus had told them ; and they prepared the Passover meal .
41014017	When it was evening , Jesus came with the twelve disciples .
41014018	While they were at the table eating , Jesus said , “ I tell you that one of you will betray me—one who is eating with me . ”
41014019	The disciples were upset and began to ask him , one after the other , “ Surely you don't mean me , do you ? ”
41014020	Jesus answered , “ It will be one of you twelve , one who dips his bread in the dish with me .
41014021	The Son of Man will die as the Scriptures say he will ; but how terrible for that man who will betray the Son of Man ! It would have been better for that man if he had never been born ! ”
41014022	While they were eating , Jesus took a piece of bread , gave a prayer of thanks , broke it , and gave it to his disciples . “ Take it , ” he said , “ this is my body . ”
41014023	Then he took a cup , gave thanks to God , and handed it to them ; and they all drank from it .
41014024	Jesus said , “ This is my blood which is poured out for many , my blood which seals God's covenant .
41014025	I tell you , I will never again drink this wine until the day I drink the new wine in the Kingdom of God . ”
41014026	Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives .
41014027	Jesus said to them , “ All of you will run away and leave me , for the scripture says , ‘ God will kill the shepherd , and the sheep will all be scattered . ’
41014028	But after I am raised to life , I will go to Galilee ahead of you . ”
41014029	Peter answered , “ I will never leave you , even though all the rest do ! ”
41014030	Jesus said to Peter , “ I tell you that before the rooster crows two times tonight , you will say three times that you do not know me . ”
41014031	Peter answered even more strongly , “ I will never say that , even if I have to die with you ! ” And all the other disciples said the same thing .
41014032	They came to a place called Gethsemane , and Jesus said to his disciples , “ Sit here while I pray . ”
41014033	He took Peter , James , and John with him . Distress and anguish came over him ,
41014034	and he said to them , “ The sorrow in my heart is so great that it almost crushes me . Stay here and keep watch . ”
41014035	He went a little farther on , threw himself on the ground , and prayed that , if possible , he might not have to go through that time of suffering .
41014036	“ Father , ” he prayed , “ my Father ! All things are possible for you . Take this cup of suffering away from me . Yet not what I want , but what you want . ”
41014037	Then he returned and found the three disciples asleep . He said to Peter , “ Simon , are you asleep ? Weren't you able to stay awake for even one hour ? ”
41014038	And he said to them , “ Keep watch , and pray that you will not fall into temptation . The spirit is willing , but the flesh is weak . ”
41014039	He went away once more and prayed , saying the same words .
41014040	Then he came back to the disciples and found them asleep ; they could not keep their eyes open . And they did not know what to say to him .
41014041	When he came back the third time , he said to them , “ Are you still sleeping and resting ? Enough ! The hour has come ! Look , the Son of Man is now being handed over to the power of sinners .
41014042	Get up , let us go . Look , here is the man who is betraying me ! ”
41014043	Jesus was still speaking when Judas , one of the twelve disciples , arrived . With him was a crowd armed with swords and clubs and sent by the chief priests , the teachers of the Law , and the elders .
41014044	The traitor had given the crowd a signal : “ The man I kiss is the one you want . Arrest him and take him away under guard . ”
41014045	As soon as Judas arrived , he went up to Jesus and said , “ Teacher ! ” and kissed him .
41014046	So they arrested Jesus and held him tight .
41014047	But one of those standing there drew his sword and struck at the High Priest's slave , cutting off his ear .
41014048	Then Jesus spoke up and said to them , “ Did you have to come with swords and clubs to capture me , as though I were an outlaw ?
41014049	Day after day I was with you teaching in the Temple , and you did not arrest me . But the Scriptures must come true . ”
41014050	Then all the disciples left him and ran away .
41014051	A certain young man , dressed only in a linen cloth , was following Jesus . They tried to arrest him ,
41014052	but he ran away naked , leaving the cloth behind .
41014053	Then Jesus was taken to the High Priest's house , where all the chief priests , the elders , and the teachers of the Law were gathering .
41014054	Peter followed from a distance and went into the courtyard of the High Priest's house . There he sat down with the guards , keeping himself warm by the fire .
41014055	The chief priests and the whole Council tried to find some evidence against Jesus in order to put him to death , but they could not find any .
41014056	Many witnesses told lies against Jesus , but their stories did not agree .
41014057	Then some men stood up and told this lie against Jesus :
41014058	“ We heard him say , ‘ I will tear down this Temple which men have made , and after three days I will build one that is not made by men . ’ ”
41014059	Not even they , however , could make their stories agree .
41014060	The High Priest stood up in front of them all and questioned Jesus , “ Have you no answer to the accusation they bring against you ? ”
41014061	But Jesus kept quiet and would not say a word . Again the High Priest questioned him , “ Are you the Messiah , the Son of the Blessed God ? ”
41014062	“ I am , ” answered Jesus , “ and you will all see the Son of Man seated at the right side of the Almighty and coming with the clouds of heaven ! ”
41014063	The High Priest tore his robes and said , “ We don't need any more witnesses !
41014064	You heard his blasphemy . What is your decision ? ” They all voted against him : he was guilty and should be put to death .
41014065	Some of them began to spit on Jesus , and they blindfolded him and hit him . “ Guess who hit you ! ” they said . And the guards took him and slapped him .
41014066	Peter was still down in the courtyard when one of the High Priest's servant women came by .
41014067	When she saw Peter warming himself , she looked straight at him and said , “ You , too , were with Jesus of Nazareth . ”
41014068	But he denied it . “ I don't know … I don't understand what you are talking about , ” he answered , and went out into the passageway . Just then a rooster crowed .
41014069	The servant woman saw him there and began to repeat to the bystanders , “ He is one of them ! ”
41014070	But Peter denied it again . A little while later the bystanders accused Peter again , “ You can't deny that you are one of them , because you , too , are from Galilee . ”
41014071	Then Peter said , “ I swear that I am telling the truth ! May God punish me if I am not ! I do not know the man you are talking about ! ”
41014072	Just then a rooster crowed a second time , and Peter remembered how Jesus had said to him , “ Before the rooster crows two times , you will say three times that you do not know me . ” And he broke down and cried .
41015001	Early in the morning the chief priests met hurriedly with the elders , the teachers of the Law , and the whole Council , and made their plans . They put Jesus in chains , led him away , and handed him over to Pilate .
41015002	Pilate questioned him , “ Are you the king of the Jews ? ” Jesus answered , “ So you say . ”
41015003	The chief priests were accusing Jesus of many things ,
41015004	so Pilate questioned him again , “ Aren't you going to answer ? Listen to all their accusations ! ”
41015005	Again Jesus refused to say a word , and Pilate was amazed .
41015006	At every Passover Festival Pilate was in the habit of setting free any one prisoner the people asked for .
41015007	At that time a man named Barabbas was in prison with the rebels who had committed murder in the riot .
41015008	When the crowd gathered and began to ask Pilate for the usual favor ,
41015009	he asked them , “ Do you want me to set free for you the king of the Jews ? ”
41015010	He knew very well that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him because they were jealous .
41015011	But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to ask , instead , that Pilate set Barabbas free for them .
41015012	Pilate spoke again to the crowd , “ What , then , do you want me to do with the one you call the king of the Jews ? ”
41015013	They shouted back , “ Crucify him ! ”
41015014	“ But what crime has he committed ? ” Pilate asked . They shouted all the louder , “ Crucify him ! ”
41015015	Pilate wanted to please the crowd , so he set Barabbas free for them . Then he had Jesus whipped and handed him over to be crucified .
41015016	The soldiers took Jesus inside to the courtyard of the governor's palace and called together the rest of the company .
41015017	They put a purple robe on Jesus , made a crown out of thorny branches , and put it on his head .
41015018	Then they began to salute him : “ Long live the King of the Jews ! ”
41015019	They beat him over the head with a stick , spat on him , fell on their knees , and bowed down to him .
41015020	When they had finished making fun of him , they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes back on him . Then they led him out to crucify him .
41015021	On the way they met a man named Simon , who was coming into the city from the country , and the soldiers forced him to carry Jesus' cross . ( Simon was from Cyrene and was the father of Alexander and Rufus . )
41015022	They took Jesus to a place called Golgotha , which means “ The Place of the Skull . ”
41015023	There they tried to give him wine mixed with a drug called myrrh , but Jesus would not drink it .
41015024	Then they crucified him and divided his clothes among themselves , throwing dice to see who would get which piece of clothing .
41015025	It was nine o'clock in the morning when they crucified him .
41015026	The notice of the accusation against him said : “ The King of the Jews . ”
41015027	They also crucified two bandits with Jesus , one on his right and the other on his left .
41015029	People passing by shook their heads and hurled insults at Jesus : “ Aha ! You were going to tear down the Temple and build it back up in three days !
41015030	Now come down from the cross and save yourself ! ”
41015031	In the same way the chief priests and the teachers of the Law made fun of Jesus , saying to one another , “ He saved others , but he cannot save himself !
41015032	Let us see the Messiah , the king of Israel , come down from the cross now , and we will believe in him ! ” And the two who were crucified with Jesus insulted him also .
41015033	At noon the whole country was covered with darkness , which lasted for three hours .
41015034	At three o'clock Jesus cried out with a loud shout , “ Eloi , Eloi , lema sabachthani ? ” which means , “ My God , my God , why did you abandon me ? ”
41015035	Some of the people there heard him and said , “ Listen , he is calling for Elijah ! ”
41015036	One of them ran up with a sponge , soaked it in cheap wine , and put it on the end of a stick . Then he held it up to Jesus' lips and said , “ Wait ! Let us see if Elijah is coming to bring him down from the cross ! ”
41015037	With a loud cry Jesus died .
41015038	The curtain hanging in the Temple was torn in two , from top to bottom .
41015039	The army officer who was standing there in front of the cross saw how Jesus had died . “ This man was really the Son of God ! ” he said .
41015040	Some women were there , looking on from a distance . Among them were Mary Magdalene , Mary the mother of the younger James and of Joseph , and Salome .
41015041	They had followed Jesus while he was in Galilee and had helped him . Many other women who had come to Jerusalem with him were there also .
41015044	Pilate was surprised to hear that Jesus was already dead . He called the army officer and asked him if Jesus had been dead a long time .
41015045	After hearing the officer's report , Pilate told Joseph he could have the body .
41015046	Joseph bought a linen sheet , took the body down , wrapped it in the sheet , and placed it in a tomb which had been dug out of solid rock . Then he rolled a large stone across the entrance to the tomb .
41015047	Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph were watching and saw where the body of Jesus was placed .
41016001	After the Sabbath was over , Mary Magdalene , Mary the mother of James , and Salome bought spices to go and anoint the body of Jesus .
41016002	Very early on Sunday morning , at sunrise , they went to the tomb .
41016005	So they entered the tomb , where they saw a young man sitting at the right , wearing a white robe—and they were alarmed .
41016006	“ Don't be alarmed , ” he said . “ I know you are looking for Jesus of Nazareth , who was crucified . He is not here—he has been raised ! Look , here is the place where he was placed .
41016007	Now go and give this message to his disciples , including Peter : ‘ He is going to Galilee ahead of you ; there you will see him , just as he told you . ’ ”
41016008	So they went out and ran from the tomb , distressed and terrified . They said nothing to anyone , because they were afraid . [
41016009	The women went to Peter and his friends and gave them a brief account of all they had been told .
41016010	After this , Jesus himself sent out through his disciples from the east to the west the sacred and everliving message of eternal salvation . ]
41016011	and when they heard her say that Jesus was alive and that she had seen him , they did not believe her .
41016012	After this , Jesus appeared in a different manner to two of them while they were on their way to the country .
41016013	They returned and told the others , but these would not believe it .
41016014	Last of all , Jesus appeared to the eleven disciples as they were eating . He scolded them , because they did not have faith and because they were too stubborn to believe those who had seen him alive .
41016015	He said to them , “ Go throughout the whole world and preach the gospel to all people .
41016016	Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved ; whoever does not believe will be condemned .
41016017	Believers will be given the power to perform miracles : they will drive out demons in my name ; they will speak in strange tongues ;
41016018	if they pick up snakes or drink any poison , they will not be harmed ; they will place their hands on sick people , and these will get well . ”
41016019	After the Lord Jesus had talked with them , he was taken up to heaven and sat at the right side of God .
41016020	The disciples went and preached everywhere , and the Lord worked with them and proved that their preaching was true by the miracles that were performed . ] [
42001001	Dear Theophilus : Many people have done their best to write a report of the things that have taken place among us .
42001002	They wrote what we have been told by those who saw these things from the beginning and who proclaimed the message .
42001003	And so , Your Excellency , because I have carefully studied all these matters from their beginning , I thought it would be good to write an orderly account for you .
42001004	I do this so that you will know the full truth about everything which you have been taught .
42001005	During the time when Herod was king of Judea , there was a priest named Zechariah , who belonged to the priestly order of Abijah . His wife's name was Elizabeth ; she also belonged to a priestly family .
42001006	They both lived good lives in God's sight and obeyed fully all the Lord's laws and commands .
42001007	They had no children because Elizabeth could not have any , and she and Zechariah were both very old .
42001008	One day Zechariah was doing his work as a priest in the Temple , taking his turn in the daily service .
42001009	According to the custom followed by the priests , he was chosen by lot to burn incense on the altar . So he went into the Temple of the Lord ,
42001010	while the crowd of people outside prayed during the hour when the incense was burned .
42001011	An angel of the Lord appeared to him , standing at the right side of the altar where the incense was burned .
42001012	When Zechariah saw him , he was alarmed and felt afraid .
42001013	But the angel said to him , “ Don't be afraid , Zechariah ! God has heard your prayer , and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son . You are to name him John .
42001014	How glad and happy you will be , and how happy many others will be when he is born !
42001015	John will be great in the Lord's sight . He must not drink any wine or strong drink . From his very birth he will be filled with the Holy Spirit ,
42001016	and he will bring back many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God .
42001017	He will go ahead of the Lord , strong and mighty like the prophet Elijah . He will bring fathers and children together again ; he will turn disobedient people back to the way of thinking of the righteous ; he will get the Lord's people ready for him . ”
42001018	Zechariah said to the angel , “ How shall I know if this is so ? I am an old man , and my wife is old also . ”
42001019	“ I am Gabriel , ” the angel answered . “ I stand in the presence of God , who sent me to speak to you and tell you this good news .
42001020	But you have not believed my message , which will come true at the right time . Because you have not believed , you will be unable to speak ; you will remain silent until the day my promise to you comes true . ”
42001021	In the meantime the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he was spending such a long time in the Temple .
42001022	When he came out , he could not speak to them , and so they knew that he had seen a vision in the Temple . Unable to say a word , he made signs to them with his hands .
42001023	When his period of service in the Temple was over , Zechariah went back home .
42001024	Some time later his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and did not leave the house for five months .
42001025	“ Now at last the Lord has helped me , ” she said . “ He has taken away my public disgrace ! ”
42001026	In the sixth month of Elizabeth's pregnancy God sent the angel Gabriel to a town in Galilee named Nazareth .
42001027	He had a message for a young woman promised in marriage to a man named Joseph , who was a descendant of King David . Her name was Mary .
42001028	The angel came to her and said , “ Peace be with you ! The Lord is with you and has greatly blessed you ! ”
42001029	Mary was deeply troubled by the angel's message , and she wondered what his words meant .
42001030	The angel said to her , “ Don't be afraid , Mary ; God has been gracious to you .
42001031	You will become pregnant and give birth to a son , and you will name him Jesus .
42001032	He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High God . The Lord God will make him a king , as his ancestor David was ,
42001033	and he will be the king of the descendants of Jacob forever ; his kingdom will never end ! ”
42001034	Mary said to the angel , “ I am a virgin . How , then , can this be ? ”
42001035	The angel answered , “ The Holy Spirit will come on you , and God's power will rest upon you . For this reason the holy child will be called the Son of God .
42001036	Remember your relative Elizabeth . It is said that she cannot have children , but she herself is now six months pregnant , even though she is very old .
42001037	For there is nothing that God cannot do . ”
42001038	“ I am the Lord's servant , ” said Mary ; “ may it happen to me as you have said . ” And the angel left her .
42001039	Soon afterward Mary got ready and hurried off to a town in the hill country of Judea .
42001040	She went into Zechariah's house and greeted Elizabeth .
42001041	When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting , the baby moved within her . Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit
42001042	and said in a loud voice , “ You are the most blessed of all women , and blessed is the child you will bear !
42001043	Why should this great thing happen to me , that my Lord's mother comes to visit me ?
42001044	For as soon as I heard your greeting , the baby within me jumped with gladness .
42001045	How happy you are to believe that the Lord's message to you will come true ! ”
42001046	Mary said , “ My heart praises the Lord ;
42001047	my soul is glad because of God my Savior ,
42001048	for he has remembered me , his lowly servant ! From now on all people will call me happy ,
42001049	because of the great things the Mighty God has done for me . His name is holy ;
42001050	from one generation to another he shows mercy to those who honor him .
42001051	He has stretched out his mighty arm and scattered the proud with all their plans .
42001052	He has brought down mighty kings from their thrones , and lifted up the lowly .
42001053	He has filled the hungry with good things , and sent the rich away with empty hands .
42001054	He has kept the promise he made to our ancestors , and has come to the help of his servant Israel .
42001055	He has remembered to show mercy to Abraham and to all his descendants forever ! ”
42001056	Mary stayed about three months with Elizabeth and then went back home .
42001057	The time came for Elizabeth to have her baby , and she gave birth to a son .
42001058	Her neighbors and relatives heard how wonderfully good the Lord had been to her , and they all rejoiced with her .
42001059	When the baby was a week old , they came to circumcise him , and they were going to name him Zechariah , after his father .
42001060	But his mother said , “ No ! His name is to be John . ”
42001061	They said to her , “ But you don't have any relative with that name ! ”
42001062	Then they made signs to his father , asking him what name he would like the boy to have .
42001063	Zechariah asked for a writing pad and wrote , “ His name is John . ” How surprised they all were !
42001064	At that moment Zechariah was able to speak again , and he started praising God .
42001065	The neighbors were all filled with fear , and the news about these things spread through all the hill country of Judea .
42001066	Everyone who heard of it thought about it and asked , “ What is this child going to be ? ” For it was plain that the Lord's power was upon him .
42001067	John's father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit , and he spoke God's message :
42001068	“ Let us praise the Lord , the God of Israel ! He has come to the help of his people and has set them free .
42001069	He has provided for us a mighty Savior , a descendant of his servant David .
42001070	He promised through his holy prophets long ago
42001071	that he would save us from our enemies , from the power of all those who hate us .
42001072	He said he would show mercy to our ancestors and remember his sacred covenant .
42001075	so that we might be holy and righteous before him all the days of our life .
42001076	“ You , my child , will be called a prophet of the Most High God . You will go ahead of the Lord to prepare his road for him ,
42001077	to tell his people that they will be saved by having their sins forgiven .
42001078	Our God is merciful and tender . He will cause the bright dawn of salvation to rise on us
42001079	and to shine from heaven on all those who live in the dark shadow of death , to guide our steps into the path of peace . ”
42001080	The child grew and developed in body and spirit . He lived in the desert until the day when he appeared publicly to the people of Israel .
42002001	At that time Emperor Augustus ordered a census to be taken throughout the Roman Empire .
42002002	When this first census took place , Quirinius was the governor of Syria .
42002003	Everyone , then , went to register himself , each to his own hometown .
42002004	Joseph went from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to the town of Bethlehem in Judea , the birthplace of King David . Joseph went there because he was a descendant of David .
42002005	He went to register with Mary , who was promised in marriage to him . She was pregnant ,
42002006	and while they were in Bethlehem , the time came for her to have her baby .
42002007	She gave birth to her first son , wrapped him in cloths and laid him in a manger—there was no room for them to stay in the inn .
42002008	There were some shepherds in that part of the country who were spending the night in the fields , taking care of their flocks .
42002009	An angel of the Lord appeared to them , and the glory of the Lord shone over them . They were terribly afraid ,
42002010	but the angel said to them , “ Don't be afraid ! I am here with good news for you , which will bring great joy to all the people .
42002011	This very day in David's town your Savior was born—Christ the Lord !
42002012	And this is what will prove it to you : you will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger . ”
42002013	Suddenly a great army of heaven's angels appeared with the angel , singing praises to God :
42002014	“ Glory to God in the highest heaven , and peace on earth to those with whom he is pleased ! ”
42002015	When the angels went away from them back into heaven , the shepherds said to one another , “ Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened , which the Lord has told us . ”
42002016	So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph and saw the baby lying in the manger .
42002017	When the shepherds saw him , they told them what the angel had said about the child .
42002018	All who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said .
42002019	Mary remembered all these things and thought deeply about them .
42002020	The shepherds went back , singing praises to God for all they had heard and seen ; it had been just as the angel had told them .
42002021	A week later , when the time came for the baby to be circumcised , he was named Jesus , the name which the angel had given him before he had been conceived .
42002022	The time came for Joseph and Mary to perform the ceremony of purification , as the Law of Moses commanded . So they took the child to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord ,
42002023	as it is written in the law of the Lord : “ Every first-born male is to be dedicated to the Lord . ”
42002024	They also went to offer a sacrifice of a pair of doves or two young pigeons , as required by the law of the Lord .
42002025	At that time there was a man named Simeon living in Jerusalem . He was a good , God-fearing man and was waiting for Israel to be saved . The Holy Spirit was with him
42002026	and had assured him that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's promised Messiah .
42002027	Led by the Spirit , Simeon went into the Temple . When the parents brought the child Jesus into the Temple to do for him what the Law required ,
42002028	Simeon took the child in his arms and gave thanks to God :
42002029	“ Now , Lord , you have kept your promise , and you may let your servant go in peace .
42002030	With my own eyes I have seen your salvation ,
42002031	which you have prepared in the presence of all peoples :
42002032	A light to reveal your will to the Gentiles and bring glory to your people Israel . ”
42002033	The child's father and mother were amazed at the things Simeon said about him .
42002034	Simeon blessed them and said to Mary , his mother , “ This child is chosen by God for the destruction and the salvation of many in Israel . He will be a sign from God which many people will speak against
42002035	and so reveal their secret thoughts . And sorrow , like a sharp sword , will break your own heart . ”
42002038	That very same hour she arrived and gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who were waiting for God to set Jerusalem free .
42002039	When Joseph and Mary had finished doing all that was required by the Law of the Lord , they returned to their hometown of Nazareth in Galilee .
42002040	The child grew and became strong ; he was full of wisdom , and God's blessings were upon him .
42002041	Every year the parents of Jesus went to Jerusalem for the Passover Festival .
42002042	When Jesus was twelve years old , they went to the festival as usual .
42002043	When the festival was over , they started back home , but the boy Jesus stayed in Jerusalem . His parents did not know this ;
42002044	they thought that he was with the group , so they traveled a whole day and then started looking for him among their relatives and friends .
42002045	They did not find him , so they went back to Jerusalem looking for him .
42002046	On the third day they found him in the Temple , sitting with the Jewish teachers , listening to them and asking questions .
42002047	All who heard him were amazed at his intelligent answers .
42002048	His parents were astonished when they saw him , and his mother said to him , “ Son , why have you done this to us ? Your father and I have been terribly worried trying to find you . ”
42002049	He answered them , “ Why did you have to look for me ? Didn't you know that I had to be in my Father's house ? ”
42002050	But they did not understand his answer .
42002051	So Jesus went back with them to Nazareth , where he was obedient to them . His mother treasured all these things in her heart .
42002052	Jesus grew both in body and in wisdom , gaining favor with God and people .
42003001	It was the fifteenth year of the rule of Emperor Tiberius ; Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea , Herod was ruler of Galilee , and his brother Philip was ruler of the territory of Iturea and Trachonitis ; Lysanias was ruler of Abilene ,
42003002	and Annas and Caiaphas were High Priests . At that time the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the desert .
42003003	So John went throughout the whole territory of the Jordan River , preaching , “ Turn away from your sins and be baptized , and God will forgive your sins . ”
42003004	As it is written in the book of the prophet Isaiah : “ Someone is shouting in the desert : ‘ Get the road ready for the Lord ; make a straight path for him to travel !
42003005	Every valley must be filled up , every hill and mountain leveled off . The winding roads must be made straight , and the rough paths made smooth .
42003006	The whole human race will see God's salvation ! ’ ”
42003007	Crowds of people came out to John to be baptized by him . “ You snakes ! ” he said to them . “ Who told you that you could escape from the punishment God is about to send ?
42003008	Do those things that will show that you have turned from your sins . And don't start saying among yourselves that Abraham is your ancestor . I tell you that God can take these rocks and make descendants for Abraham !
42003009	The ax is ready to cut down the trees at the roots ; every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown in the fire . ”
42003010	The people asked him , “ What are we to do , then ? ”
42003011	He answered , “ Whoever has two shirts must give one to the man who has none , and whoever has food must share it . ”
42003012	Some tax collectors came to be baptized , and they asked him , “ Teacher , what are we to do ? ”
42003013	“ Don't collect more than is legal , ” he told them .
42003014	Some soldiers also asked him , “ What about us ? What are we to do ? ” He said to them , “ Don't take money from anyone by force or accuse anyone falsely . Be content with your pay . ”
42003015	People's hopes began to rise , and they began to wonder whether John perhaps might be the Messiah .
42003016	So John said to all of them , “ I baptize you with water , but someone is coming who is much greater than I am . I am not good enough even to untie his sandals . He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire .
42003017	He has his winnowing shovel with him , to thresh out all the grain and gather the wheat into his barn ; but he will burn the chaff in a fire that never goes out . ”
42003018	In many different ways John preached the Good News to the people and urged them to change their ways .
42003019	But John reprimanded Governor Herod , because he had married Herodias , his brother's wife , and had done many other evil things .
42003020	Then Herod did an even worse thing by putting John in prison .
42003021	After all the people had been baptized , Jesus also was baptized . While he was praying , heaven was opened ,
42003022	and the Holy Spirit came down upon him in bodily form like a dove . And a voice came from heaven , “ You are my own dear Son . I am pleased with you . ”
42003023	When Jesus began his work , he was about thirty years old . He was the son , so people thought , of Joseph , who was the son of Heli ,
42003024	the son of Matthat , the son of Levi , the son of Melchi , the son of Jannai , the son of Joseph ,
42003025	the son of Mattathias , the son of Amos , the son of Nahum , the son of Esli , the son of Naggai ,
42003026	the son of Maath , the son of Mattathias , the son of Semein , the son of Josech , the son of Joda ,
42003027	the son of Joanan , the son of Rhesa , the son of Zerubbabel , the son of Shealtiel , the son of Neri ,
42003028	the son of Melchi , the son of Addi , the son of Cosam , the son of Elmadam , the son of Er ,
42003029	the son of Joshua , the son of Eliezer , the son of Jorim , the son of Matthat , the son of Levi ,
42003030	the son of Simeon , the son of Judah , the son of Joseph , the son of Jonam , the son of Eliakim ,
42003031	the son of Melea , the son of Menna , the son of Mattatha , the son of Nathan , the son of David ,
42003032	the son of Jesse , the son of Obed , the son of Boaz , the son of Salmon , the son of Nahshon ,
42003033	the son of Amminadab , the son of Admin , the son of Arni , the son of Hezron , the son of Perez , the son of Judah ,
42003034	the son of Jacob , the son of Isaac , the son of Abraham , the son of Terah , the son of Nahor ,
42003035	the son of Serug , the son of Reu , the son of Peleg , the son of Eber , the son of Shelah ,
42003036	the son of Cainan , the son of Arphaxad , the son of Shem , the son of Noah , the son of Lamech ,
42003037	the son of Methuselah , the son of Enoch , the son of Jared , the son of Mahalaleel , the son of Kenan ,
42003038	the son of Enosh , the son of Seth , the son of Adam , the son of God .
42004001	Jesus returned from the Jordan full of the Holy Spirit and was led by the Spirit into the desert ,
42004002	where he was tempted by the Devil for forty days . In all that time he ate nothing , so that he was hungry when it was over .
42004003	The Devil said to him , “ If you are God's Son , order this stone to turn into bread . ”
42004004	But Jesus answered , “ The scripture says , ‘ Human beings cannot live on bread alone . ’ ”
42004005	Then the Devil took him up and showed him in a second all the kingdoms of the world .
42004006	“ I will give you all this power and all this wealth , ” the Devil told him . “ It has all been handed over to me , and I can give it to anyone I choose .
42004007	All this will be yours , then , if you worship me . ”
42004008	Jesus answered , “ The scripture says , ‘ Worship the Lord your God and serve only him ! ’ ”
42004009	Then the Devil took him to Jerusalem and set him on the highest point of the Temple , and said to him , “ If you are God's Son , throw yourself down from here .
42004010	For the scripture says , ‘ God will order his angels to take good care of you . ’
42004011	It also says , ‘ They will hold you up with their hands so that not even your feet will be hurt on the stones . ’ ”
42004012	But Jesus answered , “ The scripture says , ‘ Do not put the Lord your God to the test . ’ ”
42004013	When the Devil finished tempting Jesus in every way , he left him for a while .
42004014	Then Jesus returned to Galilee , and the power of the Holy Spirit was with him . The news about him spread throughout all that territory .
42004015	He taught in the synagogues and was praised by everyone .
42004016	Then Jesus went to Nazareth , where he had been brought up , and on the Sabbath he went as usual to the synagogue . He stood up to read the Scriptures
42004017	and was handed the book of the prophet Isaiah . He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it is written ,
42004018	“ The Spirit of the Lord is upon me , because he has chosen me to bring good news to the poor . He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind , to set free the oppressed
42004019	and announce that the time has come when the Lord will save his people . ”
42004020	Jesus rolled up the scroll , gave it back to the attendant , and sat down . All the people in the synagogue had their eyes fixed on him ,
42004021	as he said to them , “ This passage of scripture has come true today , as you heard it being read . ”
42004022	They were all well impressed with him and marveled at the eloquent words that he spoke . They said , “ Isn't he the son of Joseph ? ”
42004023	He said to them , “ I am sure that you will quote this proverb to me , ‘ Doctor , heal yourself . ’ You will also tell me to do here in my hometown the same things you heard were done in Capernaum .
42004024	I tell you this , ” Jesus added , “ prophets are never welcomed in their hometown .
42004025	Listen to me : it is true that there were many widows in Israel during the time of Elijah , when there was no rain for three and a half years and a severe famine spread throughout the whole land .
42004026	Yet Elijah was not sent to anyone in Israel , but only to a widow living in Zarephath in the territory of Sidon .
42004027	And there were many people suffering from a dreaded skin disease who lived in Israel during the time of the prophet Elisha ; yet not one of them was healed , but only Naaman the Syrian . ”
42004028	When the people in the synagogue heard this , they were filled with anger .
42004029	They rose up , dragged Jesus out of town , and took him to the top of the hill on which their town was built . They meant to throw him over the cliff ,
42004030	but he walked through the middle of the crowd and went his way .
42004031	Then Jesus went to Capernaum , a town in Galilee , where he taught the people on the Sabbath .
42004032	They were all amazed at the way he taught , because he spoke with authority .
42004033	In the synagogue was a man who had the spirit of an evil demon in him ; he screamed out in a loud voice ,
42004034	“ Ah ! What do you want with us , Jesus of Nazareth ? Are you here to destroy us ? I know who you are : you are God's holy messenger ! ”
42004035	Jesus ordered the spirit , “ Be quiet and come out of the man ! ” The demon threw the man down in front of them and went out of him without doing him any harm .
42004036	The people were all amazed and said to one another , “ What kind of words are these ? With authority and power this man gives orders to the evil spirits , and they come out ! ”
42004037	And the report about Jesus spread everywhere in that region .
42004038	Jesus left the synagogue and went to Simon's home . Simon's mother-in-law was sick with a high fever , and they spoke to Jesus about her .
42004039	He went and stood at her bedside and ordered the fever to leave her . The fever left her , and she got up at once and began to wait on them .
42004040	After sunset all who had friends who were sick with various diseases brought them to Jesus ; he placed his hands on every one of them and healed them all .
42004041	Demons also went out from many people , screaming , “ You are the Son of God ! ” Jesus gave the demons an order and would not let them speak , because they knew he was the Messiah .
42004042	At daybreak Jesus left the town and went off to a lonely place . The people started looking for him , and when they found him , they tried to keep him from leaving .
42004043	But he said to them , “ I must preach the Good News about the Kingdom of God in other towns also , because that is what God sent me to do . ”
42004044	So he preached in the synagogues throughout the country .
42005001	One day Jesus was standing on the shore of Lake Gennesaret while the people pushed their way up to him to listen to the word of God .
42005002	He saw two boats pulled up on the beach ; the fishermen had left them and were washing the nets .
42005003	Jesus got into one of the boats—it belonged to Simon—and asked him to push off a little from the shore . Jesus sat in the boat and taught the crowd .
42005004	When he finished speaking , he said to Simon , “ Push the boat out further to the deep water , and you and your partners let down your nets for a catch . ”
42005005	“ Master , ” Simon answered , “ we worked hard all night long and caught nothing . But if you say so , I will let down the nets . ”
42005006	They let them down and caught such a large number of fish that the nets were about to break .
42005007	So they motioned to their partners in the other boat to come and help them . They came and filled both boats so full of fish that the boats were about to sink .
42005008	When Simon Peter saw what had happened , he fell on his knees before Jesus and said , “ Go away from me , Lord ! I am a sinful man ! ”
42005009	He and the others with him were all amazed at the large number of fish they had caught .
42005010	The same was true of Simon's partners , James and John , the sons of Zebedee . Jesus said to Simon , “ Don't be afraid ; from now on you will be catching people . ”
42005011	They pulled the boats up on the beach , left everything , and followed Jesus .
42005012	Once Jesus was in a town where there was a man who was suffering from a dreaded skin disease . When he saw Jesus , he threw himself down and begged him , “ Sir , if you want to , you can make me clean ! ”
42005013	Jesus reached out and touched him . “ I do want to , ” he answered . “ Be clean ! ” At once the disease left the man .
42005014	Jesus ordered him , “ Don't tell anyone , but go straight to the priest and let him examine you ; then to prove to everyone that you are cured , offer the sacrifice as Moses ordered . ”
42005015	But the news about Jesus spread all the more widely , and crowds of people came to hear him and be healed from their diseases .
42005016	But he would go away to lonely places , where he prayed .
42005017	One day when Jesus was teaching , some Pharisees and teachers of the Law were sitting there who had come from every town in Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem . The power of the Lord was present for Jesus to heal the sick .
42005018	Some men came carrying a paralyzed man on a bed , and they tried to carry him into the house and put him in front of Jesus .
42005019	Because of the crowd , however , they could find no way to take him in . So they carried him up on the roof , made an opening in the tiles , and let him down on his bed into the middle of the group in front of Jesus .
42005020	When Jesus saw how much faith they had , he said to the man , “ Your sins are forgiven , my friend . ”
42005021	The teachers of the Law and the Pharisees began to say to themselves , “ Who is this man who speaks such blasphemy ! God is the only one who can forgive sins ! ”
42005022	Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them , “ Why do you think such things ?
42005023	Is it easier to say , ‘ Your sins are forgiven you , ’ or to say , ‘ Get up and walk ’ ?
42005024	I will prove to you , then , that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins . ” So he said to the paralyzed man , “ I tell you , get up , pick up your bed , and go home ! ”
42005025	At once the man got up in front of them all , took the bed he had been lying on , and went home , praising God .
42005026	They were all completely amazed ! Full of fear , they praised God , saying , “ What marvelous things we have seen today ! ”
42005027	After this , Jesus went out and saw a tax collector named Levi , sitting in his office . Jesus said to him , “ Follow me . ”
42005028	Levi got up , left everything , and followed him .
42005029	Then Levi had a big feast in his house for Jesus , and among the guests was a large number of tax collectors and other people .
42005030	Some Pharisees and some teachers of the Law who belonged to their group complained to Jesus' disciples . “ Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and other outcasts ? ” they asked .
42005031	Jesus answered them , “ People who are well do not need a doctor , but only those who are sick .
42005032	I have not come to call respectable people to repent , but outcasts . ”
42005033	Some people said to Jesus , “ The disciples of John fast frequently and offer prayers , and the disciples of the Pharisees do the same ; but your disciples eat and drink . ”
42005034	Jesus answered , “ Do you think you can make the guests at a wedding party go without food as long as the bridegroom is with them ? Of course not !
42005035	But the day will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them , and then they will fast . ”
42005036	Jesus also told them this parable : “ You don't tear a piece off a new coat to patch up an old coat . If you do , you will have torn the new coat , and the piece of new cloth will not match the old .
42005037	Nor do you pour new wine into used wineskins , because the new wine will burst the skins , the wine will pour out , and the skins will be ruined .
42005038	Instead , new wine must be poured into fresh wineskins !
42005039	And you don't want new wine after drinking old wine . ‘ The old is better , ’ you say . ”
42006001	Jesus was walking through some wheat fields on a Sabbath . His disciples began to pick the heads of wheat , rub them in their hands , and eat the grain .
42006002	Some Pharisees asked , “ Why are you doing what our Law says you cannot do on the Sabbath ? ”
42006003	Jesus answered them , “ Haven't you read what David did when he and his men were hungry ?
42006004	He went into the house of God , took the bread offered to God , ate it , and gave it also to his men . Yet it is against our Law for anyone except the priests to eat that bread . ”
42006005	And Jesus concluded , “ The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath . ”
42006006	On another Sabbath Jesus went into a synagogue and taught . A man was there whose right hand was paralyzed .
42006007	Some teachers of the Law and some Pharisees wanted a reason to accuse Jesus of doing wrong , so they watched him closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath .
42006008	But Jesus knew their thoughts and said to the man , “ Stand up and come here to the front . ” The man got up and stood there .
42006009	Then Jesus said to them , “ I ask you : What does our Law allow us to do on the Sabbath ? To help or to harm ? To save someone's life or destroy it ? ”
42006010	He looked around at them all ; then he said to the man , “ Stretch out your hand . ” He did so , and his hand became well again .
42006011	They were filled with rage and began to discuss among themselves what they could do to Jesus .
42006012	At that time Jesus went up a hill to pray and spent the whole night there praying to God .
42006013	When day came , he called his disciples to him and chose twelve of them , whom he named apostles :
42006014	Simon ( whom he named Peter ) and his brother Andrew ; James and John , Philip and Bartholomew ,
42006015	Matthew and Thomas , James son of Alphaeus , and Simon ( who was called the Patriot ) ,
42006016	Judas son of James , and Judas Iscariot , who became the traitor .
42006017	When Jesus had come down from the hill with the apostles , he stood on a level place with a large number of his disciples . A large crowd of people was there from all over Judea and from Jerusalem and from the coast cities of Tyre and Sidon ;
42006018	they had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases . Those who were troubled by evil spirits also came and were healed .
42006019	All the people tried to touch him , for power was going out from him and healing them all .
42006020	Jesus looked at his disciples and said , “ Happy are you poor ; the Kingdom of God is yours !
42006021	“ Happy are you who are hungry now ; you will be filled ! “ Happy are you who weep now ; you will laugh !
42006022	“ Happy are you when people hate you , reject you , insult you , and say that you are evil , all because of the Son of Man !
42006023	Be glad when that happens and dance for joy , because a great reward is kept for you in heaven . For their ancestors did the very same things to the prophets .
42006024	“ But how terrible for you who are rich now ; you have had your easy life !
42006025	“ How terrible for you who are full now ; you will go hungry ! “ How terrible for you who laugh now ; you will mourn and weep !
42006026	“ How terrible when all people speak well of you ; their ancestors said the very same things about the false prophets .
42006027	“ But I tell you who hear me : Love your enemies , do good to those who hate you ,
42006028	bless those who curse you , and pray for those who mistreat you .
42006029	If anyone hits you on one cheek , let him hit the other one too ; if someone takes your coat , let him have your shirt as well .
42006030	Give to everyone who asks you for something , and when someone takes what is yours , do not ask for it back .
42006031	Do for others just what you want them to do for you .
42006032	“ If you love only the people who love you , why should you receive a blessing ? Even sinners love those who love them !
42006033	And if you do good only to those who do good to you , why should you receive a blessing ? Even sinners do that !
42006034	And if you lend only to those from whom you hope to get it back , why should you receive a blessing ? Even sinners lend to sinners , to get back the same amount !
42006035	No ! Love your enemies and do good to them ; lend and expect nothing back . You will then have a great reward , and you will be children of the Most High God . For he is good to the ungrateful and the wicked .
42006036	Be merciful just as your Father is merciful .
42006037	“ Do not judge others , and God will not judge you ; do not condemn others , and God will not condemn you ; forgive others , and God will forgive you .
42006038	Give to others , and God will give to you . Indeed , you will receive a full measure , a generous helping , poured into your hands—all that you can hold . The measure you use for others is the one that God will use for you . ”
42006039	And Jesus told them this parable : “ One blind man cannot lead another one ; if he does , both will fall into a ditch .
42006040	No pupils are greater than their teacher ; but all pupils , when they have completed their training , will be like their teacher .
42006041	“ Why do you look at the speck in your brother's eye , but pay no attention to the log in your own eye ?
42006042	How can you say to your brother , ‘ Please , brother , let me take that speck out of your eye , ’ yet cannot even see the log in your own eye ? You hypocrite ! First take the log out of your own eye , and then you will be able to see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye .
42006043	“ A healthy tree does not bear bad fruit , nor does a poor tree bear good fruit .
42006044	Every tree is known by the fruit it bears ; you do not pick figs from thorn bushes or gather grapes from bramble bushes .
42006045	A good person brings good out of the treasure of good things in his heart ; a bad person brings bad out of his treasure of bad things . For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of .
42006046	“ Why do you call me , ‘ Lord , Lord , ’ and yet don't do what I tell you ?
42006047	Anyone who comes to me and listens to my words and obeys them—I will show you what he is like .
42006048	He is like a man who , in building his house , dug deep and laid the foundation on rock . The river flooded over and hit that house but could not shake it , because it was well built .
42006049	But anyone who hears my words and does not obey them is like a man who built his house without laying a foundation ; when the flood hit that house it fell at once—and what a terrible crash that was ! ”
42007001	When Jesus had finished saying all these things to the people , he went to Capernaum .
42007002	A Roman officer there had a servant who was very dear to him ; the man was sick and about to die .
42007003	When the officer heard about Jesus , he sent some Jewish elders to ask him to come and heal his servant .
42007004	They came to Jesus and begged him earnestly , “ This man really deserves your help .
42007005	He loves our people and he himself built a synagogue for us . ”
42007006	So Jesus went with them . He was not far from the house when the officer sent friends to tell him , “ Sir , don't trouble yourself . I do not deserve to have you come into my house ,
42007007	neither do I consider myself worthy to come to you in person . Just give the order , and my servant will get well .
42007008	I , too , am a man placed under the authority of superior officers , and I have soldiers under me . I order this one , ‘ Go ! ’ and he goes ; I order that one , ‘ Come ! ’ and he comes ; and I order my slave , ‘ Do this ! ’ and he does it . ”
42007009	Jesus was surprised when he heard this ; he turned around and said to the crowd following him , “ I tell you , I have never found faith like this , not even in Israel ! ”
42007010	The messengers went back to the officer's house and found his servant well .
42007011	Soon afterward Jesus went to a town named Nain , accompanied by his disciples and a large crowd .
42007012	Just as he arrived at the gate of the town , a funeral procession was coming out . The dead man was the only son of a woman who was a widow , and a large crowd from the town was with her .
42007013	When the Lord saw her , his heart was filled with pity for her , and he said to her , “ Don't cry . ”
42007014	Then he walked over and touched the coffin , and the men carrying it stopped . Jesus said , “ Young man ! Get up , I tell you ! ”
42007015	The dead man sat up and began to talk , and Jesus gave him back to his mother .
42007016	They all were filled with fear and praised God . “ A great prophet has appeared among us ! ” they said ; “ God has come to save his people ! ”
42007017	This news about Jesus went out through all the country and the surrounding territory .
42007018	When John's disciples told him about all these things , he called two of them
42007019	and sent them to the Lord to ask him , “ Are you the one John said was going to come , or should we expect someone else ? ”
42007020	When they came to Jesus , they said , “ John the Baptist sent us to ask if you are the one he said was going to come , or should we expect someone else ? ”
42007021	At that very time Jesus healed many people from their sicknesses , diseases , and evil spirits , and gave sight to many blind people .
42007022	He answered John's messengers , “ Go back and tell John what you have seen and heard : the blind can see , the lame can walk , those who suffer from dreaded skin diseases are made clean , the deaf can hear , the dead are raised to life , and the Good News is preached to the poor .
42007023	How happy are those who have no doubts about me ! ”
42007024	After John's messengers had left , Jesus began to speak about him to the crowds : “ When you went out to John in the desert , what did you expect to see ? A blade of grass bending in the wind ?
42007025	What did you go out to see ? A man dressed up in fancy clothes ? People who dress like that and live in luxury are found in palaces !
42007026	Tell me , what did you go out to see ? A prophet ? Yes indeed , but you saw much more than a prophet .
42007027	For John is the one of whom the scripture says : ‘ God said , I will send my messenger ahead of you to open the way for you . ’
42007028	I tell you , ” Jesus added , “ John is greater than anyone who has ever lived . But the one who is least in the Kingdom of God is greater than John . ”
42007029	All the people heard him ; they and especially the tax collectors were the ones who had obeyed God's righteous demands and had been baptized by John .
42007030	But the Pharisees and the teachers of the Law rejected God's purpose for themselves and refused to be baptized by John .
42007031	Jesus continued , “ Now to what can I compare the people of this day ? What are they like ?
42007032	They are like children sitting in the marketplace . One group shouts to the other , ‘ We played wedding music for you , but you wouldn't dance ! We sang funeral songs , but you wouldn't cry ! ’
42007033	John the Baptist came , and he fasted and drank no wine , and you said , ‘ He has a demon in him ! ’
42007034	The Son of Man came , and he ate and drank , and you said , ‘ Look at this man ! He is a glutton and wine drinker , a friend of tax collectors and other outcasts ! ’
42007035	God's wisdom , however , is shown to be true by all who accept it . ”
42007036	A Pharisee invited Jesus to have dinner with him , and Jesus went to his house and sat down to eat .
42007037	In that town was a woman who lived a sinful life . She heard that Jesus was eating in the Pharisee's house , so she brought an alabaster jar full of perfume
42007038	and stood behind Jesus , by his feet , crying and wetting his feet with her tears . Then she dried his feet with her hair , kissed them , and poured the perfume on them .
42007039	When the Pharisee saw this , he said to himself , “ If this man really were a prophet , he would know who this woman is who is touching him ; he would know what kind of sinful life she lives ! ”
42007040	Jesus spoke up and said to him , “ Simon , I have something to tell you . ” “ Yes , Teacher , ” he said , “ tell me . ”
42007041	“ There were two men who owed money to a moneylender , ” Jesus began . “ One owed him five hundred silver coins , and the other owed him fifty .
42007042	Neither of them could pay him back , so he canceled the debts of both . Which one , then , will love him more ? ”
42007043	“ I suppose , ” answered Simon , “ that it would be the one who was forgiven more . ” “ You are right , ” said Jesus .
42007044	Then he turned to the woman and said to Simon , “ Do you see this woman ? I came into your home , and you gave me no water for my feet , but she has washed my feet with her tears and dried them with her hair .
42007045	You did not welcome me with a kiss , but she has not stopped kissing my feet since I came .
42007046	You provided no olive oil for my head , but she has covered my feet with perfume .
42007047	I tell you , then , the great love she has shown proves that her many sins have been forgiven . But whoever has been forgiven little shows only a little love . ”
42007048	Then Jesus said to the woman , “ Your sins are forgiven . ”
42007049	The others sitting at the table began to say to themselves , “ Who is this , who even forgives sins ? ”
42007050	But Jesus said to the woman , “ Your faith has saved you ; go in peace . ”
42008001	Some time later Jesus traveled through towns and villages , preaching the Good News about the Kingdom of God . The twelve disciples went with him ,
42008002	and so did some women who had been healed of evil spirits and diseases : Mary ( who was called Magdalene ) , from whom seven demons had been driven out ;
42008003	Joanna , whose husband Chuza was an officer in Herod's court ; and Susanna , and many other women who used their own resources to help Jesus and his disciples .
42008004	People kept coming to Jesus from one town after another ; and when a great crowd gathered , Jesus told this parable :
42008005	“ Once there was a man who went out to sow grain . As he scattered the seed in the field , some of it fell along the path , where it was stepped on , and the birds ate it up .
42008006	Some of it fell on rocky ground , and when the plants sprouted , they dried up because the soil had no moisture .
42008007	Some of the seed fell among thorn bushes , which grew up with the plants and choked them .
42008008	And some seeds fell in good soil ; the plants grew and bore grain , one hundred grains each . ” And Jesus concluded , “ Listen , then , if you have ears ! ”
42008009	His disciples asked Jesus what this parable meant ,
42008010	and he answered , “ The knowledge of the secrets of the Kingdom of God has been given to you , but to the rest it comes by means of parables , so that they may look but not see , and listen but not understand .
42008011	“ This is what the parable means : the seed is the word of God .
42008012	The seeds that fell along the path stand for those who hear ; but the Devil comes and takes the message away from their hearts in order to keep them from believing and being saved .
42008013	The seeds that fell on rocky ground stand for those who hear the message and receive it gladly . But it does not sink deep into them ; they believe only for a while but when the time of testing comes , they fall away .
42008014	The seeds that fell among thorn bushes stand for those who hear ; but the worries and riches and pleasures of this life crowd in and choke them , and their fruit never ripens .
42008015	The seeds that fell in good soil stand for those who hear the message and retain it in a good and obedient heart , and they persist until they bear fruit .
42008016	“ No one lights a lamp and covers it with a bowl or puts it under a bed . Instead , it is put on the lampstand , so that people will see the light as they come in .
42008017	“ Whatever is hidden away will be brought out into the open , and whatever is covered up will be found and brought to light .
42008018	“ Be careful , then , how you listen ; because those who have something will be given more , but whoever has nothing will have taken away from them even the little they think they have . ”
42008019	Jesus' mother and brothers came to him , but were unable to join him because of the crowd .
42008020	Someone said to Jesus , “ Your mother and brothers are standing outside and want to see you . ”
42008021	Jesus said to them all , “ My mother and brothers are those who hear the word of God and obey it . ”
42008022	One day Jesus got into a boat with his disciples and said to them , “ Let us go across to the other side of the lake . ” So they started out .
42008023	As they were sailing , Jesus fell asleep . Suddenly a strong wind blew down on the lake , and the boat began to fill with water , so that they were all in great danger .
42008024	The disciples went to Jesus and woke him up , saying , “ Master , Master ! We are about to die ! ” Jesus got up and gave an order to the wind and to the stormy water ; they quieted down , and there was a great calm .
42008025	Then he said to the disciples , “ Where is your faith ? ” But they were amazed and afraid , and said to one another , “ Who is this man ? He gives orders to the winds and waves , and they obey him ! ”
42008026	Jesus and his disciples sailed on over to the territory of Gerasa , which is across the lake from Galilee .
42008027	As Jesus stepped ashore , he was met by a man from the town who had demons in him . For a long time this man had gone without clothes and would not stay at home , but spent his time in the burial caves .
42008028	When he saw Jesus , he gave a loud cry , threw himself down at his feet , and shouted , “ Jesus , Son of the Most High God ! What do you want with me ? I beg you , don't punish me ! ”
42008029	He said this because Jesus had ordered the evil spirit to go out of him . Many times it had seized him , and even though he was kept a prisoner , his hands and feet tied with chains , he would break the chains and be driven by the demon out into the desert .
42008030	Jesus asked him , “ What is your name ? ” “ My name is ‘ Mob , ’ ” he answered—because many demons had gone into him .
42008031	The demons begged Jesus not to send them into the abyss .
42008032	There was a large herd of pigs near by , feeding on a hillside . So the demons begged Jesus to let them go into the pigs , and he let them .
42008033	They went out of the man and into the pigs . The whole herd rushed down the side of the cliff into the lake and was drowned .
42008034	The men who had been taking care of the pigs saw what happened , so they ran off and spread the news in the town and among the farms .
42008035	People went out to see what had happened , and when they came to Jesus , they found the man from whom the demons had gone out sitting at the feet of Jesus , clothed and in his right mind ; and they were all afraid .
42008036	Those who had seen it told the people how the man had been cured .
42008037	Then all the people from that territory asked Jesus to go away , because they were terribly afraid . So Jesus got into the boat and left .
42008038	The man from whom the demons had gone out begged Jesus , “ Let me go with you . ” But Jesus sent him away , saying ,
42008039	“ Go back home and tell what God has done for you . ” The man went through the town , telling what Jesus had done for him .
42008040	When Jesus returned to the other side of the lake , the people welcomed him , because they had all been waiting for him .
42008041	Then a man named Jairus arrived ; he was an official in the local synagogue . He threw himself down at Jesus' feet and begged him to go to his home ,
42008042	because his only daughter , who was twelve years old , was dying . As Jesus went along , the people were crowding him from every side .
42008043	Among them was a woman who had suffered from severe bleeding for twelve years ; she had spent all she had on doctors , but no one had been able to cure her .
42008044	She came up in the crowd behind Jesus and touched the edge of his cloak , and her bleeding stopped at once .
42008045	Jesus asked , “ Who touched me ? ” Everyone denied it , and Peter said , “ Master , the people are all around you and crowding in on you . ”
42008046	But Jesus said , “ Someone touched me , for I knew it when power went out of me . ”
42008047	The woman saw that she had been found out , so she came trembling and threw herself at Jesus' feet . There in front of everybody , she told him why she had touched him and how she had been healed at once .
42008048	Jesus said to her , “ My daughter , your faith has made you well . Go in peace . ”
42008049	While Jesus was saying this , a messenger came from the official's house . “ Your daughter has died , ” he told Jairus ; “ don't bother the Teacher any longer . ”
42008050	But Jesus heard it and said to Jairus , “ Don't be afraid ; only believe , and she will be well . ”
42008051	When he arrived at the house , he would not let anyone go in with him except Peter , John , and James , and the child's father and mother .
42008052	Everyone there was crying and mourning for the child . Jesus said , “ Don't cry ; the child is not dead—she is only sleeping ! ”
42008053	They all made fun of him , because they knew that she was dead .
42008054	But Jesus took her by the hand and called out , “ Get up , child ! ”
42008055	Her life returned , and she got up at once , and Jesus ordered them to give her something to eat .
42008056	Her parents were astounded , but Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone what had happened .
42009001	Jesus called the twelve disciples together and gave them power and authority to drive out all demons and to cure diseases .
42009002	Then he sent them out to preach the Kingdom of God and to heal the sick ,
42009003	after saying to them , “ Take nothing with you for the trip : no walking stick , no beggar's bag , no food , no money , not even an extra shirt .
42009004	Wherever you are welcomed , stay in the same house until you leave that town ;
42009005	wherever people don't welcome you , leave that town and shake the dust off your feet as a warning to them . ”
42009006	The disciples left and traveled through all the villages , preaching the Good News and healing people everywhere .
42009007	When Herod , the ruler of Galilee , heard about all the things that were happening , he was very confused , because some people were saying that John the Baptist had come back to life .
42009008	Others were saying that Elijah had appeared , and still others that one of the prophets of long ago had come back to life .
42009009	Herod said , “ I had John's head cut off ; but who is this man I hear these things about ? ” And he kept trying to see Jesus .
42009010	The apostles came back and told Jesus everything they had done . He took them with him , and they went off by themselves to a town named Bethsaida .
42009011	When the crowds heard about it , they followed him . He welcomed them , spoke to them about the Kingdom of God , and healed those who needed it .
42009012	When the sun was beginning to set , the twelve disciples came to him and said , “ Send the people away so that they can go to the villages and farms around here and find food and lodging , because this is a lonely place . ”
42009013	But Jesus said to them , “ You yourselves give them something to eat . ” They answered , “ All we have are five loaves and two fish . Do you want us to go and buy food for this whole crowd ? ”
42009014	( There were about five thousand men there . ) Jesus said to his disciples , “ Make the people sit down in groups of about fifty each . ”
42009015	After the disciples had done so ,
42009016	Jesus took the five loaves and two fish , looked up to heaven , thanked God for them , broke them , and gave them to the disciples to distribute to the people .
42009017	They all ate and had enough , and the disciples took up twelve baskets of what was left over .
42009018	One day when Jesus was praying alone , the disciples came to him . “ Who do the crowds say I am ? ” he asked them .
42009019	“ Some say that you are John the Baptist , ” they answered . “ Others say that you are Elijah , while others say that one of the prophets of long ago has come back to life . ”
42009020	“ What about you ? ” he asked them . “ Who do you say I am ? ” Peter answered , “ You are God's Messiah . ”
42009021	Then Jesus gave them strict orders not to tell this to anyone .
42009022	He also told them , “ The Son of Man must suffer much and be rejected by the elders , the chief priests , and the teachers of the Law . He will be put to death , but three days later he will be raised to life . ”
42009023	And he said to them all , “ If you want to come with me , you must forget yourself , take up your cross every day , and follow me .
42009024	For if you want to save your own life , you will lose it , but if you lose your life for my sake , you will save it .
42009025	Will you gain anything if you win the whole world but are yourself lost or defeated ? Of course not !
42009026	If you are ashamed of me and of my teaching , then the Son of Man will be ashamed of you when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels .
42009027	I assure you that there are some here who will not die until they have seen the Kingdom of God . ”
42009028	About a week after he had said these things , Jesus took Peter , John , and James with him and went up a hill to pray .
42009029	While he was praying , his face changed its appearance , and his clothes became dazzling white .
42009030	Suddenly two men were there talking with him . They were Moses and Elijah ,
42009031	who appeared in heavenly glory and talked with Jesus about the way in which he would soon fulfill God's purpose by dying in Jerusalem .
42009032	Peter and his companions were sound asleep , but they woke up and saw Jesus' glory and the two men who were standing with him .
42009033	As the men were leaving Jesus , Peter said to him , “ Master , how good it is that we are here ! We will make three tents , one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . ” ( He did not really know what he was saying . )
42009034	While he was still speaking , a cloud appeared and covered them with its shadow ; and the disciples were afraid as the cloud came over them .
42009035	A voice said from the cloud , “ This is my Son , whom I have chosen—listen to him ! ”
42009036	When the voice stopped , there was Jesus all alone . The disciples kept quiet about all this and told no one at that time anything they had seen .
42009037	The next day Jesus and the three disciples went down from the hill , and a large crowd met Jesus .
42009038	A man shouted from the crowd , “ Teacher ! I beg you , look at my son—my only son !
42009039	A spirit attacks him with a sudden shout and throws him into a fit , so that he foams at the mouth ; it keeps on hurting him and will hardly let him go !
42009040	I begged your disciples to drive it out , but they couldn't . ”
42009041	Jesus answered , “ How unbelieving and wrong you people are ! How long must I stay with you ? How long do I have to put up with you ? ” Then he said to the man , “ Bring your son here . ”
42009042	As the boy was coming , the demon knocked him to the ground and threw him into a fit . Jesus gave a command to the evil spirit , healed the boy , and gave him back to his father .
42009043	All the people were amazed at the mighty power of God . The people were still marveling at everything Jesus was doing , when he said to his disciples ,
42009044	“ Don't forget what I am about to tell you ! The Son of Man is going to be handed over to the power of human beings . ”
42009045	But the disciples did not know what this meant . It had been hidden from them so that they could not understand it , and they were afraid to ask him about the matter .
42009046	An argument broke out among the disciples as to which one of them was the greatest .
42009047	Jesus knew what they were thinking , so he took a child , stood him by his side ,
42009048	and said to them , “ Whoever welcomes this child in my name , welcomes me ; and whoever welcomes me , also welcomes the one who sent me . For the one who is least among you all is the greatest . ”
42009049	John spoke up , “ Master , we saw a man driving out demons in your name , and we told him to stop , because he doesn't belong to our group . ”
42009050	“ Do not try to stop him , ” Jesus said to him and to the other disciples , “ because whoever is not against you is for you . ”
42009051	As the time drew near when Jesus would be taken up to heaven , he made up his mind and set out on his way to Jerusalem .
42009052	He sent messengers ahead of him , who went into a village in Samaria to get everything ready for him .
42009053	But the people there would not receive him , because it was clear that he was on his way to Jerusalem .
42009054	When the disciples James and John saw this , they said , “ Lord , do you want us to call fire down from heaven to destroy them ? ”
42009055	Jesus turned and rebuked them .
42009056	Then Jesus and his disciples went on to another village .
42009057	As they went on their way , a man said to Jesus , “ I will follow you wherever you go . ”
42009058	Jesus said to him , “ Foxes have holes , and birds have nests , but the Son of Man has no place to lie down and rest . ”
42009059	He said to another man , “ Follow me . ” But that man said , “ Sir , first let me go back and bury my father . ”
42009060	Jesus answered , “ Let the dead bury their own dead . You go and proclaim the Kingdom of God . ”
42009061	Someone else said , “ I will follow you , sir ; but first let me go and say good-bye to my family . ”
42009062	Jesus said to him , “ Anyone who starts to plow and then keeps looking back is of no use for the Kingdom of God . ”
42010001	After this the Lord chose another seventy-two men and sent them out two by two , to go ahead of him to every town and place where he himself was about to go .
42010002	He said to them , “ There is a large harvest , but few workers to gather it in . Pray to the owner of the harvest that he will send out workers to gather in his harvest .
42010003	Go ! I am sending you like lambs among wolves .
42010004	Don't take a purse or a beggar's bag or shoes ; don't stop to greet anyone on the road .
42010005	Whenever you go into a house , first say , ‘ Peace be with this house . ’
42010006	If someone who is peace-loving lives there , let your greeting of peace remain on that person ; if not , take back your greeting of peace .
42010007	Stay in that same house , eating and drinking whatever they offer you , for workers should be given their pay . Don't move around from one house to another .
42010008	Whenever you go into a town and are made welcome , eat what is set before you ,
42010009	heal the sick in that town , and say to the people there , ‘ The Kingdom of God has come near you . ’
42010010	But whenever you go into a town and are not welcomed , go out in the streets and say ,
42010011	‘ Even the dust from your town that sticks to our feet we wipe off against you . But remember that the Kingdom of God has come near you ! ’
42010012	I assure you that on the Judgment Day God will show more mercy to Sodom than to that town !
42010013	“ How terrible it will be for you , Chorazin ! How terrible for you too , Bethsaida ! If the miracles which were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon , the people there would have long ago sat down , put on sackcloth , and sprinkled ashes on themselves , to show that they had turned from their sins !
42010014	God will show more mercy on the Judgment Day to Tyre and Sidon than to you .
42010015	And as for you , Capernaum ! Did you want to lift yourself up to heaven ? You will be thrown down to hell ! ”
42010016	Jesus said to his disciples , “ Whoever listens to you listens to me ; whoever rejects you rejects me ; and whoever rejects me rejects the one who sent me . ”
42010017	The seventy-two men came back in great joy . “ Lord , ” they said , “ even the demons obeyed us when we gave them a command in your name ! ”
42010018	Jesus answered them , “ I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven .
42010019	Listen ! I have given you authority , so that you can walk on snakes and scorpions and overcome all the power of the Enemy , and nothing will hurt you .
42010020	But don't be glad because the evil spirits obey you ; rather be glad because your names are written in heaven . ”
42010021	At that time Jesus was filled with joy by the Holy Spirit and said , “ Father , Lord of heaven and earth ! I thank you because you have shown to the unlearned what you have hidden from the wise and learned . Yes , Father , this was how you were pleased to have it happen .
42010022	“ My Father has given me all things . No one knows who the Son is except the Father , and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him . ”
42010023	Then Jesus turned to the disciples and said to them privately , “ How fortunate you are to see the things you see !
42010024	I tell you that many prophets and kings wanted to see what you see , but they could not , and to hear what you hear , but they did not . ”
42010025	A teacher of the Law came up and tried to trap Jesus . “ Teacher , ” he asked , “ what must I do to receive eternal life ? ”
42010026	Jesus answered him , “ What do the Scriptures say ? How do you interpret them ? ”
42010027	The man answered , “ ‘ Love the Lord your God with all your heart , with all your soul , with all your strength , and with all your mind ’ ; and ‘ Love your neighbor as you love yourself . ’ ”
42010028	“ You are right , ” Jesus replied ; “ do this and you will live . ”
42010029	But the teacher of the Law wanted to justify himself , so he asked Jesus , “ Who is my neighbor ? ”
42010030	Jesus answered , “ There was once a man who was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho when robbers attacked him , stripped him , and beat him up , leaving him half dead .
42010031	It so happened that a priest was going down that road ; but when he saw the man , he walked on by on the other side .
42010032	In the same way a Levite also came there , went over and looked at the man , and then walked on by on the other side .
42010033	But a Samaritan who was traveling that way came upon the man , and when he saw him , his heart was filled with pity .
42010034	He went over to him , poured oil and wine on his wounds and bandaged them ; then he put the man on his own animal and took him to an inn , where he took care of him .
42010035	The next day he took out two silver coins and gave them to the innkeeper . ‘ Take care of him , ’ he told the innkeeper , ‘ and when I come back this way , I will pay you whatever else you spend on him . ’ ”
42010036	And Jesus concluded , “ In your opinion , which one of these three acted like a neighbor toward the man attacked by the robbers ? ”
42010037	The teacher of the Law answered , “ The one who was kind to him . ” Jesus replied , “ You go , then , and do the same . ”
42010038	As Jesus and his disciples went on their way , he came to a village where a woman named Martha welcomed him in her home .
42010039	She had a sister named Mary , who sat down at the feet of the Lord and listened to his teaching .
42010040	Martha was upset over all the work she had to do , so she came and said , “ Lord , don't you care that my sister has left me to do all the work by myself ? Tell her to come and help me ! ”
42010041	The Lord answered her , “ Martha , Martha ! You are worried and troubled over so many things ,
42010042	but just one is needed . Mary has chosen the right thing , and it will not be taken away from her . ”
42011001	One day Jesus was praying in a certain place . When he had finished , one of his disciples said to him , “ Lord , teach us to pray , just as John taught his disciples . ”
42011002	Jesus said to them , “ When you pray , say this : ‘ Father : May your holy name be honored ; may your Kingdom come .
42011003	Give us day by day the food we need .
42011004	Forgive us our sins , for we forgive everyone who does us wrong . And do not bring us to hard testing . ’ ”
42011005	And Jesus said to his disciples , “ Suppose one of you should go to a friend's house at midnight and say , ‘ Friend , let me borrow three loaves of bread .
42011006	A friend of mine who is on a trip has just come to my house , and I don't have any food for him ! ’
42011007	And suppose your friend should answer from inside , ‘ Don't bother me ! The door is already locked , and my children and I are in bed . I can't get up and give you anything . ’
42011008	Well , what then ? I tell you that even if he will not get up and give you the bread because you are his friend , yet he will get up and give you everything you need because you are not ashamed to keep on asking .
42011009	And so I say to you : Ask , and you will receive ; seek , and you will find ; knock , and the door will be opened to you .
42011010	For those who ask will receive , and those who seek will find , and the door will be opened to anyone who knocks .
42011011	Would any of you who are fathers give your son a snake when he asks for fish ?
42011012	Or would you give him a scorpion when he asks for an egg ?
42011013	As bad as you are , you know how to give good things to your children . How much more , then , will the Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him ! ”
42011014	Jesus was driving out a demon that could not talk ; and when the demon went out , the man began to talk . The crowds were amazed ,
42011015	but some of the people said , “ It is Beelzebul , the chief of the demons , who gives him the power to drive them out . ”
42011016	Others wanted to trap Jesus , so they asked him to perform a miracle to show that God approved of him .
42011017	But Jesus knew what they were thinking , so he said to them , “ Any country that divides itself into groups which fight each other will not last very long ; a family divided against itself falls apart .
42011018	So if Satan's kingdom has groups fighting each other , how can it last ? You say that I drive out demons because Beelzebul gives me the power to do so .
42011019	If this is how I drive them out , how do your followers drive them out ? Your own followers prove that you are wrong !
42011020	No , it is rather by means of God's power that I drive out demons , and this proves that the Kingdom of God has already come to you .
42011021	“ When a strong man , with all his weapons ready , guards his own house , all his belongings are safe .
42011022	But when a stronger man attacks him and defeats him , he carries away all the weapons the owner was depending on and divides up what he stole .
42011023	“ Anyone who is not for me is really against me ; anyone who does not help me gather is really scattering .
42011024	“ When an evil spirit goes out of a person , it travels over dry country looking for a place to rest . If it can't find one , it says to itself , ‘ I will go back to my house . ’
42011025	So it goes back and finds the house clean and all fixed up .
42011026	Then it goes out and brings seven other spirits even worse than itself , and they come and live there . So when it is all over , that person is in worse shape than at the beginning . ”
42011027	When Jesus had said this , a woman spoke up from the crowd and said to him , “ How happy is the woman who bore you and nursed you ! ”
42011028	But Jesus answered , “ Rather , how happy are those who hear the word of God and obey it ! ”
42011029	As the people crowded around Jesus , he went on to say , “ How evil are the people of this day ! They ask for a miracle , but none will be given them except the miracle of Jonah .
42011030	In the same way that the prophet Jonah was a sign for the people of Nineveh , so the Son of Man will be a sign for the people of this day .
42011031	On the Judgment Day the Queen of Sheba will stand up and accuse the people of today , because she traveled all the way from her country to listen to King Solomon's wise teaching ; and there is something here , I tell you , greater than Solomon .
42011032	On the Judgment Day the people of Nineveh will stand up and accuse you , because they turned from their sins when they heard Jonah preach ; and I assure you that there is something here greater than Jonah !
42011033	“ No one lights a lamp and then hides it or puts it under a bowl ; instead , it is put on the lampstand , so that people may see the light as they come in .
42011034	Your eyes are like a lamp for the body . When your eyes are sound , your whole body is full of light ; but when your eyes are no good , your whole body will be in darkness .
42011035	Make certain , then , that the light in you is not darkness .
42011036	If your whole body is full of light , with no part of it in darkness , it will be bright all over , as when a lamp shines on you with its brightness . ”
42011037	When Jesus finished speaking , a Pharisee invited him to eat with him ; so he went in and sat down to eat .
42011038	The Pharisee was surprised when he noticed that Jesus had not washed before eating .
42011039	So the Lord said to him , “ Now then , you Pharisees clean the outside of your cup and plate , but inside you are full of violence and evil .
42011040	Fools ! Did not God , who made the outside , also make the inside ?
42011041	But give what is in your cups and plates to the poor , and everything will be ritually clean for you .
42011042	“ How terrible for you Pharisees ! You give to God one tenth of the seasoning herbs , such as mint and rue and all the other herbs , but you neglect justice and love for God . These you should practice , without neglecting the others .
42011043	“ How terrible for you Pharisees ! You love the reserved seats in the synagogues and to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces .
42011044	How terrible for you ! You are like unmarked graves which people walk on without knowing it . ”
42011045	One of the teachers of the Law said to him , “ Teacher , when you say this , you insult us too ! ”
42011046	Jesus answered , “ How terrible also for you teachers of the Law ! You put onto people's backs loads which are hard to carry , but you yourselves will not stretch out a finger to help them carry those loads .
42011047	How terrible for you ! You make fine tombs for the prophets—the very prophets your ancestors murdered .
42011048	You yourselves admit , then , that you approve of what your ancestors did ; they murdered the prophets , and you build their tombs .
42011049	For this reason the Wisdom of God said , ‘ I will send them prophets and messengers ; they will kill some of them and persecute others . ’
42011050	So the people of this time will be punished for the murder of all the prophets killed since the creation of the world ,
42011051	from the murder of Abel to the murder of Zechariah , who was killed between the altar and the Holy Place . Yes , I tell you , the people of this time will be punished for them all !
42011052	“ How terrible for you teachers of the Law ! You have kept the key that opens the door to the house of knowledge ; you yourselves will not go in , and you stop those who are trying to go in ! ”
42011053	When Jesus left that place , the teachers of the Law and the Pharisees began to criticize him bitterly and ask him questions about many things ,
42011054	trying to lay traps for him and catch him saying something wrong .
42012001	As thousands of people crowded together , so that they were stepping on each other , Jesus said first to his disciples , “ Be on guard against the yeast of the Pharisees—I mean their hypocrisy .
42012002	Whatever is covered up will be uncovered , and every secret will be made known .
42012003	So then , whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in broad daylight , and whatever you have whispered in private in a closed room will be shouted from the housetops .
42012004	“ I tell you , my friends , do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot afterward do anything worse .
42012005	I will show you whom to fear : fear God , who , after killing , has the authority to throw into hell . Believe me , he is the one you must fear !
42012006	“ Aren't five sparrows sold for two pennies ? Yet not one sparrow is forgotten by God .
42012007	Even the hairs of your head have all been counted . So do not be afraid ; you are worth much more than many sparrows !
42012008	“ I assure you that those who declare publicly that they belong to me , the Son of Man will do the same for them before the angels of God .
42012009	But those who reject me publicly , the Son of Man will also reject them before the angels of God .
42012010	“ Whoever says a word against the Son of Man can be forgiven ; but whoever says evil things against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven .
42012011	“ When they bring you to be tried in the synagogues or before governors or rulers , do not be worried about how you will defend yourself or what you will say .
42012012	For the Holy Spirit will teach you at that time what you should say . ”
42012013	A man in the crowd said to Jesus , “ Teacher , tell my brother to divide with me the property our father left us . ”
42012014	Jesus answered him , “ Friend , who gave me the right to judge or to divide the property between you two ? ”
42012015	And he went on to say to them all , “ Watch out and guard yourselves from every kind of greed ; because your true life is not made up of the things you own , no matter how rich you may be . ”
42012016	Then Jesus told them this parable : “ There was once a rich man who had land which bore good crops .
42012017	He began to think to himself , ‘ I don't have a place to keep all my crops . What can I do ?
42012018	This is what I will do , ’ he told himself ; ‘ I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones , where I will store the grain and all my other goods .
42012019	Then I will say to myself , Lucky man ! You have all the good things you need for many years . Take life easy , eat , drink , and enjoy yourself ! ’
42012020	But God said to him , ‘ You fool ! This very night you will have to give up your life ; then who will get all these things you have kept for yourself ? ’ ”
42012021	And Jesus concluded , “ This is how it is with those who pile up riches for themselves but are not rich in God's sight . ”
42012022	Then Jesus said to the disciples , “ And so I tell you not to worry about the food you need to stay alive or about the clothes you need for your body .
42012023	Life is much more important than food , and the body much more important than clothes .
42012024	Look at the crows : they don't plant seeds or gather a harvest ; they don't have storage rooms or barns ; God feeds them ! You are worth so much more than birds !
42012025	Can any of you live a bit longer by worrying about it ?
42012026	If you can't manage even such a small thing , why worry about the other things ?
42012027	Look how the wild flowers grow : they don't work or make clothes for themselves . But I tell you that not even King Solomon with all his wealth had clothes as beautiful as one of these flowers .
42012028	It is God who clothes the wild grass—grass that is here today and gone tomorrow , burned up in the oven . Won't he be all the more sure to clothe you ? What little faith you have !
42012029	“ So don't be all upset , always concerned about what you will eat and drink .
42012030	( For the pagans of this world are always concerned about all these things . ) Your Father knows that you need these things .
42012031	Instead , be concerned with his Kingdom , and he will provide you with these things .
42012032	“ Do not be afraid , little flock , for your Father is pleased to give you the Kingdom .
42012033	Sell all your belongings and give the money to the poor . Provide for yourselves purses that don't wear out , and save your riches in heaven , where they will never decrease , because no thief can get to them , and no moth can destroy them .
42012034	For your heart will always be where your riches are .
42012035	“ Be ready for whatever comes , dressed for action and with your lamps lit ,
42012036	like servants who are waiting for their master to come back from a wedding feast . When he comes and knocks , they will open the door for him at once .
42012037	How happy are those servants whose master finds them awake and ready when he returns ! I tell you , he will take off his coat , have them sit down , and will wait on them .
42012038	How happy they are if he finds them ready , even if he should come at midnight or even later !
42012039	And you can be sure that if the owner of a house knew the time when the thief would come , he would not let the thief break into his house .
42012040	And you , too , must be ready , because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you are not expecting him . ”
42012041	Peter said , “ Lord , does this parable apply to us , or do you mean it for everyone ? ”
42012042	The Lord answered , “ Who , then , is the faithful and wise servant ? He is the one that his master will put in charge , to run the household and give the other servants their share of the food at the proper time .
42012043	How happy that servant is if his master finds him doing this when he comes home !
42012044	Indeed , I tell you , the master will put that servant in charge of all his property .
42012045	But if that servant says to himself that his master is taking a long time to come back and if he begins to beat the other servants , both the men and the women , and eats and drinks and gets drunk ,
42012046	then the master will come back one day when the servant does not expect him and at a time he does not know . The master will cut him in pieces and make him share the fate of the disobedient .
42012047	“ The servant who knows what his master wants him to do , but does not get himself ready and do it , will be punished with a heavy whipping .
42012048	But the servant who does not know what his master wants , and yet does something for which he deserves a whipping , will be punished with a light whipping . Much is required from the person to whom much is given ; much more is required from the person to whom much more is given .
42012049	“ I came to set the earth on fire , and how I wish it were already kindled !
42012050	I have a baptism to receive , and how distressed I am until it is over !
42012051	Do you suppose that I came to bring peace to the world ? No , not peace , but division .
42012052	From now on a family of five will be divided , three against two and two against three .
42012053	Fathers will be against their sons , and sons against their fathers ; mothers will be against their daughters , and daughters against their mothers ; mothers-in-law will be against their daughters-in-law , and daughters-in-law against their mothers-in-law . ”
42012054	Jesus said also to the people , “ When you see a cloud coming up in the west , at once you say that it is going to rain—and it does .
42012055	And when you feel the south wind blowing , you say that it is going to get hot—and it does .
42012056	Hypocrites ! You can look at the earth and the sky and predict the weather ; why , then , don't you know the meaning of this present time ?
42012057	“ Why do you not judge for yourselves the right thing to do ?
42012058	If someone brings a lawsuit against you and takes you to court , do your best to settle the dispute before you get to court . If you don't , you will be dragged before the judge , who will hand you over to the police , and you will be put in jail .
42012059	There you will stay , I tell you , until you pay the last penny of your fine . ”
42013001	At that time some people were there who told Jesus about the Galileans whom Pilate had killed while they were offering sacrifices to God .
42013002	Jesus answered them , “ Because those Galileans were killed in that way , do you think it proves that they were worse sinners than all other Galileans ?
42013003	No indeed ! And I tell you that if you do not turn from your sins , you will all die as they did .
42013004	What about those eighteen people in Siloam who were killed when the tower fell on them ? Do you suppose this proves that they were worse than all the other people living in Jerusalem ?
42013005	No indeed ! And I tell you that if you do not turn from your sins , you will all die as they did . ”
42013006	Then Jesus told them this parable : “ There was once a man who had a fig tree growing in his vineyard . He went looking for figs on it but found none .
42013007	So he said to his gardener , ‘ Look , for three years I have been coming here looking for figs on this fig tree , and I haven't found any . Cut it down ! Why should it go on using up the soil ? ’
42013008	But the gardener answered , ‘ Leave it alone , sir , just one more year ; I will dig around it and put in some fertilizer .
42013009	Then if the tree bears figs next year , so much the better ; if not , then you can have it cut down . ’ ”
42013010	One Sabbath Jesus was teaching in a synagogue .
42013011	A woman there had an evil spirit that had kept her sick for eighteen years ; she was bent over and could not straighten up at all .
42013012	When Jesus saw her , he called out to her , “ Woman , you are free from your sickness ! ”
42013013	He placed his hands on her , and at once she straightened herself up and praised God .
42013014	The official of the synagogue was angry that Jesus had healed on the Sabbath , so he spoke up and said to the people , “ There are six days in which we should work ; so come during those days and be healed , but not on the Sabbath ! ”
42013015	The Lord answered him , “ You hypocrites ! Any one of you would untie your ox or your donkey from the stall and take it out to give it water on the Sabbath .
42013016	Now here is this descendant of Abraham whom Satan has kept in bonds for eighteen years ; should she not be released on the Sabbath ? ”
42013017	His answer made his enemies ashamed of themselves , while the people rejoiced over all the wonderful things that he did .
42013018	Jesus asked , “ What is the Kingdom of God like ? What shall I compare it with ?
42013019	It is like this . A man takes a mustard seed and plants it in his field . The plant grows and becomes a tree , and the birds make their nests in its branches . ”
42013020	Again Jesus asked , “ What shall I compare the Kingdom of God with ?
42013021	It is like this . A woman takes some yeast and mixes it with a bushel of flour until the whole batch of dough rises . ”
42013022	Jesus went through towns and villages , teaching the people and making his way toward Jerusalem .
42013023	Someone asked him , “ Sir , will just a few people be saved ? ” Jesus answered them ,
42013024	“ Do your best to go in through the narrow door ; because many people will surely try to go in but will not be able .
42013025	The master of the house will get up and close the door ; then when you stand outside and begin to knock on the door and say , ‘ Open the door for us , sir ! ’ he will answer you , ‘ I don't know where you come from ! ’
42013026	Then you will answer , ‘ We ate and drank with you ; you taught in our town ! ’
42013027	But he will say again , ‘ I don't know where you come from . Get away from me , all you wicked people ! ’
42013028	How you will cry and gnash your teeth when you see Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , and all the prophets in the Kingdom of God , while you are thrown out !
42013029	People will come from the east and the west , from the north and the south , and sit down at the feast in the Kingdom of God .
42013030	Then those who are now last will be first , and those who are now first will be last . ”
42013031	At that same time some Pharisees came to Jesus and said to him , “ You must get out of here and go somewhere else , because Herod wants to kill you . ”
42013032	Jesus answered them , “ Go and tell that fox : ‘ I am driving out demons and performing cures today and tomorrow , and on the third day I shall finish my work . ’
42013033	Yet I must be on my way today , tomorrow , and the next day ; it is not right for a prophet to be killed anywhere except in Jerusalem .
42013034	“ Jerusalem , Jerusalem ! You kill the prophets , you stone the messengers God has sent you ! How many times I wanted to put my arms around all your people , just as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings , but you would not let me !
42013035	And so your Temple will be abandoned . I assure you that you will not see me until the time comes when you say , ‘ God bless him who comes in the name of the Lord . ’ ”
42014001	One Sabbath Jesus went to eat a meal at the home of one of the leading Pharisees ; and people were watching Jesus closely .
42014002	A man whose legs and arms were swollen came to Jesus ,
42014003	and Jesus spoke up and asked the teachers of the Law and the Pharisees , “ Does our Law allow healing on the Sabbath or not ? ”
42014004	But they would not say a thing . Jesus took the man , healed him , and sent him away .
42014005	Then he said to them , “ If any one of you had a child or an ox that happened to fall in a well on a Sabbath , would you not pull it out at once on the Sabbath itself ? ”
42014006	But they were not able to answer him about this .
42014007	Jesus noticed how some of the guests were choosing the best places , so he told this parable to all of them :
42014008	“ When someone invites you to a wedding feast , do not sit down in the best place . It could happen that someone more important than you has been invited ,
42014009	and your host , who invited both of you , would have to come and say to you , ‘ Let him have this place . ’ Then you would be embarrassed and have to sit in the lowest place .
42014010	Instead , when you are invited , go and sit in the lowest place , so that your host will come to you and say , ‘ Come on up , my friend , to a better place . ’ This will bring you honor in the presence of all the other guests .
42014011	For those who make themselves great will be humbled , and those who humble themselves will be made great . ”
42014012	Then Jesus said to his host , “ When you give a lunch or a dinner , do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or your rich neighbors—for they will invite you back , and in this way you will be paid for what you did .
42014013	When you give a feast , invite the poor , the crippled , the lame , and the blind ;
42014014	and you will be blessed , because they are not able to pay you back . God will repay you on the day the good people rise from death . ”
42014015	When one of the guests sitting at the table heard this , he said to Jesus , “ How happy are those who will sit down at the feast in the Kingdom of God ! ”
42014016	Jesus said to him , “ There was once a man who was giving a great feast to which he invited many people .
42014017	When it was time for the feast , he sent his servant to tell his guests , ‘ Come , everything is ready ! ’
42014018	But they all began , one after another , to make excuses . The first one told the servant , ‘ I have bought a field and must go and look at it ; please accept my apologies . ’
42014019	Another one said , ‘ I have bought five pairs of oxen and am on my way to try them out ; please accept my apologies . ’
42014020	Another one said , ‘ I have just gotten married , and for that reason I cannot come . ’
42014021	The servant went back and told all this to his master . The master was furious and said to his servant , ‘ Hurry out to the streets and alleys of the town , and bring back the poor , the crippled , the blind , and the lame . ’
42014022	Soon the servant said , ‘ Your order has been carried out , sir , but there is room for more . ’
42014023	So the master said to the servant , ‘ Go out to the country roads and lanes and make people come in , so that my house will be full .
42014024	I tell you all that none of those who were invited will taste my dinner ! ’ ”
42014025	Once when large crowds of people were going along with Jesus , he turned and said to them ,
42014026	“ Those who come to me cannot be my disciples unless they love me more than they love father and mother , wife and children , brothers and sisters , and themselves as well .
42014027	Those who do not carry their own cross and come after me cannot be my disciples .
42014028	If one of you is planning to build a tower , you sit down first and figure out what it will cost , to see if you have enough money to finish the job .
42014029	If you don't , you will not be able to finish the tower after laying the foundation ; and all who see what happened will make fun of you .
42014030	‘ You began to build but can't finish the job ! ’ they will say .
42014031	If a king goes out with ten thousand men to fight another king who comes against him with twenty thousand men , he will sit down first and decide if he is strong enough to face that other king .
42014032	If he isn't , he will send messengers to meet the other king to ask for terms of peace while he is still a long way off .
42014033	In the same way , ” concluded Jesus , “ none of you can be my disciple unless you give up everything you have .
42014034	“ Salt is good , but if it loses its saltiness , there is no way to make it salty again .
42014035	It is no good for the soil or for the manure pile ; it is thrown away . Listen , then , if you have ears ! ”
42015001	One day when many tax collectors and other outcasts came to listen to Jesus ,
42015002	the Pharisees and the teachers of the Law started grumbling , “ This man welcomes outcasts and even eats with them ! ”
42015003	So Jesus told them this parable :
42015004	“ Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them—what do you do ? You leave the other ninety-nine sheep in the pasture and go looking for the one that got lost until you find it .
42015005	When you find it , you are so happy that you put it on your shoulders
42015006	and carry it back home . Then you call your friends and neighbors together and say to them , ‘ I am so happy I found my lost sheep . Let us celebrate ! ’
42015007	In the same way , I tell you , there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine respectable people who do not need to repent .
42015008	“ Or suppose a woman who has ten silver coins loses one of them—what does she do ? She lights a lamp , sweeps her house , and looks carefully everywhere until she finds it .
42015009	When she finds it , she calls her friends and neighbors together , and says to them , ‘ I am so happy I found the coin I lost . Let us celebrate ! ’
42015010	In the same way , I tell you , the angels of God rejoice over one sinner who repents . ”
42015011	Jesus went on to say , “ There was once a man who had two sons .
42015012	The younger one said to him , ‘ Father , give me my share of the property now . ’ So the man divided his property between his two sons .
42015013	After a few days the younger son sold his part of the property and left home with the money . He went to a country far away , where he wasted his money in reckless living .
42015014	He spent everything he had . Then a severe famine spread over that country , and he was left without a thing .
42015015	So he went to work for one of the citizens of that country , who sent him out to his farm to take care of the pigs .
42015016	He wished he could fill himself with the bean pods the pigs ate , but no one gave him anything to eat .
42015017	At last he came to his senses and said , ‘ All my father's hired workers have more than they can eat , and here I am about to starve !
42015018	I will get up and go to my father and say , “ Father , I have sinned against God and against you .
42015019	I am no longer fit to be called your son ; treat me as one of your hired workers . ” ’
42015020	So he got up and started back to his father . “ He was still a long way from home when his father saw him ; his heart was filled with pity , and he ran , threw his arms around his son , and kissed him .
42015021	‘ Father , ’ the son said , ‘ I have sinned against God and against you . I am no longer fit to be called your son . ’
42015022	But the father called to his servants . ‘ Hurry ! ’ he said . ‘ Bring the best robe and put it on him . Put a ring on his finger and shoes on his feet .
42015023	Then go and get the prize calf and kill it , and let us celebrate with a feast !
42015024	For this son of mine was dead , but now he is alive ; he was lost , but now he has been found . ’ And so the feasting began .
42015025	“ In the meantime the older son was out in the field . On his way back , when he came close to the house , he heard the music and dancing .
42015026	So he called one of the servants and asked him , ‘ What's going on ? ’
42015027	‘ Your brother has come back home , ’ the servant answered , ‘ and your father has killed the prize calf , because he got him back safe and sound . ’
42015028	The older brother was so angry that he would not go into the house ; so his father came out and begged him to come in .
42015029	But he spoke back to his father , ‘ Look , all these years I have worked for you like a slave , and I have never disobeyed your orders . What have you given me ? Not even a goat for me to have a feast with my friends !
42015030	But this son of yours wasted all your property on prostitutes , and when he comes back home , you kill the prize calf for him ! ’
42015031	‘ My son , ’ the father answered , ‘ you are always here with me , and everything I have is yours .
42015032	But we had to celebrate and be happy , because your brother was dead , but now he is alive ; he was lost , but now he has been found . ’ ”
42016001	Jesus said to his disciples , “ There was once a rich man who had a servant who managed his property . The rich man was told that the manager was wasting his master's money ,
42016002	so he called him in and said , ‘ What is this I hear about you ? Turn in a complete account of your handling of my property , because you cannot be my manager any longer . ’
42016003	The servant said to himself , ‘ My master is going to dismiss me from my job . What shall I do ? I am not strong enough to dig ditches , and I am ashamed to beg .
42016004	Now I know what I will do ! Then when my job is gone , I shall have friends who will welcome me in their homes . ’
42016005	So he called in all the people who were in debt to his master . He asked the first one , ‘ How much do you owe my master ? ’
42016006	‘ One hundred barrels of olive oil , ’ he answered . ‘ Here is your account , ’ the manager told him ; ‘ sit down and write fifty . ’
42016007	Then he asked another one , ‘ And you—how much do you owe ? ’ ‘ A thousand bushels of wheat , ’ he answered . ‘ Here is your account , ’ the manager told him ; ‘ write eight hundred . ’
42016008	As a result the master of this dishonest manager praised him for doing such a shrewd thing ; because the people of this world are much more shrewd in handling their affairs than the people who belong to the light . ”
42016009	And Jesus went on to say , “ And so I tell you : make friends for yourselves with worldly wealth , so that when it gives out , you will be welcomed in the eternal home .
42016010	Whoever is faithful in small matters will be faithful in large ones ; whoever is dishonest in small matters will be dishonest in large ones .
42016011	If , then , you have not been faithful in handling worldly wealth , how can you be trusted with true wealth ?
42016012	And if you have not been faithful with what belongs to someone else , who will give you what belongs to you ?
42016013	“ No servant can be the slave of two masters ; such a slave will hate one and love the other or will be loyal to one and despise the other . You cannot serve both God and money . ”
42016014	When the Pharisees heard all this , they made fun of Jesus , because they loved money .
42016015	Jesus said to them , “ You are the ones who make yourselves look right in other people's sight , but God knows your hearts . For the things that are considered of great value by people are worth nothing in God's sight .
42016016	“ The Law of Moses and the writings of the prophets were in effect up to the time of John the Baptist ; since then the Good News about the Kingdom of God is being told , and everyone forces their way in .
42016017	But it is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the smallest detail of the Law to be done away with .
42016018	“ Any man who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery ; and the man who marries a divorced woman commits adultery .
42016019	“ There was once a rich man who dressed in the most expensive clothes and lived in great luxury every day .
42016020	There was also a poor man named Lazarus , covered with sores , who used to be brought to the rich man's door ,
42016021	hoping to eat the bits of food that fell from the rich man's table . Even the dogs would come and lick his sores .
42016022	The poor man died and was carried by the angels to sit beside Abraham at the feast in heaven . The rich man died and was buried ,
42016023	and in Hades , where he was in great pain , he looked up and saw Abraham , far away , with Lazarus at his side .
42016024	So he called out , ‘ Father Abraham ! Take pity on me , and send Lazarus to dip his finger in some water and cool off my tongue , because I am in great pain in this fire ! ’
42016025	But Abraham said , ‘ Remember , my son , that in your lifetime you were given all the good things , while Lazarus got all the bad things . But now he is enjoying himself here , while you are in pain .
42016026	Besides all that , there is a deep pit lying between us , so that those who want to cross over from here to you cannot do so , nor can anyone cross over to us from where you are . ’
42016027	The rich man said , ‘ Then I beg you , father Abraham , send Lazarus to my father's house ,
42016028	where I have five brothers . Let him go and warn them so that they , at least , will not come to this place of pain . ’
42016029	Abraham said , ‘ Your brothers have Moses and the prophets to warn them ; your brothers should listen to what they say . ’
42016030	The rich man answered , ‘ That is not enough , father Abraham ! But if someone were to rise from death and go to them , then they would turn from their sins . ’
42016031	But Abraham said , ‘ If they will not listen to Moses and the prophets , they will not be convinced even if someone were to rise from death . ’ ”
42017001	Jesus said to his disciples , “ Things that make people fall into sin are bound to happen , but how terrible for the one who makes them happen !
42017002	It would be better for him if a large millstone were tied around his neck and he were thrown into the sea than for him to cause one of these little ones to sin .
42017003	So watch what you do ! “ If your brother sins , rebuke him , and if he repents , forgive him .
42017004	If he sins against you seven times in one day , and each time he comes to you saying , ‘ I repent , ’ you must forgive him . ”
42017005	The apostles said to the Lord , “ Make our faith greater . ”
42017006	The Lord answered , “ If you had faith as big as a mustard seed , you could say to this mulberry tree , ‘ Pull yourself up by the roots and plant yourself in the sea ! ’ and it would obey you .
42017007	“ Suppose one of you has a servant who is plowing or looking after the sheep . When he comes in from the field , do you tell him to hurry along and eat his meal ?
42017008	Of course not ! Instead , you say to him , ‘ Get my supper ready , then put on your apron and wait on me while I eat and drink ; after that you may have your meal . ’
42017009	The servant does not deserve thanks for obeying orders , does he ?
42017010	It is the same with you ; when you have done all you have been told to do , say , ‘ We are ordinary servants ; we have only done our duty . ’ ”
42017011	As Jesus made his way to Jerusalem , he went along the border between Samaria and Galilee .
42017012	He was going into a village when he was met by ten men suffering from a dreaded skin disease . They stood at a distance
42017013	and shouted , “ Jesus ! Master ! Have pity on us ! ”
42017014	Jesus saw them and said to them , “ Go and let the priests examine you . ” On the way they were made clean .
42017015	When one of them saw that he was healed , he came back , praising God in a loud voice .
42017016	He threw himself to the ground at Jesus' feet and thanked him . The man was a Samaritan .
42017017	Jesus spoke up , “ There were ten who were healed ; where are the other nine ?
42017018	Why is this foreigner the only one who came back to give thanks to God ? ”
42017019	And Jesus said to him , “ Get up and go ; your faith has made you well . ”
42017020	Some Pharisees asked Jesus when the Kingdom of God would come . His answer was , “ The Kingdom of God does not come in such a way as to be seen .
42017021	No one will say , ‘ Look , here it is ! ’ or , ‘ There it is ! ’ ; because the Kingdom of God is within you . ”
42017022	Then he said to the disciples , “ The time will come when you will wish you could see one of the days of the Son of Man , but you will not see it .
42017023	There will be those who will say to you , ‘ Look , over there ! ’ or , ‘ Look , over here ! ’ But don't go out looking for it .
42017024	As the lightning flashes across the sky and lights it up from one side to the other , so will the Son of Man be in his day .
42017025	But first he must suffer much and be rejected by the people of this day .
42017026	As it was in the time of Noah so shall it be in the days of the Son of Man .
42017027	Everybody kept on eating and drinking , and men and women married , up to the very day Noah went into the boat and the flood came and killed them all .
42017028	It will be as it was in the time of Lot . Everybody kept on eating and drinking , buying and selling , planting and building .
42017029	On the day Lot left Sodom , fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and killed them all .
42017030	That is how it will be on the day the Son of Man is revealed .
42017031	“ On that day someone who is on the roof of a house must not go down into the house to get any belongings ; in the same way anyone who is out in the field must not go back to the house .
42017032	Remember Lot's wife !
42017033	Those who try to save their own life will lose it ; those who lose their life will save it .
42017034	On that night , I tell you , there will be two people sleeping in the same bed : one will be taken away , the other will be left behind .
42017035	Two women will be grinding meal together : one will be taken away , the other will be left behind . ”
42017037	The disciples asked him , “ Where , Lord ? ” Jesus answered , “ Wherever there is a dead body , the vultures will gather . ”
42018001	Then Jesus told his disciples a parable to teach them that they should always pray and never become discouraged .
42018002	“ In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor respected people .
42018003	And there was a widow in that same town who kept coming to him and pleading for her rights , saying , ‘ Help me against my opponent ! ’
42018004	For a long time the judge refused to act , but at last he said to himself , ‘ Even though I don't fear God or respect people ,
42018005	yet because of all the trouble this widow is giving me , I will see to it that she gets her rights . If I don't , she will keep on coming and finally wear me out ! ’ ”
42018006	And the Lord continued , “ Listen to what that corrupt judge said .
42018007	Now , will God not judge in favor of his own people who cry to him day and night for help ? Will he be slow to help them ?
42018008	I tell you , he will judge in their favor and do it quickly . But will the Son of Man find faith on earth when he comes ? ”
42018009	Jesus also told this parable to people who were sure of their own goodness and despised everybody else .
42018010	“ Once there were two men who went up to the Temple to pray : one was a Pharisee , the other a tax collector .
42018011	The Pharisee stood apart by himself and prayed , ‘ I thank you , God , that I am not greedy , dishonest , or an adulterer , like everybody else . I thank you that I am not like that tax collector over there .
42018012	I fast two days a week , and I give you one tenth of all my income . ’
42018013	But the tax collector stood at a distance and would not even raise his face to heaven , but beat on his breast and said , ‘ God , have pity on me , a sinner ! ’
42018014	I tell you , ” said Jesus , “ the tax collector , and not the Pharisee , was in the right with God when he went home . For those who make themselves great will be humbled , and those who humble themselves will be made great . ”
42018015	Some people brought their babies to Jesus for him to place his hands on them . The disciples saw them and scolded them for doing so ,
42018016	but Jesus called the children to him and said , “ Let the children come to me and do not stop them , because the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these .
42018017	Remember this ! Whoever does not receive the Kingdom of God like a child will never enter it . ”
42018018	A Jewish leader asked Jesus , “ Good Teacher , what must I do to receive eternal life ? ”
42018019	“ Why do you call me good ? ” Jesus asked him . “ No one is good except God alone .
42018020	You know the commandments : ‘ Do not commit adultery ; do not commit murder ; do not steal ; do not accuse anyone falsely ; respect your father and your mother . ’ ”
42018021	The man replied , “ Ever since I was young , I have obeyed all these commandments . ”
42018022	When Jesus heard this , he said to him , “ There is still one more thing you need to do . Sell all you have and give the money to the poor , and you will have riches in heaven ; then come and follow me . ”
42018023	But when the man heard this , he became very sad , because he was very rich .
42018024	Jesus saw that he was sad and said , “ How hard it is for rich people to enter the Kingdom of God !
42018025	It is much harder for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of God than for a camel to go through the eye of a needle . ”
42018026	The people who heard him asked , “ Who , then , can be saved ? ”
42018027	Jesus answered , “ What is humanly impossible is possible for God . ”
42018028	Then Peter said , “ Look ! We have left our homes to follow you . ”
42018029	“ Yes , ” Jesus said to them , “ and I assure you that anyone who leaves home or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the Kingdom of God
42018030	will receive much more in this present age and eternal life in the age to come . ”
42018031	Jesus took the twelve disciples aside and said to them , “ Listen ! We are going to Jerusalem where everything the prophets wrote about the Son of Man will come true .
42018032	He will be handed over to the Gentiles , who will make fun of him , insult him , and spit on him .
42018033	They will whip him and kill him , but three days later he will rise to life . ”
42018034	But the disciples did not understand any of these things ; the meaning of the words was hidden from them , and they did not know what Jesus was talking about .
42018035	As Jesus was coming near Jericho , there was a blind man sitting by the road , begging .
42018036	When he heard the crowd passing by , he asked , “ What is this ? ”
42018037	“ Jesus of Nazareth is passing by , ” they told him .
42018038	He cried out , “ Jesus ! Son of David ! Have mercy on me ! ”
42018039	The people in front scolded him and told him to be quiet . But he shouted even more loudly , “ Son of David ! Have mercy on me ! ”
42018040	So Jesus stopped and ordered the blind man to be brought to him . When he came near , Jesus asked him ,
42018041	“ What do you want me to do for you ? ” “ Sir , ” he answered , “ I want to see again . ”
42018042	Jesus said to him , “ Then see ! Your faith has made you well . ”
42018043	At once he was able to see , and he followed Jesus , giving thanks to God . When the crowd saw it , they all praised God .
42019001	Jesus went on into Jericho and was passing through .
42019002	There was a chief tax collector there named Zacchaeus , who was rich .
42019003	He was trying to see who Jesus was , but he was a little man and could not see Jesus because of the crowd .
42019004	So he ran ahead of the crowd and climbed a sycamore tree to see Jesus , who was going to pass that way .
42019005	When Jesus came to that place , he looked up and said to Zacchaeus , “ Hurry down , Zacchaeus , because I must stay in your house today . ”
42019006	Zacchaeus hurried down and welcomed him with great joy .
42019007	All the people who saw it started grumbling , “ This man has gone as a guest to the home of a sinner ! ”
42019008	Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord , “ Listen , sir ! I will give half my belongings to the poor , and if I have cheated anyone , I will pay back four times as much . ”
42019009	Jesus said to him , “ Salvation has come to this house today , for this man , also , is a descendant of Abraham .
42019010	The Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost . ”
42019011	While the people were listening to this , Jesus continued and told them a parable . He was now almost at Jerusalem , and they supposed that the Kingdom of God was just about to appear .
42019012	So he said , “ There was once a man of high rank who was going to a country far away to be made king , after which he planned to come back home .
42019013	Before he left , he called his ten servants and gave them each a gold coin and told them , ‘ See what you can earn with this while I am gone . ’
42019014	Now , his own people hated him , and so they sent messengers after him to say , ‘ We don't want this man to be our king . ’
42019015	“ The man was made king and came back . At once he ordered his servants to appear before him , in order to find out how much they had earned .
42019016	The first one came and said , ‘ Sir , I have earned ten gold coins with the one you gave me . ’
42019017	‘ Well done , ’ he said ; ‘ you are a good servant ! Since you were faithful in small matters , I will put you in charge of ten cities . ’
42019018	The second servant came and said , ‘ Sir , I have earned five gold coins with the one you gave me . ’
42019019	To this one he said , ‘ You will be in charge of five cities . ’
42019020	Another servant came and said , ‘ Sir , here is your gold coin ; I kept it hidden in a handkerchief .
42019021	I was afraid of you , because you are a hard man . You take what is not yours and reap what you did not plant . ’
42019022	He said to him , ‘ You bad servant ! I will use your own words to condemn you ! You know that I am a hard man , taking what is not mine and reaping what I have not planted .
42019023	Well , then , why didn't you put my money in the bank ? Then I would have received it back with interest when I returned . ’
42019024	Then he said to those who were standing there , ‘ Take the gold coin away from him and give it to the servant who has ten coins . ’
42019025	But they said to him , ‘ Sir , he already has ten coins ! ’
42019026	‘ I tell you , ’ he replied , ‘ that to those who have something , even more will be given ; but those who have nothing , even the little that they have will be taken away from them .
42019027	Now , as for those enemies of mine who did not want me to be their king , bring them here and kill them in my presence ! ’ ”
42019028	After Jesus said this , he went on in front of them toward Jerusalem .
42019029	As he came near Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives , he sent two disciples ahead
42019030	with these instructions : “ Go to the village there ahead of you ; as you go in , you will find a colt tied up that has never been ridden . Untie it and bring it here .
42019031	If someone asks you why you are untying it , tell him that the Master needs it . ”
42019032	They went on their way and found everything just as Jesus had told them .
42019033	As they were untying the colt , its owners said to them , “ Why are you untying it ? ”
42019034	“ The Master needs it , ” they answered ,
42019035	and they took the colt to Jesus . Then they threw their cloaks over the animal and helped Jesus get on .
42019036	As he rode on , people spread their cloaks on the road .
42019037	When he came near Jerusalem , at the place where the road went down the Mount of Olives , the large crowd of his disciples began to thank God and praise him in loud voices for all the great things that they had seen :
42019038	“ God bless the king who comes in the name of the Lord ! Peace in heaven and glory to God ! ”
42019039	Then some of the Pharisees in the crowd spoke to Jesus . “ Teacher , ” they said , “ command your disciples to be quiet ! ”
42019040	Jesus answered , “ I tell you that if they keep quiet , the stones themselves will start shouting . ”
42019041	He came closer to the city , and when he saw it , he wept over it ,
42019042	saying , “ If you only knew today what is needed for peace ! But now you cannot see it !
42019043	The time will come when your enemies will surround you with barricades , blockade you , and close in on you from every side .
42019044	They will completely destroy you and the people within your walls ; not a single stone will they leave in its place , because you did not recognize the time when God came to save you ! ”
42019045	Then Jesus went into the Temple and began to drive out the merchants ,
42019046	saying to them , “ It is written in the Scriptures that God said , ‘ My Temple will be a house of prayer . ’ But you have turned it into a hideout for thieves ! ”
42019047	Every day Jesus taught in the Temple . The chief priests , the teachers of the Law , and the leaders of the people wanted to kill him ,
42019048	but they could not find a way to do it , because all the people kept listening to him , not wanting to miss a single word .
42020001	One day when Jesus was in the Temple teaching the people and preaching the Good News , the chief priests and the teachers of the Law , together with the elders , came
42020002	and said to him , “ Tell us , what right do you have to do these things ? Who gave you such right ? ”
42020003	Jesus answered them , “ Now let me ask you a question . Tell me ,
42020004	did John's right to baptize come from God or from human beings ? ”
42020005	They started to argue among themselves , “ What shall we say ? If we say , ‘ From God , ’ he will say , ‘ Why , then , did you not believe John ? ’
42020006	But if we say , ‘ From human beings , ’ this whole crowd here will stone us , because they are convinced that John was a prophet . ”
42020007	So they answered , “ We don't know where it came from . ”
42020008	And Jesus said to them , “ Neither will I tell you , then , by what right I do these things . ”
42020009	Then Jesus told the people this parable : “ There was once a man who planted a vineyard , rented it out to tenants , and then left home for a long time .
42020010	When the time came to gather the grapes , he sent a slave to the tenants to receive from them his share of the harvest . But the tenants beat the slave and sent him back without a thing .
42020011	So he sent another slave ; but the tenants beat him also , treated him shamefully , and sent him back without a thing .
42020012	Then he sent a third slave ; the tenants wounded him , too , and threw him out .
42020013	Then the owner of the vineyard said , ‘ What shall I do ? I will send my own dear son ; surely they will respect him ! ’
42020014	But when the tenants saw him , they said to one another , ‘ This is the owner's son . Let's kill him , and his property will be ours ! ’
42020015	So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him . “ What , then , will the owner of the vineyard do to the tenants ? ” Jesus asked .
42020016	“ He will come and kill those men , and turn the vineyard over to other tenants . ” When the people heard this , they said , “ Surely not ! ”
42020017	Jesus looked at them and asked , “ What , then , does this scripture mean ? ‘ The stone which the builders rejected as worthless turned out to be the most important of all . ’
42020019	The teachers of the Law and the chief priests tried to arrest Jesus on the spot , because they knew that he had told this parable against them ; but they were afraid of the people .
42020020	So they looked for an opportunity . They bribed some men to pretend they were sincere , and they sent them to trap Jesus with questions , so that they could hand him over to the authority and power of the Roman Governor .
42020021	These spies said to Jesus , “ Teacher , we know that what you say and teach is right . We know that you pay no attention to anyone's status , but teach the truth about God's will for people .
42020022	Tell us , is it against our Law for us to pay taxes to the Roman Emperor , or not ? ”
42020023	But Jesus saw through their trick and said to them ,
42020024	“ Show me a silver coin . Whose face and name are these on it ? ” “ The Emperor's , ” they answered .
42020025	So Jesus said , “ Well , then , pay to the Emperor what belongs to the Emperor , and pay to God what belongs to God . ”
42020026	There before the people they could not catch him in a thing , so they kept quiet , amazed at his answer .
42020027	Then some Sadducees , who say that people will not rise from death , came to Jesus and said ,
42020028	“ Teacher , Moses wrote this law for us : ‘ If a man dies and leaves a wife but no children , that man's brother must marry the widow so that they can have children who will be considered the dead man's children . ’
42020029	Once there were seven brothers ; the oldest got married and died without having children .
42020030	Then the second one married the woman ,
42020031	and then the third . The same thing happened to all seven—they died without having children .
42020032	Last of all , the woman died .
42020033	Now , on the day when the dead rise to life , whose wife will she be ? All seven of them had married her . ”
42020034	Jesus answered them , “ The men and women of this age marry ,
42020035	but the men and women who are worthy to rise from death and live in the age to come will not then marry .
42020036	They will be like angels and cannot die . They are the children of God , because they have risen from death .
42020037	And Moses clearly proves that the dead are raised to life . In the passage about the burning bush he speaks of the Lord as ‘ the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . ’
42020038	He is the God of the living , not of the dead , for to him all are alive . ”
42020039	Some of the teachers of the Law spoke up , “ A good answer , Teacher ! ”
42020040	For they did not dare ask him any more questions .
42020041	Jesus asked them , “ How can it be said that the Messiah will be the descendant of David ?
42020042	For David himself says in the book of Psalms , ‘ The Lord said to my Lord : Sit here at my right side
42020043	until I put your enemies as a footstool under your feet . ’
42020045	As all the people listened to him , Jesus said to his disciples ,
42020046	“ Be on your guard against the teachers of the Law , who like to walk around in their long robes and love to be greeted with respect in the marketplace ; who choose the reserved seats in the synagogues and the best places at feasts ;
42020047	who take advantage of widows and rob them of their homes , and then make a show of saying long prayers ! Their punishment will be all the worse ! ”
42021001	Jesus looked around and saw rich people dropping their gifts in the Temple treasury ,
42021002	and he also saw a very poor widow dropping in two little copper coins .
42021003	He said , “ I tell you that this poor widow put in more than all the others .
42021004	For the others offered their gifts from what they had to spare of their riches ; but she , poor as she is , gave all she had to live on . ”
42021005	Some of the disciples were talking about the Temple , how beautiful it looked with its fine stones and the gifts offered to God . Jesus said ,
42021006	“ All this you see—the time will come when not a single stone here will be left in its place ; every one will be thrown down . ”
42021007	“ Teacher , ” they asked , “ when will this be ? And what will happen in order to show that the time has come for it to take place ? ”
42021008	Jesus said , “ Watch out ; don't be fooled . Many men , claiming to speak for me , will come and say , ‘ I am he ! ’ and , ‘ The time has come ! ’ But don't follow them .
42021009	Don't be afraid when you hear of wars and revolutions ; such things must happen first , but they do not mean that the end is near . ”
42021010	He went on to say , “ Countries will fight each other ; kingdoms will attack one another .
42021011	There will be terrible earthquakes , famines , and plagues everywhere ; there will be strange and terrifying things coming from the sky .
42021012	Before all these things take place , however , you will be arrested and persecuted ; you will be handed over to be tried in synagogues and be put in prison ; you will be brought before kings and rulers for my sake .
42021013	This will be your chance to tell the Good News .
42021014	Make up your minds ahead of time not to worry about how you will defend yourselves ,
42021015	because I will give you such words and wisdom that none of your enemies will be able to refute or contradict what you say .
42021016	You will be handed over by your parents , your brothers , your relatives , and your friends ; and some of you will be put to death .
42021017	Everyone will hate you because of me .
42021018	But not a single hair from your heads will be lost .
42021019	Stand firm , and you will save yourselves .
42021020	“ When you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies , then you will know that it will soon be destroyed .
42021021	Then those who are in Judea must run away to the hills ; those who are in the city must leave , and those who are out in the country must not go into the city .
42021022	For those will be ‘ The Days of Punishment , ’ to make come true all that the Scriptures say .
42021023	How terrible it will be in those days for women who are pregnant and for mothers with little babies ! Terrible distress will come upon this land , and God's punishment will fall on this people .
42021024	Some will be killed by the sword , and others will be taken as prisoners to all countries ; and the heathen will trample over Jerusalem until their time is up .
42021025	“ There will be strange things happening to the sun , the moon , and the stars . On earth whole countries will be in despair , afraid of the roar of the sea and the raging tides .
42021026	People will faint from fear as they wait for what is coming over the whole earth , for the powers in space will be driven from their courses .
42021027	Then the Son of Man will appear , coming in a cloud with great power and glory .
42021028	When these things begin to happen , stand up and raise your heads , because your salvation is near . ”
42021029	Then Jesus told them this parable : “ Think of the fig tree and all the other trees .
42021030	When you see their leaves beginning to appear , you know that summer is near .
42021031	In the same way , when you see these things happening , you will know that the Kingdom of God is about to come .
42021032	“ Remember that all these things will take place before the people now living have all died .
42021033	Heaven and earth will pass away , but my words will never pass away .
42021034	“ Be careful not to let yourselves become occupied with too much feasting and drinking and with the worries of this life , or that Day may suddenly catch you
42021035	like a trap . For it will come upon all people everywhere on earth .
42021036	Be on watch and pray always that you will have the strength to go safely through all those things that will happen and to stand before the Son of Man . ”
42021037	Jesus spent those days teaching in the Temple , and when evening came , he would go out and spend the night on the Mount of Olives .
42021038	Early each morning all the people went to the Temple to listen to him .
42022001	The time was near for the Festival of Unleavened Bread , which is called the Passover .
42022002	The chief priests and the teachers of the Law were afraid of the people , and so they were trying to find a way of putting Jesus to death secretly .
42022003	Then Satan entered into Judas , called Iscariot , who was one of the twelve disciples .
42022004	So Judas went off and spoke with the chief priests and the officers of the Temple guard about how he could betray Jesus to them .
42022005	They were pleased and offered to pay him money .
42022006	Judas agreed to it and started looking for a good chance to hand Jesus over to them without the people knowing about it .
42022007	The day came during the Festival of Unleavened Bread when the lambs for the Passover meal were to be killed .
42022008	Jesus sent Peter and John with these instructions : “ Go and get the Passover meal ready for us to eat . ”
42022009	“ Where do you want us to get it ready ? ” they asked him .
42022010	He answered , “ As you go into the city , a man carrying a jar of water will meet you . Follow him into the house that he enters ,
42022011	and say to the owner of the house : ‘ The Teacher says to you , Where is the room where my disciples and I will eat the Passover meal ? ’
42022012	He will show you a large furnished room upstairs , where you will get everything ready . ”
42022013	They went off and found everything just as Jesus had told them , and they prepared the Passover meal .
42022014	When the hour came , Jesus took his place at the table with the apostles .
42022015	He said to them , “ I have wanted so much to eat this Passover meal with you before I suffer !
42022016	For I tell you , I will never eat it until it is given its full meaning in the Kingdom of God . ”
42022017	Then Jesus took a cup , gave thanks to God , and said , “ Take this and share it among yourselves .
42022018	I tell you that from now on I will not drink this wine until the Kingdom of God comes . ”
42022019	Then he took a piece of bread , gave thanks to God , broke it , and gave it to them , saying , “ This is my body , which is given for you . Do this in memory of me . ”
42022020	In the same way , he gave them the cup after the supper , saying , “ This cup is God's new covenant sealed with my blood , which is poured out for you .
42022021	“ But , look ! The one who betrays me is here at the table with me !
42022022	The Son of Man will die as God has decided , but how terrible for that man who betrays him ! ”
42022023	Then they began to ask among themselves which one of them it could be who was going to do this .
42022024	An argument broke out among the disciples as to which one of them should be thought of as the greatest .
42022025	Jesus said to them , “ The kings of the pagans have power over their people , and the rulers claim the title ‘ Friends of the People . ’
42022026	But this is not the way it is with you ; rather , the greatest one among you must be like the youngest , and the leader must be like the servant .
42022027	Who is greater , the one who sits down to eat or the one who serves ? The one who sits down , of course . But I am among you as one who serves .
42022028	“ You have stayed with me all through my trials ;
42022029	and just as my Father has given me the right to rule , so I will give you the same right .
42022030	You will eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom , and you will sit on thrones to rule over the twelve tribes of Israel .
42022031	“ Simon , Simon ! Listen ! Satan has received permission to test all of you , to separate the good from the bad , as a farmer separates the wheat from the chaff .
42022032	But I have prayed for you , Simon , that your faith will not fail . And when you turn back to me , you must strengthen your brothers . ”
42022033	Peter answered , “ Lord , I am ready to go to prison with you and to die with you ! ”
42022034	“ I tell you , Peter , ” Jesus said , “ the rooster will not crow tonight until you have said three times that you do not know me . ”
42022035	Then Jesus asked his disciples , “ When I sent you out that time without purse , bag , or shoes , did you lack anything ? ” “ Not a thing , ” they answered .
42022036	“ But now , ” Jesus said , “ whoever has a purse or a bag must take it ; and whoever does not have a sword must sell his coat and buy one .
42022037	For I tell you that the scripture which says , ‘ He shared the fate of criminals , ’ must come true about me , because what was written about me is coming true . ”
42022038	The disciples said , “ Look ! Here are two swords , Lord ! ” “ That is enough ! ” he replied .
42022039	Jesus left the city and went , as he usually did , to the Mount of Olives ; and the disciples went with him .
42022040	When he arrived at the place , he said to them , “ Pray that you will not fall into temptation . ”
42022041	Then he went off from them about the distance of a stone's throw and knelt down and prayed .
42022042	“ Father , ” he said , “ if you will , take this cup of suffering away from me . Not my will , however , but your will be done . ”
42022043	An angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him .
42022044	In great anguish he prayed even more fervently ; his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground .
42022045	Rising from his prayer , he went back to the disciples and found them asleep , worn out by their grief .
42022046	He said to them , “ Why are you sleeping ? Get up and pray that you will not fall into temptation . ”
42022047	Jesus was still speaking when a crowd arrived , led by Judas , one of the twelve disciples . He came up to Jesus to kiss him .
42022048	But Jesus said , “ Judas , is it with a kiss that you betray the Son of Man ? ”
42022049	When the disciples who were with Jesus saw what was going to happen , they asked , “ Shall we use our swords , Lord ? ”
42022050	And one of them struck the High Priest's slave and cut off his right ear .
42022051	But Jesus said , “ Enough of this ! ” He touched the man's ear and healed him .
42022052	Then Jesus said to the chief priests and the officers of the Temple guard and the elders who had come there to get him , “ Did you have to come with swords and clubs , as though I were an outlaw ?
42022053	I was with you in the Temple every day , and you did not try to arrest me . But this is your hour to act , when the power of darkness rules . ”
42022054	They arrested Jesus and took him away into the house of the High Priest ; and Peter followed at a distance .
42022055	A fire had been lit in the center of the courtyard , and Peter joined those who were sitting around it .
42022056	When one of the servant women saw him sitting there at the fire , she looked straight at him and said , “ This man too was with Jesus ! ”
42022057	But Peter denied it , “ Woman , I don't even know him ! ”
42022058	After a little while a man noticed Peter and said , “ You are one of them , too ! ” But Peter answered , “ Man , I am not ! ”
42022059	And about an hour later another man insisted strongly , “ There isn't any doubt that this man was with Jesus , because he also is a Galilean ! ”
42022060	But Peter answered , “ Man , I don't know what you are talking about ! ” At once , while he was still speaking , a rooster crowed .
42022061	The Lord turned around and looked straight at Peter , and Peter remembered that the Lord had said to him , “ Before the rooster crows tonight , you will say three times that you do not know me . ”
42022062	Peter went out and wept bitterly .
42022063	The men who were guarding Jesus made fun of him and beat him .
42022064	They blindfolded him and asked him , “ Who hit you ? Guess ! ”
42022065	And they said many other insulting things to him .
42022066	When day came , the elders , the chief priests , and the teachers of the Law met together , and Jesus was brought before the Council .
42022067	“ Tell us , ” they said , “ are you the Messiah ? ” He answered , “ If I tell you , you will not believe me ;
42022068	and if I ask you a question , you will not answer .
42022069	But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right side of Almighty God . ”
42022070	They all said , “ Are you , then , the Son of God ? ” He answered them , “ You say that I am . ”
42022071	And they said , “ We don't need any witnesses ! We ourselves have heard what he said ! ”
42023001	The whole group rose up and took Jesus before Pilate ,
42023002	where they began to accuse him : “ We caught this man misleading our people , telling them not to pay taxes to the Emperor and claiming that he himself is the Messiah , a king . ”
42023003	Pilate asked him , “ Are you the king of the Jews ? ” “ So you say , ” answered Jesus .
42023004	Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds , “ I find no reason to condemn this man . ”
42023005	But they insisted even more strongly , “ With his teaching he is starting a riot among the people all through Judea . He began in Galilee and now has come here . ”
42023006	When Pilate heard this , he asked , “ Is this man a Galilean ? ”
42023007	When he learned that Jesus was from the region ruled by Herod , he sent him to Herod , who was also in Jerusalem at that time .
42023008	Herod was very pleased when he saw Jesus , because he had heard about him and had been wanting to see him for a long time . He was hoping to see Jesus perform some miracle .
42023009	So Herod asked Jesus many questions , but Jesus made no answer .
42023010	The chief priests and the teachers of the Law stepped forward and made strong accusations against Jesus .
42023011	Herod and his soldiers made fun of Jesus and treated him with contempt ; then they put a fine robe on him and sent him back to Pilate .
42023012	On that very day Herod and Pilate became friends ; before this they had been enemies .
42023013	Pilate called together the chief priests , the leaders , and the people ,
42023014	and said to them , “ You brought this man to me and said that he was misleading the people . Now , I have examined him here in your presence , and I have not found him guilty of any of the crimes you accuse him of .
42023015	Nor did Herod find him guilty , for he sent him back to us . There is nothing this man has done to deserve death .
42023016	So I will have him whipped and let him go . ”
42023018	The whole crowd cried out , “ Kill him ! Set Barabbas free for us ! ” (
42023019	Barabbas had been put in prison for a riot that had taken place in the city , and for murder . )
42023020	Pilate wanted to set Jesus free , so he appealed to the crowd again .
42023021	But they shouted back , “ Crucify him ! Crucify him ! ”
42023022	Pilate said to them the third time , “ But what crime has he committed ? I cannot find anything he has done to deserve death ! I will have him whipped and set him free . ”
42023023	But they kept on shouting at the top of their voices that Jesus should be crucified , and finally their shouting succeeded .
42023024	So Pilate passed the sentence on Jesus that they were asking for .
42023025	He set free the man they wanted , the one who had been put in prison for riot and murder , and he handed Jesus over for them to do as they wished .
42023026	The soldiers led Jesus away , and as they were going , they met a man from Cyrene named Simon who was coming into the city from the country . They seized him , put the cross on him , and made him carry it behind Jesus .
42023027	A large crowd of people followed him ; among them were some women who were weeping and wailing for him .
42023028	Jesus turned to them and said , “ Women of Jerusalem ! Don't cry for me , but for yourselves and your children .
42023029	For the days are coming when people will say , ‘ How lucky are the women who never had children , who never bore babies , who never nursed them ! ’
42023030	That will be the time when people will say to the mountains , ‘ Fall on us ! ’ and to the hills , ‘ Hide us ! ’
42023031	For if such things as these are done when the wood is green , what will happen when it is dry ? ”
42023032	Two other men , both of them criminals , were also led out to be put to death with Jesus .
42023033	When they came to the place called “ The Skull , ” they crucified Jesus there , and the two criminals , one on his right and the other on his left .
42023034	Jesus said , “ Forgive them , Father ! They don't know what they are doing . ” They divided his clothes among themselves by throwing dice .
42023035	The people stood there watching while the Jewish leaders made fun of him : “ He saved others ; let him save himself if he is the Messiah whom God has chosen ! ”
42023036	The soldiers also made fun of him : they came up to him and offered him cheap wine ,
42023037	and said , “ Save yourself if you are the king of the Jews ! ”
42023038	Above him were written these words : “ This is the King of the Jews . ”
42023039	One of the criminals hanging there hurled insults at him : “ Aren't you the Messiah ? Save yourself and us ! ”
42023040	The other one , however , rebuked him , saying , “ Don't you fear God ? You received the same sentence he did .
42023041	Ours , however , is only right , because we are getting what we deserve for what we did ; but he has done no wrong . ”
42023042	And he said to Jesus , “ Remember me , Jesus , when you come as King ! ”
42023043	Jesus said to him , “ I promise you that today you will be in Paradise with me . ”
42023046	Jesus cried out in a loud voice , “ Father ! In your hands I place my spirit ! ” He said this and died .
42023047	The army officer saw what had happened , and he praised God , saying , “ Certainly he was a good man ! ”
42023048	When the people who had gathered there to watch the spectacle saw what happened , they all went back home , beating their breasts in sorrow .
42023049	All those who knew Jesus personally , including the women who had followed him from Galilee , stood at a distance to watch .
42023052	He went into the presence of Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus .
42023053	Then he took the body down , wrapped it in a linen sheet , and placed it in a tomb which had been dug out of solid rock and which had never been used .
42023054	It was Friday , and the Sabbath was about to begin .
42023055	The women who had followed Jesus from Galilee went with Joseph and saw the tomb and how Jesus' body was placed in it .
42023056	Then they went back home and prepared the spices and perfumes for the body . On the Sabbath they rested , as the Law commanded .
42024001	Very early on Sunday morning the women went to the tomb , carrying the spices they had prepared .
42024002	They found the stone rolled away from the entrance to the tomb ,
42024003	so they went in ; but they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus .
42024004	They stood there puzzled about this , when suddenly two men in bright shining clothes stood by them .
42024005	Full of fear , the women bowed down to the ground , as the men said to them , “ Why are you looking among the dead for one who is alive ?
42024006	He is not here ; he has been raised . Remember what he said to you while he was in Galilee :
42024007	‘ The Son of Man must be handed over to sinners , be crucified , and three days later rise to life . ’ ”
42024008	Then the women remembered his words ,
42024009	returned from the tomb , and told all these things to the eleven disciples and all the rest .
42024010	The women were Mary Magdalene , Joanna , and Mary the mother of James ; they and the other women with them told these things to the apostles .
42024011	But the apostles thought that what the women said was nonsense , and they did not believe them .
42024012	But Peter got up and ran to the tomb ; he bent down and saw the grave cloths but nothing else . Then he went back home amazed at what had happened .
42024013	On that same day two of Jesus' followers were going to a village named Emmaus , about seven miles from Jerusalem ,
42024014	and they were talking to each other about all the things that had happened .
42024015	As they talked and discussed , Jesus himself drew near and walked along with them ;
42024016	they saw him , but somehow did not recognize him .
42024017	Jesus said to them , “ What are you talking about to each other , as you walk along ? ” They stood still , with sad faces .
42024018	One of them , named Cleopas , asked him , “ Are you the only visitor in Jerusalem who doesn't know the things that have been happening there these last few days ? ”
42024019	“ What things ? ” he asked . “ The things that happened to Jesus of Nazareth , ” they answered . “ This man was a prophet and was considered by God and by all the people to be powerful in everything he said and did .
42024020	Our chief priests and rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death , and he was crucified .
42024021	And we had hoped that he would be the one who was going to set Israel free ! Besides all that , this is now the third day since it happened .
42024022	Some of the women of our group surprised us ; they went at dawn to the tomb ,
42024023	but could not find his body . They came back saying they had seen a vision of angels who told them that he is alive .
42024024	Some of our group went to the tomb and found it exactly as the women had said , but they did not see him . ”
42024025	Then Jesus said to them , “ How foolish you are , how slow you are to believe everything the prophets said !
42024026	Was it not necessary for the Messiah to suffer these things and then to enter his glory ? ”
42024027	And Jesus explained to them what was said about himself in all the Scriptures , beginning with the books of Moses and the writings of all the prophets .
42024028	As they came near the village to which they were going , Jesus acted as if he were going farther ;
42024029	but they held him back , saying , “ Stay with us ; the day is almost over and it is getting dark . ” So he went in to stay with them .
42024030	He sat down to eat with them , took the bread , and said the blessing ; then he broke the bread and gave it to them .
42024031	Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him , but he disappeared from their sight .
42024032	They said to each other , “ Wasn't it like a fire burning in us when he talked to us on the road and explained the Scriptures to us ? ”
42024033	They got up at once and went back to Jerusalem , where they found the eleven disciples gathered together with the others
42024034	and saying , “ The Lord is risen indeed ! He has appeared to Simon ! ”
42024035	The two then explained to them what had happened on the road , and how they had recognized the Lord when he broke the bread .
42024036	While the two were telling them this , suddenly the Lord himself stood among them and said to them , “ Peace be with you . ”
42024037	They were terrified , thinking that they were seeing a ghost .
42024038	But he said to them , “ Why are you alarmed ? Why are these doubts coming up in your minds ?
42024039	Look at my hands and my feet , and see that it is I myself . Feel me , and you will know , for a ghost doesn't have flesh and bones , as you can see I have . ”
42024040	He said this and showed them his hands and his feet .
42024041	They still could not believe , they were so full of joy and wonder ; so he asked them , “ Do you have anything here to eat ? ”
42024042	They gave him a piece of cooked fish ,
42024043	which he took and ate in their presence .
42024044	Then he said to them , “ These are the very things I told you about while I was still with you : everything written about me in the Law of Moses , the writings of the prophets , and the Psalms had to come true . ”
42024045	Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures ,
42024046	and said to them , “ This is what is written : the Messiah must suffer and must rise from death three days later ,
42024047	and in his name the message about repentance and the forgiveness of sins must be preached to all nations , beginning in Jerusalem .
42024048	You are witnesses of these things .
42024049	And I myself will send upon you what my Father has promised . But you must wait in the city until the power from above comes down upon you . ”
42024050	Then he led them out of the city as far as Bethany , where he raised his hands and blessed them .
42024051	As he was blessing them , he departed from them and was taken up into heaven .
42024052	They worshiped him and went back into Jerusalem , filled with great joy ,
42024053	and spent all their time in the Temple giving thanks to God .
43001001	In the beginning the Word already existed ; the Word was with God , and the Word was God .
43001002	From the very beginning the Word was with God .
43001003	Through him God made all things ; not one thing in all creation was made without him .
43001004	The Word was the source of life , and this life brought light to people .
43001005	The light shines in the darkness , and the darkness has never put it out .
43001006	God sent his messenger , a man named John ,
43001007	who came to tell people about the light , so that all should hear the message and believe .
43001008	He himself was not the light ; he came to tell about the light .
43001009	This was the real light—the light that comes into the world and shines on all people .
43001010	The Word was in the world , and though God made the world through him , yet the world did not recognize him .
43001011	He came to his own country , but his own people did not receive him .
43001012	Some , however , did receive him and believed in him ; so he gave them the right to become God's children .
43001013	They did not become God's children by natural means , that is , by being born as the children of a human father ; God himself was their Father .
43001014	The Word became a human being and , full of grace and truth , lived among us . We saw his glory , the glory which he received as the Father's only Son .
43001015	John spoke about him . He cried out , “ This is the one I was talking about when I said , ‘ He comes after me , but he is greater than I am , because he existed before I was born . ’ ”
43001016	Out of the fullness of his grace he has blessed us all , giving us one blessing after another .
43001017	God gave the Law through Moses , but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ .
43001018	No one has ever seen God . The only Son , who is the same as God and is at the Father's side , he has made him known .
43001019	The Jewish authorities in Jerusalem sent some priests and Levites to John to ask him , “ Who are you ? ”
43001020	John did not refuse to answer , but spoke out openly and clearly , saying : “ I am not the Messiah . ”
43001021	“ Who are you , then ? ” they asked . “ Are you Elijah ? ” “ No , I am not , ” John answered . “ Are you the Prophet ? ” they asked . “ No , ” he replied .
43001022	“ Then tell us who you are , ” they said . “ We have to take an answer back to those who sent us . What do you say about yourself ? ”
43001023	John answered by quoting the prophet Isaiah : “ I am ‘ the voice of someone shouting in the desert : Make a straight path for the Lord to travel ! ’ ”
43001024	The messengers , who had been sent by the Pharisees ,
43001025	then asked John , “ If you are not the Messiah nor Elijah nor the Prophet , why do you baptize ? ”
43001026	John answered , “ I baptize with water , but among you stands the one you do not know .
43001027	He is coming after me , but I am not good enough even to untie his sandals . ”
43001028	All this happened in Bethany on the east side of the Jordan River , where John was baptizing .
43001029	The next day John saw Jesus coming to him , and said , “ There is the Lamb of God , who takes away the sin of the world !
43001030	This is the one I was talking about when I said , ‘ A man is coming after me , but he is greater than I am , because he existed before I was born . ’
43001031	I did not know who he would be , but I came baptizing with water in order to make him known to the people of Israel . ”
43001032	And John gave this testimony : “ I saw the Spirit come down like a dove from heaven and stay on him .
43001033	I still did not know that he was the one , but God , who sent me to baptize with water , had said to me , ‘ You will see the Spirit come down and stay on a man ; he is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit . ’
43001034	I have seen it , ” said John , “ and I tell you that he is the Son of God . ”
43001035	The next day John was standing there again with two of his disciples ,
43001036	when he saw Jesus walking by . “ There is the Lamb of God ! ” he said .
43001037	The two disciples heard him say this and went with Jesus .
43001038	Jesus turned , saw them following him , and asked , “ What are you looking for ? ” They answered , “ Where do you live , Rabbi ? ” ( This word means “ Teacher . ” )
43001039	“ Come and see , ” he answered . ( It was then about four o'clock in the afternoon . ) So they went with him and saw where he lived , and spent the rest of that day with him .
43001040	One of them was Andrew , Simon Peter's brother .
43001041	At once he found his brother Simon and told him , “ We have found the Messiah . ” ( This word means “ Christ . ” )
43001042	Then he took Simon to Jesus . Jesus looked at him and said , “ Your name is Simon son of John , but you will be called Cephas . ” ( This is the same as Peter and means “ a rock . ” )
43001043	The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee . He found Philip and said to him , “ Come with me ! ” (
43001044	Philip was from Bethsaida , the town where Andrew and Peter lived . )
43001045	Philip found Nathanael and told him , “ We have found the one whom Moses wrote about in the book of the Law and whom the prophets also wrote about . He is Jesus son of Joseph , from Nazareth . ”
43001046	“ Can anything good come from Nazareth ? ” Nathanael asked . “ Come and see , ” answered Philip .
43001047	When Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him , he said about him , “ Here is a real Israelite ; there is nothing false in him ! ”
43001048	Nathanael asked him , “ How do you know me ? ” Jesus answered , “ I saw you when you were under the fig tree before Philip called you . ”
43001049	“ Teacher , ” answered Nathanael , “ you are the Son of God ! You are the King of Israel ! ”
43001050	Jesus said , “ Do you believe just because I told you I saw you when you were under the fig tree ? You will see much greater things than this ! ”
43001051	And he said to them , “ I am telling you the truth : you will see heaven open and God's angels going up and coming down on the Son of Man . ”
43002001	Two days later there was a wedding in the town of Cana in Galilee . Jesus' mother was there ,
43002002	and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding .
43002003	When the wine had given out , Jesus' mother said to him , “ They are out of wine . ”
43002004	“ You must not tell me what to do , ” Jesus replied . “ My time has not yet come . ”
43002005	Jesus' mother then told the servants , “ Do whatever he tells you . ”
43002006	The Jews have rules about ritual washing , and for this purpose six stone water jars were there , each one large enough to hold between twenty and thirty gallons .
43002007	Jesus said to the servants , “ Fill these jars with water . ” They filled them to the brim ,
43002008	and then he told them , “ Now draw some water out and take it to the man in charge of the feast . ” They took him the water ,
43002009	which now had turned into wine , and he tasted it . He did not know where this wine had come from ( but , of course , the servants who had drawn out the water knew ) ; so he called the bridegroom
43002010	and said to him , “ Everyone else serves the best wine first , and after the guests have drunk a lot , he serves the ordinary wine . But you have kept the best wine until now ! ”
43002011	Jesus performed this first miracle in Cana in Galilee ; there he revealed his glory , and his disciples believed in him .
43002012	After this , Jesus and his mother , brothers , and disciples went to Capernaum and stayed there a few days .
43002013	It was almost time for the Passover Festival , so Jesus went to Jerusalem .
43002014	There in the Temple he found people selling cattle , sheep , and pigeons , and also the moneychangers sitting at their tables .
43002015	So he made a whip from cords and drove all the animals out of the Temple , both the sheep and the cattle ; he overturned the tables of the moneychangers and scattered their coins ;
43002016	and he ordered those who sold the pigeons , “ Take them out of here ! Stop making my Father's house a marketplace ! ”
43002017	His disciples remembered that the scripture says , “ My devotion to your house , O God , burns in me like a fire . ”
43002018	The Jewish authorities came back at him with a question , “ What miracle can you perform to show us that you have the right to do this ? ”
43002019	Jesus answered , “ Tear down this Temple , and in three days I will build it again . ”
43002020	“ Are you going to build it again in three days ? ” they asked him . “ It has taken forty-six years to build this Temple ! ”
43002021	But the temple Jesus was speaking about was his body .
43002022	So when he was raised from death , his disciples remembered that he had said this , and they believed the scripture and what Jesus had said .
43002023	While Jesus was in Jerusalem during the Passover Festival , many believed in him as they saw the miracles he performed .
43002024	But Jesus did not trust himself to them , because he knew them all .
43002025	There was no need for anyone to tell him about them , because he himself knew what was in their hearts .
43003001	There was a Jewish leader named Nicodemus , who belonged to the party of the Pharisees .
43003002	One night he went to Jesus and said to him , “ Rabbi , we know that you are a teacher sent by God . No one could perform the miracles you are doing unless God were with him . ”
43003003	Jesus answered , “ I am telling you the truth : no one can see the Kingdom of God without being born again . ”
43003004	“ How can a grown man be born again ? ” Nicodemus asked . “ He certainly cannot enter his mother's womb and be born a second time ! ”
43003005	“ I am telling you the truth , ” replied Jesus , “ that no one can enter the Kingdom of God without being born of water and the Spirit .
43003006	A person is born physically of human parents , but is born spiritually of the Spirit .
43003007	Do not be surprised because I tell you that you must all be born again .
43003008	The wind blows wherever it wishes ; you hear the sound it makes , but you do not know where it comes from or where it is going . It is like that with everyone who is born of the Spirit . ”
43003009	“ How can this be ? ” asked Nicodemus .
43003010	Jesus answered , “ You are a great teacher in Israel , and you don't know this ?
43003011	I am telling you the truth : we speak of what we know and report what we have seen , yet none of you is willing to accept our message .
43003012	You do not believe me when I tell you about the things of this world ; how will you ever believe me , then , when I tell you about the things of heaven ?
43003013	And no one has ever gone up to heaven except the Son of Man , who came down from heaven . ”
43003014	As Moses lifted up the bronze snake on a pole in the desert , in the same way the Son of Man must be lifted up ,
43003015	so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life .
43003016	For God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son , so that everyone who believes in him may not die but have eternal life .
43003017	For God did not send his Son into the world to be its judge , but to be its savior .
43003018	Those who believe in the Son are not judged ; but those who do not believe have already been judged , because they have not believed in God's only Son .
43003019	This is how the judgment works : the light has come into the world , but people love the darkness rather than the light , because their deeds are evil .
43003020	Those who do evil things hate the light and will not come to the light , because they do not want their evil deeds to be shown up .
43003021	But those who do what is true come to the light in order that the light may show that what they did was in obedience to God .
43003022	After this , Jesus and his disciples went to the province of Judea , where he spent some time with them and baptized .
43003023	John also was baptizing in Aenon , not far from Salim , because there was plenty of water in that place . People were going to him , and he was baptizing them . (
43003024	This was before John had been put in prison . )
43003025	Some of John's disciples began arguing with a Jew about the matter of ritual washing .
43003026	So they went to John and told him , “ Teacher , you remember the man who was with you on the east side of the Jordan , the one you spoke about ? Well , he is baptizing now , and everyone is going to him ! ”
43003027	John answered , “ No one can have anything unless God gives it .
43003028	You yourselves are my witnesses that I said , ‘ I am not the Messiah , but I have been sent ahead of him . ’
43003029	The bridegroom is the one to whom the bride belongs ; but the bridegroom's friend , who stands by and listens , is glad when he hears the bridegroom's voice . This is how my own happiness is made complete .
43003030	He must become more important while I become less important . ”
43003031	He who comes from above is greater than all . He who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks about earthly matters , but he who comes from heaven is above all .
43003032	He tells what he has seen and heard , yet no one accepts his message .
43003033	But whoever accepts his message confirms by this that God is truthful .
43003034	The one whom God has sent speaks God's words , because God gives him the fullness of his Spirit .
43003035	The Father loves his Son and has put everything in his power .
43003036	Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life ; whoever disobeys the Son will not have life , but will remain under God's punishment .
43004001	The Pharisees heard that Jesus was winning and baptizing more disciples than John . (
43004002	Actually , Jesus himself did not baptize anyone ; only his disciples did . )
43004003	So when Jesus heard what was being said , he left Judea and went back to Galilee ;
43004004	on his way there he had to go through Samaria .
43004005	In Samaria he came to a town named Sychar , which was not far from the field that Jacob had given to his son Joseph .
43004006	Jacob's well was there , and Jesus , tired out by the trip , sat down by the well . It was about noon .
43004007	A Samaritan woman came to draw some water , and Jesus said to her , “ Give me a drink of water . ” (
43004008	His disciples had gone into town to buy food . )
43004009	The woman answered , “ You are a Jew , and I am a Samaritan—so how can you ask me for a drink ? ” ( Jews will not use the same cups and bowls that Samaritans use . )
43004010	Jesus answered , “ If you only knew what God gives and who it is that is asking you for a drink , you would ask him , and he would give you life-giving water . ”
43004011	“ Sir , ” the woman said , “ you don't have a bucket , and the well is deep . Where would you get that life-giving water ?
43004012	It was our ancestor Jacob who gave us this well ; he and his children and his flocks all drank from it . You don't claim to be greater than Jacob , do you ? ”
43004013	Jesus answered , “ Those who drink this water will get thirsty again ,
43004014	but those who drink the water that I will give them will never be thirsty again . The water that I will give them will become in them a spring which will provide them with life-giving water and give them eternal life . ”
43004015	“ Sir , ” the woman said , “ give me that water ! Then I will never be thirsty again , nor will I have to come here to draw water . ”
43004016	“ Go and call your husband , ” Jesus told her , “ and come back . ”
43004017	“ I don't have a husband , ” she answered . Jesus replied , “ You are right when you say you don't have a husband .
43004018	You have been married to five men , and the man you live with now is not really your husband . You have told me the truth . ”
43004019	“ I see you are a prophet , sir , ” the woman said .
43004020	“ My Samaritan ancestors worshiped God on this mountain , but you Jews say that Jerusalem is the place where we should worship God . ”
43004021	Jesus said to her , “ Believe me , woman , the time will come when people will not worship the Father either on this mountain or in Jerusalem .
43004022	You Samaritans do not really know whom you worship ; but we Jews know whom we worship , because it is from the Jews that salvation comes .
43004023	But the time is coming and is already here , when by the power of God's Spirit people will worship the Father as he really is , offering him the true worship that he wants .
43004024	God is Spirit , and only by the power of his Spirit can people worship him as he really is . ”
43004025	The woman said to him , “ I know that the Messiah will come , and when he comes , he will tell us everything . ”
43004026	Jesus answered , “ I am he , I who am talking with you . ”
43004027	At that moment Jesus' disciples returned , and they were greatly surprised to find him talking with a woman . But none of them said to her , “ What do you want ? ” or asked him , “ Why are you talking with her ? ”
43004028	Then the woman left her water jar , went back to the town , and said to the people there ,
43004029	“ Come and see the man who told me everything I have ever done . Could he be the Messiah ? ”
43004030	So they left the town and went to Jesus .
43004031	In the meantime the disciples were begging Jesus , “ Teacher , have something to eat ! ”
43004032	But he answered , “ I have food to eat that you know nothing about . ”
43004033	So the disciples started asking among themselves , “ Could somebody have brought him food ? ”
43004034	“ My food , ” Jesus said to them , “ is to obey the will of the one who sent me and to finish the work he gave me to do .
43004035	You have a saying , ‘ Four more months and then the harvest . ’ But I tell you , take a good look at the fields ; the crops are now ripe and ready to be harvested !
43004036	The one who reaps the harvest is being paid and gathers the crops for eternal life ; so the one who plants and the one who reaps will be glad together .
43004037	For the saying is true , ‘ Someone plants , someone else reaps . ’
43004038	I have sent you to reap a harvest in a field where you did not work ; others worked there , and you profit from their work . ”
43004039	Many of the Samaritans in that town believed in Jesus because the woman had said , “ He told me everything I have ever done . ”
43004040	So when the Samaritans came to him , they begged him to stay with them , and Jesus stayed there two days .
43004041	Many more believed because of his message ,
43004042	and they told the woman , “ We believe now , not because of what you said , but because we ourselves have heard him , and we know that he really is the Savior of the world . ”
43004043	After spending two days there , Jesus left and went to Galilee .
43004044	For he himself had said , “ Prophets are not respected in their own country . ”
43004045	When he arrived in Galilee , the people there welcomed him , because they had gone to the Passover Festival in Jerusalem and had seen everything that he had done during the festival .
43004046	Then Jesus went back to Cana in Galilee , where he had turned the water into wine . A government official was there whose son was sick in Capernaum .
43004047	When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee , he went to him and asked him to go to Capernaum and heal his son , who was about to die .
43004048	Jesus said to him , “ None of you will ever believe unless you see miracles and wonders . ”
43004049	“ Sir , ” replied the official , “ come with me before my child dies . ”
43004050	Jesus said to him , “ Go ; your son will live ! ” The man believed Jesus' words and went .
43004051	On his way home his servants met him with the news , “ Your boy is going to live ! ”
43004052	He asked them what time it was when his son got better , and they answered , “ It was one o'clock yesterday afternoon when the fever left him . ”
43004053	Then the father remembered that it was at that very hour when Jesus had told him , “ Your son will live . ” So he and all his family believed .
43004054	This was the second miracle that Jesus performed after coming from Judea to Galilee .
43005001	After this , Jesus went to Jerusalem for a religious festival .
43005002	Near the Sheep Gate in Jerusalem there is a pool with five porches ; in Hebrew it is called Bethzatha .
43005003	A large crowd of sick people were lying on the porches—the blind , the lame , and the paralyzed .
43005005	A man was there who had been sick for thirty-eight years .
43005006	Jesus saw him lying there , and he knew that the man had been sick for such a long time ; so he asked him , “ Do you want to get well ? ”
43005007	The sick man answered , “ Sir , I don't have anyone here to put me in the pool when the water is stirred up ; while I am trying to get in , somebody else gets there first . ”
43005008	Jesus said to him , “ Get up , pick up your mat , and walk . ”
43005009	Immediately the man got well ; he picked up his mat and started walking . The day this happened was a Sabbath ,
43005010	so the Jewish authorities told the man who had been healed , “ This is a Sabbath , and it is against our Law for you to carry your mat . ”
43005011	He answered , “ The man who made me well told me to pick up my mat and walk . ”
43005012	They asked him , “ Who is the man who told you to do this ? ”
43005013	But the man who had been healed did not know who Jesus was , for there was a crowd in that place , and Jesus had slipped away .
43005014	Afterward , Jesus found him in the Temple and said , “ Listen , you are well now ; so stop sinning or something worse may happen to you . ”
43005015	Then the man left and told the Jewish authorities that it was Jesus who had healed him .
43005016	So they began to persecute Jesus , because he had done this healing on a Sabbath .
43005017	Jesus answered them , “ My Father is always working , and I too must work . ”
43005018	This saying made the Jewish authorities all the more determined to kill him ; not only had he broken the Sabbath law , but he had said that God was his own Father and in this way had made himself equal with God .
43005019	So Jesus answered them , “ I tell you the truth : the Son can do nothing on his own ; he does only what he sees his Father doing . What the Father does , the Son also does .
43005020	For the Father loves the Son and shows him all that he himself is doing . He will show him even greater things to do than this , and you will all be amazed .
43005021	Just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life , in the same way the Son gives life to those he wants to .
43005022	Nor does the Father himself judge anyone . He has given his Son the full right to judge ,
43005023	so that all will honor the Son in the same way as they honor the Father . Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him .
43005024	“ I am telling you the truth : those who hear my words and believe in him who sent me have eternal life . They will not be judged , but have already passed from death to life .
43005025	I am telling you the truth : the time is coming—the time has already come—when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God , and those who hear it will come to life .
43005026	Just as the Father is himself the source of life , in the same way he has made his Son to be the source of life .
43005027	And he has given the Son the right to judge , because he is the Son of Man .
43005028	Do not be surprised at this ; the time is coming when all the dead will hear his voice
43005029	and come out of their graves : those who have done good will rise and live , and those who have done evil will rise and be condemned .
43005030	“ I can do nothing on my own authority ; I judge only as God tells me , so my judgment is right , because I am not trying to do what I want , but only what he who sent me wants .
43005031	“ If I testify on my own behalf , what I say is not to be accepted as real proof .
43005032	But there is someone else who testifies on my behalf , and I know that what he says about me is true .
43005033	John is the one to whom you sent your messengers , and he spoke on behalf of the truth .
43005034	It is not that I must have a human witness ; I say this only in order that you may be saved .
43005035	John was like a lamp , burning and shining , and you were willing for a while to enjoy his light .
43005036	But I have a witness on my behalf which is even greater than the witness that John gave : what I do , that is , the deeds my Father gave me to do , these speak on my behalf and show that the Father has sent me .
43005037	And the Father , who sent me , also testifies on my behalf . You have never heard his voice or seen his face ,
43005038	and you do not keep his message in your hearts , for you do not believe in the one whom he sent .
43005039	You study the Scriptures , because you think that in them you will find eternal life . And these very Scriptures speak about me !
43005040	Yet you are not willing to come to me in order to have life .
43005041	“ I am not looking for human praise .
43005042	But I know what kind of people you are , and I know that you have no love for God in your hearts .
43005043	I have come with my Father's authority , but you have not received me ; when , however , someone comes with his own authority , you will receive him .
43005044	You like to receive praise from one another , but you do not try to win praise from the one who alone is God ; how , then , can you believe me ?
43005045	Do not think , however , that I am the one who will accuse you to my Father . Moses , in whom you have put your hope , is the very one who will accuse you .
43005046	If you had really believed Moses , you would have believed me , because he wrote about me .
43005047	But since you do not believe what he wrote , how can you believe what I say ? ”
43006001	After this , Jesus went across Lake Galilee ( or , Lake Tiberias , as it is also called ) .
43006002	A large crowd followed him , because they had seen his miracles of healing the sick .
43006003	Jesus went up a hill and sat down with his disciples .
43006004	The time for the Passover Festival was near .
43006005	Jesus looked around and saw that a large crowd was coming to him , so he asked Philip , “ Where can we buy enough food to feed all these people ? ” (
43006006	He said this to test Philip ; actually he already knew what he would do . )
43006007	Philip answered , “ For everyone to have even a little , it would take more than two hundred silver coins to buy enough bread . ”
43006008	Another one of his disciples , Andrew , who was Simon Peter's brother , said ,
43006009	“ There is a boy here who has five loaves of barley bread and two fish . But they will certainly not be enough for all these people . ”
43006010	“ Make the people sit down , ” Jesus told them . ( There was a lot of grass there . ) So all the people sat down ; there were about five thousand men .
43006011	Jesus took the bread , gave thanks to God , and distributed it to the people who were sitting there . He did the same with the fish , and they all had as much as they wanted .
43006012	When they were all full , he said to his disciples , “ Gather the pieces left over ; let us not waste a bit . ”
43006013	So they gathered them all and filled twelve baskets with the pieces left over from the five barley loaves which the people had eaten .
43006014	Seeing this miracle that Jesus had performed , the people there said , “ Surely this is the Prophet who was to come into the world ! ”
43006015	Jesus knew that they were about to come and seize him in order to make him king by force ; so he went off again to the hills by himself .
43006016	When evening came , Jesus' disciples went down to the lake ,
43006017	got into a boat , and went back across the lake toward Capernaum . Night came on , and Jesus still had not come to them .
43006018	By then a strong wind was blowing and stirring up the water .
43006019	The disciples had rowed about three or four miles when they saw Jesus walking on the water , coming near the boat , and they were terrified .
43006020	“ Don't be afraid , ” Jesus told them , “ it is I ! ”
43006021	Then they willingly took him into the boat , and immediately the boat reached land at the place they were heading for .
43006022	Next day the crowd which had stayed on the other side of the lake realized that there had been only one boat there . They knew that Jesus had not gone in it with his disciples , but that they had left without him .
43006023	Other boats , which were from Tiberias , came to shore near the place where the crowd had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks .
43006024	When the crowd saw that Jesus was not there , nor his disciples , they got into those boats and went to Capernaum , looking for him .
43006025	When the people found Jesus on the other side of the lake , they said to him , “ Teacher , when did you get here ? ”
43006026	Jesus answered , “ I am telling you the truth : you are looking for me because you ate the bread and had all you wanted , not because you understood my miracles .
43006027	Do not work for food that spoils ; instead , work for the food that lasts for eternal life . This is the food which the Son of Man will give you , because God , the Father , has put his mark of approval on him . ”
43006028	So they asked him , “ What can we do in order to do what God wants us to do ? ”
43006029	Jesus answered , “ What God wants you to do is to believe in the one he sent . ”
43006030	They replied , “ What miracle will you perform so that we may see it and believe you ? What will you do ?
43006031	Our ancestors ate manna in the desert , just as the scripture says , ‘ He gave them bread from heaven to eat . ’ ”
43006032	“ I am telling you the truth , ” Jesus said . “ What Moses gave you was not the bread from heaven ; it is my Father who gives you the real bread from heaven .
43006033	For the bread that God gives is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world . ”
43006034	“ Sir , ” they asked him , “ give us this bread always . ”
43006035	“ I am the bread of life , ” Jesus told them . “ Those who come to me will never be hungry ; those who believe in me will never be thirsty .
43006036	Now , I told you that you have seen me but will not believe .
43006037	Everyone whom my Father gives me will come to me . I will never turn away anyone who comes to me ,
43006038	because I have come down from heaven to do not my own will but the will of him who sent me .
43006039	And it is the will of him who sent me that I should not lose any of all those he has given me , but that I should raise them all to life on the last day .
43006040	For what my Father wants is that all who see the Son and believe in him should have eternal life . And I will raise them to life on the last day . ”
43006041	The people started grumbling about him , because he said , “ I am the bread that came down from heaven . ”
43006042	So they said , “ This man is Jesus son of Joseph , isn't he ? We know his father and mother . How , then , does he now say he came down from heaven ? ”
43006043	Jesus answered , “ Stop grumbling among yourselves .
43006044	People cannot come to me unless the Father who sent me draws them to me ; and I will raise them to life on the last day .
43006045	The prophets wrote , ‘ Everyone will be taught by God . ’ Anyone who hears the Father and learns from him comes to me .
43006046	This does not mean that anyone has seen the Father ; he who is from God is the only one who has seen the Father .
43006047	I am telling you the truth : he who believes has eternal life .
43006048	I am the bread of life .
43006049	Your ancestors ate manna in the desert , but they died .
43006050	But the bread that comes down from heaven is of such a kind that whoever eats it will not die .
43006051	I am the living bread that came down from heaven . If you eat this bread , you will live forever . The bread that I will give you is my flesh , which I give so that the world may live . ”
43006052	This started an angry argument among them . “ How can this man give us his flesh to eat ? ” they asked .
43006053	Jesus said to them , “ I am telling you the truth : if you do not eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood , you will not have life in yourselves .
43006054	Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood have eternal life , and I will raise them to life on the last day .
43006055	For my flesh is the real food ; my blood is the real drink .
43006056	Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood live in me , and I live in them .
43006057	The living Father sent me , and because of him I live also . In the same way whoever eats me will live because of me .
43006058	This , then , is the bread that came down from heaven ; it is not like the bread that your ancestors ate , but then later died . Those who eat this bread will live forever . ”
43006059	Jesus said this as he taught in the synagogue in Capernaum .
43006060	Many of his followers heard this and said , “ This teaching is too hard . Who can listen to it ? ”
43006061	Without being told , Jesus knew that they were grumbling about this , so he said to them , “ Does this make you want to give up ?
43006062	Suppose , then , that you should see the Son of Man go back up to the place where he was before ?
43006063	What gives life is God's Spirit ; human power is of no use at all . The words I have spoken to you bring God's life-giving Spirit .
43006064	Yet some of you do not believe . ” ( Jesus knew from the very beginning who were the ones that would not believe and which one would betray him . )
43006065	And he added , “ This is the very reason I told you that no people can come to me unless the Father makes it possible for them to do so . ”
43006066	Because of this , many of Jesus' followers turned back and would not go with him any more .
43006067	So he asked the twelve disciples , “ And you—would you also like to leave ? ”
43006068	Simon Peter answered him , “ Lord , to whom would we go ? You have the words that give eternal life .
43006069	And now we believe and know that you are the Holy One who has come from God . ”
43006070	Jesus replied , “ I chose the twelve of you , didn't I ? Yet one of you is a devil ! ”
43006071	He was talking about Judas , the son of Simon Iscariot . For Judas , even though he was one of the twelve disciples , was going to betray him .
43007001	After this , Jesus traveled in Galilee ; he did not want to travel in Judea , because the Jewish authorities there were wanting to kill him .
43007002	The time for the Festival of Shelters was near ,
43007003	so Jesus' brothers said to him , “ Leave this place and go to Judea , so that your followers will see the things that you are doing .
43007004	People don't hide what they are doing if they want to be well known . Since you are doing these things , let the whole world know about you ! ” (
43007005	Not even his brothers believed in him . )
43007006	Jesus said to them , “ The right time for me has not yet come . Any time is right for you .
43007007	The world cannot hate you , but it hates me , because I keep telling it that its ways are bad .
43007008	You go on to the festival . I am not going to this festival , because the right time has not come for me . ”
43007009	He said this and then stayed on in Galilee .
43007010	After his brothers had gone to the festival , Jesus also went ; however , he did not go openly , but secretly .
43007011	The Jewish authorities were looking for him at the festival . “ Where is he ? ” they asked .
43007012	There was much whispering about him in the crowd . “ He is a good man , ” some people said . “ No , ” others said , “ he fools the people . ”
43007013	But no one talked about him openly , because they were afraid of the Jewish authorities .
43007014	The festival was nearly half over when Jesus went to the Temple and began teaching .
43007015	The Jewish authorities were greatly surprised and said , “ How does this man know so much when he has never been to school ? ”
43007016	Jesus answered , “ What I teach is not my own teaching , but it comes from God , who sent me .
43007017	Whoever is willing to do what God wants will know whether what I teach comes from God or whether I speak on my own authority .
43007018	Those who speak on their own authority are trying to gain glory for themselves . But he who wants glory for the one who sent him is honest , and there is nothing false in him .
43007019	Moses gave you the Law , didn't he ? But not one of you obeys the Law . Why are you trying to kill me ? ”
43007020	“ You have a demon in you ! ” the crowd answered . “ Who is trying to kill you ? ”
43007021	Jesus answered , “ I performed one miracle , and you were all surprised .
43007022	Moses ordered you to circumcise your sons ( although it was not Moses but your ancestors who started it ) , and so you circumcise a boy on the Sabbath .
43007023	If a boy is circumcised on the Sabbath so that Moses' Law is not broken , why are you angry with me because I made a man completely well on the Sabbath ?
43007024	Stop judging by external standards , and judge by true standards . ”
43007025	Some of the people of Jerusalem said , “ Isn't this the man the authorities are trying to kill ?
43007026	Look ! He is talking in public , and they say nothing against him ! Can it be that they really know that he is the Messiah ?
43007027	But when the Messiah comes , no one will know where he is from . And we all know where this man comes from . ”
43007028	As Jesus taught in the Temple , he said in a loud voice , “ Do you really know me and know where I am from ? I have not come on my own authority . He who sent me , however , is truthful . You do not know him ,
43007029	but I know him , because I come from him and he sent me . ”
43007030	Then they tried to seize him , but no one laid a hand on him , because his hour had not yet come .
43007031	But many in the crowd believed in him and said , “ When the Messiah comes , will he perform more miracles than this man has ? ”
43007032	The Pharisees heard the crowd whispering these things about Jesus , so they and the chief priests sent some guards to arrest him .
43007033	Jesus said , “ I shall be with you a little while longer , and then I shall go away to him who sent me .
43007034	You will look for me , but you will not find me , because you cannot go where I will be . ”
43007035	The Jewish authorities said among themselves , “ Where is he about to go so that we shall not find him ? Will he go to the Greek cities where our people live , and teach the Greeks ?
43007036	He says that we will look for him but will not find him , and that we cannot go where he will be . What does he mean ? ”
43007037	On the last and most important day of the festival Jesus stood up and said in a loud voice , “ Whoever is thirsty should come to me , and
43007038	whoever believes in me should drink . As the scripture says , ‘ Streams of life-giving water will pour out from his side . ’ ”
43007039	Jesus said this about the Spirit , which those who believed in him were going to receive . At that time the Spirit had not yet been given , because Jesus had not been raised to glory .
43007040	Some of the people in the crowd heard him say this and said , “ This man is really the Prophet ! ”
43007041	Others said , “ He is the Messiah ! ” But others said , “ The Messiah will not come from Galilee !
43007042	The scripture says that the Messiah will be a descendant of King David and will be born in Bethlehem , the town where David lived . ”
43007043	So there was a division in the crowd because of Jesus .
43007044	Some wanted to seize him , but no one laid a hand on him .
43007045	When the guards went back , the chief priests and Pharisees asked them , “ Why did you not bring him ? ”
43007046	The guards answered , “ Nobody has ever talked the way this man does ! ”
43007047	“ Did he fool you , too ? ” the Pharisees asked them .
43007048	“ Have you ever known one of the authorities or one Pharisee to believe in him ?
43007049	This crowd does not know the Law of Moses , so they are under God's curse ! ”
43007050	One of the Pharisees there was Nicodemus , the man who had gone to see Jesus before . He said to the others ,
43007051	“ According to our Law we cannot condemn people before hearing them and finding out what they have done . ”
43007052	“ Well , ” they answered , “ are you also from Galilee ? Study the Scriptures and you will learn that no prophet ever comes from Galilee . ”
43008001	Then everyone went home , but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives .
43008002	Early the next morning he went back to the Temple . All the people gathered around him , and he sat down and began to teach them .
43008003	The teachers of the Law and the Pharisees brought in a woman who had been caught committing adultery , and they made her stand before them all .
43008004	“ Teacher , ” they said to Jesus , “ this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery .
43008005	In our Law Moses commanded that such a woman must be stoned to death . Now , what do you say ? ”
43008006	They said this to trap Jesus , so that they could accuse him . But he bent over and wrote on the ground with his finger .
43008007	As they stood there asking him questions , he straightened up and said to them , “ Whichever one of you has committed no sin may throw the first stone at her . ”
43008008	Then he bent over again and wrote on the ground .
43008009	When they heard this , they all left , one by one , the older ones first . Jesus was left alone , with the woman still standing there .
43008010	He straightened up and said to her , “ Where are they ? Is there no one left to condemn you ? ”
43008011	“ No one , sir , ” she answered . “ Well , then , ” Jesus said , “ I do not condemn you either . Go , but do not sin again . ” ]
43008012	Jesus spoke to the Pharisees again . “ I am the light of the world , ” he said . “ Whoever follows me will have the light of life and will never walk in darkness . ”
43008013	The Pharisees said to him , “ Now you are testifying on your own behalf ; what you say proves nothing . ”
43008014	“ No , ” Jesus answered , “ even though I do testify on my own behalf , what I say is true , because I know where I came from and where I am going . You do not know where I came from or where I am going .
43008015	You make judgments in a purely human way ; I pass judgment on no one .
43008016	But if I were to do so , my judgment would be true , because I am not alone in this ; the Father who sent me is with me .
43008017	It is written in your Law that when two witnesses agree , what they say is true .
43008018	I testify on my own behalf , and the Father who sent me also testifies on my behalf . ”
43008019	“ Where is your father ? ” they asked him . “ You know neither me nor my Father , ” Jesus answered . “ If you knew me , you would know my Father also . ”
43008020	Jesus said all this as he taught in the Temple , in the room where the offering boxes were placed . And no one arrested him , because his hour had not come .
43008021	Again Jesus said to them , “ I will go away ; you will look for me , but you will die in your sins . You cannot go where I am going . ”
43008022	So the Jewish authorities said , “ He says that we cannot go where he is going . Does this mean that he will kill himself ? ”
43008023	Jesus answered , “ You belong to this world here below , but I come from above . You are from this world , but I am not from this world .
43008024	That is why I told you that you will die in your sins . And you will die in your sins if you do not believe that ‘ I Am Who I Am ’ . ”
43008025	“ Who are you ? ” they asked him . Jesus answered , “ What I have told you from the very beginning .
43008026	I have much to say about you , much to condemn you for . The one who sent me , however , is truthful , and I tell the world only what I have heard from him . ”
43008027	They did not understand that Jesus was talking to them about the Father .
43008028	So he said to them , “ When you lift up the Son of Man , you will know that ‘ I Am Who I Am ’ ; then you will know that I do nothing on my own authority , but I say only what the Father has instructed me to say .
43008029	And he who sent me is with me ; he has not left me alone , because I always do what pleases him . ”
43008030	Many who heard Jesus say these things believed in him .
43008031	So Jesus said to those who believed in him , “ If you obey my teaching , you are really my disciples ;
43008032	you will know the truth , and the truth will set you free . ”
43008033	“ We are the descendants of Abraham , ” they answered , “ and we have never been anybody's slaves . What do you mean , then , by saying , ‘ You will be free ’ ? ”
43008034	Jesus said to them , “ I am telling you the truth : everyone who sins is a slave of sin .
43008035	A slave does not belong to a family permanently , but a son belongs there forever .
43008036	If the Son sets you free , then you will be really free .
43008037	I know you are Abraham's descendants . Yet you are trying to kill me , because you will not accept my teaching .
43008038	I talk about what my Father has shown me , but you do what your father has told you . ”
43008039	They answered him , “ Our father is Abraham . ” “ If you really were Abraham's children , ” Jesus replied , “ you would do the same things that he did .
43008040	All I have ever done is to tell you the truth I heard from God , yet you are trying to kill me . Abraham did nothing like this !
43008041	You are doing what your father did . ” “ God himself is the only Father we have , ” they answered , “ and we are his true children . ”
43008042	Jesus said to them , “ If God really were your Father , you would love me , because I came from God and now I am here . I did not come on my own authority , but he sent me .
43008043	Why do you not understand what I say ? It is because you cannot bear to listen to my message .
43008044	You are the children of your father , the Devil , and you want to follow your father's desires . From the very beginning he was a murderer and has never been on the side of truth , because there is no truth in him . When he tells a lie , he is only doing what is natural to him , because he is a liar and the father of all lies .
43008045	But I tell the truth , and that is why you do not believe me .
43008046	Which one of you can prove that I am guilty of sin ? If I tell the truth , then why do you not believe me ?
43008047	He who comes from God listens to God's words . You , however , are not from God , and that is why you will not listen . ”
43008048	They asked Jesus , “ Were we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon in you ? ”
43008049	“ I have no demon , ” Jesus answered . “ I honor my Father , but you dishonor me .
43008050	I am not seeking honor for myself . But there is one who is seeking it and who judges in my favor .
43008051	I am telling you the truth : whoever obeys my teaching will never die . ”
43008052	They said to him , “ Now we know for sure that you have a demon ! Abraham died , and the prophets died , yet you say that whoever obeys your teaching will never die .
43008053	Our father Abraham died ; you do not claim to be greater than Abraham , do you ? And the prophets also died . Who do you think you are ? ”
43008054	Jesus answered , “ If I were to honor myself , that honor would be worth nothing . The one who honors me is my Father—the very one you say is your God .
43008055	You have never known him , but I know him . If I were to say that I do not know him , I would be a liar like you . But I do know him , and I obey his word .
43008056	Your father Abraham rejoiced that he was to see the time of my coming ; he saw it and was glad . ”
43008057	They said to him , “ You are not even fifty years old—and you have seen Abraham ? ”
43008058	“ I am telling you the truth , ” Jesus replied . “ Before Abraham was born , ‘ I Am ’ . ”
43008059	Then they picked up stones to throw at him , but Jesus hid himself and left the Temple .
43009001	As Jesus was walking along , he saw a man who had been born blind .
43009002	His disciples asked him , “ Teacher , whose sin caused him to be born blind ? Was it his own or his parents' sin ? ”
43009003	Jesus answered , “ His blindness has nothing to do with his sins or his parents' sins . He is blind so that God's power might be seen at work in him .
43009004	As long as it is day , we must do the work of him who sent me ; night is coming when no one can work .
43009005	While I am in the world , I am the light for the world . ”
43009006	After he said this , Jesus spat on the ground and made some mud with the spittle ; he rubbed the mud on the man's eyes
43009007	and told him , “ Go and wash your face in the Pool of Siloam . ” ( This name means “ Sent . ” ) So the man went , washed his face , and came back seeing .
43009008	His neighbors , then , and the people who had seen him begging before this , asked , “ Isn't this the man who used to sit and beg ? ”
43009009	Some said , “ He is the one , ” but others said , “ No he isn't ; he just looks like him . ” So the man himself said , “ I am the man . ”
43009010	“ How is it that you can now see ? ” they asked him .
43009011	He answered , “ The man called Jesus made some mud , rubbed it on my eyes , and told me to go to Siloam and wash my face . So I went , and as soon as I washed , I could see . ”
43009012	“ Where is he ? ” they asked . “ I don't know , ” he answered .
43009013	Then they took to the Pharisees the man who had been blind .
43009014	The day that Jesus made the mud and cured him of his blindness was a Sabbath .
43009015	The Pharisees , then , asked the man again how he had received his sight . He told them , “ He put some mud on my eyes ; I washed my face , and now I can see . ”
43009016	Some of the Pharisees said , “ The man who did this cannot be from God , for he does not obey the Sabbath law . ” Others , however , said , “ How could a man who is a sinner perform such miracles as these ? ” And there was a division among them .
43009017	So the Pharisees asked the man once more , “ You say he cured you of your blindness—well , what do you say about him ? ” “ He is a prophet , ” the man answered .
43009018	The Jewish authorities , however , were not willing to believe that he had been blind and could now see , until they called his parents
43009019	and asked them , “ Is this your son ? You say that he was born blind ; how is it , then , that he can now see ? ”
43009020	His parents answered , “ We know that he is our son , and we know that he was born blind .
43009021	But we do not know how it is that he is now able to see , nor do we know who cured him of his blindness . Ask him ; he is old enough , and he can answer for himself ! ”
43009022	His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jewish authorities , who had already agreed that anyone who said he believed that Jesus was the Messiah would be expelled from the synagogue .
43009023	That is why his parents said , “ He is old enough ; ask him ! ”
43009024	A second time they called back the man who had been born blind , and said to him , “ Promise before God that you will tell the truth ! We know that this man who cured you is a sinner . ”
43009025	“ I do not know if he is a sinner or not , ” the man replied . “ One thing I do know : I was blind , and now I see . ”
43009026	“ What did he do to you ? ” they asked . “ How did he cure you of your blindness ? ”
43009027	“ I have already told you , ” he answered , “ and you would not listen . Why do you want to hear it again ? Maybe you , too , would like to be his disciples ? ”
43009028	They insulted him and said , “ You are that fellow's disciple ; but we are Moses' disciples .
43009029	We know that God spoke to Moses ; as for that fellow , however , we do not even know where he comes from ! ”
43009030	The man answered , “ What a strange thing that is ! You do not know where he comes from , but he cured me of my blindness !
43009031	We know that God does not listen to sinners ; he does listen to people who respect him and do what he wants them to do .
43009032	Since the beginning of the world nobody has ever heard of anyone giving sight to a person born blind .
43009033	Unless this man came from God , he would not be able to do a thing . ”
43009034	They answered , “ You were born and brought up in sin—and you are trying to teach us ? ” And they expelled him from the synagogue .
43009035	When Jesus heard what had happened , he found the man and asked him , “ Do you believe in the Son of Man ? ”
43009036	The man answered , “ Tell me who he is , sir , so that I can believe in him ! ”
43009037	Jesus said to him , “ You have already seen him , and he is the one who is talking with you now . ”
43009038	“ I believe , Lord ! ” the man said , and knelt down before Jesus .
43009039	Jesus said , “ I came to this world to judge , so that the blind should see and those who see should become blind . ”
43009040	Some Pharisees who were there with him heard him say this and asked him , “ Surely you don't mean that we are blind , too ? ”
43009041	Jesus answered , “ If you were blind , then you would not be guilty ; but since you claim that you can see , this means that you are still guilty . ”
43010001	Jesus said , “ I am telling you the truth : the man who does not enter the sheep pen by the gate , but climbs in some other way , is a thief and a robber .
43010002	The man who goes in through the gate is the shepherd of the sheep .
43010003	The gatekeeper opens the gate for him ; the sheep hear his voice as he calls his own sheep by name , and he leads them out .
43010004	When he has brought them out , he goes ahead of them , and the sheep follow him , because they know his voice .
43010005	They will not follow someone else ; instead , they will run away from such a person , because they do not know his voice . ”
43010006	Jesus told them this parable , but they did not understand what he meant .
43010007	So Jesus said again , “ I am telling you the truth : I am the gate for the sheep .
43010008	All others who came before me are thieves and robbers , but the sheep did not listen to them .
43010009	I am the gate . Those who come in by me will be saved ; they will come in and go out and find pasture .
43010010	The thief comes only in order to steal , kill , and destroy . I have come in order that you might have life—life in all its fullness .
43010011	“ I am the good shepherd , who is willing to die for the sheep .
43010012	When the hired man , who is not a shepherd and does not own the sheep , sees a wolf coming , he leaves the sheep and runs away ; so the wolf snatches the sheep and scatters them .
43010013	The hired man runs away because he is only a hired man and does not care about the sheep .
43010016	There are other sheep which belong to me that are not in this sheep pen . I must bring them , too ; they will listen to my voice , and they will become one flock with one shepherd .
43010017	“ The Father loves me because I am willing to give up my life , in order that I may receive it back again .
43010018	No one takes my life away from me . I give it up of my own free will . I have the right to give it up , and I have the right to take it back . This is what my Father has commanded me to do . ”
43010019	Again there was a division among the people because of these words .
43010020	Many of them were saying , “ He has a demon ! He is crazy ! Why do you listen to him ? ”
43010021	But others were saying , “ A man with a demon could not talk like this ! How could a demon give sight to blind people ? ”
43010022	It was winter , and the Festival of the Dedication of the Temple was being celebrated in Jerusalem .
43010023	Jesus was walking in Solomon's Porch in the Temple ,
43010024	when the people gathered around him and asked , “ How long are you going to keep us in suspense ? Tell us the plain truth : are you the Messiah ? ”
43010025	Jesus answered , “ I have already told you , but you would not believe me . The deeds I do by my Father's authority speak on my behalf ;
43010026	but you will not believe , for you are not my sheep .
43010027	My sheep listen to my voice ; I know them , and they follow me .
43010028	I give them eternal life , and they shall never die . No one can snatch them away from me .
43010029	What my Father has given me is greater than everything , and no one can snatch them away from the Father's care .
43010030	The Father and I are one . ”
43010031	Then the people again picked up stones to throw at him .
43010032	Jesus said to them , “ I have done many good deeds in your presence which the Father gave me to do ; for which one of these do you want to stone me ? ”
43010033	They answered , “ We do not want to stone you because of any good deeds , but because of your blasphemy ! You are only a man , but you are trying to make yourself God ! ”
43010034	Jesus answered , “ It is written in your own Law that God said , ‘ You are gods . ’
43010035	We know that what the scripture says is true forever ; and God called those people gods , the people to whom his message was given .
43010036	As for me , the Father chose me and sent me into the world . How , then , can you say that I blaspheme because I said that I am the Son of God ?
43010037	Do not believe me , then , if I am not doing the things my Father wants me to do .
43010038	But if I do them , even though you do not believe me , you should at least believe my deeds , in order that you may know once and for all that the Father is in me and that I am in the Father . ”
43010039	Once more they tried to seize Jesus , but he slipped out of their hands .
43010040	Jesus then went back again across the Jordan River to the place where John had been baptizing , and he stayed there .
43010041	Many people came to him . “ John performed no miracles , ” they said , “ but everything he said about this man was true . ”
43010042	And many people there believed in him .
43011001	A man named Lazarus , who lived in Bethany , became sick . Bethany was the town where Mary and her sister Martha lived . (
43011002	This Mary was the one who poured the perfume on the Lord's feet and wiped them with her hair ; it was her brother Lazarus who was sick . )
43011003	The sisters sent Jesus a message : “ Lord , your dear friend is sick . ”
43011004	When Jesus heard it , he said , “ The final result of this sickness will not be the death of Lazarus ; this has happened in order to bring glory to God , and it will be the means by which the Son of God will receive glory . ”
43011005	Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus .
43011006	Yet when he received the news that Lazarus was sick , he stayed where he was for two more days .
43011007	Then he said to the disciples , “ Let us go back to Judea . ”
43011008	“ Teacher , ” the disciples answered , “ just a short time ago the people there wanted to stone you ; and are you planning to go back ? ”
43011009	Jesus said , “ A day has twelve hours , doesn't it ? So those who walk in broad daylight do not stumble , for they see the light of this world .
43011010	But if they walk during the night they stumble , because they have no light . ”
43011011	Jesus said this and then added , “ Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep , but I will go and wake him up . ”
43011012	The disciples answered , “ If he is asleep , Lord , he will get well . ”
43011013	Jesus meant that Lazarus had died , but they thought he meant natural sleep .
43011014	So Jesus told them plainly , “ Lazarus is dead ,
43011015	but for your sake I am glad that I was not with him , so that you will believe . Let us go to him . ”
43011016	Thomas ( called the Twin ) said to his fellow disciples , “ Let us all go along with the Teacher , so that we may die with him ! ”
43011017	When Jesus arrived , he found that Lazarus had been buried four days before .
43011018	Bethany was less than two miles from Jerusalem ,
43011019	and many Judeans had come to see Martha and Mary to comfort them about their brother's death .
43011020	When Martha heard that Jesus was coming , she went out to meet him , but Mary stayed in the house .
43011021	Martha said to Jesus , “ If you had been here , Lord , my brother would not have died !
43011022	But I know that even now God will give you whatever you ask him for . ”
43011023	“ Your brother will rise to life , ” Jesus told her .
43011024	“ I know , ” she replied , “ that he will rise to life on the last day . ”
43011025	Jesus said to her , “ I am the resurrection and the life . Those who believe in me will live , even though they die ;
43011026	and those who live and believe in me will never die . Do you believe this ? ”
43011027	“ Yes , Lord ! ” she answered . “ I do believe that you are the Messiah , the Son of God , who was to come into the world . ”
43011028	After Martha said this , she went back and called her sister Mary privately . “ The Teacher is here , ” she told her , “ and is asking for you . ”
43011029	When Mary heard this , she got up and hurried out to meet him . (
43011030	Jesus had not yet arrived in the village , but was still in the place where Martha had met him . )
43011031	The people who were in the house with Mary comforting her followed her when they saw her get up and hurry out . They thought that she was going to the grave to weep there .
43011032	Mary arrived where Jesus was , and as soon as she saw him , she fell at his feet . “ Lord , ” she said , “ if you had been here , my brother would not have died ! ”
43011033	Jesus saw her weeping , and he saw how the people with her were weeping also ; his heart was touched , and he was deeply moved .
43011034	“ Where have you buried him ? ” he asked them . “ Come and see , Lord , ” they answered .
43011035	Jesus wept .
43011036	“ See how much he loved him ! ” the people said .
43011037	But some of them said , “ He gave sight to the blind man , didn't he ? Could he not have kept Lazarus from dying ? ”
43011038	Deeply moved once more , Jesus went to the tomb , which was a cave with a stone placed at the entrance .
43011039	“ Take the stone away ! ” Jesus ordered . Martha , the dead man's sister , answered , “ There will be a bad smell , Lord . He has been buried four days ! ”
43011040	Jesus said to her , “ Didn't I tell you that you would see God's glory if you believed ? ”
43011041	They took the stone away . Jesus looked up and said , “ I thank you , Father , that you listen to me .
43011042	I know that you always listen to me , but I say this for the sake of the people here , so that they will believe that you sent me . ”
43011043	After he had said this , he called out in a loud voice , “ Lazarus , come out ! ”
43011044	He came out , his hands and feet wrapped in grave cloths , and with a cloth around his face . “ Untie him , ” Jesus told them , “ and let him go . ”
43011045	Many of the people who had come to visit Mary saw what Jesus did , and they believed in him .
43011046	But some of them returned to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done .
43011047	So the Pharisees and the chief priests met with the Council and said , “ What shall we do ? Look at all the miracles this man is performing !
43011048	If we let him go on in this way , everyone will believe in him , and the Roman authorities will take action and destroy our Temple and our nation ! ”
43011049	One of them , named Caiaphas , who was High Priest that year , said , “ What fools you are !
43011050	Don't you realize that it is better for you to have one man die for the people , instead of having the whole nation destroyed ? ”
43011051	Actually , he did not say this of his own accord ; rather , as he was High Priest that year , he was prophesying that Jesus was going to die for the Jewish people ,
43011052	and not only for them , but also to bring together into one body all the scattered people of God .
43011053	From that day on the Jewish authorities made plans to kill Jesus .
43011054	So Jesus did not travel openly in Judea , but left and went to a place near the desert , to a town named Ephraim , where he stayed with the disciples .
43011055	The time for the Passover Festival was near , and many people went up from the country to Jerusalem to perform the ritual of purification before the festival .
43011056	They were looking for Jesus , and as they gathered in the Temple , they asked one another , “ What do you think ? Surely he will not come to the festival , will he ? ”
43011057	The chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where Jesus was , he must report it , so that they could arrest him .
43012001	Six days before the Passover , Jesus went to Bethany , the home of Lazarus , the man he had raised from death .
43012002	They prepared a dinner for him there , which Martha helped serve ; Lazarus was one of those who were sitting at the table with Jesus .
43012003	Then Mary took a whole pint of a very expensive perfume made of pure nard , poured it on Jesus' feet , and wiped them with her hair . The sweet smell of the perfume filled the whole house .
43012004	One of Jesus' disciples , Judas Iscariot—the one who was going to betray him—said ,
43012005	“ Why wasn't this perfume sold for three hundred silver coins and the money given to the poor ? ”
43012006	He said this , not because he cared about the poor , but because he was a thief . He carried the money bag and would help himself from it .
43012007	But Jesus said , “ Leave her alone ! Let her keep what she has for the day of my burial .
43012008	You will always have poor people with you , but you will not always have me . ”
43012009	A large number of people heard that Jesus was in Bethany , so they went there , not only because of Jesus but also to see Lazarus , whom Jesus had raised from death .
43012010	So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus too ,
43012011	because on his account many Jews were rejecting them and believing in Jesus .
43012012	The next day the large crowd that had come to the Passover Festival heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem .
43012013	So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him , shouting , “ Praise God ! God bless him who comes in the name of the Lord ! God bless the King of Israel ! ”
43012014	Jesus found a donkey and rode on it , just as the scripture says ,
43012015	“ Do not be afraid , city of Zion ! Here comes your king , riding on a young donkey . ”
43012016	His disciples did not understand this at the time ; but when Jesus had been raised to glory , they remembered that the scripture said this about him and that they had done this for him .
43012017	The people who had been with Jesus when he called Lazarus out of the grave and raised him from death had reported what had happened .
43012018	That was why the crowd met him—because they heard that he had performed this miracle .
43012019	The Pharisees then said to one another , “ You see , we are not succeeding at all ! Look , the whole world is following him ! ”
43012020	Some Greeks were among those who had gone to Jerusalem to worship during the festival .
43012021	They went to Philip ( he was from Bethsaida in Galilee ) and said , “ Sir , we want to see Jesus . ”
43012022	Philip went and told Andrew , and the two of them went and told Jesus .
43012023	Jesus answered them , “ The hour has now come for the Son of Man to receive great glory .
43012024	I am telling you the truth : a grain of wheat remains no more than a single grain unless it is dropped into the ground and dies . If it does die , then it produces many grains .
43012025	Those who love their own life will lose it ; those who hate their own life in this world will keep it for life eternal .
43012026	Whoever wants to serve me must follow me , so that my servant will be with me where I am . And my Father will honor anyone who serves me .
43012027	“ Now my heart is troubled—and what shall I say ? Shall I say , ‘ Father , do not let this hour come upon me ’ ? But that is why I came—so that I might go through this hour of suffering .
43012028	Father , bring glory to your name ! ” Then a voice spoke from heaven , “ I have brought glory to it , and I will do so again . ”
43012029	The crowd standing there heard the voice , and some of them said it was thunder , while others said , “ An angel spoke to him ! ”
43012030	But Jesus said to them , “ It was not for my sake that this voice spoke , but for yours .
43012031	Now is the time for this world to be judged ; now the ruler of this world will be overthrown .
43012032	When I am lifted up from the earth , I will draw everyone to me . ” (
43012033	In saying this he indicated the kind of death he was going to suffer . )
43012034	The crowd answered , “ Our Law tells us that the Messiah will live forever . How , then , can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up ? Who is this Son of Man ? ”
43012035	Jesus answered , “ The light will be among you a little longer . Continue on your way while you have the light , so that the darkness will not come upon you ; for the one who walks in the dark does not know where he is going .
43012036	Believe in the light , then , while you have it , so that you will be the people of the light . ” After Jesus said this , he went off and hid himself from them .
43012037	Even though he had performed all these miracles in their presence , they did not believe in him ,
43012038	so that what the prophet Isaiah had said might come true : “ Lord , who believed the message we told ? To whom did the Lord reveal his power ? ”
43012039	And so they were not able to believe , because Isaiah also said ,
43012040	“ God has blinded their eyes and closed their minds , so that their eyes would not see , and their minds would not understand , and they would not turn to me , says God , for me to heal them . ”
43012041	Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus' glory and spoke about him .
43012042	Even then , many Jewish authorities believed in Jesus ; but because of the Pharisees they did not talk about it openly , so as not to be expelled from the synagogue .
43012043	They loved human approval rather than the approval of God .
43012044	Jesus said in a loud voice , “ Whoever believes in me believes not only in me but also in him who sent me .
43012045	Whoever sees me sees also him who sent me .
43012046	I have come into the world as light , so that everyone who believes in me should not remain in the darkness .
43012047	If people hear my message and do not obey it , I will not judge them . I came , not to judge the world , but to save it .
43012048	Those who reject me and do not accept my message have one who will judge them . The words I have spoken will be their judge on the last day !
43012049	This is true , because I have not spoken on my own authority , but the Father who sent me has commanded me what I must say and speak .
43012050	And I know that his command brings eternal life . What I say , then , is what the Father has told me to say . ”
43013001	It was now the day before the Passover Festival . Jesus knew that the hour had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father . He had always loved those in the world who were his own , and he loved them to the very end .
43013002	Jesus and his disciples were at supper . The Devil had already put into the heart of Judas , the son of Simon Iscariot , the thought of betraying Jesus .
43013003	Jesus knew that the Father had given him complete power ; he knew that he had come from God and was going to God .
43013004	So he rose from the table , took off his outer garment , and tied a towel around his waist .
43013005	Then he poured some water into a washbasin and began to wash the disciples' feet and dry them with the towel around his waist .
43013006	He came to Simon Peter , who said to him , “ Are you going to wash my feet , Lord ? ”
43013007	Jesus answered him , “ You do not understand now what I am doing , but you will understand later . ”
43013008	Peter declared , “ Never at any time will you wash my feet ! ” “ If I do not wash your feet , ” Jesus answered , “ you will no longer be my disciple . ”
43013009	Simon Peter answered , “ Lord , do not wash only my feet , then ! Wash my hands and head , too ! ”
43013010	Jesus said , “ Those who have taken a bath are completely clean and do not have to wash themselves , except for their feet . All of you are clean—all except one . ” (
43013011	Jesus already knew who was going to betray him ; that is why he said , “ All of you , except one , are clean . ” )
43013012	After Jesus had washed their feet , he put his outer garment back on and returned to his place at the table . “ Do you understand what I have just done to you ? ” he asked .
43013013	“ You call me Teacher and Lord , and it is right that you do so , because that is what I am .
43013014	I , your Lord and Teacher , have just washed your feet . You , then , should wash one another's feet .
43013015	I have set an example for you , so that you will do just what I have done for you .
43013016	I am telling you the truth : no slaves are greater than their master , and no messengers are greater than the one who sent them .
43013017	Now that you know this truth , how happy you will be if you put it into practice !
43013018	“ I am not talking about all of you ; I know those I have chosen . But the scripture must come true that says , ‘ The man who shared my food turned against me . ’
43013019	I tell you this now before it happens , so that when it does happen , you will believe that ‘ I Am Who I Am . ’
43013020	I am telling you the truth : whoever receives anyone I send receives me also ; and whoever receives me receives him who sent me . ”
43013021	After Jesus had said this , he was deeply troubled and declared openly , “ I am telling you the truth : one of you is going to betray me . ”
43013022	The disciples looked at one another , completely puzzled about whom he meant .
43013023	One of the disciples , the one whom Jesus loved , was sitting next to Jesus .
43013024	Simon Peter motioned to him and said , “ Ask him whom he is talking about . ”
43013025	So that disciple moved closer to Jesus' side and asked , “ Who is it , Lord ? ”
43013026	Jesus answered , “ I will dip some bread in the sauce and give it to him ; he is the man . ” So he took a piece of bread , dipped it , and gave it to Judas , the son of Simon Iscariot .
43013027	As soon as Judas took the bread , Satan entered into him . Jesus said to him , “ Hurry and do what you must ! ”
43013028	None of the others at the table understood why Jesus said this to him .
43013029	Since Judas was in charge of the money bag , some of the disciples thought that Jesus had told him to go and buy what they needed for the festival , or to give something to the poor .
43013030	Judas accepted the bread and went out at once . It was night .
43013031	After Judas had left , Jesus said , “ Now the Son of Man's glory is revealed ; now God's glory is revealed through him .
43013032	And if God's glory is revealed through him , then God will reveal the glory of the Son of Man in himself , and he will do so at once .
43013033	My children , I shall not be with you very much longer . You will look for me ; but I tell you now what I told the Jewish authorities , ‘ You cannot go where I am going . ’
43013034	And now I give you a new commandment : love one another . As I have loved you , so you must love one another .
43013035	If you have love for one another , then everyone will know that you are my disciples . ”
43013036	“ Where are you going , Lord ? ” Simon Peter asked him . “ You cannot follow me now where I am going , ” answered Jesus ; “ but later you will follow me . ”
43013037	“ Lord , why can't I follow you now ? ” asked Peter . “ I am ready to die for you ! ”
43013038	Jesus answered , “ Are you really ready to die for me ? I am telling you the truth : before the rooster crows you will say three times that you do not know me .
43014001	“ Do not be worried and upset , ” Jesus told them . “ Believe in God and believe also in me .
43014002	There are many rooms in my Father's house , and I am going to prepare a place for you . I would not tell you this if it were not so .
43014003	And after I go and prepare a place for you , I will come back and take you to myself , so that you will be where I am .
43014004	You know the way that leads to the place where I am going . ”
43014005	Thomas said to him , “ Lord , we do not know where you are going ; so how can we know the way to get there ? ”
43014006	Jesus answered him , “ I am the way , the truth , and the life ; no one goes to the Father except by me .
43014007	Now that you have known me , ” he said to them , “ you will know my Father also , and from now on you do know him and you have seen him . ”
43014008	Philip said to him , “ Lord , show us the Father ; that is all we need . ”
43014009	Jesus answered , “ For a long time I have been with you all ; yet you do not know me , Philip ? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father . Why , then , do you say , ‘ Show us the Father ’ ?
43014010	Do you not believe , Philip , that I am in the Father and the Father is in me ? The words that I have spoken to you , ” Jesus said to his disciples , “ do not come from me . The Father , who remains in me , does his own work .
43014011	Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me . If not , believe because of the things I do .
43014012	I am telling you the truth : those who believe in me will do what I do—yes , they will do even greater things , because I am going to the Father .
43014013	And I will do whatever you ask for in my name , so that the Father's glory will be shown through the Son .
43014014	If you ask me for anything in my name , I will do it .
43014015	“ If you love me , you will obey my commandments .
43014016	I will ask the Father , and he will give you another Helper , who will stay with you forever .
43014017	He is the Spirit , who reveals the truth about God . The world cannot receive him , because it cannot see him or know him . But you know him , because he remains with you and is in you .
43014018	“ When I go , you will not be left all alone ; I will come back to you .
43014019	In a little while the world will see me no more , but you will see me ; and because I live , you also will live .
43014020	When that day comes , you will know that I am in my Father and that you are in me , just as I am in you .
43014021	“ Those who accept my commandments and obey them are the ones who love me . My Father will love those who love me ; I too will love them and reveal myself to them . ”
43014022	Judas ( not Judas Iscariot ) said , “ Lord , how can it be that you will reveal yourself to us and not to the world ? ”
43014023	Jesus answered him , “ Those who love me will obey my teaching . My Father will love them , and my Father and I will come to them and live with them .
43014024	Those who do not love me do not obey my teaching . And the teaching you have heard is not mine , but comes from the Father , who sent me .
43014025	“ I have told you this while I am still with you .
43014026	The Helper , the Holy Spirit , whom the Father will send in my name , will teach you everything and make you remember all that I have told you .
43014027	“ Peace is what I leave with you ; it is my own peace that I give you . I do not give it as the world does . Do not be worried and upset ; do not be afraid .
43014028	You heard me say to you , ‘ I am leaving , but I will come back to you . ’ If you loved me , you would be glad that I am going to the Father ; for he is greater than I .
43014029	I have told you this now before it all happens , so that when it does happen , you will believe .
43014030	I cannot talk with you much longer , because the ruler of this world is coming . He has no power over me ,
43014031	but the world must know that I love the Father ; that is why I do everything as he commands me . “ Come , let us go from this place .
43015001	“ I am the real vine , and my Father is the gardener .
43015002	He breaks off every branch in me that does not bear fruit , and he prunes every branch that does bear fruit , so that it will be clean and bear more fruit .
43015003	You have been made clean already by the teaching I have given you .
43015004	Remain united to me , and I will remain united to you . A branch cannot bear fruit by itself ; it can do so only if it remains in the vine . In the same way you cannot bear fruit unless you remain in me .
43015005	“ I am the vine , and you are the branches . Those who remain in me , and I in them , will bear much fruit ; for you can do nothing without me .
43015006	Those who do not remain in me are thrown out like a branch and dry up ; such branches are gathered up and thrown into the fire , where they are burned .
43015007	If you remain in me and my words remain in you , then you will ask for anything you wish , and you shall have it .
43015008	My Father's glory is shown by your bearing much fruit ; and in this way you become my disciples .
43015009	I love you just as the Father loves me ; remain in my love .
43015010	If you obey my commands , you will remain in my love , just as I have obeyed my Father's commands and remain in his love .
43015011	“ I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete .
43015012	My commandment is this : love one another , just as I love you .
43015013	The greatest love you can have for your friends is to give your life for them .
43015014	And you are my friends if you do what I command you .
43015015	I do not call you servants any longer , because servants do not know what their master is doing . Instead , I call you friends , because I have told you everything I heard from my Father .
43015016	You did not choose me ; I chose you and appointed you to go and bear much fruit , the kind of fruit that endures . And so the Father will give you whatever you ask of him in my name .
43015017	This , then , is what I command you : love one another .
43015018	“ If the world hates you , just remember that it has hated me first .
43015019	If you belonged to the world , then the world would love you as its own . But I chose you from this world , and you do not belong to it ; that is why the world hates you .
43015020	Remember what I told you : ‘ Slaves are not greater than their master . ’ If people persecuted me , they will persecute you too ; if they obeyed my teaching , they will obey yours too .
43015021	But they will do all this to you because you are mine ; for they do not know the one who sent me .
43015022	They would not have been guilty of sin if I had not come and spoken to them ; as it is , they no longer have any excuse for their sin .
43015023	Whoever hates me hates my Father also .
43015024	They would not have been guilty of sin if I had not done among them the things that no one else ever did ; as it is , they have seen what I did , and they hate both me and my Father .
43015025	This , however , was bound to happen so that what is written in their Law may come true : ‘ They hated me for no reason at all . ’
43015026	“ The Helper will come—the Spirit , who reveals the truth about God and who comes from the Father . I will send him to you from the Father , and he will speak about me .
43015027	And you , too , will speak about me , because you have been with me from the very beginning .
43016001	“ I have told you this , so that you will not give up your faith .
43016002	You will be expelled from the synagogues , and the time will come when those who kill you will think that by doing this they are serving God .
43016003	People will do these things to you because they have not known either the Father or me .
43016004	But I have told you this , so that when the time comes for them to do these things , you will remember what I told you . “ I did not tell you these things at the beginning , for I was with you .
43016005	But now I am going to him who sent me , yet none of you asks me where I am going .
43016006	And now that I have told you , your hearts are full of sadness .
43016007	But I am telling you the truth : it is better for you that I go away , because if I do not go , the Helper will not come to you . But if I do go away , then I will send him to you .
43016008	And when he comes , he will prove to the people of the world that they are wrong about sin and about what is right and about God's judgment .
43016009	They are wrong about sin , because they do not believe in me ;
43016010	they are wrong about what is right , because I am going to the Father and you will not see me any more ;
43016011	and they are wrong about judgment , because the ruler of this world has already been judged .
43016012	“ I have much more to tell you , but now it would be too much for you to bear .
43016013	When , however , the Spirit comes , who reveals the truth about God , he will lead you into all the truth . He will not speak on his own authority , but he will speak of what he hears and will tell you of things to come .
43016014	He will give me glory , because he will take what I say and tell it to you .
43016015	All that my Father has is mine ; that is why I said that the Spirit will take what I give him and tell it to you .
43016016	“ In a little while you will not see me any more , and then a little while later you will see me . ”
43016017	Some of his disciples asked among themselves , “ What does this mean ? He tells us that in a little while we will not see him , and then a little while later we will see him ; and he also says , ‘ It is because I am going to the Father . ’
43016018	What does this ‘ a little while ’ mean ? We don't know what he is talking about ! ”
43016019	Jesus knew that they wanted to question him , so he said to them , “ I said , ‘ In a little while you will not see me , and then a little while later you will see me . ’ Is this what you are asking about among yourselves ?
43016020	I am telling you the truth : you will cry and weep , but the world will be glad ; you will be sad , but your sadness will turn into gladness .
43016021	When a woman is about to give birth , she is sad because her hour of suffering has come ; but when the baby is born , she forgets her suffering , because she is happy that a baby has been born into the world .
43016022	That is how it is with you : now you are sad , but I will see you again , and your hearts will be filled with gladness , the kind of gladness that no one can take away from you .
43016023	“ When that day comes , you will not ask me for anything . I am telling you the truth : the Father will give you whatever you ask of him in my name .
43016024	Until now you have not asked for anything in my name ; ask and you will receive , so that your happiness may be complete .
43016025	“ I have used figures of speech to tell you these things . But the time will come when I will not use figures of speech , but will speak to you plainly about the Father .
43016026	When that day comes , you will ask him in my name ; and I do not say that I will ask him on your behalf ,
43016027	for the Father himself loves you . He loves you because you love me and have believed that I came from God .
43016028	I did come from the Father , and I came into the world ; and now I am leaving the world and going to the Father . ”
43016029	Then his disciples said to him , “ Now you are speaking plainly , without using figures of speech .
43016030	We know now that you know everything ; you do not need to have someone ask you questions . This makes us believe that you came from God . ”
43016031	Jesus answered them , “ Do you believe now ?
43016032	The time is coming , and is already here , when all of you will be scattered , each of you to your own home , and I will be left all alone . But I am not really alone , because the Father is with me .
43016033	I have told you this so that you will have peace by being united to me . The world will make you suffer . But be brave ! I have defeated the world ! ”
43017001	After Jesus finished saying this , he looked up to heaven and said , “ Father , the hour has come . Give glory to your Son , so that the Son may give glory to you .
43017002	For you gave him authority over all people , so that he might give eternal life to all those you gave him .
43017003	And eternal life means to know you , the only true God , and to know Jesus Christ , whom you sent .
43017004	I have shown your glory on earth ; I have finished the work you gave me to do .
43017005	Father ! Give me glory in your presence now , the same glory I had with you before the world was made .
43017006	“ I have made you known to those you gave me out of the world . They belonged to you , and you gave them to me . They have obeyed your word ,
43017007	and now they know that everything you gave me comes from you .
43017008	I gave them the message that you gave me , and they received it ; they know that it is true that I came from you , and they believe that you sent me .
43017009	“ I pray for them . I do not pray for the world but for those you gave me , for they belong to you .
43017010	All I have is yours , and all you have is mine ; and my glory is shown through them .
43017011	And now I am coming to you ; I am no longer in the world , but they are in the world . Holy Father ! Keep them safe by the power of your name , the name you gave me , so that they may be one just as you and I are one .
43017012	While I was with them , I kept them safe by the power of your name , the name you gave me . I protected them , and not one of them was lost , except the man who was bound to be lost—so that the scripture might come true .
43017013	And now I am coming to you , and I say these things in the world so that they might have my joy in their hearts in all its fullness .
43017014	I gave them your message , and the world hated them , because they do not belong to the world , just as I do not belong to the world .
43017015	I do not ask you to take them out of the world , but I do ask you to keep them safe from the Evil One .
43017016	Just as I do not belong to the world , they do not belong to the world .
43017017	Dedicate them to yourself by means of the truth ; your word is truth .
43017018	I sent them into the world , just as you sent me into the world .
43017019	And for their sake I dedicate myself to you , in order that they , too , may be truly dedicated to you .
43017020	“ I pray not only for them , but also for those who believe in me because of their message .
43017021	I pray that they may all be one . Father ! May they be in us , just as you are in me and I am in you . May they be one , so that the world will believe that you sent me .
43017022	I gave them the same glory you gave me , so that they may be one , just as you and I are one :
43017023	I in them and you in me , so that they may be completely one , in order that the world may know that you sent me and that you love them as you love me .
43017024	“ Father ! You have given them to me , and I want them to be with me where I am , so that they may see my glory , the glory you gave me ; for you loved me before the world was made .
43017025	Righteous Father ! The world does not know you , but I know you , and these know that you sent me .
43017026	I made you known to them , and I will continue to do so , in order that the love you have for me may be in them , and so that I also may be in them . ”
43018001	After Jesus had said this prayer , he left with his disciples and went across Kidron Brook . There was a garden in that place , and Jesus and his disciples went in .
43018002	Judas , the traitor , knew where it was , because many times Jesus had met there with his disciples .
43018003	So Judas went to the garden , taking with him a group of Roman soldiers , and some Temple guards sent by the chief priests and the Pharisees ; they were armed and carried lanterns and torches .
43018004	Jesus knew everything that was going to happen to him , so he stepped forward and asked them , “ Who is it you are looking for ? ”
43018005	“ Jesus of Nazareth , ” they answered . “ I am he , ” he said . Judas , the traitor , was standing there with them .
43018006	When Jesus said to them , “ I am he , ” they moved back and fell to the ground .
43018007	Again Jesus asked them , “ Who is it you are looking for ? ” “ Jesus of Nazareth , ” they said .
43018008	“ I have already told you that I am he , ” Jesus said . “ If , then , you are looking for me , let these others go . ” (
43018009	He said this so that what he had said might come true : “ Father , I have not lost even one of those you gave me . ” )
43018010	Simon Peter , who had a sword , drew it and struck the High Priest's slave , cutting off his right ear . The name of the slave was Malchus .
43018011	Jesus said to Peter , “ Put your sword back in its place ! Do you think that I will not drink the cup of suffering which my Father has given me ? ”
43018012	Then the Roman soldiers with their commanding officer and the Jewish guards arrested Jesus , tied him up ,
43018013	and took him first to Annas . He was the father-in-law of Caiaphas , who was High Priest that year .
43018014	It was Caiaphas who had advised the Jewish authorities that it was better that one man should die for all the people .
43018015	Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus . That other disciple was well known to the High Priest , so he went with Jesus into the courtyard of the High Priest's house ,
43018016	while Peter stayed outside by the gate . Then the other disciple went back out , spoke to the girl at the gate , and brought Peter inside .
43018017	The girl at the gate said to Peter , “ Aren't you also one of the disciples of that man ? ” “ No , I am not , ” answered Peter .
43018018	It was cold , so the servants and guards had built a charcoal fire and were standing around it , warming themselves . So Peter went over and stood with them , warming himself .
43018019	The High Priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching .
43018020	Jesus answered , “ I have always spoken publicly to everyone ; all my teaching was done in the synagogues and in the Temple , where all the people come together . I have never said anything in secret .
43018021	Why , then , do you question me ? Question the people who heard me . Ask them what I told them—they know what I said . ”
43018022	When Jesus said this , one of the guards there slapped him and said , “ How dare you talk like that to the High Priest ! ”
43018023	Jesus answered him , “ If I have said anything wrong , tell everyone here what it was . But if I am right in what I have said , why do you hit me ? ”
43018024	Then Annas sent him , still tied up , to Caiaphas the High Priest .
43018025	Peter was still standing there keeping himself warm . So the others said to him , “ Aren't you also one of the disciples of that man ? ” But Peter denied it . “ No , I am not , ” he said .
43018026	One of the High Priest's slaves , a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off , spoke up . “ Didn't I see you with him in the garden ? ” he asked .
43018027	Again Peter said “ No ” —and at once a rooster crowed .
43018028	Early in the morning Jesus was taken from Caiaphas' house to the governor's palace . The Jewish authorities did not go inside the palace , for they wanted to keep themselves ritually clean , in order to be able to eat the Passover meal .
43018029	So Pilate went outside to them and asked , “ What do you accuse this man of ? ”
43018030	Their answer was , “ We would not have brought him to you if he had not committed a crime . ”
43018031	Pilate said to them , “ Then you yourselves take him and try him according to your own law . ” They replied , “ We are not allowed to put anyone to death . ” (
43018032	This happened in order to make come true what Jesus had said when he indicated the kind of death he would die . )
43018033	Pilate went back into the palace and called Jesus . “ Are you the king of the Jews ? ” he asked him .
43018034	Jesus answered , “ Does this question come from you or have others told you about me ? ”
43018035	Pilate replied , “ Do you think I am a Jew ? It was your own people and the chief priests who handed you over to me . What have you done ? ”
43018036	Jesus said , “ My kingdom does not belong to this world ; if my kingdom belonged to this world , my followers would fight to keep me from being handed over to the Jewish authorities . No , my kingdom does not belong here ! ”
43018037	So Pilate asked him , “ Are you a king , then ? ” Jesus answered , “ You say that I am a king . I was born and came into the world for this one purpose , to speak about the truth . Whoever belongs to the truth listens to me . ”
43018038	“ And what is truth ? ” Pilate asked . Then Pilate went back outside to the people and said to them , “ I cannot find any reason to condemn him .
43018039	But according to the custom you have , I always set free a prisoner for you during the Passover . Do you want me to set free for you the king of the Jews ? ”
43018040	They answered him with a shout , “ No , not him ! We want Barabbas ! ” ( Barabbas was a bandit . )
43019001	Then Pilate took Jesus and had him whipped .
43019002	The soldiers made a crown out of thorny branches and put it on his head ; then they put a purple robe on him
43019003	and came to him and said , “ Long live the King of the Jews ! ” And they went up and slapped him .
43019004	Pilate went back out once more and said to the crowd , “ Look , I will bring him out here to you to let you see that I cannot find any reason to condemn him . ”
43019005	So Jesus came out , wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe . Pilate said to them , “ Look ! Here is the man ! ”
43019006	When the chief priests and the Temple guards saw him , they shouted , “ Crucify him ! Crucify him ! ” Pilate said to them , “ You take him , then , and crucify him . I find no reason to condemn him . ”
43019007	The crowd answered back , “ We have a law that says he ought to die , because he claimed to be the Son of God . ”
43019008	When Pilate heard this , he was even more afraid .
43019009	He went back into the palace and asked Jesus , “ Where do you come from ? ” But Jesus did not answer .
43019010	Pilate said to him , “ You will not speak to me ? Remember , I have the authority to set you free and also to have you crucified . ”
43019011	Jesus answered , “ You have authority over me only because it was given to you by God . So the man who handed me over to you is guilty of a worse sin . ”
43019012	When Pilate heard this , he tried to find a way to set Jesus free . But the crowd shouted back , “ If you set him free , that means that you are not the Emperor's friend ! Anyone who claims to be a king is a rebel against the Emperor ! ”
43019013	When Pilate heard these words , he took Jesus outside and sat down on the judge's seat in the place called “ The Stone Pavement . ” ( In Hebrew the name is “ Gabbatha . ” )
43019014	It was then almost noon of the day before the Passover . Pilate said to the people , “ Here is your king ! ”
43019015	They shouted back , “ Kill him ! Kill him ! Crucify him ! ” Pilate asked them , “ Do you want me to crucify your king ? ” The chief priests answered , “ The only king we have is the Emperor ! ”
43019016	Then Pilate handed Jesus over to them to be crucified . So they took charge of Jesus .
43019017	He went out , carrying his cross , and came to “ The Place of the Skull , ” as it is called . ( In Hebrew it is called “ Golgotha . ” )
43019018	There they crucified him ; and they also crucified two other men , one on each side , with Jesus between them .
43019019	Pilate wrote a notice and had it put on the cross . “ Jesus of Nazareth , the King of the Jews , ” is what he wrote .
43019020	Many people read it , because the place where Jesus was crucified was not far from the city . The notice was written in Hebrew , Latin , and Greek .
43019021	The chief priests said to Pilate , “ Do not write ‘ The King of the Jews , ’ but rather , ‘ This man said , I am the King of the Jews . ’ ”
43019022	Pilate answered , “ What I have written stays written . ”
43019023	After the soldiers had crucified Jesus , they took his clothes and divided them into four parts , one part for each soldier . They also took the robe , which was made of one piece of woven cloth without any seams in it .
43019024	The soldiers said to one another , “ Let's not tear it ; let's throw dice to see who will get it . ” This happened in order to make the scripture come true : “ They divided my clothes among themselves and gambled for my robe . ”
43019025	Standing close to Jesus' cross were his mother , his mother's sister , Mary the wife of Clopas , and Mary Magdalene .
43019026	Jesus saw his mother and the disciple he loved standing there ; so he said to his mother , “ He is your son . ”
43019027	Then he said to the disciple , “ She is your mother . ” From that time the disciple took her to live in his home .
43019028	Jesus knew that by now everything had been completed ; and in order to make the scripture come true , he said , “ I am thirsty . ”
43019029	A bowl was there , full of cheap wine ; so a sponge was soaked in the wine , put on a stalk of hyssop , and lifted up to his lips .
43019030	Jesus drank the wine and said , “ It is finished ! ” Then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit .
43019031	Then the Jewish authorities asked Pilate to allow them to break the legs of the men who had been crucified , and to take the bodies down from the crosses . They requested this because it was Friday , and they did not want the bodies to stay on the crosses on the Sabbath , since the coming Sabbath was especially holy .
43019032	So the soldiers went and broke the legs of the first man and then of the other man who had been crucified with Jesus .
43019033	But when they came to Jesus , they saw that he was already dead , so they did not break his legs .
43019034	One of the soldiers , however , plunged his spear into Jesus' side , and at once blood and water poured out . (
43019035	The one who saw this happen has spoken of it , so that you also may believe . What he said is true , and he knows that he speaks the truth . )
43019036	This was done to make the scripture come true : “ Not one of his bones will be broken . ”
43019037	And there is another scripture that says , “ People will look at him whom they pierced . ”
43019038	After this , Joseph , who was from the town of Arimathea , asked Pilate if he could take Jesus' body . ( Joseph was a follower of Jesus , but in secret , because he was afraid of the Jewish authorities . ) Pilate told him he could have the body , so Joseph went and took it away .
43019039	Nicodemus , who at first had gone to see Jesus at night , went with Joseph , taking with him about one hundred pounds of spices , a mixture of myrrh and aloes .
43019040	The two men took Jesus' body and wrapped it in linen cloths with the spices according to the Jewish custom of preparing a body for burial .
43019041	There was a garden in the place where Jesus had been put to death , and in it there was a new tomb where no one had ever been buried .
43019042	Since it was the day before the Sabbath and because the tomb was close by , they placed Jesus' body there .
43020001	Early on Sunday morning , while it was still dark , Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been taken away from the entrance .
43020002	She went running to Simon Peter and the other disciple , whom Jesus loved , and told them , “ They have taken the Lord from the tomb , and we don't know where they have put him ! ”
43020003	Then Peter and the other disciple went to the tomb .
43020004	The two of them were running , but the other disciple ran faster than Peter and reached the tomb first .
43020005	He bent over and saw the linen cloths , but he did not go in .
43020006	Behind him came Simon Peter , and he went straight into the tomb . He saw the linen cloths lying there
43020007	and the cloth which had been around Jesus' head . It was not lying with the linen cloths but was rolled up by itself .
43020008	Then the other disciple , who had reached the tomb first , also went in ; he saw and believed . (
43020009	They still did not understand the scripture which said that he must rise from death . )
43020010	Then the disciples went back home .
43020011	Mary stood crying outside the tomb . While she was still crying , she bent over and looked in the tomb
43020012	and saw two angels there dressed in white , sitting where the body of Jesus had been , one at the head and the other at the feet .
43020013	“ Woman , why are you crying ? ” they asked her . She answered , “ They have taken my Lord away , and I do not know where they have put him ! ”
43020014	Then she turned around and saw Jesus standing there ; but she did not know that it was Jesus .
43020015	“ Woman , why are you crying ? ” Jesus asked her . “ Who is it that you are looking for ? ” She thought he was the gardener , so she said to him , “ If you took him away , sir , tell me where you have put him , and I will go and get him . ”
43020016	Jesus said to her , “ Mary ! ” She turned toward him and said in Hebrew , “ Rabboni ! ” ( This means “ Teacher . ” )
43020017	“ Do not hold on to me , ” Jesus told her , “ because I have not yet gone back up to the Father . But go to my brothers and tell them that I am returning to him who is my Father and their Father , my God and their God . ”
43020018	So Mary Magdalene went and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord and related to them what he had told her .
43020019	It was late that Sunday evening , and the disciples were gathered together behind locked doors , because they were afraid of the Jewish authorities . Then Jesus came and stood among them . “ Peace be with you , ” he said .
43020020	After saying this , he showed them his hands and his side . The disciples were filled with joy at seeing the Lord .
43020021	Jesus said to them again , “ Peace be with you . As the Father sent me , so I send you . ”
43020022	Then he breathed on them and said , “ Receive the Holy Spirit .
43020023	If you forgive people's sins , they are forgiven ; if you do not forgive them , they are not forgiven . ”
43020024	One of the twelve disciples , Thomas ( called the Twin ) , was not with them when Jesus came .
43020025	So the other disciples told him , “ We have seen the Lord ! ” Thomas said to them , “ Unless I see the scars of the nails in his hands and put my finger on those scars and my hand in his side , I will not believe . ”
43020026	A week later the disciples were together again indoors , and Thomas was with them . The doors were locked , but Jesus came and stood among them and said , “ Peace be with you . ”
43020027	Then he said to Thomas , “ Put your finger here , and look at my hands ; then reach out your hand and put it in my side . Stop your doubting , and believe ! ”
43020028	Thomas answered him , “ My Lord and my God ! ”
43020029	Jesus said to him , “ Do you believe because you see me ? How happy are those who believe without seeing me ! ”
43020030	In his disciples' presence Jesus performed many other miracles which are not written down in this book .
43020031	But these have been written in order that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah , the Son of God , and that through your faith in him you may have life .
43021001	After this , Jesus appeared once more to his disciples at Lake Tiberias . This is how it happened .
43021002	Simon Peter , Thomas ( called the Twin ) , Nathanael ( the one from Cana in Galilee ) , the sons of Zebedee , and two other disciples of Jesus were all together .
43021003	Simon Peter said to the others , “ I am going fishing . ” “ We will come with you , ” they told him . So they went out in a boat , but all that night they did not catch a thing .
43021004	As the sun was rising , Jesus stood at the water's edge , but the disciples did not know that it was Jesus .
43021005	Then he asked them , “ Young men , haven't you caught anything ? ” “ Not a thing , ” they answered .
43021006	He said to them , “ Throw your net out on the right side of the boat , and you will catch some . ” So they threw the net out and could not pull it back in , because they had caught so many fish .
43021007	The disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter , “ It is the Lord ! ” When Peter heard that it was the Lord , he wrapped his outer garment around him ( for he had taken his clothes off ) and jumped into the water .
43021008	The other disciples came to shore in the boat , pulling the net full of fish . They were not very far from land , about a hundred yards away .
43021009	When they stepped ashore , they saw a charcoal fire there with fish on it and some bread .
43021010	Then Jesus said to them , “ Bring some of the fish you have just caught . ”
43021011	Simon Peter went aboard and dragged the net ashore full of big fish , a hundred and fifty-three in all ; even though there were so many , still the net did not tear .
43021012	Jesus said to them , “ Come and eat . ” None of the disciples dared ask him , “ Who are you ? ” because they knew it was the Lord .
43021013	So Jesus went over , took the bread , and gave it to them ; he did the same with the fish .
43021014	This , then , was the third time Jesus appeared to the disciples after he was raised from death .
43021015	After they had eaten , Jesus said to Simon Peter , “ Simon son of John , do you love me more than these others do ? ” “ Yes , Lord , ” he answered , “ you know that I love you . ” Jesus said to him , “ Take care of my lambs . ”
43021016	A second time Jesus said to him , “ Simon son of John , do you love me ? ” “ Yes , Lord , ” he answered , “ you know that I love you . ” Jesus said to him , “ Take care of my sheep . ”
43021017	A third time Jesus said , “ Simon son of John , do you love me ? ” Peter became sad because Jesus asked him the third time , “ Do you love me ? ” and so he said to him , “ Lord , you know everything ; you know that I love you ! ” Jesus said to him , “ Take care of my sheep .
43021018	I am telling you the truth : when you were young , you used to get ready and go anywhere you wanted to ; but when you are old , you will stretch out your hands and someone else will tie you up and take you where you don't want to go . ”
43021019	( In saying this , Jesus was indicating the way in which Peter would die and bring glory to God . ) Then Jesus said to him , “ Follow me ! ”
43021020	Peter turned around and saw behind him that other disciple , whom Jesus loved—the one who had leaned close to Jesus at the meal and had asked , “ Lord , who is going to betray you ? ”
43021021	When Peter saw him , he asked Jesus , “ Lord , what about this man ? ”
43021022	Jesus answered him , “ If I want him to live until I come , what is that to you ? Follow me ! ”
43021023	So a report spread among the followers of Jesus that this disciple would not die . But Jesus did not say he would not die ; he said , “ If I want him to live until I come , what is that to you ? ”
43021024	He is the disciple who spoke of these things , the one who also wrote them down ; and we know that what he said is true .
43021025	Now , there are many other things that Jesus did . If they were all written down one by one , I suppose that the whole world could not hold the books that would be written .
44001001	Dear Theophilus : In my first book I wrote about all the things that Jesus did and taught from the time he began his work
44001002	until the day he was taken up to heaven . Before he was taken up , he gave instructions by the power of the Holy Spirit to the men he had chosen as his apostles .
44001003	For forty days after his death he appeared to them many times in ways that proved beyond doubt that he was alive . They saw him , and he talked with them about the Kingdom of God .
44001004	And when they came together , he gave them this order : “ Do not leave Jerusalem , but wait for the gift I told you about , the gift my Father promised .
44001005	John baptized with water , but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit . ”
44001006	When the apostles met together with Jesus , they asked him , “ Lord , will you at this time give the Kingdom back to Israel ? ”
44001007	Jesus said to them , “ The times and occasions are set by my Father's own authority , and it is not for you to know when they will be .
44001008	But when the Holy Spirit comes upon you , you will be filled with power , and you will be witnesses for me in Jerusalem , in all of Judea and Samaria , and to the ends of the earth . ”
44001009	After saying this , he was taken up to heaven as they watched him , and a cloud hid him from their sight .
44001010	They still had their eyes fixed on the sky as he went away , when two men dressed in white suddenly stood beside them
44001011	and said , “ Galileans , why are you standing there looking up at the sky ? This Jesus , who was taken from you into heaven , will come back in the same way that you saw him go to heaven . ”
44001012	Then the apostles went back to Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives , which is about half a mile away from the city .
44001013	They entered the city and went up to the room where they were staying : Peter , John , James and Andrew , Philip and Thomas , Bartholomew and Matthew , James son of Alphaeus , Simon the Patriot , and Judas son of James .
44001014	They gathered frequently to pray as a group , together with the women and with Mary the mother of Jesus and with his brothers .
44001015	A few days later there was a meeting of the believers , about a hundred and twenty in all , and Peter stood up to speak .
44001016	“ My friends , ” he said , “ the scripture had to come true in which the Holy Spirit , speaking through David , made a prediction about Judas , who was the guide for those who arrested Jesus .
44001017	Judas was a member of our group , for he had been chosen to have a part in our work . ” (
44001018	With the money that Judas got for his evil act he bought a field , where he fell to his death ; he burst open and all his insides spilled out .
44001019	All the people living in Jerusalem heard about it , and so in their own language they call that field Akeldama , which means “ Field of Blood . ” )
44001020	“ For it is written in the book of Psalms , ‘ May his house become empty ; may no one live in it . ’ ‘ May someone else take his place of service . ’
44001023	So they proposed two men : Joseph , who was called Barsabbas ( also known as Justus ) , and Matthias .
44001024	Then they prayed , “ Lord , you know the thoughts of everyone , so show us which of these two you have chosen
44001025	to serve as an apostle in the place of Judas , who left to go to the place where he belongs . ”
44001026	Then they drew lots to choose between the two men , and the one chosen was Matthias , who was added to the group of eleven apostles .
44002001	When the day of Pentecost came , all the believers were gathered together in one place .
44002002	Suddenly there was a noise from the sky which sounded like a strong wind blowing , and it filled the whole house where they were sitting .
44002003	Then they saw what looked like tongues of fire which spread out and touched each person there .
44002004	They were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to talk in other languages , as the Spirit enabled them to speak .
44002005	There were Jews living in Jerusalem , religious people who had come from every country in the world .
44002006	When they heard this noise , a large crowd gathered . They were all excited , because all of them heard the believers talking in their own languages .
44002007	In amazement and wonder they exclaimed , “ These people who are talking like this are Galileans !
44002008	How is it , then , that all of us hear them speaking in our own native languages ?
44002009	We are from Parthia , Media , and Elam ; from Mesopotamia , Judea , and Cappadocia ; from Pontus and Asia ,
44002010	from Phrygia and Pamphylia , from Egypt and the regions of Libya near Cyrene . Some of us are from Rome ,
44002011	both Jews and Gentiles converted to Judaism , and some of us are from Crete and Arabia—yet all of us hear them speaking in our own languages about the great things that God has done ! ”
44002012	Amazed and confused , they kept asking each other , “ What does this mean ? ”
44002013	But others made fun of the believers , saying , “ These people are drunk ! ”
44002014	Then Peter stood up with the other eleven apostles and in a loud voice began to speak to the crowd : “ Fellow Jews and all of you who live in Jerusalem , listen to me and let me tell you what this means .
44002015	These people are not drunk , as you suppose ; it is only nine o'clock in the morning .
44002016	Instead , this is what the prophet Joel spoke about :
44002017	‘ This is what I will do in the last days , God says : I will pour out my Spirit on everyone . Your sons and daughters will proclaim my message ; your young men will see visions , and your old men will have dreams .
44002018	Yes , even on my servants , both men and women , I will pour out my Spirit in those days , and they will proclaim my message .
44002019	I will perform miracles in the sky above and wonders on the earth below . There will be blood , fire , and thick smoke ;
44002020	the sun will be darkened , and the moon will turn red as blood , before the great and glorious Day of the Lord comes .
44002021	And then , whoever calls out to the Lord for help will be saved . ’
44002022	“ Listen to these words , fellow Israelites ! Jesus of Nazareth was a man whose divine authority was clearly proven to you by all the miracles and wonders which God performed through him . You yourselves know this , for it happened here among you .
44002023	In accordance with his own plan God had already decided that Jesus would be handed over to you ; and you killed him by letting sinful men crucify him .
44002024	But God raised him from death , setting him free from its power , because it was impossible that death should hold him prisoner .
44002025	For David said about him , ‘ I saw the Lord before me at all times ; he is near me , and I will not be troubled .
44002026	And so I am filled with gladness , and my words are full of joy . And I , mortal though I am , will rest assured in hope ,
44002027	because you will not abandon me in the world of the dead ; you will not allow your faithful servant to rot in the grave .
44002028	You have shown me the paths that lead to life , and your presence will fill me with joy . ’
44002029	“ My friends , I must speak to you plainly about our famous ancestor King David . He died and was buried , and his grave is here with us to this very day .
44002030	He was a prophet , and he knew what God had promised him : God had made a vow that he would make one of David's descendants a king , just as David was .
44002031	David saw what God was going to do in the future , and so he spoke about the resurrection of the Messiah when he said , ‘ He was not abandoned in the world of the dead ; his body did not rot in the grave . ’ ‘ The Lord said to my Lord : Sit here at my right side
44002035	until I put your enemies as a footstool under your feet . ’
44002036	“ All the people of Israel , then , are to know for sure that this Jesus , whom you crucified , is the one that God has made Lord and Messiah ! ”
44002037	When the people heard this , they were deeply troubled and said to Peter and the other apostles , “ What shall we do , brothers ? ”
44002038	Peter said to them , “ Each one of you must turn away from your sins and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ , so that your sins will be forgiven ; and you will receive God's gift , the Holy Spirit .
44002039	For God's promise was made to you and your children , and to all who are far away—all whom the Lord our God calls to himself . ”
44002040	Peter made his appeal to them and with many other words he urged them , saying , “ Save yourselves from the punishment coming on this wicked people ! ”
44002041	Many of them believed his message and were baptized , and about three thousand people were added to the group that day .
44002042	They spent their time in learning from the apostles , taking part in the fellowship , and sharing in the fellowship meals and the prayers .
44002043	Many miracles and wonders were being done through the apostles , and everyone was filled with awe .
44002044	All the believers continued together in close fellowship and shared their belongings with one another .
44002045	They would sell their property and possessions , and distribute the money among all , according to what each one needed .
44002046	Day after day they met as a group in the Temple , and they had their meals together in their homes , eating with glad and humble hearts ,
44002047	praising God , and enjoying the good will of all the people . And every day the Lord added to their group those who were being saved .
44003001	One day Peter and John went to the Temple at three o'clock in the afternoon , the hour for prayer .
44003002	There at the Beautiful Gate , as it was called , was a man who had been lame all his life . Every day he was carried to the gate to beg for money from the people who were going into the Temple .
44003003	When he saw Peter and John going in , he begged them to give him something .
44003004	They looked straight at him , and Peter said , “ Look at us ! ”
44003005	So he looked at them , expecting to get something from them .
44003006	But Peter said to him , “ I have no money at all , but I give you what I have : in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth I order you to get up and walk ! ”
44003007	Then he took him by his right hand and helped him up . At once the man's feet and ankles became strong ;
44003008	he jumped up , stood on his feet , and started walking around . Then he went into the Temple with them , walking and jumping and praising God .
44003009	The people there saw him walking and praising God ,
44003010	and when they recognized him as the beggar who had sat at the Beautiful Gate , they were all surprised and amazed at what had happened to him .
44003011	As the man held on to Peter and John in Solomon's Porch , as it was called , the people were amazed and ran to them .
44003012	When Peter saw the people , he said to them , “ Fellow Israelites , why are you surprised at this , and why do you stare at us ? Do you think that it was by means of our own power or godliness that we made this man walk ?
44003013	The God of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , the God of our ancestors , has given divine glory to his Servant Jesus . But you handed him over to the authorities , and you rejected him in Pilate's presence , even after Pilate had decided to set him free .
44003014	He was holy and good , but you rejected him , and instead you asked Pilate to do you the favor of turning loose a murderer .
44003015	You killed the one who leads to life , but God raised him from death—and we are witnesses to this .
44003016	It was the power of his name that gave strength to this lame man . What you see and know was done by faith in his name ; it was faith in Jesus that has made him well , as you can all see .
44003017	“ And now , my friends , I know that what you and your leaders did to Jesus was due to your ignorance .
44003018	God announced long ago through all the prophets that his Messiah had to suffer ; and he made it come true in this way .
44003019	Repent , then , and turn to God , so that he will forgive your sins . If you do ,
44003020	times of spiritual strength will come from the Lord , and he will send Jesus , who is the Messiah he has already chosen for you .
44003021	He must remain in heaven until the time comes for all things to be made new , as God announced through his holy prophets of long ago .
44003022	For Moses said , ‘ The Lord your God will send you a prophet , just as he sent me , and he will be one of your own people . You are to obey everything that he tells you to do .
44003023	Anyone who does not obey that prophet shall be separated from God's people and destroyed . ’
44003024	And all the prophets who had a message , including Samuel and those who came after him , also announced what has been happening these days .
44003025	The promises of God through his prophets are for you , and you share in the covenant which God made with your ancestors . As he said to Abraham , ‘ Through your descendants I will bless all the people on earth . ’
44003026	And so God chose his Servant and sent him to you first , to bless you by making every one of you turn away from your wicked ways . ”
44004001	Peter and John were still speaking to the people when some priests , the officer in charge of the Temple guards , and some Sadducees arrived .
44004002	They were annoyed because the two apostles were teaching the people that Jesus had risen from death , which proved that the dead will rise to life .
44004003	So they arrested them and put them in jail until the next day , since it was already late .
44004004	But many who heard the message believed ; and the number grew to about five thousand .
44004005	The next day the Jewish leaders , the elders , and the teachers of the Law gathered in Jerusalem .
44004006	They met with the High Priest Annas and with Caiaphas , John , Alexander , and the others who belonged to the High Priest's family .
44004007	They made the apostles stand before them and asked them , “ How did you do this ? What power do you have or whose name did you use ? ”
44004008	Peter , full of the Holy Spirit , answered them , “ Leaders of the people and elders :
44004009	if we are being questioned today about the good deed done to the lame man and how he was healed ,
44004010	then you should all know , and all the people of Israel should know , that this man stands here before you completely well through the power of the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth—whom you crucified and whom God raised from death .
44004011	Jesus is the one of whom the scripture says , ‘ The stone that you the builders despised turned out to be the most important of all . ’
44004013	The members of the Council were amazed to see how bold Peter and John were and to learn that they were ordinary men of no education . They realized then that they had been companions of Jesus .
44004014	But there was nothing that they could say , because they saw the man who had been healed standing there with Peter and John .
44004015	So they told them to leave the Council room , and then they started discussing among themselves .
44004016	“ What shall we do with these men ? ” they asked . “ Everyone in Jerusalem knows that this extraordinary miracle has been performed by them , and we cannot deny it .
44004017	But to keep this matter from spreading any further among the people , let us warn these men never again to speak to anyone in the name of Jesus . ”
44004018	So they called them back in and told them that under no condition were they to speak or to teach in the name of Jesus .
44004019	But Peter and John answered them , “ You yourselves judge which is right in God's sight—to obey you or to obey God .
44004020	For we cannot stop speaking of what we ourselves have seen and heard . ”
44004021	So the Council warned them even more strongly and then set them free . They saw that it was impossible to punish them , because the people were all praising God for what had happened .
44004022	The man on whom this miracle of healing had been performed was over forty years old .
44004023	As soon as Peter and John were set free , they returned to their group and told them what the chief priests and the elders had said .
44004024	When the believers heard it , they all joined together in prayer to God : “ Master and Creator of heaven , earth , and sea , and all that is in them !
44004025	By means of the Holy Spirit you spoke through our ancestor David , your servant , when he said , ‘ Why were the Gentiles furious ; why did people make their useless plots ?
44004026	The kings of the earth prepared themselves , and the rulers met together against the Lord and his Messiah . ’
44004031	When they finished praying , the place where they were meeting was shaken . They were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to proclaim God's message with boldness .
44004032	The group of believers was one in mind and heart . None of them said that any of their belongings were their own , but they all shared with one another everything they had .
44004033	With great power the apostles gave witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus , and God poured rich blessings on them all .
44004034	There was no one in the group who was in need . Those who owned fields or houses would sell them , bring the money received from the sale ,
44004035	and turn it over to the apostles ; and the money was distributed according to the needs of the people .
44004036	And so it was that Joseph , a Levite born in Cyprus , whom the apostles called Barnabas ( which means “ One who Encourages ” ) ,
44004037	sold a field he owned , brought the money , and turned it over to the apostles .
44005001	But there was a man named Ananias , who with his wife Sapphira sold some property that belonged to them .
44005002	But with his wife's agreement he kept part of the money for himself and turned the rest over to the apostles .
44005003	Peter said to him , “ Ananias , why did you let Satan take control of you and make you lie to the Holy Spirit by keeping part of the money you received for the property ?
44005004	Before you sold the property , it belonged to you ; and after you sold it , the money was yours . Why , then , did you decide to do such a thing ? You have not lied to people—you have lied to God ! ”
44005005	As soon as Ananias heard this , he fell down dead ; and all who heard about it were terrified .
44005006	The young men came in , wrapped up his body , carried him out , and buried him .
44005007	About three hours later his wife , not knowing what had happened , came in .
44005008	Peter asked her , “ Tell me , was this the full amount you and your husband received for your property ? ” “ Yes , ” she answered , “ the full amount . ”
44005009	So Peter said to her , “ Why did you and your husband decide to put the Lord's Spirit to the test ? The men who buried your husband are at the door right now , and they will carry you out too ! ”
44005010	At once she fell down at his feet and died . The young men came in and saw that she was dead , so they carried her out and buried her beside her husband .
44005011	The whole church and all the others who heard of this were terrified .
44005012	Many miracles and wonders were being performed among the people by the apostles . All the believers met together in Solomon's Porch .
44005013	Nobody outside the group dared join them , even though the people spoke highly of them .
44005014	But more and more people were added to the group—a crowd of men and women who believed in the Lord .
44005015	As a result of what the apostles were doing , sick people were carried out into the streets and placed on beds and mats so that at least Peter's shadow might fall on some of them as he passed by .
44005016	And crowds of people came in from the towns around Jerusalem , bringing those who were sick or who had evil spirits in them ; and they were all healed .
44005017	Then the High Priest and all his companions , members of the local party of the Sadducees , became extremely jealous of the apostles ; so they decided to take action .
44005018	They arrested the apostles and put them in the public jail .
44005019	But that night an angel of the Lord opened the prison gates , led the apostles out , and said to them ,
44005020	“ Go and stand in the Temple , and tell the people all about this new life . ”
44005021	The apostles obeyed , and at dawn they entered the Temple and started teaching . The High Priest and his companions called together all the Jewish elders for a full meeting of the Council ; then they sent orders to the prison to have the apostles brought before them .
44005022	But when the officials arrived , they did not find the apostles in prison , so they returned to the Council and reported ,
44005023	“ When we arrived at the jail , we found it locked up tight and all the guards on watch at the gates ; but when we opened the gates , we found no one inside ! ”
44005024	When the chief priests and the officer in charge of the Temple guards heard this , they wondered what had happened to the apostles .
44005025	Then a man came in and said to them , “ Listen ! The men you put in prison are in the Temple teaching the people ! ”
44005026	So the officer went off with his men and brought the apostles back . They did not use force , however , because they were afraid that the people might stone them .
44005027	They brought the apostles in , made them stand before the Council , and the High Priest questioned them .
44005028	“ We gave you strict orders not to teach in the name of this man , ” he said ; “ but see what you have done ! You have spread your teaching all over Jerusalem , and you want to make us responsible for his death ! ”
44005029	Peter and the other apostles answered , “ We must obey God , not men .
44005030	The God of our ancestors raised Jesus from death , after you had killed him by nailing him to a cross .
44005031	God raised him to his right side as Leader and Savior , to give the people of Israel the opportunity to repent and have their sins forgiven .
44005032	We are witnesses to these things—we and the Holy Spirit , who is God's gift to those who obey him . ”
44005033	When the members of the Council heard this , they were so furious that they wanted to have the apostles put to death .
44005034	But one of them , a Pharisee named Gamaliel , who was a teacher of the Law and was highly respected by all the people , stood up in the Council . He ordered the apostles to be taken out for a while ,
44005035	and then he said to the Council , “ Fellow Israelites , be careful what you do to these men .
44005036	You remember that Theudas appeared some time ago , claiming to be somebody great , and about four hundred men joined him . But he was killed , all his followers were scattered , and his movement died out .
44005037	After that , Judas the Galilean appeared during the time of the census ; he drew a crowd after him , but he also was killed , and all his followers were scattered .
44005038	And so in this case , I tell you , do not take any action against these men . Leave them alone ! If what they have planned and done is of human origin , it will disappear ,
44005039	but if it comes from God , you cannot possibly defeat them . You could find yourselves fighting against God ! ” The Council followed Gamaliel's advice .
44005040	They called the apostles in , had them whipped , and ordered them never again to speak in the name of Jesus ; and then they set them free .
44005041	As the apostles left the Council , they were happy , because God had considered them worthy to suffer disgrace for the sake of Jesus .
44005042	And every day in the Temple and in people's homes they continued to teach and preach the Good News about Jesus the Messiah .
44006001	Some time later , as the number of disciples kept growing , there was a quarrel between the Greek-speaking Jews and the native Jews . The Greek-speaking Jews claimed that their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution of funds .
44006002	So the twelve apostles called the whole group of believers together and said , “ It is not right for us to neglect the preaching of God's word in order to handle finances .
44006003	So then , friends , choose seven men among you who are known to be full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom , and we will put them in charge of this matter .
44006004	We ourselves , then , will give our full time to prayer and the work of preaching . ”
44006005	The whole group was pleased with the apostles' proposal , so they chose Stephen , a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit , and Philip , Prochorus , Nicanor , Timon , Parmenas , and Nicolaus , a Gentile from Antioch who had earlier been converted to Judaism .
44006006	The group presented them to the apostles , who prayed and placed their hands on them .
44006007	And so the word of God continued to spread . The number of disciples in Jerusalem grew larger and larger , and a great number of priests accepted the faith .
44006008	Stephen , a man richly blessed by God and full of power , performed great miracles and wonders among the people .
44006009	But he was opposed by some men who were members of the synagogue of the Freedmen ( as it was called ) , which had Jews from Cyrene and Alexandria . They and other Jews from the provinces of Cilicia and Asia started arguing with Stephen .
44006010	But the Spirit gave Stephen such wisdom that when he spoke , they could not refute him .
44006011	So they bribed some men to say , “ We heard him speaking against Moses and against God ! ”
44006012	In this way they stirred up the people , the elders , and the teachers of the Law . They seized Stephen and took him before the Council .
44006013	Then they brought in some men to tell lies about him . “ This man , ” they said , “ is always talking against our sacred Temple and the Law of Moses .
44006014	We heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will tear down the Temple and change all the customs which have come down to us from Moses ! ”
44006015	All those sitting in the Council fixed their eyes on Stephen and saw that his face looked like the face of an angel .
44007001	The High Priest asked Stephen , “ Is this true ? ”
44007002	Stephen answered , “ Brothers and fathers , listen to me ! Before our ancestor Abraham had gone to live in Haran , the God of glory appeared to him in Mesopotamia
44007003	and said to him , ‘ Leave your family and country and go to the land that I will show you . ’
44007004	And so he left his country and went to live in Haran . After Abraham's father died , God made him move to this land where you now live .
44007005	God did not then give Abraham any part of it as his own , not even a square foot of ground , but God promised to give it to him , and that it would belong to him and to his descendants . At the time God made this promise , Abraham had no children .
44007006	This is what God said to him : ‘ Your descendants will live in a foreign country , where they will be slaves and will be badly treated for four hundred years .
44007007	But I will pass judgment on the people that they will serve , and afterward your descendants will come out of that country and will worship me in this place . ’
44007008	Then God gave to Abraham the ceremony of circumcision as a sign of the covenant . So Abraham circumcised Isaac a week after he was born ; Isaac circumcised his son Jacob , and Jacob circumcised his twelve sons , the famous ancestors of our race .
44007009	“ Jacob's sons became jealous of their brother Joseph and sold him to be a slave in Egypt . But God was with him
44007010	and brought him safely through all his troubles . When Joseph appeared before the king of Egypt , God gave him a pleasing manner and wisdom , and the king made Joseph governor over the country and the royal household .
44007011	Then there was a famine all over Egypt and Canaan , which caused much suffering . Our ancestors could not find any food ,
44007012	and when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt , he sent his sons , our ancestors , on their first visit there .
44007013	On the second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers , and the king of Egypt came to know about Joseph's family .
44007014	So Joseph sent a message to his father Jacob , telling him and the whole family , seventy-five people in all , to come to Egypt .
44007015	Then Jacob went to Egypt , where he and his sons died .
44007016	Their bodies were taken to Shechem , where they were buried in the grave which Abraham had bought from the clan of Hamor for a sum of money .
44007017	“ When the time drew near for God to keep the promise he had made to Abraham , the number of our people in Egypt had grown much larger .
44007018	At last a king who did not know about Joseph began to rule in Egypt .
44007019	He tricked our ancestors and was cruel to them , forcing them to put their babies out of their homes , so that they would die .
44007020	It was at this time that Moses was born , a very beautiful child . He was cared for at home for three months ,
44007021	and when he was put out of his home , the king's daughter adopted him and brought him up as her own son .
44007022	He was taught all the wisdom of the Egyptians and became a great man in words and deeds .
44007023	“ When Moses was forty years old , he decided to find out how his fellow Israelites were being treated .
44007024	He saw one of them being mistreated by an Egyptian , so he went to his help and took revenge on the Egyptian by killing him . (
44007025	He thought that his own people would understand that God was going to use him to set them free , but they did not understand . )
44007026	The next day he saw two Israelites fighting , and he tried to make peace between them . ‘ Listen , men , ’ he said , ‘ you are fellow Israelites ; why are you fighting like this ? ’
44007027	But the one who was mistreating the other pushed Moses aside . ‘ Who made you ruler and judge over us ? ’ he asked .
44007028	‘ Do you want to kill me , just as you killed that Egyptian yesterday ? ’
44007029	When Moses heard this , he fled from Egypt and went to live in the land of Midian . There he had two sons .
44007030	“ After forty years had passed , an angel appeared to Moses in the flames of a burning bush in the desert near Mount Sinai .
44007031	Moses was amazed by what he saw , and went near the bush to get a better look . But he heard the Lord's voice :
44007032	‘ I am the God of your ancestors , the God of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . ’ Moses trembled with fear and dared not look .
44007033	The Lord said to him , ‘ Take your sandals off , for the place where you are standing is holy ground .
44007034	I have seen the cruel suffering of my people in Egypt . I have heard their groans , and I have come down to set them free . Come now ; I will send you to Egypt . ’
44007035	“ Moses is the one who was rejected by the people of Israel . ‘ Who made you ruler and judge over us ? ’ they asked . He is the one whom God sent to rule the people and set them free with the help of the angel who appeared to him in the burning bush .
44007036	He led the people out of Egypt , performing miracles and wonders in Egypt and at the Red Sea and for forty years in the desert .
44007037	Moses is the one who said to the people of Israel , ‘ God will send you a prophet , just as he sent me , and he will be one of your own people . ’
44007038	He is the one who was with the people of Israel assembled in the desert ; he was there with our ancestors and with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai , and he received God's living messages to pass on to us .
44007039	“ But our ancestors refused to obey him ; they pushed him aside and wished that they could go back to Egypt .
44007040	So they said to Aaron , ‘ Make us some gods who will lead us . We do not know what has happened to that man Moses , who brought us out of Egypt . ’
44007041	It was then that they made an idol in the shape of a bull , offered sacrifice to it , and had a feast in honor of what they themselves had made .
44007042	So God turned away from them and gave them over to worship the stars of heaven , as it is written in the book of the prophets : ‘ People of Israel ! It was not to me that you slaughtered and sacrificed animals for forty years in the desert .
44007043	It was the tent of the god Molech that you carried , and the image of Rephan , your star god ; they were idols that you had made to worship . And so I will send you into exile beyond Babylon . ’
44007044	“ Our ancestors had the Tent of God's presence with them in the desert . It had been made as God had told Moses to make it , according to the pattern that Moses had been shown .
44007045	Later on , our ancestors who received the tent from their fathers carried it with them when they went with Joshua and took over the land from the nations that God drove out as they advanced . And it stayed there until the time of David .
44007046	He won God's favor and asked God to allow him to provide a dwelling place for the God of Jacob .
44007047	But it was Solomon who built him a house .
44007048	“ But the Most High God does not live in houses built by human hands ; as the prophet says ,
44007049	‘ Heaven is my throne , says the Lord , and the earth is my footstool . What kind of house would you build for me ? Where is the place for me to live in ?
44007050	Did not I myself make all these things ? ’
44007051	“ How stubborn you are ! ” Stephen went on to say . “ How heathen your hearts , how deaf you are to God's message ! You are just like your ancestors : you too have always resisted the Holy Spirit !
44007052	Was there any prophet that your ancestors did not persecute ? They killed God's messengers , who long ago announced the coming of his righteous Servant . And now you have betrayed and murdered him .
44007053	You are the ones who received God's law , that was handed down by angels—yet you have not obeyed it ! ”
44007054	As the members of the Council listened to Stephen , they became furious and ground their teeth at him in anger .
44007055	But Stephen , full of the Holy Spirit , looked up to heaven and saw God's glory and Jesus standing at the right side of God .
44007056	“ Look ! ” he said . “ I see heaven opened and the Son of Man standing at the right side of God ! ”
44007057	With a loud cry the Council members covered their ears with their hands . Then they all rushed at him at once ,
44007058	threw him out of the city , and stoned him . The witnesses left their cloaks in the care of a young man named Saul .
44007059	They kept on stoning Stephen as he called out to the Lord , “ Lord Jesus , receive my spirit ! ”
44007060	He knelt down and cried out in a loud voice , “ Lord ! Do not remember this sin against them ! ” He said this and died .
44008001	And Saul approved of his murder . That very day the church in Jerusalem began to suffer cruel persecution . All the believers , except the apostles , were scattered throughout the provinces of Judea and Samaria .
44008002	Some devout men buried Stephen , mourning for him with loud cries .
44008003	But Saul tried to destroy the church ; going from house to house , he dragged out the believers , both men and women , and threw them into jail .
44008004	The believers who were scattered went everywhere , preaching the message .
44008005	Philip went to the principal city in Samaria and preached the Messiah to the people there .
44008006	The crowds paid close attention to what Philip said , as they listened to him and saw the miracles that he performed .
44008007	Evil spirits came out from many people with a loud cry , and many paralyzed and lame people were healed .
44008008	So there was great joy in that city .
44008009	A man named Simon lived there , who for some time had astounded the Samaritans with his magic . He claimed that he was someone great ,
44008010	and everyone in the city , from all classes of society , paid close attention to him . “ He is that power of God known as ‘ The Great Power , ’ ” they said .
44008011	They paid this attention to him because for such a long time he had astonished them with his magic .
44008012	But when they believed Philip's message about the good news of the Kingdom of God and about Jesus Christ , they were baptized , both men and women .
44008013	Simon himself also believed ; and after being baptized , he stayed close to Philip and was astounded when he saw the great wonders and miracles that were being performed .
44008014	The apostles in Jerusalem heard that the people of Samaria had received the word of God , so they sent Peter and John to them .
44008015	When they arrived , they prayed for the believers that they might receive the Holy Spirit .
44008016	For the Holy Spirit had not yet come down on any of them ; they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus .
44008017	Then Peter and John placed their hands on them , and they received the Holy Spirit .
44008018	Simon saw that the Spirit had been given to the believers when the apostles placed their hands on them . So he offered money to Peter and John ,
44008019	and said , “ Give this power to me too , so that anyone I place my hands on will receive the Holy Spirit . ”
44008020	But Peter answered him , “ May you and your money go to hell , for thinking that you can buy God's gift with money !
44008021	You have no part or share in our work , because your heart is not right in God's sight .
44008022	Repent , then , of this evil plan of yours , and pray to the Lord that he will forgive you for thinking such a thing as this .
44008023	For I see that you are full of bitter envy and are a prisoner of sin . ”
44008024	Simon said to Peter and John , “ Please pray to the Lord for me , so that none of these things you spoke of will happen to me . ”
44008025	After they had given their testimony and proclaimed the Lord's message , Peter and John went back to Jerusalem . On their way they preached the Good News in many villages of Samaria .
44008026	An angel of the Lord said to Philip , “ Get ready and go south to the road that goes from Jerusalem to Gaza . ” ( This road is not used nowadays . )
44008029	The Holy Spirit said to Philip , “ Go over to that carriage and stay close to it . ”
44008030	Philip ran over and heard him reading from the book of the prophet Isaiah . He asked him , “ Do you understand what you are reading ? ”
44008031	The official replied , “ How can I understand unless someone explains it to me ? ” And he invited Philip to climb up and sit in the carriage with him .
44008032	The passage of scripture which he was reading was this : “ He was like a sheep that is taken to be slaughtered , like a lamb that makes no sound when its wool is cut off . He did not say a word .
44008033	He was humiliated , and justice was denied him . No one will be able to tell about his descendants , because his life on earth has come to an end . ”
44008034	The official asked Philip , “ Tell me , of whom is the prophet saying this ? Of himself or of someone else ? ”
44008035	Then Philip began to speak ; starting from this passage of scripture , he told him the Good News about Jesus .
44008036	As they traveled down the road , they came to a place where there was some water , and the official said , “ Here is some water . What is to keep me from being baptized ? ”
44008038	The official ordered the carriage to stop , and both Philip and the official went down into the water , and Philip baptized him .
44008039	When they came up out of the water , the Spirit of the Lord took Philip away . The official did not see him again , but continued on his way , full of joy .
44008040	Philip found himself in Azotus ; he went on to Caesarea , and on the way he preached the Good News in every town .
44009001	In the meantime Saul kept up his violent threats of murder against the followers of the Lord . He went to the High Priest
44009002	and asked for letters of introduction to the synagogues in Damascus , so that if he should find there any followers of the Way of the Lord , he would be able to arrest them , both men and women , and bring them back to Jerusalem .
44009003	As Saul was coming near the city of Damascus , suddenly a light from the sky flashed around him .
44009004	He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him , “ Saul , Saul ! Why do you persecute me ? ”
44009005	“ Who are you , Lord ? ” he asked . “ I am Jesus , whom you persecute , ” the voice said .
44009006	“ But get up and go into the city , where you will be told what you must do . ”
44009007	The men who were traveling with Saul had stopped , not saying a word ; they heard the voice but could not see anyone .
44009008	Saul got up from the ground and opened his eyes , but could not see a thing . So they took him by the hand and led him into Damascus .
44009009	For three days he was not able to see , and during that time he did not eat or drink anything .
44009010	There was a believer in Damascus named Ananias . He had a vision , in which the Lord said to him , “ Ananias ! ” “ Here I am , Lord , ” he answered .
44009011	The Lord said to him , “ Get ready and go to Straight Street , and at the house of Judas ask for a man from Tarsus named Saul . He is praying ,
44009012	and in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias come in and place his hands on him so that he might see again . ”
44009013	Ananias answered , “ Lord , many people have told me about this man and about all the terrible things he has done to your people in Jerusalem .
44009014	And he has come to Damascus with authority from the chief priests to arrest all who worship you . ”
44009015	The Lord said to him , “ Go , because I have chosen him to serve me , to make my name known to Gentiles and kings and to the people of Israel .
44009016	And I myself will show him all that he must suffer for my sake . ”
44009017	So Ananias went , entered the house where Saul was , and placed his hands on him . “ Brother Saul , ” he said , “ the Lord has sent me—Jesus himself , who appeared to you on the road as you were coming here . He sent me so that you might see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit . ”
44009018	At once something like fish scales fell from Saul's eyes , and he was able to see again . He stood up and was baptized ;
44009019	and after he had eaten , his strength came back . Saul stayed for a few days with the believers in Damascus .
44009020	He went straight to the synagogues and began to preach that Jesus was the Son of God .
44009021	All who heard him were amazed and asked , “ Isn't he the one who in Jerusalem was killing those who worship that man Jesus ? And didn't he come here for the very purpose of arresting those people and taking them back to the chief priests ? ”
44009022	But Saul's preaching became even more powerful , and his proofs that Jesus was the Messiah were so convincing that the Jews who lived in Damascus could not answer him .
44009023	After many days had gone by , the Jews met together and made plans to kill Saul ,
44009024	but he was told of their plan . Day and night they watched the city gates in order to kill him .
44009025	But one night Saul's followers took him and let him down through an opening in the wall , lowering him in a basket .
44009026	Saul went to Jerusalem and tried to join the disciples . But they would not believe that he was a disciple , and they were all afraid of him .
44009027	Then Barnabas came to his help and took him to the apostles . He explained to them how Saul had seen the Lord on the road and that the Lord had spoken to him . He also told them how boldly Saul had preached in the name of Jesus in Damascus .
44009028	And so Saul stayed with them and went all over Jerusalem , preaching boldly in the name of the Lord .
44009029	He also talked and disputed with the Greek-speaking Jews , but they tried to kill him .
44009030	When the believers found out about this , they took Saul to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus .
44009031	And so it was that the church throughout Judea , Galilee , and Samaria had a time of peace . Through the help of the Holy Spirit it was strengthened and grew in numbers , as it lived in reverence for the Lord .
44009032	Peter traveled everywhere , and on one occasion he went to visit God's people who lived in Lydda .
44009033	There he met a man named Aeneas , who was paralyzed and had not been able to get out of bed for eight years .
44009034	“ Aeneas , ” Peter said to him , “ Jesus Christ makes you well . Get up and make your bed . ” At once Aeneas got up .
44009035	All the people living in Lydda and Sharon saw him , and they turned to the Lord .
44009036	In Joppa there was a woman named Tabitha , who was a believer . ( Her name in Greek is Dorcas , meaning “ a deer . ” ) She spent all her time doing good and helping the poor .
44009037	At that time she got sick and died . Her body was washed and laid in a room upstairs .
44009038	Joppa was not very far from Lydda , and when the believers in Joppa heard that Peter was in Lydda , they sent two men to him with the message , “ Please hurry and come to us . ”
44009039	So Peter got ready and went with them . When he arrived , he was taken to the room upstairs , where all the widows crowded around him , crying and showing him all the shirts and coats that Dorcas had made while she was alive .
44009040	Peter put them all out of the room , and knelt down and prayed ; then he turned to the body and said , “ Tabitha , get up ! ” She opened her eyes , and when she saw Peter , she sat up .
44009041	Peter reached over and helped her get up . Then he called all the believers , including the widows , and presented her alive to them .
44009042	The news about this spread all over Joppa , and many people believed in the Lord .
44009043	Peter stayed on in Joppa for many days with a tanner of leather named Simon .
44010001	There was a man in Caesarea named Cornelius , who was a captain in the Roman army regiment called “ The Italian Regiment . ”
44010002	He was a religious man ; he and his whole family worshiped God . He also did much to help the Jewish poor people and was constantly praying to God .
44010003	It was about three o'clock one afternoon when he had a vision , in which he clearly saw an angel of God come in and say to him , “ Cornelius ! ”
44010004	He stared at the angel in fear and said , “ What is it , sir ? ” The angel answered , “ God is pleased with your prayers and works of charity , and is ready to answer you .
44010005	And now send some men to Joppa for a certain man whose full name is Simon Peter .
44010006	He is a guest in the home of a tanner of leather named Simon , who lives by the sea . ”
44010007	Then the angel went away , and Cornelius called two of his house servants and a soldier , a religious man who was one of his personal attendants .
44010008	He told them what had happened and sent them off to Joppa .
44010009	The next day , as they were on their way and coming near Joppa , Peter went up on the roof of the house about noon in order to pray .
44010010	He became hungry and wanted something to eat ; while the food was being prepared , he had a vision .
44010011	He saw heaven opened and something coming down that looked like a large sheet being lowered by its four corners to the earth .
44010012	In it were all kinds of animals , reptiles , and wild birds .
44010013	A voice said to him , “ Get up , Peter ; kill and eat ! ”
44010014	But Peter said , “ Certainly not , Lord ! I have never eaten anything ritually unclean or defiled . ”
44010015	The voice spoke to him again , “ Do not consider anything unclean that God has declared clean . ”
44010016	This happened three times , and then the thing was taken back up into heaven .
44010017	While Peter was wondering about the meaning of this vision , the men sent by Cornelius had learned where Simon's house was , and they were now standing in front of the gate .
44010018	They called out and asked , “ Is there a guest here by the name of Simon Peter ? ”
44010019	Peter was still trying to understand what the vision meant , when the Spirit said , “ Listen ! Three men are here looking for you .
44010020	So get ready and go down , and do not hesitate to go with them , for I have sent them . ”
44010021	So Peter went down and said to the men , “ I am the man you are looking for . Why have you come ? ”
44010022	“ Captain Cornelius sent us , ” they answered . “ He is a good man who worships God and is highly respected by all the Jewish people . An angel of God told him to invite you to his house , so that he could hear what you have to say . ”
44010023	Peter invited the men in and had them spend the night there . The next day he got ready and went with them ; and some of the believers from Joppa went along with him .
44010024	The following day he arrived in Caesarea , where Cornelius was waiting for him , together with relatives and close friends that he had invited .
44010025	As Peter was about to go in , Cornelius met him , fell at his feet , and bowed down before him .
44010026	But Peter made him rise . “ Stand up , ” he said , “ I myself am only a man . ”
44010027	Peter kept on talking to Cornelius as he went into the house , where he found many people gathered .
44010028	He said to them , “ You yourselves know very well that a Jew is not allowed by his religion to visit or associate with Gentiles . But God has shown me that I must not consider any person ritually unclean or defiled .
44010029	And so when you sent for me , I came without any objection . I ask you , then , why did you send for me ? ”
44010030	Cornelius said , “ It was about this time three days ago that I was praying in my house at three o'clock in the afternoon . Suddenly a man dressed in shining clothes stood in front of me
44010031	and said : ‘ Cornelius ! God has heard your prayer and has taken notice of your works of charity .
44010032	Send someone to Joppa for a man whose full name is Simon Peter . He is a guest in the home of Simon the tanner of leather , who lives by the sea . ’
44010033	And so I sent for you at once , and you have been good enough to come . Now we are all here in the presence of God , waiting to hear anything that the Lord has instructed you to say . ”
44010034	Peter began to speak : “ I now realize that it is true that God treats everyone on the same basis .
44010035	Those who fear him and do what is right are acceptable to him , no matter what race they belong to .
44010036	You know the message he sent to the people of Israel , proclaiming the Good News of peace through Jesus Christ , who is Lord of all .
44010037	You know of the great event that took place throughout the land of Israel , beginning in Galilee after John preached his message of baptism .
44010038	You know about Jesus of Nazareth and how God poured out on him the Holy Spirit and power . He went everywhere , doing good and healing all who were under the power of the Devil , for God was with him .
44010039	We are witnesses of everything that he did in the land of Israel and in Jerusalem . Then they put him to death by nailing him to a cross .
44010040	But God raised him from death three days later and caused him to appear ,
44010041	not to everyone , but only to the witnesses that God had already chosen , that is , to us who ate and drank with him after he rose from death .
44010042	And he commanded us to preach the gospel to the people and to testify that he is the one whom God has appointed judge of the living and the dead .
44010043	All the prophets spoke about him , saying that all who believe in him will have their sins forgiven through the power of his name . ”
44010044	While Peter was still speaking , the Holy Spirit came down on all those who were listening to his message .
44010045	The Jewish believers who had come from Joppa with Peter were amazed that God had poured out his gift of the Holy Spirit on the Gentiles also .
44010046	For they heard them speaking in strange tongues and praising God's greatness . Peter spoke up :
44010047	“ These people have received the Holy Spirit , just as we also did . Can anyone , then , stop them from being baptized with water ? ”
44010048	So he ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ . Then they asked him to stay with them for a few days .
44011001	The apostles and the other believers throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God .
44011002	When Peter went to Jerusalem , those who were in favor of circumcising Gentiles criticized him , saying ,
44011003	“ You were a guest in the home of uncircumcised Gentiles , and you even ate with them ! ”
44011004	So Peter gave them a complete account of what had happened from the very beginning :
44011005	“ While I was praying in the city of Joppa , I had a vision . I saw something coming down that looked like a large sheet being lowered by its four corners from heaven , and it stopped next to me .
44011006	I looked closely inside and saw domesticated and wild animals , reptiles , and wild birds .
44011007	Then I heard a voice saying to me , ‘ Get up , Peter ; kill and eat ! ’
44011008	But I said , ‘ Certainly not , Lord ! No ritually unclean or defiled food has ever entered my mouth . ’
44011009	The voice spoke again from heaven , ‘ Do not consider anything unclean that God has declared clean . ’
44011010	This happened three times , and finally the whole thing was drawn back up into heaven .
44011011	At that very moment three men who had been sent to me from Caesarea arrived at the house where I was staying .
44011012	The Spirit told me to go with them without hesitation . These six fellow believers from Joppa accompanied me to Caesarea , and we all went into the house of Cornelius .
44011013	He told us how he had seen an angel standing in his house , who said to him , ‘ Send someone to Joppa for a man whose full name is Simon Peter .
44011014	He will speak words to you by which you and all your family will be saved . ’
44011015	And when I began to speak , the Holy Spirit came down on them just as on us at the beginning .
44011016	Then I remembered what the Lord had said : ‘ John baptized with water , but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit . ’
44011017	It is clear that God gave those Gentiles the same gift that he gave us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ ; who was I , then , to try to stop God ! ”
44011018	When they heard this , they stopped their criticism and praised God , saying , “ Then God has given to the Gentiles also the opportunity to repent and live ! ”
44011019	Some of the believers who were scattered by the persecution which took place when Stephen was killed went as far as Phoenicia , Cyprus , and Antioch , telling the message to Jews only .
44011020	But other believers , who were from Cyprus and Cyrene , went to Antioch and proclaimed the message to Gentiles also , telling them the Good News about the Lord Jesus .
44011021	The Lord's power was with them , and a great number of people believed and turned to the Lord .
44011022	The news about this reached the church in Jerusalem , so they sent Barnabas to Antioch .
44011023	When he arrived and saw how God had blessed the people , he was glad and urged them all to be faithful and true to the Lord with all their hearts .
44011024	Barnabas was a good man , full of the Holy Spirit and faith , and many people were brought to the Lord .
44011025	Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul .
44011026	When he found him , he took him to Antioch , and for a whole year the two met with the people of the church and taught a large group . It was at Antioch that the believers were first called Christians .
44011027	About that time some prophets went from Jerusalem to Antioch .
44011028	One of them , named Agabus , stood up and by the power of the Spirit predicted that a severe famine was about to come over all the earth . ( It came when Claudius was emperor . )
44011029	The disciples decided that they each would send as much as they could to help their fellow believers who lived in Judea .
44011030	They did this , then , and sent the money to the church elders by Barnabas and Saul .
44012001	About this time King Herod began to persecute some members of the church .
44012002	He had James , the brother of John , put to death by the sword .
44012003	When he saw that this pleased the Jews , he went ahead and had Peter arrested . ( This happened during the time of the Festival of Unleavened Bread . )
44012004	After his arrest Peter was put in jail , where he was handed over to be guarded by four groups of four soldiers each . Herod planned to put him on trial in public after Passover .
44012005	So Peter was kept in jail , but the people of the church were praying earnestly to God for him .
44012006	The night before Herod was going to bring him out to the people , Peter was sleeping between two guards . He was tied with two chains , and there were guards on duty at the prison gate .
44012007	Suddenly an angel of the Lord stood there , and a light shone in the cell . The angel shook Peter by the shoulder , woke him up , and said , “ Hurry ! Get up ! ” At once the chains fell off Peter's hands .
44012008	Then the angel said , “ Tighten your belt and put on your sandals . ” Peter did so , and the angel said , “ Put your cloak around you and come with me . ”
44012009	Peter followed him out of the prison , not knowing , however , if what the angel was doing was real ; he thought he was seeing a vision .
44012010	They passed by the first guard station and then the second , and came at last to the iron gate that opens into the city . The gate opened for them by itself , and they went out . They walked down a street , and suddenly the angel left Peter .
44012011	Then Peter realized what had happened to him , and said , “ Now I know that it is really true ! The Lord sent his angel to rescue me from Herod's power and from everything the Jewish people expected to happen . ”
44012012	Aware of his situation , he went to the home of Mary , the mother of John Mark , where many people had gathered and were praying .
44012013	Peter knocked at the outside door , and a servant named Rhoda came to answer it .
44012014	She recognized Peter's voice and was so happy that she ran back in without opening the door , and announced that Peter was standing outside .
44012015	“ You are crazy ! ” they told her . But she insisted that it was true . So they answered , “ It is his angel . ”
44012016	Meanwhile Peter kept on knocking . At last they opened the door , and when they saw him , they were amazed .
44012017	He motioned with his hand for them to be quiet , and he explained to them how the Lord had brought him out of prison . “ Tell this to James and the rest of the believers , ” he said ; then he left and went somewhere else .
44012018	When morning came , there was a tremendous confusion among the guards—what had happened to Peter ?
44012019	Herod gave orders to search for him , but they could not find him . So he had the guards questioned and ordered them put to death . After this , Herod left Judea and spent some time in Caesarea .
44012020	Herod was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon , so they went in a group to see him . First they convinced Blastus , the man in charge of the palace , that he should help them . Then they went to Herod and asked him for peace , because their country got its food supplies from the king's country .
44012021	On a chosen day Herod put on his royal robes , sat on his throne , and made a speech to the people .
44012022	“ It isn't a man speaking , but a god ! ” they shouted .
44012023	At once the angel of the Lord struck Herod down , because he did not give honor to God . He was eaten by worms and died .
44012024	Meanwhile the word of God continued to spread and grow .
44012025	Barnabas and Saul finished their mission and returned from Jerusalem , taking John Mark with them .
44013001	In the church at Antioch there were some prophets and teachers : Barnabas , Simeon ( called the Black ) , Lucius ( from Cyrene ) , Manaen ( who had been brought up with Governor Herod ) , and Saul .
44013002	While they were serving the Lord and fasting , the Holy Spirit said to them , “ Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul , to do the work to which I have called them . ”
44013003	They fasted and prayed , placed their hands on them , and sent them off .
44013004	Having been sent by the Holy Spirit , Barnabas and Saul went to Seleucia and sailed from there to the island of Cyprus .
44013005	When they arrived at Salamis , they preached the word of God in the synagogues . They had John Mark with them to help in the work .
44013006	They went all the way across the island to Paphos , where they met a certain magician named Bar-Jesus , a Jew who claimed to be a prophet .
44013007	He was a friend of the governor of the island , Sergius Paulus , who was an intelligent man . The governor called Barnabas and Saul before him because he wanted to hear the word of God .
44013008	But they were opposed by the magician Elymas ( that is his name in Greek ) , who tried to turn the governor away from the faith .
44013009	Then Saul—also known as Paul—was filled with the Holy Spirit ; he looked straight at the magician
44013010	and said , “ You son of the Devil ! You are the enemy of everything that is good . You are full of all kinds of evil tricks , and you always keep trying to turn the Lord's truths into lies !
44013011	The Lord's hand will come down on you now ; you will be blind and will not see the light of day for a time . ” At once Elymas felt a dark mist cover his eyes , and he walked around trying to find someone to lead him by the hand .
44013012	When the governor saw what had happened , he believed ; for he was greatly amazed at the teaching about the Lord .
44013013	Paul and his companions sailed from Paphos and came to Perga , a city in Pamphylia , where John Mark left them and went back to Jerusalem .
44013014	They went on from Perga and arrived in Antioch in Pisidia , and on the Sabbath they went into the synagogue and sat down .
44013015	After the reading from the Law of Moses and from the writings of the prophets , the officials of the synagogue sent them a message : “ Friends , we want you to speak to the people if you have a message of encouragement for them . ”
44013016	Paul stood up , motioned with his hand , and began to speak : “ Fellow Israelites and all Gentiles here who worship God : hear me !
44013017	The God of the people of Israel chose our ancestors and made the people a great nation during the time they lived as foreigners in Egypt . God brought them out of Egypt by his great power ,
44013018	and for forty years he endured them in the desert .
44013019	He destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan and made his people the owners of the land .
44013020	All of this took about 450 years . “ After this he gave them judges until the time of the prophet Samuel .
44013021	And when they asked for a king , God gave them Saul son of Kish from the tribe of Benjamin , to be their king for forty years .
44013022	After removing him , God made David their king . This is what God said about him : ‘ I have found that David son of Jesse is the kind of man I like , a man who will do all I want him to do . ’
44013023	It was Jesus , a descendant of David , whom God made the Savior of the people of Israel , as he had promised .
44013024	Before Jesus began his work , John preached to all the people of Israel that they should turn from their sins and be baptized .
44013025	And as John was about to finish his mission , he said to the people , ‘ Who do you think I am ? I am not the one you are waiting for . But listen ! He is coming after me , and I am not good enough to take his sandals off his feet . ’
44013026	“ My fellow Israelites , descendants of Abraham , and all Gentiles here who worship God : it is to us that this message of salvation has been sent !
44013027	For the people who live in Jerusalem and their leaders did not know that he is the Savior , nor did they understand the words of the prophets that are read every Sabbath . Yet they made the prophets' words come true by condemning Jesus .
44013028	And even though they could find no reason to pass the death sentence on him , they asked Pilate to have him put to death .
44013029	And after they had done everything that the Scriptures say about him , they took him down from the cross and placed him in a tomb .
44013030	But God raised him from death ,
44013031	and for many days he appeared to those who had traveled with him from Galilee to Jerusalem . They are now witnesses for him to the people of Israel .
44013041	‘ Look , you scoffers ! Be astonished and die ! For what I am doing today is something that you will not believe , even when someone explains it to you ! ’ ”
44013042	As Paul and Barnabas were leaving the synagogue , the people invited them to come back the next Sabbath and tell them more about these things .
44013043	After the people had left the meeting , Paul and Barnabas were followed by many Jews and by many Gentiles who had been converted to Judaism . The apostles spoke to them and encouraged them to keep on living in the grace of God .
44013044	The next Sabbath nearly everyone in the town came to hear the word of the Lord .
44013045	When the Jews saw the crowds , they were filled with jealousy ; they disputed what Paul was saying and insulted him .
44013046	But Paul and Barnabas spoke out even more boldly : “ It was necessary that the word of God should be spoken first to you . But since you reject it and do not consider yourselves worthy of eternal life , we will leave you and go to the Gentiles .
44013047	For this is the commandment that the Lord has given us : ‘ I have made you a light for the Gentiles , so that all the world may be saved . ’ ”
44013048	When the Gentiles heard this , they were glad and praised the Lord's message ; and those who had been chosen for eternal life became believers .
44013049	The word of the Lord spread everywhere in that region .
44013050	But the Jews stirred up the leading men of the city and the Gentile women of high social standing who worshiped God . They started a persecution against Paul and Barnabas and threw them out of their region .
44013051	The apostles shook the dust off their feet in protest against them and went on to Iconium .
44013052	The believers in Antioch were full of joy and the Holy Spirit .
44014001	The same thing happened in Iconium : Paul and Barnabas went to the synagogue and spoke in such a way that a great number of Jews and Gentiles became believers .
44014002	But the Jews who would not believe stirred up the Gentiles and turned them against the believers .
44014003	The apostles stayed there for a long time , speaking boldly about the Lord , who proved that their message about his grace was true by giving them the power to perform miracles and wonders .
44014004	The people of the city were divided : some were for the Jews , others for the apostles .
44014005	Then some Gentiles and Jews , together with their leaders , decided to mistreat the apostles and stone them .
44014006	When the apostles learned about it , they fled to the cities of Lystra and Derbe in Lycaonia and to the surrounding territory .
44014007	There they preached the Good News .
44014008	In Lystra there was a crippled man who had been lame from birth and had never been able to walk .
44014009	He sat there and listened to Paul's words . Paul saw that he believed and could be healed , so he looked straight at him
44014010	and said in a loud voice , “ Stand up straight on your feet ! ” The man jumped up and started walking around .
44014011	When the crowds saw what Paul had done , they started shouting in their own Lycaonian language , “ The gods have become like men and have come down to us ! ”
44014012	They gave Barnabas the name Zeus , and Paul the name Hermes , because he was the chief speaker .
44014013	The priest of the god Zeus , whose temple stood just outside the town , brought bulls and flowers to the gate , for he and the crowds wanted to offer sacrifice to the apostles .
44014014	When Barnabas and Paul heard what they were about to do , they tore their clothes and ran into the middle of the crowd , shouting ,
44014015	“ Why are you doing this ? We ourselves are only human beings like you ! We are here to announce the Good News , to turn you away from these worthless things to the living God , who made heaven , earth , sea , and all that is in them .
44014016	In the past he allowed all people to go their own way .
44014017	But he has always given evidence of his existence by the good things he does : he gives you rain from heaven and crops at the right times ; he gives you food and fills your hearts with happiness . ”
44014018	Even with these words the apostles could hardly keep the crowd from offering a sacrifice to them .
44014019	Some Jews came from Antioch in Pisidia and from Iconium ; they won the crowds over to their side , stoned Paul and dragged him out of the town , thinking that he was dead .
44014020	But when the believers gathered around him , he got up and went back into the town . The next day he and Barnabas went to Derbe .
44014021	Paul and Barnabas preached the Good News in Derbe and won many disciples . Then they went back to Lystra , to Iconium , and on to Antioch in Pisidia .
44014022	They strengthened the believers and encouraged them to remain true to the faith . “ We must pass through many troubles to enter the Kingdom of God , ” they taught .
44014023	In each church they appointed elders , and with prayers and fasting they commended them to the Lord , in whom they had put their trust .
44014024	After going through the territory of Pisidia , they came to Pamphylia .
44014025	There they preached the message in Perga and then went to Attalia ,
44014026	and from there they sailed back to Antioch , the place where they had been commended to the care of God's grace for the work they had now completed .
44014027	When they arrived in Antioch , they gathered the people of the church together and told them about all that God had done with them and how he had opened the way for the Gentiles to believe .
44014028	And they stayed a long time there with the believers .
44015001	Some men came from Judea to Antioch and started teaching the believers , “ You cannot be saved unless you are circumcised as the Law of Moses requires . ”
44015002	Paul and Barnabas got into a fierce argument with them about this , so it was decided that Paul and Barnabas and some of the others in Antioch should go to Jerusalem and see the apostles and elders about this matter .
44015003	They were sent on their way by the church ; and as they went through Phoenicia and Samaria , they reported how the Gentiles had turned to God ; this news brought great joy to all the believers .
44015004	When they arrived in Jerusalem , they were welcomed by the church , the apostles , and the elders , to whom they told all that God had done through them .
44015005	But some of the believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees stood up and said , “ The Gentiles must be circumcised and told to obey the Law of Moses . ”
44015006	The apostles and the elders met together to consider this question .
44015007	After a long debate Peter stood up and said , “ My friends , you know that a long time ago God chose me from among you to preach the Good News to the Gentiles , so that they could hear and believe .
44015008	And God , who knows the thoughts of everyone , showed his approval of the Gentiles by giving the Holy Spirit to them , just as he had to us .
44015009	He made no difference between us and them ; he forgave their sins because they believed .
44015010	So then , why do you now want to put God to the test by laying a load on the backs of the believers which neither our ancestors nor we ourselves were able to carry ?
44015011	No ! We believe and are saved by the grace of the Lord Jesus , just as they are . ”
44015012	The whole group was silent as they heard Barnabas and Paul report all the miracles and wonders that God had performed through them among the Gentiles .
44015013	When they had finished speaking , James spoke up : “ Listen to me , my friends !
44015014	Simon has just explained how God first showed his care for the Gentiles by taking from among them a people to belong to him .
44015015	The words of the prophets agree completely with this . As the scripture says ,
44015016	‘ After this I will return , says the Lord , and restore the kingdom of David . I will rebuild its ruins and make it strong again .
44015017	And so all the rest of the human race will come to me , all the Gentiles whom I have called to be my own .
44015018	So says the Lord , who made this known long ago . ’
44015019	“ It is my opinion , ” James went on , “ that we should not trouble the Gentiles who are turning to God .
44015020	Instead , we should write a letter telling them not to eat any food that is ritually unclean because it has been offered to idols ; to keep themselves from sexual immorality ; and not to eat any animal that has been strangled , or any blood .
44015021	For the Law of Moses has been read for a very long time in the synagogues every Sabbath , and his words are preached in every town . ”
44015022	Then the apostles and the elders , together with the whole church , decided to choose some men from the group and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas . They chose two men who were highly respected by the believers , Judas , called Barsabbas , and Silas ,
44015023	and they sent the following letter by them :
44015030	The messengers were sent off and went to Antioch , where they gathered the whole group of believers and gave them the letter .
44015031	When the people read it , they were filled with joy by the message of encouragement .
44015032	Judas and Silas , who were themselves prophets , spoke a long time with them , giving them courage and strength .
44015033	After spending some time there , they were sent off in peace by the believers and went back to those who had sent them .
44015035	Paul and Barnabas spent some time in Antioch , and together with many others they taught and preached the word of the Lord .
44015036	Some time later Paul said to Barnabas , “ Let us go back and visit the believers in every town where we preached the word of the Lord , and let us find out how they are getting along . ”
44015037	Barnabas wanted to take John Mark with them ,
44015038	but Paul did not think it was right to take him , because he had not stayed with them to the end of their mission , but had turned back and left them in Pamphylia .
44015039	There was a sharp argument , and they separated : Barnabas took Mark and sailed off for Cyprus ,
44015040	while Paul chose Silas and left , commended by the believers to the care of the Lord's grace .
44015041	He went through Syria and Cilicia , strengthening the churches .
44016001	Paul traveled on to Derbe and Lystra , where a Christian named Timothy lived . His mother , who was also a Christian , was Jewish , but his father was a Greek .
44016002	All the believers in Lystra and Iconium spoke well of Timothy .
44016003	Paul wanted to take Timothy along with him , so he circumcised him . He did so because all the Jews who lived in those places knew that Timothy's father was Greek .
44016004	As they went through the towns , they delivered to the believers the rules decided upon by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem , and they told them to obey those rules .
44016005	So the churches were made stronger in the faith and grew in numbers every day .
44016006	They traveled through the region of Phrygia and Galatia because the Holy Spirit did not let them preach the message in the province of Asia .
44016007	When they reached the border of Mysia , they tried to go into the province of Bithynia , but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them .
44016008	So they traveled right on through Mysia and went to Troas .
44016009	That night Paul had a vision in which he saw a Macedonian standing and begging him , “ Come over to Macedonia and help us ! ”
44016010	As soon as Paul had this vision , we got ready to leave for Macedonia , because we decided that God had called us to preach the Good News to the people there .
44016011	We left by ship from Troas and sailed straight across to Samothrace , and the next day to Neapolis .
44016012	From there we went inland to Philippi , a city of the first district of Macedonia ; it is also a Roman colony . We spent several days there .
44016013	On the Sabbath we went out of the city to the riverside , where we thought there would be a place where Jews gathered for prayer . We sat down and talked to the women who gathered there .
44016014	One of those who heard us was Lydia from Thyatira , who was a dealer in purple cloth . She was a woman who worshiped God , and the Lord opened her mind to pay attention to what Paul was saying .
44016015	After she and the people of her house had been baptized , she invited us , “ Come and stay in my house if you have decided that I am a true believer in the Lord . ” And she persuaded us to go .
44016016	One day as we were going to the place of prayer , we were met by a young servant woman who had an evil spirit that enabled her to predict the future . She earned a lot of money for her owners by telling fortunes .
44016017	She followed Paul and us , shouting , “ These men are servants of the Most High God ! They announce to you how you can be saved ! ”
44016018	She did this for many days , until Paul became so upset that he turned around and said to the spirit , “ In the name of Jesus Christ I order you to come out of her ! ” The spirit went out of her that very moment .
44016019	When her owners realized that their chance of making money was gone , they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them to the authorities in the public square .
44016020	They brought them before the Roman officials and said , “ These men are Jews , and they are causing trouble in our city .
44016021	They are teaching customs that are against our law ; we are Roman citizens , and we cannot accept these customs or practice them . ”
44016022	And the crowd joined in the attack against Paul and Silas . Then the officials tore the clothes off Paul and Silas and ordered them to be whipped .
44016023	After a severe beating , they were thrown into jail , and the jailer was ordered to lock them up tight .
44016024	Upon receiving this order , the jailer threw them into the inner cell and fastened their feet between heavy blocks of wood .
44016025	About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God , and the other prisoners were listening to them .
44016026	Suddenly there was a violent earthquake , which shook the prison to its foundations . At once all the doors opened , and the chains fell off all the prisoners .
44016027	The jailer woke up , and when he saw the prison doors open , he thought that the prisoners had escaped ; so he pulled out his sword and was about to kill himself .
44016028	But Paul shouted at the top of his voice , “ Don't harm yourself We are all here ! ”
44016029	The jailer called for a light , rushed in , and fell trembling at the feet of Paul and Silas .
44016030	Then he led them out and asked , “ Sirs , what must I do to be saved ? ”
44016031	They answered , “ Believe in the Lord Jesus , and you will be saved—you and your family . ”
44016032	Then they preached the word of the Lord to him and to all the others in the house .
44016033	At that very hour of the night the jailer took them and washed their wounds ; and he and all his family were baptized at once .
44016034	Then he took Paul and Silas up into his house and gave them some food to eat . He and his family were filled with joy , because they now believed in God .
44016035	The next morning the Roman authorities sent police officers with the order , “ Let those men go . ”
44016036	So the jailer told Paul , “ The officials have sent an order for you and Silas to be released . You may leave , then , and go in peace . ”
44016037	But Paul said to the police officers , “ We were not found guilty of any crime , yet they whipped us in public—and we are Roman citizens ! Then they threw us in prison . And now they want to send us away secretly ? Not at all ! The Roman officials themselves must come here and let us out . ”
44016038	The police officers reported these words to the Roman officials ; and when they heard that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens , they were afraid .
44016039	So they went and apologized to them ; then they led them out of the prison and asked them to leave the city .
44016040	Paul and Silas left the prison and went to Lydia's house . There they met the believers , spoke words of encouragement to them , and left .
44017001	Paul and Silas traveled on through Amphipolis and Apollonia and came to Thessalonica , where there was a synagogue .
44017002	According to his usual habit Paul went to the synagogue . There during three Sabbaths he held discussions with the people , quoting
44017003	and explaining the Scriptures , and proving from them that the Messiah had to suffer and rise from death . “ This Jesus whom I announce to you , ” Paul said , “ is the Messiah . ”
44017004	Some of them were convinced and joined Paul and Silas ; so did many of the leading women and a large group of Greeks who worshiped God .
44017005	But some Jews were jealous and gathered worthless loafers from the streets and formed a mob . They set the whole city in an uproar and attacked the home of a man named Jason , in an attempt to find Paul and Silas and bring them out to the people .
44017006	But when they did not find them , they dragged Jason and some other believers before the city authorities and shouted , “ These men have caused trouble everywhere ! Now they have come to our city ,
44017007	and Jason has kept them in his house . They are all breaking the laws of the Emperor , saying that there is another king , whose name is Jesus . ”
44017008	With these words they threw the crowd and the city authorities in an uproar .
44017009	The authorities made Jason and the others pay the required amount of money to be released , and then let them go .
44017010	As soon as night came , the believers sent Paul and Silas to Berea . When they arrived , they went to the synagogue .
44017011	The people there were more open-minded than the people in Thessalonica . They listened to the message with great eagerness , and every day they studied the Scriptures to see if what Paul said was really true .
44017012	Many of them believed ; and many Greek women of high social standing and many Greek men also believed .
44017013	But when the Jews in Thessalonica heard that Paul had preached the word of God in Berea also , they came there and started exciting and stirring up the mobs .
44017014	At once the believers sent Paul away to the coast ; but both Silas and Timothy stayed in Berea .
44017015	The men who were taking Paul went with him as far as Athens and then returned to Berea with instructions from Paul that Silas and Timothy should join him as soon as possible .
44017016	While Paul was waiting in Athens for Silas and Timothy , he was greatly upset when he noticed how full of idols the city was .
44017017	So he held discussions in the synagogue with the Jews and with the Gentiles who worshiped God , and also in the public square every day with the people who happened to come by .
44017018	Certain Epicurean and Stoic teachers also debated with him . Some of them asked , “ What is this ignorant show-off trying to say ? ” Others answered , “ He seems to be talking about foreign gods . ” They said this because Paul was preaching about Jesus and the resurrection .
44017019	So they took Paul , brought him before the city council , the Areopagus , and said , “ We would like to know what this new teaching is that you are talking about .
44017020	Some of the things we hear you say sound strange to us , and we would like to know what they mean . ” (
44017021	For all the citizens of Athens and the foreigners who lived there liked to spend all their time telling and hearing the latest new thing . )
44017022	Paul stood up in front of the city council and said , “ I see that in every way you Athenians are very religious .
44017023	For as I walked through your city and looked at the places where you worship , I found an altar on which is written , ‘ To an Unknown God . ’ That which you worship , then , even though you do not know it , is what I now proclaim to you .
44017024	God , who made the world and everything in it , is Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples made by human hands .
44017025	Nor does he need anything that we can supply by working for him , since it is he himself who gives life and breath and everything else to everyone .
44017026	From one human being he created all races of people and made them live throughout the whole earth . He himself fixed beforehand the exact times and the limits of the places where they would live .
44017027	He did this so that they would look for him , and perhaps find him as they felt around for him . Yet God is actually not far from any one of us ;
44017028	as someone has said , ‘ In him we live and move and exist . ’ ‘ We too are his children . ’
44017032	When they heard Paul speak about a raising from death , some of them made fun of him , but others said , “ We want to hear you speak about this again . ”
44017033	And so Paul left the meeting .
44017034	Some men joined him and believed , among whom was Dionysius , a member of the council ; there was also a woman named Damaris , and some other people .
44018001	After this , Paul left Athens and went on to Corinth .
44018002	There he met a Jew named Aquila , born in Pontus , who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla , for Emperor Claudius had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome . Paul went to see them ,
44018003	and stayed and worked with them , because he earned his living by making tents , just as they did .
44018004	He held discussions in the synagogue every Sabbath , trying to convince both Jews and Greeks .
44018005	When Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia , Paul gave his whole time to preaching the message , testifying to the Jews that Jesus is the Messiah .
44018006	When they opposed him and said evil things about him , he protested by shaking the dust from his clothes and saying to them , “ If you are lost , you yourselves must take the blame for it ! I am not responsible . From now on I will go to the Gentiles . ”
44018007	So he left them and went to live in the house of a Gentile named Titius Justus , who worshiped God ; his house was next to the synagogue .
44018008	Crispus , who was the leader of the synagogue , believed in the Lord , together with all his family ; and many other people in Corinth heard the message , believed , and were baptized .
44018009	One night Paul had a vision in which the Lord said to him , “ Do not be afraid , but keep on speaking and do not give up ,
44018010	for I am with you . No one will be able to harm you , for many in this city are my people . ”
44018011	So Paul stayed there for a year and a half , teaching the people the word of God .
44018012	When Gallio was made the Roman governor of Achaia , Jews there got together , seized Paul , and took him into court .
44018013	“ This man , ” they said , “ is trying to persuade people to worship God in a way that is against the law ! ”
44018014	Paul was about to speak when Gallio said to the Jews , “ If this were a matter of some evil crime or wrong that has been committed , it would be reasonable for me to be patient with you Jews .
44018015	But since it is an argument about words and names and your own law , you yourselves must settle it . I will not be the judge of such things ! ”
44018016	And he drove them out of the court .
44018017	They all grabbed Sosthenes , the leader of the synagogue , and beat him in front of the court . But that did not bother Gallio a bit .
44018018	Paul stayed on with the believers in Corinth for many days , then left them and sailed off with Priscilla and Aquila for Syria . Before sailing from Cenchreae he had his head shaved because of a vow he had taken .
44018019	They arrived in Ephesus , where Paul left Priscilla and Aquila . He went into the synagogue and held discussions with the Jews .
44018020	The people asked him to stay longer , but he would not consent .
44018021	Instead , he told them as he left , “ If it is the will of God , I will come back to you . ” And so he sailed from Ephesus .
44018022	When he arrived at Caesarea , he went to Jerusalem and greeted the church , and then went to Antioch .
44018023	After spending some time there , he left and went through the region of Galatia and Phrygia , strengthening all the believers .
44018024	At that time a Jew named Apollos , who had been born in Alexandria , came to Ephesus . He was an eloquent speaker and had a thorough knowledge of the Scriptures .
44018025	He had been instructed in the Way of the Lord , and with great enthusiasm he proclaimed and taught correctly the facts about Jesus . However , he knew only the baptism of John .
44018026	He began to speak boldly in the synagogue . When Priscilla and Aquila heard him , they took him home with them and explained to him more correctly the Way of God .
44018027	Apollos then decided to go to Achaia , so the believers in Ephesus helped him by writing to the believers in Achaia , urging them to welcome him . When he arrived , he was a great help to those who through God's grace had become believers .
44018028	For with his strong arguments he defeated the Jews in public debates by proving from the Scriptures that Jesus is the Messiah .
44019001	While Apollos was in Corinth , Paul traveled through the interior of the province and arrived in Ephesus . There he found some disciples
44019002	and asked them , “ Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you became believers ? ” “ We have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit , ” they answered .
44019003	“ Well , then , what kind of baptism did you receive ? ” Paul asked . “ The baptism of John , ” they answered .
44019004	Paul said , “ The baptism of John was for those who turned from their sins ; and he told the people of Israel to believe in the one who was coming after him—that is , in Jesus . ”
44019005	When they heard this , they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus .
44019006	Paul placed his hands on them , and the Holy Spirit came upon them ; they spoke in strange tongues and also proclaimed God's message .
44019007	They were about twelve men in all .
44019008	Paul went into the synagogue and for three months spoke boldly with the people , holding discussions with them and trying to convince them about the Kingdom of God .
44019009	But some of them were stubborn and would not believe , and before the whole group they said evil things about the Way of the Lord . So Paul left them and took the believers with him , and every day he held discussions in the lecture hall of Tyrannus .
44019010	This went on for two years , so that all the people who lived in the province of Asia , both Jews and Gentiles , heard the word of the Lord .
44019011	God was performing unusual miracles through Paul .
44019012	Even handkerchiefs and aprons he had used were taken to the sick , and their diseases were driven away , and the evil spirits would go out of them .
44019013	Some Jews who traveled around and drove out evil spirits also tried to use the name of the Lord Jesus to do this . They said to the evil spirits , “ I command you in the name of Jesus , whom Paul preaches . ”
44019014	Seven brothers , who were the sons of a Jewish High Priest named Sceva , were doing this .
44019015	But the evil spirit said to them , “ I know Jesus , and I know about Paul ; but you—who are you ? ”
44019016	The man who had the evil spirit in him attacked them with such violence that he overpowered them all . They ran away from his house , wounded and with their clothes torn off .
44019017	All the Jews and Gentiles who lived in Ephesus heard about this ; they were all filled with fear , and the name of the Lord Jesus was given greater honor .
44019018	Many of the believers came , publicly admitting and revealing what they had done .
44019019	Many of those who had practiced magic brought their books together and burned them in public . They added up the price of the books , and the total came to fifty thousand silver coins .
44019020	In this powerful way the word of the Lord kept spreading and growing stronger .
44019021	After these things had happened , Paul made up his mind to travel through Macedonia and Achaia and go on to Jerusalem . “ After I go there , ” he said , “ I must also see Rome . ”
44019022	So he sent Timothy and Erastus , two of his helpers , to Macedonia , while he spent more time in the province of Asia .
44019023	It was at this time that there was serious trouble in Ephesus because of the Way of the Lord .
44019024	A certain silversmith named Demetrius made silver models of the temple of the goddess Artemis , and his business brought a great deal of profit to the workers .
44019025	So he called them all together with others whose work was like theirs and said to them , “ Men , you know that our prosperity comes from this work .
44019026	Now , you can see and hear for yourselves what this fellow Paul is doing . He says that hand-made gods are not gods at all , and he has succeeded in convincing many people , both here in Ephesus and in nearly the whole province of Asia .
44019027	There is the danger , then , that this business of ours will get a bad name . Not only that , but there is also the danger that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will come to mean nothing and that her greatness will be destroyed—the goddess worshiped by everyone in Asia and in all the world ! ”
44019028	As the crowd heard these words , they became furious and started shouting , “ Great is Artemis of Ephesus ! ”
44019029	The uproar spread throughout the whole city . The mob grabbed Gaius and Aristarchus , two Macedonians who were traveling with Paul , and rushed with them to the theater .
44019030	Paul himself wanted to go before the crowd , but the believers would not let him .
44019031	Some of the provincial authorities , who were his friends , also sent him a message begging him not to show himself in the theater .
44019032	Meanwhile the whole meeting was in an uproar : some people were shouting one thing , others were shouting something else , because most of them did not even know why they had come together .
44019033	Some of the people concluded that Alexander was responsible , since the Jews made him go up to the front . Then Alexander motioned with his hand for the people to be silent , and he tried to make a speech of defense .
44019034	But when they recognized that he was a Jew , they all shouted together the same thing for two hours : “ Great is Artemis of Ephesus ! ”
44019035	At last the city clerk was able to calm the crowd . “ Fellow Ephesians ! ” he said . “ Everyone knows that the city of Ephesus is the keeper of the temple of the great Artemis and of the sacred stone that fell down from heaven .
44019036	Nobody can deny these things . So then , you must calm down and not do anything reckless .
44019037	You have brought these men here even though they have not robbed temples or said evil things about our goddess .
44019038	If Demetrius and his workers have an accusation against anyone , we have the authorities and the regular days for court ; charges can be made there .
44019039	But if there is something more that you want , it will have to be settled in a legal meeting of citizens .
44019040	For after what has happened today , there is the danger that we will be accused of a riot . There is no excuse for all this uproar , and we would not be able to give a good reason for it . ”
44019041	After saying this , he dismissed the meeting .
44020001	After the uproar died down , Paul called together the believers and with words of encouragement said good-bye to them . Then he left and went on to Macedonia .
44020002	He went through those regions and encouraged the people with many messages . Then he came to Achaia ,
44020003	where he stayed three months . He was getting ready to go to Syria when he discovered that there were Jews plotting against him ; so he decided to go back through Macedonia .
44020004	Sopater son of Pyrrhus , from Berea , went with him ; so did Aristarchus and Secundus , from Thessalonica ; Gaius , from Derbe ; Tychicus and Trophimus , from the province of Asia ; and Timothy .
44020005	They went ahead and waited for us in Troas .
44020006	We sailed from Philippi after the Festival of Unleavened Bread , and five days later we joined them in Troas , where we spent a week .
44020007	On Saturday evening we gathered together for the fellowship meal . Paul spoke to the people and kept on speaking until midnight , since he was going to leave the next day .
44020008	Many lamps were burning in the upstairs room where we were meeting .
44020009	A young man named Eutychus was sitting in the window , and as Paul kept on talking , Eutychus got sleepier and sleepier , until he finally went sound asleep and fell from the third story to the ground . When they picked him up , he was dead .
44020010	But Paul went down and threw himself on him and hugged him . “ Don't worry , ” he said , “ he is still alive ! ”
44020011	Then he went back upstairs , broke bread , and ate . After talking with them for a long time , even until sunrise , Paul left .
44020012	They took the young man home alive and were greatly comforted .
44020013	We went on ahead to the ship and sailed off to Assos , where we were going to take Paul aboard . He had told us to do this , because he was going there by land .
44020014	When he met us in Assos , we took him aboard and went on to Mitylene .
44020015	We sailed from there and arrived off Chios the next day . A day later we came to Samos , and the following day we reached Miletus .
44020016	Paul had decided to sail on by Ephesus , so as not to lose any time in the province of Asia . He was in a hurry to arrive in Jerusalem by the day of Pentecost , if at all possible .
44020017	From Miletus Paul sent a message to Ephesus , asking the elders of the church to meet him .
44020018	When they arrived , he said to them , “ You know how I spent the whole time I was with you , from the first day I arrived in the province of Asia .
44020019	With all humility and many tears I did my work as the Lord's servant during the hard times that came to me because of the plots of some Jews .
44020020	You know that I did not hold back anything that would be of help to you as I preached and taught in public and in your homes .
44020021	To Jews and Gentiles alike I gave solemn warning that they should turn from their sins to God and believe in our Lord Jesus .
44020022	And now , in obedience to the Holy Spirit I am going to Jerusalem , not knowing what will happen to me there .
44020023	I only know that in every city the Holy Spirit has warned me that prison and troubles wait for me .
44020024	But I reckon my own life to be worth nothing to me ; I only want to complete my mission and finish the work that the Lord Jesus gave me to do , which is to declare the Good News about the grace of God .
44020025	“ I have gone about among all of you , preaching the Kingdom of God . And now I know that none of you will ever see me again .
44020026	So I solemnly declare to you this very day : if any of you should be lost , I am not responsible .
44020027	For I have not held back from announcing to you the whole purpose of God .
44020028	So keep watch over yourselves and over all the flock which the Holy Spirit has placed in your care . Be shepherds of the church of God , which he made his own through the blood of his Son .
44020029	I know that after I leave , fierce wolves will come among you , and they will not spare the flock .
44020030	The time will come when some men from your own group will tell lies to lead the believers away after them .
44020031	Watch , then , and remember that with many tears , day and night , I taught every one of you for three years .
44020032	“ And now I commend you to the care of God and to the message of his grace , which is able to build you up and give you the blessings God has for all his people .
44020033	I have not wanted anyone's silver or gold or clothing .
44020034	You yourselves know that I have worked with these hands of mine to provide everything that my companions and I have needed .
44020035	I have shown you in all things that by working hard in this way we must help the weak , remembering the words that the Lord Jesus himself said , ‘ There is more happiness in giving than in receiving . ’ ”
44020036	When Paul finished , he knelt down with them and prayed .
44020037	They were all crying as they hugged him and kissed him good-bye .
44020038	They were especially sad because he had said that they would never see him again . And so they went with him to the ship .
44021001	We said good-bye to them and left . After sailing straight across , we came to Cos ; the next day we reached Rhodes , and from there we went on to Patara .
44021002	There we found a ship that was going to Phoenicia , so we went aboard and sailed away .
44021003	We came to where we could see Cyprus , and then sailed south of it on to Syria . We went ashore at Tyre , where the ship was going to unload its cargo .
44021004	There we found some believers and stayed with them a week . By the power of the Spirit they told Paul not to go to Jerusalem .
44021005	But when our time with them was over , we left and went on our way . All of them , together with their wives and children , went with us out of the city to the beach , where we all knelt and prayed .
44021006	Then we said good-bye to one another , and we went on board the ship while they went back home .
44021007	We continued our voyage , sailing from Tyre to Ptolemais , where we greeted the believers and stayed with them for a day .
44021008	On the following day we left and arrived in Caesarea . There we stayed at the house of Philip the evangelist , one of the seven men who had been chosen as helpers in Jerusalem .
44021009	He had four unmarried daughters who proclaimed God's message .
44021010	We had been there for several days when a prophet named Agabus arrived from Judea .
44021011	He came to us , took Paul's belt , tied up his own feet and hands with it , and said , “ This is what the Holy Spirit says : The owner of this belt will be tied up in this way by the Jews in Jerusalem , and they will hand him over to the Gentiles . ”
44021012	When we heard this , we and the others there begged Paul not to go to Jerusalem .
44021013	But he answered , “ What are you doing , crying like this and breaking my heart ? I am ready not only to be tied up in Jerusalem but even to die there for the sake of the Lord Jesus . ”
44021014	We could not convince him , so we gave up and said , “ May the Lord's will be done . ”
44021015	After spending some time there , we got our things ready and left for Jerusalem .
44021016	Some of the disciples from Caesarea also went with us and took us to the house of the man we were going to stay with —Mnason , from Cyprus , who had been a believer since the early days .
44021017	When we arrived in Jerusalem , the believers welcomed us warmly .
44021018	The next day Paul went with us to see James ; and all the church elders were present .
44021019	Paul greeted them and gave a complete report of everything that God had done among the Gentiles through his work .
44021020	After hearing him , they all praised God . Then they said , “ Brother Paul , you can see how many thousands of Jews have become believers , and how devoted they all are to the Law .
44021021	They have been told that you have been teaching all the Jews who live in Gentile countries to abandon the Law of Moses , telling them not to circumcise their children or follow the Jewish customs .
44021022	They are sure to hear that you have arrived . What should be done , then ?
44021023	This is what we want you to do . There are four men here who have taken a vow .
44021024	Go along with them and join them in the ceremony of purification and pay their expenses ; then they will be able to shave their heads . In this way everyone will know that there is no truth in any of the things that they have been told about you , but that you yourself live in accordance with the Law of Moses .
44021025	But as for the Gentiles who have become believers , we have sent them a letter telling them we decided that they must not eat any food that has been offered to idols , or any blood , or any animal that has been strangled , and that they must keep themselves from sexual immorality . ”
44021026	So Paul took the men and the next day performed the ceremony of purification with them . Then he went into the Temple and gave notice of how many days it would be until the end of the period of purification , when a sacrifice would be offered for each one of them .
44021027	But just when the seven days were about to come to an end , some Jews from the province of Asia saw Paul in the Temple . They stirred up the whole crowd and grabbed Paul .
44021028	“ People of Israel ! ” they shouted . “ Help ! This is the man who goes everywhere teaching everyone against the people of Israel , the Law of Moses , and this Temple . And now he has even brought some Gentiles into the Temple and defiled this holy place ! ” (
44021029	They said this because they had seen Trophimus from Ephesus with Paul in the city , and they thought that Paul had taken him into the Temple . )
44021030	Confusion spread through the whole city , and the people all ran together , grabbed Paul , and dragged him out of the Temple . At once the Temple doors were closed .
44021031	The mob was trying to kill Paul , when a report was sent up to the commander of the Roman troops that all of Jerusalem was rioting .
44021032	At once the commander took some officers and soldiers and rushed down to the crowd . When the people saw him with the soldiers , they stopped beating Paul .
44021033	The commander went over to Paul , arrested him , and ordered him to be bound with two chains . Then he asked , “ Who is this man , and what has he done ? ”
44021034	Some in the crowd shouted one thing , others something else . There was such confusion that the commander could not find out exactly what had happened , so he ordered his men to take Paul up into the fort .
44021035	They got as far as the steps with him , and then the soldiers had to carry him because the mob was so wild .
44021036	They were all coming after him and screaming , “ Kill him ! ”
44021037	As the soldiers were about to take Paul into the fort , he spoke to the commander : “ May I say something to you ? ” “ You speak Greek , do you ? ” the commander asked .
44021038	“ Then you are not that Egyptian fellow who some time ago started a revolution and led four thousand armed terrorists out into the desert ? ”
44021039	Paul answered , “ I am a Jew , born in Tarsus in Cilicia , a citizen of an important city . Please let me speak to the people . ”
44021040	The commander gave him permission , so Paul stood on the steps and motioned with his hand for the people to be silent . When they were quiet , Paul spoke to them in Hebrew :
44022001	“ My fellow Jews , listen to me as I make my defense before you ! ”
44022002	When they heard him speaking to them in Hebrew , they became even quieter ; and Paul went on :
44022003	“ I am a Jew , born in Tarsus in Cilicia , but brought up here in Jerusalem as a student of Gamaliel . I received strict instruction in the Law of our ancestors and was just as dedicated to God as are all of you who are here today .
44022004	I persecuted to the death the people who followed this Way . I arrested men and women and threw them into prison .
44022005	The High Priest and the whole Council can prove that I am telling the truth . I received from them letters written to fellow Jews in Damascus , so I went there to arrest these people and bring them back in chains to Jerusalem to be punished .
44022006	“ As I was traveling and coming near Damascus , about midday a bright light from the sky flashed suddenly around me .
44022007	I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me , ‘ Saul , Saul ! Why do you persecute me ? ’
44022008	‘ Who are you , Lord ? ’ I asked . ‘ I am Jesus of Nazareth , whom you persecute , ’ he said to me .
44022009	The men with me saw the light , but did not hear the voice of the one who was speaking to me .
44022010	I asked , ‘ What shall I do , Lord ? ’ and the Lord said to me , ‘ Get up and go into Damascus , and there you will be told everything that God has determined for you to do . ’
44022011	I was blind because of the bright light , and so my companions took me by the hand and led me into Damascus .
44022012	“ In that city was a man named Ananias , a religious man who obeyed our Law and was highly respected by all the Jews living there .
44022013	He came to me , stood by me , and said , ‘ Brother Saul , see again ! ’ At that very moment I saw again and looked at him .
44022014	He said , ‘ The God of our ancestors has chosen you to know his will , to see his righteous Servant , and to hear him speaking with his own voice .
44022015	For you will be a witness for him to tell everyone what you have seen and heard .
44022016	And now , why wait any longer ? Get up and be baptized and have your sins washed away by praying to him . ’
44022017	“ I went back to Jerusalem , and while I was praying in the Temple , I had a vision ,
44022018	in which I saw the Lord , as he said to me , ‘ Hurry and leave Jerusalem quickly , because the people here will not accept your witness about me . ’
44022019	‘ Lord , ’ I answered , ‘ they know very well that I went to the synagogues and arrested and beat those who believe in you .
44022020	And when your witness Stephen was put to death , I myself was there , approving of his murder and taking care of the cloaks of his murderers . ’
44022021	‘ Go , ’ the Lord said to me , ‘ for I will send you far away to the Gentiles . ’ ”
44022022	The people listened to Paul until he said this ; but then they started shouting at the top of their voices , “ Away with him ! Kill him ! He's not fit to live ! ”
44022023	They were screaming , waving their clothes , and throwing dust up in the air .
44022024	The Roman commander ordered his men to take Paul into the fort , and he told them to whip him in order to find out why the Jews were screaming like this against him .
44022025	But when they had tied him up to be whipped , Paul said to the officer standing there , “ Is it lawful for you to whip a Roman citizen who hasn't even been tried for any crime ? ”
44022026	When the officer heard this , he went to the commander and asked him , “ What are you doing ? That man is a Roman citizen ! ”
44022027	So the commander went to Paul and asked him , “ Tell me , are you a Roman citizen ? ” “ Yes , ” answered Paul .
44022028	The commander said , “ I became one by paying a large amount of money . ” “ But I am one by birth , ” Paul answered .
44022029	At once the men who were going to question Paul drew back from him ; and the commander was frightened when he realized that Paul was a Roman citizen and that he had put him in chains .
44022030	The commander wanted to find out for sure what the Jews were accusing Paul of ; so the next day he had Paul's chains taken off and ordered the chief priests and the whole Council to meet . Then he took Paul and made him stand before them .
44023001	Paul looked straight at the Council and said , “ My fellow Israelites ! My conscience is perfectly clear about the way in which I have lived before God to this very day . ”
44023002	The High Priest Ananias ordered those who were standing close to Paul to strike him on the mouth .
44023003	Paul said to him , “ God will certainly strike you—you whitewashed wall ! You sit there to judge me according to the Law , yet you break the Law by ordering them to strike me ! ”
44023004	The men close to Paul said to him , “ You are insulting God's High Priest ! ”
44023005	Paul answered , “ My fellow Israelites , I did not know that he was the High Priest . The scripture says , ‘ You must not speak evil of the ruler of your people . ’ ”
44023006	When Paul saw that some of the group were Sadducees and the others were Pharisees , he called out in the Council , “ Fellow Israelites ! I am a Pharisee , the son of Pharisees . I am on trial here because of the hope I have that the dead will rise to life ! ”
44023007	As soon as he said this , the Pharisees and Sadducees started to quarrel , and the group was divided . (
44023008	For the Sadducees say that people will not rise from death and that there are no angels or spirits ; but the Pharisees believe in all three . )
44023009	The shouting became louder , and some of the teachers of the Law who belonged to the party of the Pharisees stood up and protested strongly : “ We cannot find a thing wrong with this man ! Perhaps a spirit or an angel really did speak to him ! ”
44023010	The argument became so violent that the commander was afraid that Paul would be torn to pieces . So he ordered his soldiers to go down into the group , get Paul away from them , and take him into the fort .
44023011	That night the Lord stood by Paul and said , “ Don't be afraid ! You have given your witness for me here in Jerusalem , and you must also do the same in Rome . ”
44023012	The next morning some Jews met together and made a plan . They took a vow that they would not eat or drink anything until they had killed Paul .
44023013	There were more than forty who planned this together .
44023014	Then they went to the chief priests and elders and said , “ We have taken a solemn vow together not to eat a thing until we have killed Paul .
44023015	Now then , you and the Council send word to the Roman commander to bring Paul down to you , pretending that you want to get more accurate information about him . But we will be ready to kill him before he ever gets here . ”
44023016	But the son of Paul's sister heard about the plot ; so he went to the fort and told Paul .
44023017	Then Paul called one of the officers and said to him , “ Take this young man to the commander ; he has something to tell him . ”
44023018	The officer took him , led him to the commander , and said , “ The prisoner Paul called me and asked me to bring this young man to you , because he has something to say to you . ”
44023019	The commander took him by the hand , led him off by himself , and asked him , “ What do you have to tell me ? ”
44023020	He said , “ The Jewish authorities have agreed to ask you tomorrow to take Paul down to the Council , pretending that the Council wants to get more accurate information about him .
44023021	But don't listen to them , because there are more than forty men who will be hiding and waiting for him . They have taken a vow not to eat or drink until they have killed him . They are now ready to do it and are waiting for your decision . ”
44023022	The commander said , “ Don't tell anyone that you have reported this to me . ” And he sent the young man away .
44023023	Then the commander called two of his officers and said , “ Get two hundred soldiers ready to go to Caesarea , together with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen , and be ready to leave by nine o'clock tonight .
44023024	Provide some horses for Paul to ride and get him safely through to Governor Felix . ”
44023025	Then the commander wrote a letter that went like this :
44023026	“ Claudius Lysias to His Excellency , Governor Felix : Greetings .
44023027	The Jews seized this man and were about to kill him . I learned that he is a Roman citizen , so I went with my soldiers and rescued him .
44023028	I wanted to know what they were accusing him of , so I took him down to their Council .
44023029	I found out that he had not done a thing for which he deserved to die or be put in prison ; the accusation against him had to do with questions about their own law .
44023030	And when I was informed that there was a plot against him , at once I decided to send him to you . I have told his accusers to make their charges against him before you . ”
44023031	The soldiers carried out their orders . They got Paul and took him that night as far as Antipatris .
44023032	The next day the foot soldiers returned to the fort and left the horsemen to go on with him .
44023033	They took him to Caesarea , delivered the letter to the governor , and turned Paul over to him .
44023034	The governor read the letter and asked Paul what province he was from . When he found out that he was from Cilicia ,
44023035	he said , “ I will hear you when your accusers arrive . ” Then he gave orders for Paul to be kept under guard in the governor's headquarters .
44024001	Five days later the High Priest Ananias went to Caesarea with some elders and a lawyer named Tertullus . They appeared before Governor Felix and made their charges against Paul .
44024002	Then Paul was called in , and Tertullus began to make his accusation , as follows : “ Your Excellency ! Your wise leadership has brought us a long period of peace , and many necessary reforms are being made for the good of our country .
44024003	We welcome this everywhere and at all times , and we are deeply grateful to you .
44024004	I do not want to take up too much of your time , however , so I beg you to be kind and listen to our brief account .
44024005	We found this man to be a dangerous nuisance ; he starts riots among Jews all over the world and is a leader of the party of the Nazarenes .
44024006	He also tried to defile the Temple , and we arrested him .
44024008	If you question this man , you yourself will be able to learn from him all the things that we are accusing him of . ”
44024009	The Jews joined in the accusation and said that all this was true .
44024010	The governor then motioned to Paul to speak , and Paul said , “ I know that you have been a judge over this nation for many years , and so I am happy to defend myself before you .
44024011	As you can find out for yourself , it was no more than twelve days ago that I went to Jerusalem to worship .
44024012	The Jews did not find me arguing with anyone in the Temple , nor did they find me stirring up the people , either in the synagogues or anywhere else in the city .
44024013	Nor can they give you proof of the accusations they now bring against me .
44024014	I do admit this to you : I worship the God of our ancestors by following that Way which they say is false . But I also believe in everything written in the Law of Moses and the books of the prophets .
44024015	I have the same hope in God that these themselves have , namely , that all people , both the good and the bad , will rise from death .
44024016	And so I do my best always to have a clear conscience before God and people .
44024017	“ After being away from Jerusalem for several years , I went there to take some money to my own people and to offer sacrifices .
44024018	It was while I was doing this that they found me in the Temple after I had completed the ceremony of purification . There was no crowd with me and no disorder .
44024019	But some Jews from the province of Asia were there ; they themselves ought to come before you and make their accusations if they have anything against me .
44024020	Or let these who are here tell what crime they found me guilty of when I stood before the Council—
44024021	except for the one thing I called out when I stood before them : ‘ I am being tried by you today for believing that the dead will rise to life . ’ ”
44024022	Then Felix , who was well informed about the Way , brought the hearing to a close . “ When the commander Lysias arrives , ” he told them , “ I will decide your case . ”
44024023	He ordered the officer in charge of Paul to keep him under guard , but to give him some freedom and allow his friends to provide for his needs .
44024024	After some days Felix came with his wife Drusilla , who was Jewish . He sent for Paul and listened to him as he talked about faith in Christ Jesus .
44024025	But as Paul went on discussing about goodness , self-control , and the coming Day of Judgment , Felix was afraid and said , “ You may leave now . I will call you again when I get the chance . ”
44024026	At the same time he was hoping that Paul would give him some money ; and for this reason he would call for him often and talk with him .
44024027	After two years had passed , Porcius Festus succeeded Felix as governor . Felix wanted to gain favor with the Jews so he left Paul in prison .
44025001	Three days after Festus arrived in the province , he went from Caesarea to Jerusalem ,
44025002	where the chief priests and the Jewish leaders brought their charges against Paul . They begged Festus
44025003	to do them the favor of having Paul come to Jerusalem , for they had made a plot to kill him on the way .
44025004	Festus answered , “ Paul is being kept a prisoner in Caesarea , and I myself will be going back there soon .
44025005	Let your leaders go to Caesarea with me and accuse the man if he has done anything wrong . ”
44025006	Festus spent another eight or ten days with them and then went to Caesarea . On the next day he sat down in the judgment court and ordered Paul to be brought in .
44025007	When Paul arrived , the Jews who had come from Jerusalem stood around him and started making many serious charges against him , which they were not able to prove .
44025008	But Paul defended himself : “ I have done nothing wrong against the Law of the Jews or against the Temple or against the Roman Emperor . ”
44025009	But Festus wanted to gain favor with the Jews , so he asked Paul , “ Would you be willing to go to Jerusalem and be tried on these charges before me there ? ”
44025010	Paul said , “ I am standing before the Emperor's own judgment court , where I should be tried . I have done no wrong to the Jews , as you yourself well know .
44025011	If I have broken the law and done something for which I deserve the death penalty , I do not ask to escape it . But if there is no truth in the charges they bring against me , no one can hand me over to them . I appeal to the Emperor . ”
44025012	Then Festus , after conferring with his advisers , answered , “ You have appealed to the Emperor , so to the Emperor you will go . ”
44025013	Some time later King Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to pay a visit of welcome to Festus .
44025014	After they had been there several days , Festus explained Paul's situation to the king : “ There is a man here who was left a prisoner by Felix ;
44025015	and when I went to Jerusalem , the Jewish chief priests and elders brought charges against him and asked me to condemn him .
44025016	But I told them that we Romans are not in the habit of handing over any who are accused of a crime before they have met their accusers face-to-face and have had the chance of defending themselves against the accusation .
44025017	When they came here , then , I lost no time , but on the very next day I sat in the judgment court and ordered the man to be brought in .
44025018	His opponents stood up , but they did not accuse him of any of the evil crimes that I thought they would .
44025019	All they had were some arguments with him about their own religion and about a man named Jesus , who has died ; but Paul claims that he is alive .
44025020	I was undecided about how I could get information on these matters , so I asked Paul if he would be willing to go to Jerusalem and be tried there on these charges .
44025021	But Paul appealed ; he asked to be kept under guard and to let the Emperor decide his case . So I gave orders for him to be kept under guard until I could send him to the Emperor . ”
44025022	Agrippa said to Festus , “ I would like to hear this man myself . ” “ You will hear him tomorrow , ” Festus answered .
44025023	The next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp and ceremony and entered the audience hall with the military chiefs and the leading men of the city . Festus gave the order , and Paul was brought in .
44025024	Festus said , “ King Agrippa and all who are here with us : You see this man against whom all the Jewish people , both here and in Jerusalem , have brought complaints to me . They scream that he should not live any longer .
44025025	But I could not find that he had done anything for which he deserved the death sentence . And since he himself made an appeal to the Emperor , I have decided to send him .
44025026	But I have nothing definite about him to write to the Emperor . So I have brought him here before you—and especially before you , King Agrippa ! —so that , after investigating his case , I may have something to write .
44025027	For it seems unreasonable to me to send a prisoner without clearly indicating the charges against him . ”
44026001	Agrippa said to Paul , “ You have permission to speak on your own behalf . ” Paul stretched out his hand and defended himself as follows :
44026002	“ King Agrippa ! I consider myself fortunate that today I am to defend myself before you from all the things these Jews accuse me of ,
44026003	particularly since you know so well all the Jewish customs and disputes . I ask you , then , to listen to me with patience .
44026004	“ All the Jews know how I have lived ever since I was young . They know how I have spent my whole life , at first in my own country and then in Jerusalem .
44026005	They have always known , if they are willing to testify , that from the very first I have lived as a member of the strictest party of our religion , the Pharisees .
44026006	And now I stand here to be tried because of the hope I have in the promise that God made to our ancestors—
44026007	the very thing that the twelve tribes of our people hope to receive , as they worship God day and night . And it is because of this hope , Your Majesty , that I am being accused by these Jews !
44026008	Why do you who are here find it impossible to believe that God raises the dead ?
44026009	“ I myself thought that I should do everything I could against the cause of Jesus of Nazareth .
44026010	That is what I did in Jerusalem . I received authority from the chief priests and put many of God's people in prison ; and when they were sentenced to death , I also voted against them .
44026011	Many times I had them punished in the synagogues and tried to make them deny their faith . I was so furious with them that I even went to foreign cities to persecute them .
44026012	“ It was for this purpose that I went to Damascus with authority and orders from the chief priests .
44026013	It was on the road at midday , Your Majesty , that I saw a light much brighter than the sun , coming from the sky and shining around me and the men traveling with me .
44026014	All of us fell to the ground , and I heard a voice say to me in Hebrew , ‘ Saul , Saul ! Why are you persecuting me ? You are hurting yourself by hitting back , like an ox kicking against its owner's stick . ’
44026015	‘ Who are you , Lord ? ’ I asked . And the Lord answered , ‘ I am Jesus , whom you persecute .
44026016	But get up and stand on your feet . I have appeared to you to appoint you as my servant . You are to tell others what you have seen of me today and what I will show you in the future .
44026017	I will rescue you from the people of Israel and from the Gentiles to whom I will send you .
44026018	You are to open their eyes and turn them from the darkness to the light and from the power of Satan to God , so that through their faith in me they will have their sins forgiven and receive their place among God's chosen people . ’
44026019	“ And so , King Agrippa , I did not disobey the vision I had from heaven .
44026020	First in Damascus and in Jerusalem and then in the whole country of Israel and among the Gentiles , I preached that they must repent of their sins and turn to God and do the things that would show they had repented .
44026021	It was for this reason that these Jews seized me while I was in the Temple , and they tried to kill me .
44026022	But to this very day I have been helped by God , and so I stand here giving my witness to all , to small and great alike . What I say is the very same thing which the prophets and Moses said was going to happen :
44026023	that the Messiah must suffer and be the first one to rise from death , to announce the light of salvation to the Jews and to the Gentiles . ”
44026024	As Paul defended himself in this way , Festus shouted at him , “ You are mad , Paul ! Your great learning is driving you mad ! ”
44026025	Paul answered , “ I am not mad , Your Excellency ! I am speaking the sober truth .
44026026	King Agrippa ! I can speak to you with all boldness , because you know about these things . I am sure that you have taken notice of every one of them , for this thing has not happened hidden away in a corner .
44026027	King Agrippa , do you believe the prophets ? I know that you do ! ”
44026028	Agrippa said to Paul , “ In this short time do you think you will make me a Christian ? ”
44026029	“ Whether a short time or a long time , ” Paul answered , “ my prayer to God is that you and all the rest of you who are listening to me today might become what I am—except , of course , for these chains ! ”
44026030	Then the king , the governor , Bernice , and all the others got up ,
44026031	and after leaving they said to each other , “ This man has not done anything for which he should die or be put in prison . ”
44026032	And Agrippa said to Festus , “ This man could have been released if he had not appealed to the Emperor . ”
44027001	When it was decided that we should sail to Italy , they handed Paul and some other prisoners over to Julius , an officer in the Roman army regiment called “ The Emperor's Regiment . ”
44027002	We went aboard a ship from Adramyttium , which was ready to leave for the seaports of the province of Asia , and we sailed away . Aristarchus , a Macedonian from Thessalonica , was with us .
44027003	The next day we arrived at Sidon . Julius was kind to Paul and allowed him to go and see his friends , to be given what he needed .
44027004	We went on from there , and because the winds were blowing against us , we sailed on the sheltered side of the island of Cyprus .
44027005	We crossed over the sea off Cilicia and Pamphylia and came to Myra in Lycia .
44027006	There the officer found a ship from Alexandria that was going to sail for Italy , so he put us aboard .
44027007	We sailed slowly for several days and with great difficulty finally arrived off the town of Cnidus . The wind would not let us go any farther in that direction , so we sailed down the sheltered side of the island of Crete , passing by Cape Salmone .
44027008	We kept close to the coast and with great difficulty came to a place called Safe Harbors , not far from the town of Lasea .
44027009	We spent a long time there , until it became dangerous to continue the voyage , for by now the Day of Atonement was already past . So Paul gave them this advice :
44027010	“ Men , I see that our voyage from here on will be dangerous ; there will be great damage to the cargo and to the ship , and loss of life as well . ”
44027011	But the army officer was convinced by what the captain and the owner of the ship said , and not by what Paul said .
44027012	The harbor was not a good one to spend the winter in ; so almost everyone was in favor of putting out to sea and trying to reach Phoenix , if possible , in order to spend the winter there . Phoenix is a harbor in Crete that faces southwest and northwest .
44027013	A soft wind from the south began to blow , and the men thought that they could carry out their plan , so they pulled up the anchor and sailed as close as possible along the coast of Crete .
44027014	But soon a very strong wind—the one called “ Northeaster ” —blew down from the island .
44027015	It hit the ship , and since it was impossible to keep the ship headed into the wind , we gave up trying and let it be carried along by the wind .
44027016	We got some shelter when we passed to the south of the little island of Cauda . There , with some difficulty we managed to make the ship's boat secure .
44027017	They pulled it aboard and then fastened some ropes tight around the ship . They were afraid that they might run into the sandbanks off the coast of Libya , so they lowered the sail and let the ship be carried by the wind .
44027018	The violent storm continued , so on the next day they began to throw some of the ship's cargo overboard ,
44027019	and on the following day they threw part of the ship's equipment overboard .
44027020	For many days we could not see the sun or the stars , and the wind kept on blowing very hard . We finally gave up all hope of being saved .
44027021	After everyone had gone a long time without food , Paul stood before them and said , “ You should have listened to me and not have sailed from Crete ; then we would have avoided all this damage and loss .
44027022	But now I beg you , take courage ! Not one of you will lose your life ; only the ship will be lost .
44027023	For last night an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I worship came to me
44027024	and said , ‘ Don't be afraid , Paul ! You must stand before the Emperor . And God in his goodness to you has spared the lives of all those who are sailing with you . ’
44027025	So take courage , men ! For I trust in God that it will be just as I was told .
44027026	But we will be driven ashore on some island . ”
44027027	It was the fourteenth night , and we were being driven in the Mediterranean by the storm . About midnight the sailors suspected that we were getting close to land .
44027028	So they dropped a line with a weight tied to it and found that the water was one hundred and twenty feet deep ; a little later they did the same and found that it was ninety feet deep .
44027029	They were afraid that the ship would go on the rocks , so they lowered four anchors from the back of the ship and prayed for daylight .
44027030	Then the sailors tried to escape from the ship ; they lowered the boat into the water and pretended that they were going to put out some anchors from the front of the ship .
44027031	But Paul said to the army officer and soldiers , “ If the sailors don't stay on board , you have no hope of being saved . ”
44027032	So the soldiers cut the ropes that held the boat and let it go .
44027033	Just before dawn , Paul begged them all to eat some food : “ You have been waiting for fourteen days now , and all this time you have not eaten a thing .
44027034	I beg you , then , eat some food ; you need it in order to survive . Not even a hair of your heads will be lost . ”
44027035	After saying this , Paul took some bread , gave thanks to God before them all , broke it , and began to eat .
44027036	They took courage , and every one of them also ate some food .
44027037	There was a total of 276 of us on board .
44027038	After everyone had eaten enough , they lightened the ship by throwing all the wheat into the sea .
44027039	When day came , the sailors did not recognize the coast , but they noticed a bay with a beach and decided that , if possible , they would run the ship aground there .
44027040	So they cut off the anchors and let them sink in the sea , and at the same time they untied the ropes that held the steering oars . Then they raised the sail at the front of the ship so that the wind would blow the ship forward , and we headed for shore .
44027041	But the ship hit a sandbank and went aground ; the front part of the ship got stuck and could not move , while the back part was being broken to pieces by the violence of the waves .
44027042	The soldiers made a plan to kill all the prisoners , in order to keep them from swimming ashore and escaping .
44027043	But the army officer wanted to save Paul , so he stopped them from doing this . Instead , he ordered everyone who could swim to jump overboard first and swim ashore ;
44027044	the rest were to follow , holding on to the planks or to some broken pieces of the ship . And this was how we all got safely ashore .
44028001	When we were safely ashore , we learned that the island was called Malta .
44028002	The natives there were very friendly to us . It had started to rain and was cold , so they built a fire and made us all welcome .
44028003	Paul gathered up a bundle of sticks and was putting them on the fire when a snake came out on account of the heat and fastened itself to his hand .
44028004	The natives saw the snake hanging on Paul's hand and said to one another , “ This man must be a murderer , but Fate will not let him live , even though he escaped from the sea . ”
44028005	But Paul shook the snake off into the fire without being harmed at all .
44028006	They were waiting for him to swell up or suddenly fall down dead . But after waiting for a long time and not seeing anything unusual happening to him , they changed their minds and said , “ He is a god ! ”
44028007	Not far from that place were some fields that belonged to Publius , the chief of the island . He welcomed us kindly and for three days we were his guests .
44028008	Publius' father was in bed , sick with fever and dysentery . Paul went into his room , prayed , placed his hands on him , and healed him .
44028009	When this happened , all the other sick people on the island came and were healed .
44028010	They gave us many gifts , and when we sailed , they put on board what we needed for the voyage .
44028011	After three months we sailed away on a ship from Alexandria , called “ The Twin Gods , ” which had spent the winter in the island .
44028012	We arrived in the city of Syracuse and stayed there for three days .
44028013	From there we sailed on and arrived in the city of Rhegium . The next day a wind began to blow from the south , and in two days we came to the town of Puteoli .
44028014	We found some believers there who asked us to stay with them a week . And so we came to Rome .
44028015	The believers in Rome heard about us and came as far as the towns of Market of Appius and Three Inns to meet us . When Paul saw them , he thanked God and was greatly encouraged .
44028016	When we arrived in Rome , Paul was allowed to live by himself with a soldier guarding him .
44028017	After three days Paul called the local Jewish leaders to a meeting . When they had gathered , he said to them , “ My fellow Israelites , even though I did nothing against our people or the customs that we received from our ancestors , I was made a prisoner in Jerusalem and handed over to the Romans .
44028018	After questioning me , the Romans wanted to release me , because they found that I had done nothing for which I deserved to die .
44028019	But when the Jews opposed this , I was forced to appeal to the Emperor , even though I had no accusation to make against my own people .
44028020	That is why I asked to see you and talk with you . As a matter of fact , I am bound in chains like this for the sake of him for whom the people of Israel hope . ”
44028021	They said to him , “ We have not received any letters from Judea about you , nor have any of our people come from there with any news or anything bad to say about you .
44028022	But we would like to hear your ideas , because we know that everywhere people speak against this party to which you belong . ”
44028023	So they set a date with Paul , and a large number of them came that day to the place where Paul was staying . From morning till night he explained to them his message about the Kingdom of God , and he tried to convince them about Jesus by quoting from the Law of Moses and the writings of the prophets .
44028024	Some of them were convinced by his words , but others would not believe .
44028025	So they left , disagreeing among themselves , after Paul had said this one thing : “ How well the Holy Spirit spoke through the prophet Isaiah to your ancestors !
44028026	For he said , ‘ Go and say to this people : You will listen and listen , but not understand ; you will look and look , but not see ,
44028027	because this people's minds are dull , and they have stopped up their ears and closed their eyes . Otherwise , their eyes would see , their ears would hear , their minds would understand , and they would turn to me , says God , and I would heal them . ’ ”
44028028	And Paul concluded : “ You are to know , then , that God's message of salvation has been sent to the Gentiles . They will listen ! ”
44028030	For two years Paul lived in a place he rented for himself , and there he welcomed all who came to see him .
44028031	He preached about the Kingdom of God and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ , speaking with all boldness and freedom .
45001001	From Paul , a servant of Christ Jesus and an apostle chosen and called by God to preach his Good News .
45001002	The Good News was promised long ago by God through his prophets , as written in the Holy Scriptures .
45001003	It is about his Son , our Lord Jesus Christ : as to his humanity , he was born a descendant of David ;
45001004	as to his divine holiness , he was shown with great power to be the Son of God by being raised from death .
45001005	Through him God gave me the privilege of being an apostle for the sake of Christ , in order to lead people of all nations to believe and obey .
45001006	This also includes you who are in Rome , whom God has called to belong to Jesus Christ .
45001007	And so I write to all of you in Rome whom God loves and has called to be his own people : May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace .
45001008	First , I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you , because the whole world is hearing about your faith .
45001009	God is my witness that what I say is true—the God whom I serve with all my heart by preaching the Good News about his Son . God knows that I remember you
45001010	every time I pray . I ask that God in his good will may at last make it possible for me to visit you now .
45001011	For I want very much to see you , in order to share a spiritual blessing with you to make you strong .
45001012	What I mean is that both you and I will be helped at the same time , you by my faith and I by yours .
45001013	You must remember , my friends , that many times I have planned to visit you , but something has always kept me from doing so . I want to win converts among you also , as I have among other Gentiles .
45001014	For I have an obligation to all peoples , to the civilized and to the savage , to the educated and to the ignorant .
45001015	So then , I am eager to preach the Good News to you also who live in Rome .
45001016	I have complete confidence in the gospel ; it is God's power to save all who believe , first the Jews and also the Gentiles .
45001017	For the gospel reveals how God puts people right with himself : it is through faith from beginning to end . As the scripture says , “ The person who is put right with God through faith shall live . ”
45001018	God's anger is revealed from heaven against all the sin and evil of the people whose evil ways prevent the truth from being known .
45001019	God punishes them , because what can be known about God is plain to them , for God himself made it plain .
45001020	Ever since God created the world , his invisible qualities , both his eternal power and his divine nature , have been clearly seen ; they are perceived in the things that God has made . So those people have no excuse at all !
45001021	They know God , but they do not give him the honor that belongs to him , nor do they thank him . Instead , their thoughts have become complete nonsense , and their empty minds are filled with darkness .
45001022	They say they are wise , but they are fools ;
45001023	instead of worshiping the immortal God , they worship images made to look like mortals or birds or animals or reptiles .
45001024	And so God has given those people over to do the filthy things their hearts desire , and they do shameful things with each other .
45001025	They exchange the truth about God for a lie ; they worship and serve what God has created instead of the Creator himself , who is to be praised forever ! Amen .
45001026	Because they do this , God has given them over to shameful passions . Even the women pervert the natural use of their sex by unnatural acts .
45001027	In the same way the men give up natural sexual relations with women and burn with passion for each other . Men do shameful things with each other , and as a result they bring upon themselves the punishment they deserve for their wrongdoing .
45001028	Because those people refuse to keep in mind the true knowledge about God , he has given them over to corrupted minds , so that they do the things that they should not do .
45001029	They are filled with all kinds of wickedness , evil , greed , and vice ; they are full of jealousy , murder , fighting , deceit , and malice . They gossip
45001030	and speak evil of one another ; they are hateful to God , insolent , proud , and boastful ; they think of more ways to do evil ; they disobey their parents ;
45001031	they have no conscience ; they do not keep their promises , and they show no kindness or pity for others .
45001032	They know that God's law says that people who live in this way deserve death . Yet , not only do they continue to do these very things , but they even approve of others who do them .
45002001	Do you , my friend , pass judgment on others ? You have no excuse at all , whoever you are . For when you judge others and then do the same things which they do , you condemn yourself .
45002002	We know that God is right when he judges the people who do such things as these .
45002003	But you , my friend , do those very things for which you pass judgment on others ! Do you think you will escape God's judgment ?
45002004	Or perhaps you despise his great kindness , tolerance , and patience . Surely you know that God is kind , because he is trying to lead you to repent .
45002005	But you have a hard and stubborn heart , and so you are making your own punishment even greater on the Day when God's anger and righteous judgments will be revealed .
45002006	For God will reward each of us according to what we have done .
45002007	Some people keep on doing good , and seek glory , honor , and immortal life ; to them God will give eternal life .
45002008	Other people are selfish and reject what is right , in order to follow what is wrong ; on them God will pour out his anger and fury .
45002009	There will be suffering and pain for all those who do what is evil , for the Jews first and also for the Gentiles .
45002010	But God will give glory , honor , and peace to all who do what is good , to the Jews first and also to the Gentiles .
45002011	For God judges everyone by the same standard .
45002012	The Gentiles do not have the Law of Moses ; they sin and are lost apart from the Law . The Jews have the Law ; they sin and are judged by the Law .
45002013	For it is not by hearing the Law that people are put right with God , but by doing what the Law commands .
45002014	The Gentiles do not have the Law ; but whenever they do by instinct what the Law commands , they are their own law , even though they do not have the Law .
45002015	Their conduct shows that what the Law commands is written in their hearts . Their consciences also show that this is true , since their thoughts sometimes accuse them and sometimes defend them .
45002016	And so , according to the Good News I preach , this is how it will be on that Day when God through Jesus Christ will judge the secret thoughts of all .
45002017	What about you ? You call yourself a Jew ; you depend on the Law and boast about God ;
45002018	you know what God wants you to do , and you have learned from the Law to choose what is right ;
45002019	you are sure that you are a guide for the blind , a light for those who are in darkness ,
45002020	an instructor for the foolish , and a teacher for the ignorant . You are certain that in the Law you have the full content of knowledge and of truth .
45002021	You teach others—why don't you teach yourself ? You preach , “ Do not steal ” —but do you yourself steal ?
45002022	You say , “ Do not commit adultery ” —but do you commit adultery ? You detest idols—but do you rob temples ?
45002023	You boast about having God's law—but do you bring shame on God by breaking his law ?
45002024	The scripture says , “ Because of you Jews , the Gentiles speak evil of God . ”
45002025	If you obey the Law , your circumcision is of value ; but if you disobey the Law , you might as well never have been circumcised .
45002026	If the Gentile , who is not circumcised , obeys the commands of the Law , will not God regard him as though he were circumcised ?
45002027	And so you Jews will be condemned by the Gentiles because you break the Law , even though you have it written down and are circumcised ; but they obey the Law , even though they are not physically circumcised .
45002028	After all , who is a real Jew , truly circumcised ? It is not the man who is a Jew on the outside , whose circumcision is a physical thing .
45002029	Rather , the real Jew is the person who is a Jew on the inside , that is , whose heart has been circumcised , and this is the work of God's Spirit , not of the written Law . Such a person receives praise from God , not from human beings .
45003001	Do the Jews then have any advantage over the Gentiles ? Or is there any value in being circumcised ?
45003002	Much , indeed , in every way ! In the first place , God trusted his message to the Jews .
45003003	But what if some of them were not faithful ? Does this mean that God will not be faithful ?
45003004	Certainly not ! God must be true , even though all human beings are liars . As the scripture says , “ You must be shown to be right when you speak ; you must win your case when you are being tried . ”
45003005	But what if our doing wrong serves to show up more clearly God's doing right ? Can we say that God does wrong when he punishes us ? ( This would be the natural question to ask . )
45003006	By no means ! If God is not just , how can he judge the world ?
45003007	But what if my untruth serves God's glory by making his truth stand out more clearly ? Why should I still be condemned as a sinner ?
45003008	Why not say , then , “ Let us do evil so that good may come ” ? Some people , indeed , have insulted me by accusing me of saying this very thing ! They will be condemned , as they should be .
45003009	Well then , are we Jews in any better condition than the Gentiles ? Not at all ! I have already shown that Jews and Gentiles alike are all under the power of sin .
45003010	As the Scriptures say : “ There is no one who is righteous ,
45003011	no one who is wise or who worships God .
45003012	All have turned away from God ; they have all gone wrong ; no one does what is right , not even one .
45003013	Their words are full of deadly deceit ; wicked lies roll off their tongues , and dangerous threats , like snake's poison , from their lips ;
45003014	their speech is filled with bitter curses .
45003015	They are quick to hurt and kill ;
45003016	they leave ruin and destruction wherever they go .
45003017	They have not known the path of peace ,
45003018	nor have they learned reverence for God . ”
45003019	Now we know that everything in the Law applies to those who live under the Law , in order to stop all human excuses and bring the whole world under God's judgment .
45003020	For no one is put right in God's sight by doing what the Law requires ; what the Law does is to make us know that we have sinned .
45003021	But now God's way of putting people right with himself has been revealed . It has nothing to do with law , even though the Law of Moses and the prophets gave their witness to it .
45003022	God puts people right through their faith in Jesus Christ . God does this to all who believe in Christ , because there is no difference at all :
45003023	everyone has sinned and is far away from God's saving presence .
45003024	But by the free gift of God's grace all are put right with him through Christ Jesus , who sets them free .
45003027	What , then , can we boast about ? Nothing ! And what is the reason for this ? Is it that we obey the Law ? No , but that we believe .
45003028	For we conclude that a person is put right with God only through faith , and not by doing what the Law commands .
45003029	Or is God the God of the Jews only ? Is he not the God of the Gentiles also ? Of course he is .
45003030	God is one , and he will put the Jews right with himself on the basis of their faith , and will put the Gentiles right through their faith .
45003031	Does this mean that by this faith we do away with the Law ? No , not at all ; instead , we uphold the Law .
45004001	What shall we say , then , of Abraham , the father of our race ? What was his experience ?
45004002	If he was put right with God by the things he did , he would have something to boast about—but not in God's sight .
45004003	The scripture says , “ Abraham believed God , and because of his faith God accepted him as righteous . ”
45004004	A person who works is paid wages , but they are not regarded as a gift ; they are something that has been earned .
45004005	But those who depend on faith , not on deeds , and who believe in the God who declares the guilty to be innocent , it is this faith that God takes into account in order to put them right with himself .
45004006	This is what David meant when he spoke of the happiness of the person whom God accepts as righteous , apart from anything that person does :
45004007	“ Happy are those whose wrongs are forgiven , whose sins are pardoned !
45004008	Happy is the person whose sins the Lord will not keep account of ! ”
45004009	Does this happiness that David spoke of belong only to those who are circumcised ? No indeed ! It belongs also to those who are not circumcised . For we have quoted the scripture , “ Abraham believed God , and because of his faith God accepted him as righteous . ”
45004010	When did this take place ? Was it before or after Abraham was circumcised ? It was before , not after .
45004011	He was circumcised later , and his circumcision was a sign to show that because of his faith God had accepted him as righteous before he had been circumcised . And so Abraham is the spiritual father of all who believe in God and are accepted as righteous by him , even though they are not circumcised .
45004012	He is also the father of those who are circumcised , that is , of those who , in addition to being circumcised , also live the same life of faith that our father Abraham lived before he was circumcised .
45004013	When God promised Abraham and his descendants that the world would belong to him , he did so , not because Abraham obeyed the Law , but because he believed and was accepted as righteous by God .
45004014	For if what God promises is to be given to those who obey the Law , then faith means nothing and God's promise is worthless .
45004015	The Law brings down God's anger ; but where there is no law , there is no disobeying of the law .
45004016	And so the promise was based on faith , in order that the promise should be guaranteed as God's free gift to all of Abraham's descendants—not just to those who obey the Law , but also to those who believe as Abraham did . For Abraham is the spiritual father of us all ;
45004017	as the scripture says , “ I have made you father of many nations . ” So the promise is good in the sight of God , in whom Abraham believed—the God who brings the dead to life and whose command brings into being what did not exist .
45004018	Abraham believed and hoped , even when there was no reason for hoping , and so became “ the father of many nations . ” Just as the scripture says , “ Your descendants will be as many as the stars . ”
45004019	He was then almost one hundred years old ; but his faith did not weaken when he thought of his body , which was already practically dead , or of the fact that Sarah could not have children .
45004020	His faith did not leave him , and he did not doubt God's promise ; his faith filled him with power , and he gave praise to God .
45004021	He was absolutely sure that God would be able to do what he had promised .
45004022	That is why Abraham , through faith , “ was accepted as righteous by God . ”
45004023	The words “ he was accepted as righteous ” were not written for him alone .
45004024	They were written also for us who are to be accepted as righteous , who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from death .
45004025	Because of our sins he was given over to die , and he was raised to life in order to put us right with God .
45005001	Now that we have been put right with God through faith , we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ .
45005002	He has brought us by faith into this experience of God's grace , in which we now live . And so we boast of the hope we have of sharing God's glory !
45005003	We also boast of our troubles , because we know that trouble produces endurance ,
45005004	endurance brings God's approval , and his approval creates hope .
45005005	This hope does not disappoint us , for God has poured out his love into our hearts by means of the Holy Spirit , who is God's gift to us .
45005006	For when we were still helpless , Christ died for the wicked at the time that God chose .
45005007	It is a difficult thing for someone to die for a righteous person . It may even be that someone might dare to die for a good person .
45005008	But God has shown us how much he loves us—it was while we were still sinners that Christ died for us !
45005009	By his blood we are now put right with God ; how much more , then , will we be saved by him from God's anger !
45005010	We were God's enemies , but he made us his friends through the death of his Son . Now that we are God's friends , how much more will we be saved by Christ's life !
45005011	But that is not all ; we rejoice because of what God has done through our Lord Jesus Christ , who has now made us God's friends .
45005012	Sin came into the world through one man , and his sin brought death with it . As a result , death has spread to the whole human race because everyone has sinned .
45005013	There was sin in the world before the Law was given ; but where there is no law , no account is kept of sins .
45005014	But from the time of Adam to the time of Moses , death ruled over all human beings , even over those who did not sin in the same way that Adam did when he disobeyed God's command . Adam was a figure of the one who was to come .
45005015	But the two are not the same , because God's free gift is not like Adam's sin . It is true that many people died because of the sin of that one man . But God's grace is much greater , and so is his free gift to so many people through the grace of the one man , Jesus Christ .
45005016	And there is a difference between God's gift and the sin of one man . After the one sin , came the judgment of “ Guilty ” ; but after so many sins , comes the undeserved gift of “ Not guilty ! ”
45005017	It is true that through the sin of one man death began to rule because of that one man . But how much greater is the result of what was done by the one man , Jesus Christ ! All who receive God's abundant grace and are freely put right with him will rule in life through Christ .
45005018	So then , as the one sin condemned all people , in the same way the one righteous act sets all people free and gives them life .
45005019	And just as all people were made sinners as the result of the disobedience of one man , in the same way they will all be put right with God as the result of the obedience of the one man .
45005020	Law was introduced in order to increase wrongdoing ; but where sin increased , God's grace increased much more .
45005021	So then , just as sin ruled by means of death , so also God's grace rules by means of righteousness , leading us to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord .
45006001	What shall we say , then ? Should we continue to live in sin so that God's grace will increase ?
45006002	Certainly not ! We have died to sin—how then can we go on living in it ?
45006003	For surely you know that when we were baptized into union with Christ Jesus , we were baptized into union with his death .
45006004	By our baptism , then , we were buried with him and shared his death , in order that , just as Christ was raised from death by the glorious power of the Father , so also we might live a new life .
45006005	For since we have become one with him in dying as he did , in the same way we shall be one with him by being raised to life as he was .
45006006	And we know that our old being has been put to death with Christ on his cross , in order that the power of the sinful self might be destroyed , so that we should no longer be the slaves of sin .
45006007	For when we die , we are set free from the power of sin .
45006008	Since we have died with Christ , we believe that we will also live with him .
45006009	For we know that Christ has been raised from death and will never die again—death will no longer rule over him .
45006010	And so , because he died , sin has no power over him ; and now he lives his life in fellowship with God .
45006011	In the same way you are to think of yourselves as dead , so far as sin is concerned , but living in fellowship with God through Christ Jesus .
45006012	Sin must no longer rule in your mortal bodies , so that you obey the desires of your natural self .
45006013	Nor must you surrender any part of yourselves to sin to be used for wicked purposes . Instead , give yourselves to God , as those who have been brought from death to life , and surrender your whole being to him to be used for righteous purposes .
45006014	Sin must not be your master ; for you do not live under law but under God's grace .
45006015	What , then ? Shall we sin , because we are not under law but under God's grace ? By no means !
45006016	Surely you know that when you surrender yourselves as slaves to obey someone , you are in fact the slaves of the master you obey—either of sin , which results in death , or of obedience , which results in being put right with God .
45006017	But thanks be to God ! For though at one time you were slaves to sin , you have obeyed with all your heart the truths found in the teaching you received .
45006018	You were set free from sin and became the slaves of righteousness .
45006019	( I use everyday language because of the weakness of your natural selves . ) At one time you surrendered yourselves entirely as slaves to impurity and wickedness for wicked purposes . In the same way you must now surrender yourselves entirely as slaves of righteousness for holy purposes .
45006020	When you were the slaves of sin , you were free from righteousness .
45006021	What did you gain from doing the things that you are now ashamed of ? The result of those things is death !
45006022	But now you have been set free from sin and are the slaves of God . Your gain is a life fully dedicated to him , and the result is eternal life .
45006023	For sin pays its wage—death ; but God's free gift is eternal life in union with Christ Jesus our Lord .
45007001	Certainly you will understand what I am about to say , my friends , because all of you know about law . The law rules over people only as long as they live .
45007002	A married woman , for example , is bound by the law to her husband as long as he lives ; but if he dies , then she is free from the law that bound her to him .
45007003	So then , if she lives with another man while her husband is alive , she will be called an adulteress ; but if her husband dies , she is legally a free woman and does not commit adultery if she marries another man .
45007004	That is how it is with you , my friends . As far as the Law is concerned , you also have died because you are part of the body of Christ ; and now you belong to him who was raised from death in order that we might be useful in the service of God .
45007005	For when we lived according to our human nature , the sinful desires stirred up by the Law were at work in our bodies , and all we did ended in death .
45007006	Now , however , we are free from the Law , because we died to that which once held us prisoners . No longer do we serve in the old way of a written law , but in the new way of the Spirit .
45007007	Shall we say , then , that the Law itself is sinful ? Of course not ! But it was the Law that made me know what sin is . If the Law had not said , “ Do not desire what belongs to someone else , ” I would not have known such a desire .
45007008	But by means of that commandment sin found its chance to stir up all kinds of selfish desires in me . Apart from law , sin is a dead thing .
45007009	I myself was once alive apart from law ; but when the commandment came , sin sprang to life ,
45007010	and I died . And the commandment which was meant to bring life , in my case brought death .
45007011	Sin found its chance , and by means of the commandment it deceived me and killed me .
45007012	So then , the Law itself is holy , and the commandment is holy , right , and good .
45007013	But does this mean that what is good caused my death ? By no means ! It was sin that did it ; by using what is good , sin brought death to me , in order that its true nature as sin might be revealed . And so , by means of the commandment sin is shown to be even more terribly sinful .
45007014	We know that the Law is spiritual ; but I am a mortal , sold as a slave to sin .
45007015	I do not understand what I do ; for I don't do what I would like to do , but instead I do what I hate .
45007016	Since what I do is what I don't want to do , this shows that I agree that the Law is right .
45007017	So I am not really the one who does this thing ; rather it is the sin that lives in me .
45007018	I know that good does not live in me—that is , in my human nature . For even though the desire to do good is in me , I am not able to do it .
45007019	I don't do the good I want to do ; instead , I do the evil that I do not want to do .
45007020	If I do what I don't want to do , this means that I am no longer the one who does it ; instead , it is the sin that lives in me .
45007021	So I find that this law is at work : when I want to do what is good , what is evil is the only choice I have .
45007022	My inner being delights in the law of God .
45007023	But I see a different law at work in my body—a law that fights against the law which my mind approves of . It makes me a prisoner to the law of sin which is at work in my body .
45007024	What an unhappy man I am ! Who will rescue me from this body that is taking me to death ?
45007025	Thanks be to God , who does this through our Lord Jesus Christ ! This , then , is my condition : on my own I can serve God's law only with my mind , while my human nature serves the law of sin .
45008001	There is no condemnation now for those who live in union with Christ Jesus .
45008002	For the law of the Spirit , which brings us life in union with Christ Jesus , has set me free from the law of sin and death .
45008003	What the Law could not do , because human nature was weak , God did . He condemned sin in human nature by sending his own Son , who came with a nature like our sinful nature , to do away with sin .
45008004	God did this so that the righteous demands of the Law might be fully satisfied in us who live according to the Spirit , and not according to human nature .
45008005	Those who live as their human nature tells them to , have their minds controlled by what human nature wants . Those who live as the Spirit tells them to , have their minds controlled by what the Spirit wants .
45008006	To be controlled by human nature results in death ; to be controlled by the Spirit results in life and peace .
45008007	And so people become enemies of God when they are controlled by their human nature ; for they do not obey God's law , and in fact they cannot obey it .
45008008	Those who obey their human nature cannot please God .
45008009	But you do not live as your human nature tells you to ; instead , you live as the Spirit tells you to—if , in fact , God's Spirit lives in you . Whoever does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him .
45008010	But if Christ lives in you , the Spirit is life for you because you have been put right with God , even though your bodies are going to die because of sin .
45008011	If the Spirit of God , who raised Jesus from death , lives in you , then he who raised Christ from death will also give life to your mortal bodies by the presence of his Spirit in you .
45008012	So then , my friends , we have an obligation , but it is not to live as our human nature wants us to .
45008013	For if you live according to your human nature , you are going to die ; but if by the Spirit you put to death your sinful actions , you will live .
45008014	Those who are led by God's Spirit are God's children .
45008015	For the Spirit that God has given you does not make you slaves and cause you to be afraid ; instead , the Spirit makes you God's children , and by the Spirit's power we cry out to God , “ Father ! my Father ! ”
45008016	God's Spirit joins himself to our spirits to declare that we are God's children .
45008017	Since we are his children , we will possess the blessings he keeps for his people , and we will also possess with Christ what God has kept for him ; for if we share Christ's suffering , we will also share his glory .
45008018	I consider that what we suffer at this present time cannot be compared at all with the glory that is going to be revealed to us .
45008019	All of creation waits with eager longing for God to reveal his children .
45008020	For creation was condemned to lose its purpose , not of its own will , but because God willed it to be so . Yet there was the hope
45008021	that creation itself would one day be set free from its slavery to decay and would share the glorious freedom of the children of God .
45008022	For we know that up to the present time all of creation groans with pain , like the pain of childbirth .
45008023	But it is not just creation alone which groans ; we who have the Spirit as the first of God's gifts also groan within ourselves as we wait for God to make us his children and set our whole being free .
45008024	For it was by hope that we were saved ; but if we see what we hope for , then it is not really hope . For who of us hopes for something we see ?
45008025	But if we hope for what we do not see , we wait for it with patience .
45008026	In the same way the Spirit also comes to help us , weak as we are . For we do not know how we ought to pray ; the Spirit himself pleads with God for us in groans that words cannot express .
45008027	And God , who sees into our hearts , knows what the thought of the Spirit is ; because the Spirit pleads with God on behalf of his people and in accordance with his will .
45008028	We know that in all things God works for good with those who love him , those whom he has called according to his purpose .
45008029	Those whom God had already chosen he also set apart to become like his Son , so that the Son would be the first among many believers .
45008030	And so those whom God set apart , he called ; and those he called , he put right with himself , and he shared his glory with them .
45008031	In view of all this , what can we say ? If God is for us , who can be against us ?
45008032	Certainly not God , who did not even keep back his own Son , but offered him for us all ! He gave us his Son—will he not also freely give us all things ?
45008033	Who will accuse God's chosen people ? God himself declares them not guilty !
45008034	Who , then , will condemn them ? Not Christ Jesus , who died , or rather , who was raised to life and is at the right side of God , pleading with him for us !
45008035	Who , then , can separate us from the love of Christ ? Can trouble do it , or hardship or persecution or hunger or poverty or danger or death ?
45008036	As the scripture says , “ For your sake we are in danger of death at all times ; we are treated like sheep that are going to be slaughtered . ”
45009001	I am speaking the truth ; I belong to Christ and I do not lie . My conscience , ruled by the Holy Spirit , also assures me that I am not lying
45009002	when I say how great is my sorrow , how endless the pain in my heart
45009003	for my people , my own flesh and blood ! For their sake I could wish that I myself were under God's curse and separated from Christ .
45009004	They are God's people ; he made them his children and revealed his glory to them ; he made his covenants with them and gave them the Law ; they have the true worship ; they have received God's promises ;
45009005	they are descended from the famous Hebrew ancestors ; and Christ , as a human being , belongs to their race . May God , who rules over all , be praised forever ! Amen .
45009006	I am not saying that the promise of God has failed ; for not all the people of Israel are the people of God .
45009007	Nor are all of Abraham's descendants the children of God . God said to Abraham , “ It is through Isaac that you will have the descendants I promised you . ”
45009008	This means that the children born in the usual way are not the children of God ; instead , the children born as a result of God's promise are regarded as the true descendants .
45009009	For God's promise was made in these words : “ At the right time I will come back , and Sarah will have a son . ”
45009010	And this is not all . For Rebecca's two sons had the same father , our ancestor Isaac .
45009013	As the scripture says , “ I loved Jacob , but I hated Esau . ”
45009014	Shall we say , then , that God is unjust ? Not at all .
45009015	For he said to Moses , “ I will have mercy on anyone I wish ; I will take pity on anyone I wish . ”
45009016	So then , everything depends , not on what we humans want or do , but only on God's mercy .
45009017	For the scripture says to the king of Egypt , “ I made you king in order to use you to show my power and to spread my fame over the whole world . ”
45009018	So then , God has mercy on anyone he wishes , and he makes stubborn anyone he wishes .
45009019	But one of you will say to me , “ If this is so , how can God find fault with anyone ? Who can resist God's will ? ”
45009020	But who are you , my friend , to talk back to God ? A clay pot does not ask the man who made it , “ Why did you make me like this ? ”
45009021	After all , the man who makes the pots has the right to use the clay as he wishes , and to make two pots from the same lump of clay , one for special occasions and the other for ordinary use .
45009022	And the same is true of what God has done . He wanted to show his anger and to make his power known . But he was very patient in enduring those who were the objects of his anger , who were doomed to destruction .
45009023	And he also wanted to reveal his abundant glory , which was poured out on us who are the objects of his mercy , those of us whom he has prepared to receive his glory .
45009024	For we are the people he called , not only from among the Jews but also from among the Gentiles .
45009025	This is what he says in the book of Hosea : “ The people who were not mine I will call ‘ My People . ’ The nation that I did not love I will call ‘ My Beloved . ’
45009026	And in the very place where they were told , ‘ You are not my people , ’ there they will be called the children of the living God . ”
45009030	So we say that the Gentiles , who were not trying to put themselves right with God , were put right with him through faith ;
45009031	while God's people , who were seeking a law that would put them right with God , did not find it .
45009032	And why not ? Because they did not depend on faith but on what they did . And so they stumbled over the “ stumbling stone ”
45009033	that the scripture speaks of : “ Look , I place in Zion a stone that will make people stumble , a rock that will make them fall . But whoever believes in him will not be disappointed . ”
45010001	My friends , how I wish with all my heart that my own people might be saved ! How I pray to God for them !
45010002	I can assure you that they are deeply devoted to God ; but their devotion is not based on true knowledge .
45010003	They have not known the way in which God puts people right with himself , and instead , they have tried to set up their own way ; and so they did not submit themselves to God's way of putting people right .
45010004	For Christ has brought the Law to an end , so that everyone who believes is put right with God .
45010005	Moses wrote this about being put right with God by obeying the Law : “ Whoever obeys the commands of the Law will live . ”
45010006	But what the scripture says about being put right with God through faith is this : “ You are not to ask yourself , Who will go up into heaven ? ” ( that is , to bring Christ down ) .
45010007	“ Nor are you to ask , Who will go down into the world below ? ” ( that is , to bring Christ up from death ) .
45010008	What it says is this : “ God's message is near you , on your lips and in your heart ” —that is , the message of faith that we preach .
45010009	If you confess that Jesus is Lord and believe that God raised him from death , you will be saved .
45010010	For it is by our faith that we are put right with God ; it is by our confession that we are saved .
45010011	The scripture says , “ Whoever believes in him will not be disappointed . ”
45010012	This includes everyone , because there is no difference between Jews and Gentiles ; God is the same Lord of all and richly blesses all who call to him .
45010013	As the scripture says , “ Everyone who calls out to the Lord for help will be saved . ”
45010014	But how can they call to him for help if they have not believed ? And how can they believe if they have not heard the message ? And how can they hear if the message is not proclaimed ?
45010015	And how can the message be proclaimed if the messengers are not sent out ? As the scripture says , “ How wonderful is the coming of messengers who bring good news ! ”
45010016	But not all have accepted the Good News . Isaiah himself said , “ Lord , who believed our message ? ”
45010017	So then , faith comes from hearing the message , and the message comes through preaching Christ .
45010018	But I ask : Is it true that they did not hear the message ? Of course they did—for as the scripture says : “ The sound of their voice went out to all the world ; their words reached the ends of the earth . ” “ I will use a so-called nation to make my people jealous ; and by means of a nation of fools I will make my people angry . ” “ I was found by those who were not looking for me ; I appeared to those who were not asking for me . ”
45011001	I ask , then : Did God reject his own people ? Certainly not ! I myself am an Israelite , a descendant of Abraham , a member of the tribe of Benjamin .
45011002	God has not rejected his people , whom he chose from the beginning . You know what the scripture says in the passage where Elijah pleads with God against Israel :
45011003	“ Lord , they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars ; I am the only one left , and they are trying to kill me . ”
45011004	What answer did God give him ? “ I have kept for myself seven thousand men who have not worshiped the false god Baal . ”
45011005	It is the same way now : there is a small number left of those whom God has chosen because of his grace .
45011006	His choice is based on his grace , not on what they have done . For if God's choice were based on what people do , then his grace would not be real grace .
45011007	What then ? The people of Israel did not find what they were looking for . It was only the small group that God chose who found it ; the rest grew deaf to God's call .
45011008	As the scripture says , “ God made their minds and hearts dull ; to this very day they cannot see or hear . ”
45011009	And David says , “ May they be caught and trapped at their feasts ; may they fall , may they be punished !
45011010	May their eyes be blinded so that they cannot see ; and make them bend under their troubles at all times . ”
45011011	I ask , then : When the Jews stumbled , did they fall to their ruin ? By no means ! Because they sinned , salvation has come to the Gentiles , to make the Jews jealous of them .
45011012	The sin of the Jews brought rich blessings to the world , and their spiritual poverty brought rich blessings to the Gentiles . Then , how much greater the blessings will be when the complete number of Jews is included !
45011013	I am speaking now to you Gentiles : As long as I am an apostle to the Gentiles , I will take pride in my work .
45011014	Perhaps I can make the people of my own race jealous , and so be able to save some of them .
45011015	For when they were rejected , all other people were changed from God's enemies into his friends . What will it be , then , when they are accepted ? It will be life for the dead !
45011016	If the first piece of bread is given to God , then the whole loaf is his also ; and if the roots of a tree are offered to God , the branches are his also .
45011017	Some of the branches of the cultivated olive tree have been broken off , and a branch of a wild olive tree has been joined to it . You Gentiles are like that wild olive tree , and now you share the strong spiritual life of the Jews .
45011018	So then , you must not despise those who were broken off like branches . How can you be proud ? You are just a branch ; you don't support the roots—the roots support you .
45011019	But you will say , “ Yes , but the branches were broken off to make room for me . ”
45011020	That is true . They were broken off because they did not believe , while you remain in place because you do believe . But do not be proud of it ; instead , be afraid .
45011021	God did not spare the Jews , who are like natural branches ; do you think he will spare you ?
45011022	Here we see how kind and how severe God is . He is severe toward those who have fallen , but kind to you—if you continue in his kindness . But if you do not , you too will be broken off .
45011023	And if the Jews abandon their unbelief , they will be put back in the place where they were ; for God is able to do that .
45011024	You Gentiles are like the branch of a wild olive tree that is broken off and then , contrary to nature , is joined to a cultivated olive tree . The Jews are like this cultivated tree ; and it will be much easier for God to join these broken-off branches to their own tree again .
45011025	There is a secret truth , my friends , which I want you to know , for it will keep you from thinking how wise you are . It is that the stubbornness of the people of Israel is not permanent , but will last only until the complete number of Gentiles comes to God .
45011026	And this is how all Israel will be saved . As the scripture says , “ The Savior will come from Zion and remove all wickedness from the descendants of Jacob .
45011027	I will make this covenant with them when I take away their sins . ”
45011033	How great are God's riches ! How deep are his wisdom and knowledge ! Who can explain his decisions ? Who can understand his ways ?
45011034	As the scripture says , “ Who knows the mind of the Lord ? Who is able to give him advice ?
45011035	Who has ever given him anything , so that he had to pay it back ? ”
45012001	So then , my friends , because of God's great mercy to us I appeal to you : Offer yourselves as a living sacrifice to God , dedicated to his service and pleasing to him . This is the true worship that you should offer .
45012002	Do not conform yourselves to the standards of this world , but let God transform you inwardly by a complete change of your mind . Then you will be able to know the will of God—what is good and is pleasing to him and is perfect .
45012003	And because of God's gracious gift to me I say to every one of you : Do not think of yourself more highly than you should . Instead , be modest in your thinking , and judge yourself according to the amount of faith that God has given you .
45012004	We have many parts in the one body , and all these parts have different functions .
45012005	In the same way , though we are many , we are one body in union with Christ , and we are all joined to each other as different parts of one body .
45012006	So we are to use our different gifts in accordance with the grace that God has given us . If our gift is to speak God's message , we should do it according to the faith that we have ;
45012007	if it is to serve , we should serve ; if it is to teach , we should teach ;
45012008	if it is to encourage others , we should do so . Whoever shares with others should do it generously ; whoever has authority should work hard ; whoever shows kindness to others should do it cheerfully .
45012009	Love must be completely sincere . Hate what is evil , hold on to what is good .
45012010	Love one another warmly as Christians , and be eager to show respect for one another .
45012011	Work hard and do not be lazy . Serve the Lord with a heart full of devotion .
45012012	Let your hope keep you joyful , be patient in your troubles , and pray at all times .
45012013	Share your belongings with your needy fellow Christians , and open your homes to strangers .
45012014	Ask God to bless those who persecute you—yes , ask him to bless , not to curse .
45012015	Be happy with those who are happy , weep with those who weep .
45012016	Have the same concern for everyone . Do not be proud , but accept humble duties . Do not think of yourselves as wise .
45012017	If someone has done you wrong , do not repay him with a wrong . Try to do what everyone considers to be good .
45012018	Do everything possible on your part to live in peace with everybody .
45012019	Never take revenge , my friends , but instead let God's anger do it . For the scripture says , “ I will take revenge , I will pay back , says the Lord . ”
45012020	Instead , as the scripture says : “ If your enemies are hungry , feed them ; if they are thirsty , give them a drink ; for by doing this you will make them burn with shame . ”
45012021	Do not let evil defeat you ; instead , conquer evil with good .
45013001	Everyone must obey state authorities , because no authority exists without God's permission , and the existing authorities have been put there by God .
45013002	Whoever opposes the existing authority opposes what God has ordered ; and anyone who does so will bring judgment on himself .
45013003	For rulers are not to be feared by those who do good , but by those who do evil . Would you like to be unafraid of those in authority ? Then do what is good , and they will praise you ,
45013004	because they are God's servants working for your own good . But if you do evil , then be afraid of them , because their power to punish is real . They are God's servants and carry out God's punishment on those who do evil .
45013005	For this reason you must obey the authorities—not just because of God's punishment , but also as a matter of conscience .
45013006	That is also why you pay taxes , because the authorities are working for God when they fulfill their duties .
45013007	Pay , then , what you owe them ; pay them your personal and property taxes , and show respect and honor for them all .
45013008	Be under obligation to no one—the only obligation you have is to love one another . Whoever does this has obeyed the Law .
45013009	The commandments , “ Do not commit adultery ; do not commit murder ; do not steal ; do not desire what belongs to someone else ” —all these , and any others besides , are summed up in the one command , “ Love your neighbor as you love yourself . ”
45013010	If you love others , you will never do them wrong ; to love , then , is to obey the whole Law .
45013011	You must do this , because you know that the time has come for you to wake up from your sleep . For the moment when we will be saved is closer now than it was when we first believed .
45013012	The night is nearly over , day is almost here . Let us stop doing the things that belong to the dark , and let us take up weapons for fighting in the light .
45013013	Let us conduct ourselves properly , as people who live in the light of day—no orgies or drunkenness , no immorality or indecency , no fighting or jealousy .
45013014	But take up the weapons of the Lord Jesus Christ , and stop paying attention to your sinful nature and satisfying its desires .
45014001	Welcome those who are weak in faith , but do not argue with them about their personal opinions .
45014002	Some people's faith allows them to eat anything , but the person who is weak in the faith eats only vegetables .
45014003	The person who will eat anything is not to despise the one who doesn't ; while the one who eats only vegetables is not to pass judgment on the one who will eat anything ; for God has accepted that person .
45014004	Who are you to judge the servants of someone else ? It is their own Master who will decide whether they succeed or fail . And they will succeed , because the Lord is able to make them succeed .
45014005	Some people think that a certain day is more important than other days , while others think that all days are the same . We each should firmly make up our own minds .
45014006	Those who think highly of a certain day do so in honor of the Lord ; those who will eat anything do so in honor of the Lord , because they give thanks to God for the food . Those who refuse to eat certain things do so in honor of the Lord , and they give thanks to God .
45014007	We do not live for ourselves only , and we do not die for ourselves only .
45014008	If we live , it is for the Lord that we live , and if we die , it is for the Lord that we die . So whether we live or die , we belong to the Lord .
45014009	For Christ died and rose to life in order to be the Lord of the living and of the dead .
45014010	You then , who eat only vegetables—why do you pass judgment on others ? And you who eat anything—why do you despise other believers ? All of us will stand before God to be judged by him .
45014011	For the scripture says , “ As surely as I am the living God , says the Lord , everyone will kneel before me , and everyone will confess that I am God . ”
45014013	So then , let us stop judging one another . Instead , you should decide never to do anything that would make others stumble or fall into sin .
45014014	My union with the Lord Jesus makes me certain that no food is of itself ritually unclean ; but if you believe that some food is unclean , then it becomes unclean for you .
45014015	If you hurt others because of something you eat , then you are no longer acting from love . Do not let the food that you eat ruin the person for whom Christ died !
45014016	Do not let what you regard as good get a bad name .
45014017	For God's Kingdom is not a matter of eating and drinking , but of the righteousness , peace , and joy which the Holy Spirit gives .
45014018	And when you serve Christ in this way , you please God and are approved by others .
45014019	So then , we must always aim at those things that bring peace and that help strengthen one another .
45014020	Do not , because of food , destroy what God has done . All foods may be eaten , but it is wrong to eat anything that will cause someone else to fall into sin .
45014021	The right thing to do is to keep from eating meat , drinking wine , or doing anything else that will make other believers fall .
45014022	Keep what you believe about this matter , then , between yourself and God . Happy are those who do not feel guilty when they do something they judge is right !
45014023	But if they have doubts about what they eat , God condemns them when they eat it , because their action is not based on faith . And anything that is not based on faith is sin .
45015001	We who are strong in the faith ought to help the weak to carry their burdens . We should not please ourselves .
45015002	Instead , we should all please other believers for their own good , in order to build them up in the faith .
45015003	For Christ did not please himself . Instead , as the scripture says , “ The insults which are hurled at you have fallen on me . ”
45015004	Everything written in the Scriptures was written to teach us , in order that we might have hope through the patience and encouragement which the Scriptures give us .
45015005	And may God , the source of patience and encouragement , enable you to have the same point of view among yourselves by following the example of Christ Jesus ,
45015006	so that all of you together may praise with one voice the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
45015007	Accept one another , then , for the glory of God , as Christ has accepted you .
45015008	For I tell you that Christ's life of service was on behalf of the Jews , to show that God is faithful , to make his promises to their ancestors come true ,
45015009	and to enable even the Gentiles to praise God for his mercy . As the scripture says , “ And so I will praise you among the Gentiles ; I will sing praises to you . ” “ Rejoice , Gentiles , with God's people ! ” “ Praise the Lord , all Gentiles ; praise him , all peoples ! ” “ A descendant of Jesse will appear ; he will come to rule the Gentiles , and they will put their hope in him . ”
45015013	May God , the source of hope , fill you with all joy and peace by means of your faith in him , so that your hope will continue to grow by the power of the Holy Spirit .
45015014	My friends : I myself feel sure that you are full of goodness , that you have all knowledge , and that you are able to teach one another .
45015015	But in this letter I have been quite bold about certain subjects of which I have reminded you . I have been bold because of the privilege God has given me
45015016	of being a servant of Christ Jesus to work for the Gentiles . I serve like a priest in preaching the Good News from God , in order that the Gentiles may be an offering acceptable to God , dedicated to him by the Holy Spirit .
45015017	In union with Christ Jesus , then , I can be proud of my service for God .
45015018	I will be bold and speak only about what Christ has done through me to lead the Gentiles to obey God . He has done this by means of words and deeds ,
45015019	by the power of miracles and wonders , and by the power of the Spirit of God . And so , in traveling all the way from Jerusalem to Illyricum , I have proclaimed fully the Good News about Christ .
45015020	My ambition has always been to proclaim the Good News in places where Christ has not been heard of , so as not to build on a foundation laid by someone else .
45015021	As the scripture says , “ Those who were not told about him will see , and those who have not heard will understand . ”
45015022	And so I have been prevented many times from coming to you .
45015023	But now that I have finished my work in these regions and since I have been wanting for so many years to come to see you ,
45015024	I hope to do so now . I would like to see you on my way to Spain , and be helped by you to go there , after I have enjoyed visiting you for a while .
45015025	Right now , however , I am going to Jerusalem in the service of God's people there .
45015026	For the churches in Macedonia and Achaia have freely decided to give an offering to help the poor among God's people in Jerusalem .
45015027	That decision was their own ; but , as a matter of fact , they have an obligation to help them . Since the Jews shared their spiritual blessings with the Gentiles , the Gentiles ought to use their material blessings to help the Jews .
45015028	When I have finished this task and have turned over to them all the money that has been raised for them , I shall leave for Spain and visit you on my way there .
45015029	When I come to you , I know that I shall come with a full measure of the blessing of Christ .
45015030	I urge you , friends , by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love that the Spirit gives : join me in praying fervently to God for me .
45015031	Pray that I may be kept safe from the unbelievers in Judea and that my service in Jerusalem may be acceptable to God's people there .
45015032	And so I will come to you full of joy , if it is God's will , and enjoy a refreshing visit with you .
45015033	May God , our source of peace , be with all of you . Amen .
45016001	I recommend to you our sister Phoebe , who serves the church at Cenchreae .
45016002	Receive her in the Lord's name , as God's people should , and give her any help she may need from you ; for she herself has been a good friend to many people and also to me .
45016003	I send greetings to Priscilla and Aquila , my fellow workers in the service of Christ Jesus ;
45016004	they risked their lives for me . I am grateful to them—not only I , but all the Gentile churches as well .
45016005	Greetings also to the church that meets in their house . Greetings to my dear friend Epaenetus , who was the first in the province of Asia to believe in Christ .
45016006	Greetings to Mary , who has worked so hard for you .
45016007	Greetings also to Andronicus and Junia , fellow Jews who were in prison with me ; they are well known among the apostles , and they became Christians before I did .
45016008	My greetings to Ampliatus , my dear friend in the fellowship of the Lord .
45016009	Greetings also to Urbanus , our fellow worker in Christ's service , and to Stachys , my dear friend .
45016010	Greetings to Apelles , whose loyalty to Christ has been proved . Greetings to those who belong to the family of Aristobulus .
45016011	Greetings to Herodion , a fellow Jew , and to the Christians in the family of Narcissus .
45016012	My greetings to Tryphaena and Tryphosa , who work in the Lord's service , and to my dear friend Persis , who has done so much work for the Lord .
45016013	I send greetings to Rufus , that outstanding worker in the Lord's service , and to his mother , who has always treated me like a son .
45016014	My greetings to Asyncritus , Phlegon , Hermes , Patrobas , Hermas , and all the other Christians with them .
45016015	Greetings to Philologus and Julia , to Nereus and his sister , to Olympas and to all of God's people who are with them .
45016016	Greet one another with the kiss of peace . All the churches of Christ send you their greetings .
45016017	I urge you , my friends : watch out for those who cause divisions and upset people's faith and go against the teaching which you have received . Keep away from them !
45016018	For those who do such things are not serving Christ our Lord , but their own appetites . By their fine words and flattering speech they deceive innocent people .
45016019	Everyone has heard of your loyalty to the gospel , and for this reason I am happy about you . I want you to be wise about what is good , but innocent in what is evil .
45016020	And God , our source of peace , will soon crush Satan under your feet . The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you .
45016021	Timothy , my fellow worker , sends you his greetings ; and so do Lucius , Jason , and Sosipater , fellow Jews .
45016022	I , Tertius , the writer of this letter , send you Christian greetings .
45016023	My host Gaius , in whose house the church meets , sends you his greetings ; Erastus , the city treasurer , and our brother Quartus send you their greetings .
45016025	Let us give glory to God ! He is able to make you stand firm in your faith , according to the Good News I preach about Jesus Christ and according to the revelation of the secret truth which was hidden for long ages in the past .
45016026	Now , however , that truth has been brought out into the open through the writings of the prophets ; and by the command of the eternal God it is made known to all nations , so that all may believe and obey .
45016027	To the only God , who alone is all-wise , be glory through Jesus Christ forever ! Amen .
46001001	From Paul , who was called by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus , and from our brother Sosthenes—
46001002	To the church of God which is in Corinth , to all who are called to be God's holy people , who belong to him in union with Christ Jesus , together with all people everywhere who worship our Lord Jesus Christ , their Lord and ours :
46001003	May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace .
46001004	I always give thanks to my God for you because of the grace he has given you through Christ Jesus .
46001005	For in union with Christ you have become rich in all things , including all speech and all knowledge .
46001006	The message about Christ has become so firmly established in you
46001007	that you have not failed to receive a single blessing , as you wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed .
46001008	He will also keep you firm to the end , so that you will be faultless on the Day of our Lord Jesus Christ .
46001009	God is to be trusted , the God who called you to have fellowship with his Son Jesus Christ , our Lord .
46001010	By the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ I appeal to all of you , my friends , to agree in what you say , so that there will be no divisions among you . Be completely united , with only one thought and one purpose .
46001011	For some people from Chloe's family have told me quite plainly , my friends , that there are quarrels among you .
46001012	Let me put it this way : each one of you says something different . One says , “ I follow Paul ” ; another , “ I follow Apollos ” ; another , “ I follow Peter ” ; and another , “ I follow Christ . ”
46001013	Christ has been divided into groups ! Was it Paul who died on the cross for you ? Were you baptized as Paul's disciples ?
46001014	I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius .
46001015	No one can say , then , that you were baptized as my disciples . (
46001016	Oh yes , I also baptized Stephanas and his family ; but I can't remember whether I baptized anyone else . )
46001017	Christ did not send me to baptize . He sent me to tell the Good News , and to tell it without using the language of human wisdom , in order to make sure that Christ's death on the cross is not robbed of its power .
46001018	For the message about Christ's death on the cross is nonsense to those who are being lost ; but for us who are being saved it is God's power .
46001019	The scripture says , “ I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and set aside the understanding of the scholars . ”
46001021	For God in his wisdom made it impossible for people to know him by means of their own wisdom . Instead , by means of the so-called “ foolish ” message we preach , God decided to save those who believe .
46001022	Jews want miracles for proof , and Greeks look for wisdom .
46001023	As for us , we proclaim the crucified Christ , a message that is offensive to the Jews and nonsense to the Gentiles ;
46001024	but for those whom God has called , both Jews and Gentiles , this message is Christ , who is the power of God and the wisdom of God .
46001025	For what seems to be God's foolishness is wiser than human wisdom , and what seems to be God's weakness is stronger than human strength .
46001026	Now remember what you were , my friends , when God called you . From the human point of view few of you were wise or powerful or of high social standing .
46001027	God purposely chose what the world considers nonsense in order to shame the wise , and he chose what the world considers weak in order to shame the powerful .
46001028	He chose what the world looks down on and despises and thinks is nothing , in order to destroy what the world thinks is important .
46001029	This means that no one can boast in God's presence .
46001030	But God has brought you into union with Christ Jesus , and God has made Christ to be our wisdom . By him we are put right with God ; we become God's holy people and are set free .
46001031	So then , as the scripture says , “ Whoever wants to boast must boast of what the Lord has done . ”
46002001	When I came to you , my friends , to preach God's secret truth , I did not use big words and great learning .
46002002	For while I was with you , I made up my mind to forget everything except Jesus Christ and especially his death on the cross .
46002003	So when I came to you , I was weak and trembled all over with fear ,
46002004	and my teaching and message were not delivered with skillful words of human wisdom , but with convincing proof of the power of God's Spirit .
46002005	Your faith , then , does not rest on human wisdom but on God's power .
46002006	Yet I do proclaim a message of wisdom to those who are spiritually mature . But it is not the wisdom that belongs to this world or to the powers that rule this world—powers that are losing their power .
46002007	The wisdom I proclaim is God's secret wisdom , which is hidden from human beings , but which he had already chosen for our glory even before the world was made .
46002008	None of the rulers of this world knew this wisdom . If they had known it , they would not have crucified the Lord of glory .
46002009	However , as the scripture says , “ What no one ever saw or heard , what no one ever thought could happen , is the very thing God prepared for those who love him . ”
46002013	So then , we do not speak in words taught by human wisdom , but in words taught by the Spirit , as we explain spiritual truths to those who have the Spirit .
46002014	Whoever does not have the Spirit cannot receive the gifts that come from God's Spirit . Such a person really does not understand them , and they seem to be nonsense , because their value can be judged only on a spiritual basis .
46002015	Whoever has the Spirit , however , is able to judge the value of everything , but no one is able to judge him .
46002016	As the scripture says , “ Who knows the mind of the Lord ? Who is able to give him advice ? ”
46003001	As a matter of fact , my friends , I could not talk to you as I talk to people who have the Spirit ; I had to talk to you as though you belonged to this world , as children in the Christian faith .
46003002	I had to feed you milk , not solid food , because you were not ready for it . And even now you are not ready for it ,
46003003	because you still live as the people of this world live . When there is jealousy among you and you quarrel with one another , doesn't this prove that you belong to this world , living by its standards ?
46003004	When one of you says , “ I follow Paul , ” and another , “ I follow Apollos ” —aren't you acting like worldly people ?
46003005	After all , who is Apollos ? And who is Paul ? We are simply God's servants , by whom you were led to believe . Each one of us does the work which the Lord gave him to do :
46003006	I planted the seed , Apollos watered the plant , but it was God who made the plant grow .
46003007	The one who plants and the one who waters really do not matter . It is God who matters , because he makes the plant grow .
46003008	There is no difference between the one who plants and the one who waters ; God will reward each one according to the work each has done .
46003009	For we are partners working together for God , and you are God's field . You are also God's building .
46003010	Using the gift that God gave me , I did the work of an expert builder and laid the foundation , and someone else is building on it . But each of you must be careful how you build .
46003011	For God has already placed Jesus Christ as the one and only foundation , and no other foundation can be laid .
46003012	Some will use gold or silver or precious stones in building on the foundation ; others will use wood or grass or straw .
46003013	And the quality of each person's work will be seen when the Day of Christ exposes it . For on that Day fire will reveal everyone's work ; the fire will test it and show its real quality .
46003014	If what was built on the foundation survives the fire , the builder will receive a reward .
46003015	But if your work is burnt up , then you will lose it ; but you yourself will be saved , as if you had escaped through the fire .
46003016	Surely you know that you are God's temple and that God's Spirit lives in you !
46003017	God will destroy anyone who destroys God's temple . For God's temple is holy , and you yourselves are his temple .
46003018	You should not fool yourself . If any of you think that you are wise by this world's standards , you should become a fool , in order to be really wise .
46003019	For what this world considers to be wisdom is nonsense in God's sight . As the scripture says , “ God traps the wise in their cleverness ” ;
46003020	and another scripture says , “ The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are worthless . ”
46003021	No one , then , should boast about what human beings can do . Actually everything belongs to you :
46003022	Paul , Apollos , and Peter ; this world , life and death , the present and the future—all these are yours ,
46003023	and you belong to Christ , and Christ belongs to God .
46004001	You should think of us as Christ's servants , who have been put in charge of God's secret truths .
46004002	The one thing required of such servants is that they be faithful to their master .
46004003	Now , I am not at all concerned about being judged by you or by any human standard ; I don't even pass judgment on myself .
46004004	My conscience is clear , but that does not prove that I am really innocent . The Lord is the one who passes judgment on me .
46004005	So you should not pass judgment on anyone before the right time comes . Final judgment must wait until the Lord comes ; he will bring to light the dark secrets and expose the hidden purposes of people's minds . And then all will receive from God the praise they deserve .
46004006	For your sake , my friends , I have applied all this to Apollos and me , using the two of us as an example , so that you may learn what the saying means , “ Observe the proper rules . ” None of you should be proud of one person and despise another .
46004007	Who made you superior to others ? Didn't God give you everything you have ? Well , then , how can you boast , as if what you have were not a gift ?
46004008	Do you already have everything you need ? Are you already rich ? Have you become kings , even though we are not ? Well , I wish you really were kings , so that we could be kings together with you .
46004009	For it seems to me that God has given the very last place to us apostles , like people condemned to die in public as a spectacle for the whole world of angels and of human beings .
46004010	For Christ's sake we are fools ; but you are wise in union with Christ ! We are weak , but you are strong ! We are despised , but you are honored !
46004011	To this very moment we go hungry and thirsty ; we are clothed in rags ; we are beaten ; we wander from place to place ;
46004012	we wear ourselves out with hard work . When we are cursed , we bless ; when we are persecuted , we endure ;
46004013	when we are insulted , we answer back with kind words . We are no more than this world's garbage ; we are the scum of the earth to this very moment !
46004014	I write this to you , not because I want to make you feel ashamed , but to instruct you as my own dear children .
46004015	For even if you have ten thousand guardians in your Christian life , you have only one father . For in your life in union with Christ Jesus I have become your father by bringing the Good News to you .
46004016	I beg you , then , to follow my example .
46004017	For this purpose I am sending to you Timothy , who is my own dear and faithful son in the Christian life . He will remind you of the principles which I follow in the new life in union with Christ Jesus and which I teach in all the churches everywhere .
46004018	Some of you have become proud because you have thought that I would not be coming to visit you .
46004019	If the Lord is willing , however , I will come to you soon , and then I will find out for myself the power which these proud people have , and not just what they say .
46004020	For the Kingdom of God is not a matter of words but of power .
46004021	Which do you prefer ? Shall I come to you with a whip , or in a spirit of love and gentleness ?
46005001	Now , it is actually being said that there is sexual immorality among you so terrible that not even the heathen would be guilty of it . I am told that a man is sleeping with his stepmother !
46005002	How , then , can you be proud ? On the contrary , you should be filled with sadness , and the man who has done such a thing should be expelled from your fellowship .
46005005	you are to hand this man over to Satan for his body to be destroyed , so that his spirit may be saved in the Day of the Lord .
46005006	It is not right for you to be proud ! You know the saying , “ A little bit of yeast makes the whole batch of dough rise . ”
46005007	You must remove the old yeast of sin so that you will be entirely pure . Then you will be like a new batch of dough without any yeast , as indeed I know you actually are . For our Passover Festival is ready , now that Christ , our Passover lamb , has been sacrificed .
46005008	Let us celebrate our Passover , then , not with bread having the old yeast of sin and wickedness , but with the bread that has no yeast , the bread of purity and truth .
46005009	In the letter that I wrote you I told you not to associate with immoral people .
46005010	Now I did not mean pagans who are immoral or greedy or are thieves , or who worship idols . To avoid them you would have to get out of the world completely .
46005011	What I meant was that you should not associate with a person who calls himself a believer but is immoral or greedy or worships idols or is a slanderer or a drunkard or a thief . Don't even sit down to eat with such a person .
46006001	If any of you have a dispute with another Christian , how dare you go before heathen judges instead of letting God's people settle the matter ?
46006002	Don't you know that God's people will judge the world ? Well , then , if you are to judge the world , aren't you capable of judging small matters ?
46006003	Do you not know that we shall judge the angels ? How much more , then , the things of this life !
46006004	If such matters come up , are you going to take them to be settled by people who have no standing in the church ?
46006005	Shame on you ! Surely there is at least one wise person in your fellowship who can settle a dispute between fellow Christians .
46006006	Instead , one Christian goes to court against another and lets unbelievers judge the case !
46006007	The very fact that you have legal disputes among yourselves shows that you have failed completely . Would it not be better for you to be wronged ? Would it not be better for you to be robbed ?
46006008	Instead , you yourselves wrong one another and rob one another , even other believers !
46006009	Surely you know that the wicked will not possess God's Kingdom . Do not fool yourselves ; people who are immoral or who worship idols or are adulterers or homosexual perverts
46006010	or who steal or are greedy or are drunkards or who slander others or are thieves—none of these will possess God's Kingdom .
46006011	Some of you were like that . But you have been purified from sin ; you have been dedicated to God ; you have been put right with God by the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God .
46006012	Someone will say , “ I am allowed to do anything . ” Yes ; but not everything is good for you . I could say that I am allowed to do anything , but I am not going to let anything make me its slave .
46006013	Someone else will say , “ Food is for the stomach , and the stomach is for food . ” Yes ; but God will put an end to both . The body is not to be used for sexual immorality , but to serve the Lord ; and the Lord provides for the body .
46006014	God raised the Lord from death , and he will also raise us by his power .
46006015	You know that your bodies are parts of the body of Christ . Shall I take a part of Christ's body and make it part of the body of a prostitute ? Impossible !
46006016	Or perhaps you don't know that the man who joins his body to a prostitute becomes physically one with her ? The scripture says quite plainly , “ The two will become one body . ”
46006017	But he who joins himself to the Lord becomes spiritually one with him .
46006018	Avoid immorality . Any other sin a man commits does not affect his body ; but the man who is guilty of sexual immorality sins against his own body .
46006019	Don't you know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit , who lives in you and who was given to you by God ? You do not belong to yourselves but to God ;
46006020	he bought you for a price . So use your bodies for God's glory .
46007001	Now , to deal with the matters you wrote about . A man does well not to marry .
46007002	But because there is so much immorality , every man should have his own wife , and every woman should have her own husband .
46007003	A man should fulfill his duty as a husband , and a woman should fulfill her duty as a wife , and each should satisfy the other's needs .
46007004	A wife is not the master of her own body , but her husband is ; in the same way a husband is not the master of his own body , but his wife is .
46007005	Do not deny yourselves to each other , unless you first agree to do so for a while in order to spend your time in prayer ; but then resume normal marital relations . In this way you will be kept from giving in to Satan's temptation because of your lack of self-control .
46007006	I tell you this not as an order , but simply as a permission .
46007007	Actually I would prefer that all of you were as I am ; but each one has a special gift from God , one person this gift , another one that gift .
46007008	Now , to the unmarried and to the widows I say that it would be better for you to continue to live alone as I do .
46007009	But if you cannot restrain your desires , go ahead and marry—it is better to marry than to burn with passion .
46007010	For married people I have a command which is not my own but the Lord's : a wife must not leave her husband ;
46007011	but if she does , she must remain single or else be reconciled to her husband ; and a husband must not divorce his wife .
46007012	To the others I say ( I , myself , not the Lord ) : if a Christian man has a wife who is an unbeliever and she agrees to go on living with him , he must not divorce her .
46007013	And if a Christian woman is married to a man who is an unbeliever and he agrees to go on living with her , she must not divorce him .
46007014	For the unbelieving husband is made acceptable to God by being united to his wife , and the unbelieving wife is made acceptable to God by being united to her Christian husband . If this were not so , their children would be like pagan children ; but as it is , they are acceptable to God .
46007015	However , if the one who is not a believer wishes to leave the Christian partner , let it be so . In such cases the Christian partner , whether husband or wife , is free to act . God has called you to live in peace .
46007016	How can you be sure , Christian wife , that you will not save your husband ? Or how can you be sure , Christian husband , that you will not save your wife ?
46007017	Each of you should go on living according to the Lord's gift to you , and as you were when God called you . This is the rule I teach in all the churches .
46007018	If a circumcised man has accepted God's call , he should not try to remove the marks of circumcision ; if an uncircumcised man has accepted God's call , he should not get circumcised .
46007019	For whether or not a man is circumcised means nothing ; what matters is to obey God's commandments .
46007020	Each of you should remain as you were when you accepted God's call .
46007021	Were you a slave when God called you ? Well , never mind ; but if you have a chance to become free , use it .
46007022	For a slave who has been called by the Lord is the Lord's free person ; in the same way a free person who has been called by Christ is his slave .
46007023	God bought you for a price ; so do not become slaves of people .
46007024	My friends , each of you should remain in fellowship with God in the same condition that you were when you were called .
46007025	Now , concerning what you wrote about unmarried people : I do not have a command from the Lord , but I give my opinion as one who by the Lord's mercy is worthy of trust .
46007026	Considering the present distress , I think it is better for a man to stay as he is .
46007027	Do you have a wife ? Then don't try to get rid of her . Are you unmarried ? Then don't look for a wife .
46007028	But if you do marry , you haven't committed a sin ; and if an unmarried woman marries , she hasn't committed a sin . But I would rather spare you the everyday troubles that married people will have .
46007029	What I mean , my friends , is this : there is not much time left , and from now on married people should live as though they were not married ;
46007030	those who weep , as though they were not sad ; those who laugh , as though they were not happy ; those who buy , as though they did not own what they bought ;
46007031	those who deal in material goods , as though they were not fully occupied with them . For this world , as it is now , will not last much longer .
46007032	I would like you to be free from worry . An unmarried man concerns himself with the Lord's work , because he is trying to please the Lord .
46007033	But a married man concerns himself with worldly matters , because he wants to please his wife ;
46007034	and so he is pulled in two directions . An unmarried woman or a virgin concerns herself with the Lord's work , because she wants to be dedicated both in body and spirit ; but a married woman concerns herself with worldly matters , because she wants to please her husband .
46007035	I am saying this because I want to help you . I am not trying to put restrictions on you . Instead , I want you to do what is right and proper , and to give yourselves completely to the Lord's service without any reservation .
46007036	In the case of an engaged couple who have decided not to marry : if the man feels that he is not acting properly toward the young woman and if his passions are too strong and he feels that they ought to marry , then they should get married , as he wants to . There is no sin in this .
46007037	But if a man , without being forced to do so , has firmly made up his mind not to marry , and if he has his will under complete control and has already decided in his own mind what to do—then he does well not to marry the young woman .
46007038	So the man who marries does well , but the one who doesn't marry does even better .
46007039	A married woman is not free as long as her husband lives ; but if her husband dies , then she is free to be married to any man she wishes , but only if he is a Christian .
46007040	She will be happier , however , if she stays as she is . That is my opinion , and I think that I too have God's Spirit .
46008001	Now , concerning what you wrote about food offered to idols . It is true , of course , that “ all of us have knowledge , ” as they say . Such knowledge , however , puffs a person up with pride ; but love builds up .
46008002	Those who think they know something really don't know as they ought to know .
46008003	But the person who loves God is known by him .
46008004	So then , about eating the food offered to idols : we know that an idol stands for something that does not really exist ; we know that there is only the one God .
46008005	Even if there are so-called “ gods , ” whether in heaven or on earth , and even though there are many of these “ gods ” and “ lords , ”
46008006	yet there is for us only one God , the Father , who is the Creator of all things and for whom we live ; and there is only one Lord , Jesus Christ , through whom all things were created and through whom we live .
46008007	But not everyone knows this truth . Some people have been so used to idols that to this day when they eat such food they still think of it as food that belongs to an idol ; their conscience is weak , and they feel they are defiled by the food .
46008008	Food , however , will not improve our relation with God ; we shall not lose anything if we do not eat , nor shall we gain anything if we do eat .
46008009	Be careful , however , not to let your freedom of action make those who are weak in the faith fall into sin .
46008010	Suppose a person whose conscience is weak in this matter sees you , who have so-called “ knowledge , ” eating in the temple of an idol ; will not this encourage him to eat food offered to idols ?
46008011	And so this weak person , your brother for whom Christ died , will perish because of your “ knowledge ” !
46008012	And in this way you will be sinning against Christ by sinning against other Christians and wounding their weak conscience .
46008013	So then , if food makes a believer sin , I will never eat meat again , so as not to make a believer fall into sin .
46009001	Am I not a free man ? Am I not an apostle ? Haven't I seen Jesus our Lord ? And aren't you the result of my work for the Lord ?
46009002	Even if others do not accept me as an apostle , surely you do ! Because of your life in union with the Lord you yourselves are proof of the fact that I am an apostle .
46009003	When people criticize me , this is how I defend myself :
46009004	Don't I have the right to be given food and drink for my work ?
46009005	Don't I have the right to follow the example of the other apostles and the Lord's brothers and Peter , by taking a Christian wife with me on my trips ?
46009006	Or are Barnabas and I the only ones who have to work for our living ?
46009007	What soldiers ever have to pay their own expenses in the army ? What farmers do not eat the grapes from their own vineyard ? What shepherds do not use the milk from their own sheep ?
46009008	I don't have to limit myself to these everyday examples , because the Law says the same thing .
46009009	We read in the Law of Moses , “ Do not muzzle an ox when you are using it to thresh grain . ” Now , is God concerned about oxen ?
46009010	Didn't he really mean us when he said that ? Of course that was written for us . Anyone who plows and anyone who reaps should do their work in the hope of getting a share of the crop .
46009011	We have sown spiritual seed among you . Is it too much if we reap material benefits from you ?
46009012	If others have the right to expect this from you , don't we have an even greater right ? But we haven't made use of this right . Instead , we have endured everything in order not to put any obstacle in the way of the Good News about Christ .
46009013	Surely you know that the men who work in the Temple get their food from the Temple and that those who offer the sacrifices on the altar get a share of the sacrifices .
46009014	In the same way , the Lord has ordered that those who preach the gospel should get their living from it .
46009015	But I haven't made use of any of these rights , nor am I writing this now in order to claim such rights for myself . I would rather die first ! Nobody is going to turn my rightful boast into empty words !
46009016	I have no right to boast just because I preach the gospel . After all , I am under orders to do so . And how terrible it would be for me if I did not preach the gospel !
46009017	If I did my work as a matter of free choice , then I could expect to be paid ; but I do it as a matter of duty , because God has entrusted me with this task .
46009018	What pay do I get , then ? It is the privilege of preaching the Good News without charging for it , without claiming my rights in my work for the gospel .
46009019	I am a free man , nobody's slave ; but I make myself everybody's slave in order to win as many people as possible .
46009020	While working with the Jews , I live like a Jew in order to win them ; and even though I myself am not subject to the Law of Moses , I live as though I were when working with those who are , in order to win them .
46009021	In the same way , when working with Gentiles , I live like a Gentile , outside the Jewish Law , in order to win Gentiles . This does not mean that I don't obey God's law ; I am really under Christ's law .
46009022	Among the weak in faith I become weak like one of them , in order to win them . So I become all things to all people , that I may save some of them by whatever means are possible .
46009023	All this I do for the gospel's sake , in order to share in its blessings .
46009024	Surely you know that many runners take part in a race , but only one of them wins the prize . Run , then , in such a way as to win the prize .
46009025	Every athlete in training submits to strict discipline , in order to be crowned with a wreath that will not last ; but we do it for one that will last forever .
46009026	That is why I run straight for the finish line ; that is why I am like a boxer who does not waste his punches .
46009027	I harden my body with blows and bring it under complete control , to keep myself from being disqualified after having called others to the contest .
46010001	I want you to remember , my friends , what happened to our ancestors who followed Moses . They were all under the protection of the cloud , and all passed safely through the Red Sea .
46010002	In the cloud and in the sea they were all baptized as followers of Moses .
46010003	All ate the same spiritual bread
46010004	and drank the same spiritual drink . They drank from the spiritual rock that went with them ; and that rock was Christ himself .
46010005	But even then God was not pleased with most of them , and so their dead bodies were scattered over the desert .
46010006	Now , all of this is an example for us , to warn us not to desire evil things , as they did ,
46010007	nor to worship idols , as some of them did . As the scripture says , “ The people sat down to a feast which turned into an orgy of drinking and sex . ”
46010008	We must not be guilty of sexual immorality , as some of them were—and in one day twenty-three thousand of them fell dead .
46010009	We must not put the Lord to the test , as some of them did—and they were killed by snakes .
46010010	We must not complain , as some of them did—and they were destroyed by the Angel of Death .
46010011	All these things happened to them as examples for others , and they were written down as a warning for us . For we live at a time when the end is about to come .
46010012	If you think you are standing firm you had better be careful that you do not fall .
46010013	Every test that you have experienced is the kind that normally comes to people . But God keeps his promise , and he will not allow you to be tested beyond your power to remain firm ; at the time you are put to the test , he will give you the strength to endure it , and so provide you with a way out .
46010014	So then , my dear friends , keep away from the worship of idols .
46010015	I speak to you as sensible people ; judge for yourselves what I say .
46010016	The cup we use in the Lord's Supper and for which we give thanks to God : when we drink from it , we are sharing in the blood of Christ . And the bread we break : when we eat it , we are sharing in the body of Christ .
46010017	Because there is the one loaf of bread , all of us , though many , are one body , for we all share the same loaf .
46010018	Consider the people of Israel ; those who eat what is offered in sacrifice share in the altar's service to God .
46010019	Do I imply , then , that an idol or the food offered to it really amounts to anything ?
46010020	No ! What I am saying is that what is sacrificed on pagan altars is offered to demons , not to God . And I do not want you to be partners with demons .
46010021	You cannot drink from the Lord's cup and also from the cup of demons ; you cannot eat at the Lord's table and also at the table of demons .
46010022	Or do we want to make the Lord jealous ? Do we think that we are stronger than he ?
46010023	“ We are allowed to do anything , ” so they say . That is true , but not everything is good . “ We are allowed to do anything ” —but not everything is helpful .
46010024	None of you should be looking out for your own interests , but for the interests of others .
46010025	You are free to eat anything sold in the meat market , without asking any questions because of your conscience .
46010026	For , as the scripture says , “ The earth and everything in it belong to the Lord . ”
46010027	If an unbeliever invites you to a meal and you decide to go , eat what is set before you , without asking any questions because of your conscience .
46010028	But if someone tells you , “ This food was offered to idols , ” then do not eat that food , for the sake of the one who told you and for conscience' sake—
46010029	that is , not your own conscience , but the other person's conscience . “ Well , then , ” someone asks , “ why should my freedom to act be limited by another person's conscience ?
46010030	If I thank God for my food , why should anyone criticize me about food for which I give thanks ? ”
46010031	Well , whatever you do , whether you eat or drink , do it all for God's glory .
46010032	Live in such a way as to cause no trouble either to Jews or Gentiles or to the church of God .
46010033	Just do as I do ; I try to please everyone in all that I do , not thinking of my own good , but of the good of all , so that they might be saved .
46011001	Imitate me , then , just as I imitate Christ .
46011002	I praise you because you always remember me and follow the teachings that I have handed on to you .
46011003	But I want you to understand that Christ is supreme over every man , the husband is supreme over his wife , and God is supreme over Christ .
46011004	So a man who prays or proclaims God's message in public worship with his head covered disgraces Christ .
46011005	And any woman who prays or proclaims God's message in public worship with nothing on her head disgraces her husband ; there is no difference between her and a woman whose head has been shaved .
46011006	If the woman does not cover her head , she might as well cut her hair . And since it is a shameful thing for a woman to shave her head or cut her hair , she should cover her head .
46011007	A man has no need to cover his head , because he reflects the image and glory of God . But woman reflects the glory of man ;
46011008	for man was not created from woman , but woman from man .
46011009	Nor was man created for woman's sake , but woman was created for man's sake .
46011010	On account of the angels , then , a woman should have a covering over her head to show that she is under her husband's authority .
46011011	In our life in the Lord , however , woman is not independent of man , nor is man independent of woman .
46011012	For as woman was made from man , in the same way man is born of woman ; and it is God who brings everything into existence .
46011013	Judge for yourselves whether it is proper for a woman to pray to God in public worship with nothing on her head .
46011014	Why , nature itself teaches you that long hair on a man is a disgrace ,
46011015	but on a woman it is a thing of beauty . Her long hair has been given her to serve as a covering .
46011016	But if anyone wants to argue about it , all I have to say is that neither we nor the churches of God have any other custom in worship .
46011017	In the following instructions , however , I do not praise you , because your meetings for worship actually do more harm than good .
46011018	In the first place , I have been told that there are opposing groups in your meetings ; and this I believe is partly true . (
46011019	No doubt there must be divisions among you so that the ones who are in the right may be clearly seen . )
46011020	When you meet together as a group , it is not the Lord's Supper that you eat .
46011021	For as you eat , you each go ahead with your own meal , so that some are hungry while others get drunk .
46011022	Don't you have your own homes in which to eat and drink ? Or would you rather despise the church of God and put to shame the people who are in need ? What do you expect me to say to you about this ? Shall I praise you ? Of course I don't !
46011023	For I received from the Lord the teaching that I passed on to you : that the Lord Jesus , on the night he was betrayed , took a piece of bread ,
46011024	gave thanks to God , broke it , and said , “ This is my body , which is for you . Do this in memory of me . ”
46011025	In the same way , after the supper he took the cup and said , “ This cup is God's new covenant , sealed with my blood . Whenever you drink it , do so in memory of me . ”
46011026	This means that every time you eat this bread and drink from this cup you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes .
46011027	It follows that if one of you eats the Lord's bread or drinks from his cup in a way that dishonors him , you are guilty of sin against the Lord's body and blood .
46011028	So then , you should each examine yourself first , and then eat the bread and drink from the cup .
46011029	For if you do not recognize the meaning of the Lord's body when you eat the bread and drink from the cup , you bring judgment on yourself as you eat and drink .
46011030	That is why many of you are sick and weak , and several have died .
46011031	If we would examine ourselves first , we would not come under God's judgment .
46011032	But we are judged and punished by the Lord , so that we shall not be condemned together with the world .
46011033	So then , my friends , when you gather together to eat the Lord's Supper , wait for one another .
46011034	And if any of you are hungry , you should eat at home , so that you will not come under God's judgment as you meet together . As for the other matters , I will settle them when I come .
46012001	Now , concerning what you wrote about the gifts from the Holy Spirit . I want you to know the truth about them , my friends .
46012002	You know that while you were still heathen , you were led astray in many ways to the worship of lifeless idols .
46012003	I want you to know that no one who is led by God's Spirit can say “ A curse on Jesus ! ” and no one can confess “ Jesus is Lord , ” without being guided by the Holy Spirit .
46012004	There are different kinds of spiritual gifts , but the same Spirit gives them .
46012005	There are different ways of serving , but the same Lord is served .
46012006	There are different abilities to perform service , but the same God gives ability to all for their particular service .
46012007	The Spirit's presence is shown in some way in each person for the good of all .
46012008	The Spirit gives one person a message full of wisdom , while to another person the same Spirit gives a message full of knowledge .
46012009	One and the same Spirit gives faith to one person , while to another person he gives the power to heal .
46012010	The Spirit gives one person the power to work miracles ; to another , the gift of speaking God's message ; and to yet another , the ability to tell the difference between gifts that come from the Spirit and those that do not . To one person he gives the ability to speak in strange tongues , and to another he gives the ability to explain what is said .
46012011	But it is one and the same Spirit who does all this ; as he wishes , he gives a different gift to each person .
46012012	Christ is like a single body , which has many parts ; it is still one body , even though it is made up of different parts .
46012013	In the same way , all of us , whether Jews or Gentiles , whether slaves or free , have been baptized into the one body by the same Spirit , and we have all been given the one Spirit to drink .
46012014	For the body itself is not made up of only one part , but of many parts .
46012015	If the foot were to say , “ Because I am not a hand , I don't belong to the body , ” that would not keep it from being a part of the body .
46012016	And if the ear were to say , “ Because I am not an eye , I don't belong to the body , ” that would not keep it from being a part of the body .
46012017	If the whole body were just an eye , how could it hear ? And if it were only an ear , how could it smell ?
46012018	As it is , however , God put every different part in the body just as he wanted it to be .
46012019	There would not be a body if it were all only one part !
46012020	As it is , there are many parts but one body .
46012021	So then , the eye cannot say to the hand , “ I don't need you ! ” Nor can the head say to the feet , “ Well , I don't need you ! ”
46012022	On the contrary , we cannot do without the parts of the body that seem to be weaker ;
46012023	and those parts that we think aren't worth very much are the ones which we treat with greater care ; while the parts of the body which don't look very nice are treated with special modesty ,
46012024	which the more beautiful parts do not need . God himself has put the body together in such a way as to give greater honor to those parts that need it .
46012025	And so there is no division in the body , but all its different parts have the same concern for one another .
46012026	If one part of the body suffers , all the other parts suffer with it ; if one part is praised , all the other parts share its happiness .
46012027	All of you are Christ's body , and each one is a part of it .
46012028	In the church God has put all in place : in the first place apostles , in the second place prophets , and in the third place teachers ; then those who perform miracles , followed by those who are given the power to heal or to help others or to direct them or to speak in strange tongues .
46012029	They are not all apostles or prophets or teachers . Not everyone has the power to work miracles
46012030	or to heal diseases or to speak in strange tongues or to explain what is said .
46012031	Set your hearts , then , on the more important gifts . Best of all , however , is the following way .
46013001	I may be able to speak the languages of human beings and even of angels , but if I have no love , my speech is no more than a noisy gong or a clanging bell .
46013002	I may have the gift of inspired preaching ; I may have all knowledge and understand all secrets ; I may have all the faith needed to move mountains—but if I have no love , I am nothing .
46013003	I may give away everything I have , and even give up my body to be burned —but if I have no love , this does me no good .
46013004	Love is patient and kind ; it is not jealous or conceited or proud ;
46013005	love is not ill-mannered or selfish or irritable ; love does not keep a record of wrongs ;
46013006	love is not happy with evil , but is happy with the truth .
46013007	Love never gives up ; and its faith , hope , and patience never fail .
46013008	Love is eternal . There are inspired messages , but they are temporary ; there are gifts of speaking in strange tongues , but they will cease ; there is knowledge , but it will pass .
46013009	For our gifts of knowledge and of inspired messages are only partial ;
46013010	but when what is perfect comes , then what is partial will disappear .
46013011	When I was a child , my speech , feelings , and thinking were all those of a child ; now that I am an adult , I have no more use for childish ways .
46013012	What we see now is like a dim image in a mirror ; then we shall see face-to-face . What I know now is only partial ; then it will be complete—as complete as God's knowledge of me .
46013013	Meanwhile these three remain : faith , hope , and love ; and the greatest of these is love .
46014001	It is love , then , that you should strive for . Set your hearts on spiritual gifts , especially the gift of proclaiming God's message .
46014002	Those who speak in strange tongues do not speak to others but to God , because no one understands them . They are speaking secret truths by the power of the Spirit .
46014003	But those who proclaim God's message speak to people and give them help , encouragement , and comfort .
46014004	Those who speak in strange tongues help only themselves , but those who proclaim God's message help the whole church .
46014005	I would like for all of you to speak in strange tongues ; but I would rather that you had the gift of proclaiming God's message . For the person who proclaims God's message is of greater value than the one who speaks in strange tongues—unless there is someone present who can explain what is said , so that the whole church may be helped .
46014006	So when I come to you , my friends , what use will I be to you if I speak in strange tongues ? Not a bit , unless I bring you some revelation from God or some knowledge or some inspired message or some teaching .
46014007	Take such lifeless musical instruments as the flute or the harp—how will anyone know the tune that is being played unless the notes are sounded distinctly ?
46014008	And if the one who plays the bugle does not sound a clear call , who will prepare for battle ?
46014009	In the same way , how will anyone understand what you are talking about if your message given in strange tongues is not clear ? Your words will vanish in the air !
46014010	There are many different languages in the world , yet none of them is without meaning .
46014011	But if I do not know the language being spoken , those who use it will be foreigners to me and I will be a foreigner to them .
46014012	Since you are eager to have the gifts of the Spirit , you must try above everything else to make greater use of those which help to build up the church .
46014013	The person who speaks in strange tongues , then , must pray for the gift to explain what is said .
46014014	For if I pray in this way , my spirit prays indeed , but my mind has no part in it .
46014015	What should I do , then ? I will pray with my spirit , but I will pray also with my mind ; I will sing with my spirit , but I will sing also with my mind .
46014016	When you give thanks to God in spirit only , how can ordinary people taking part in the meeting say “ Amen ” to your prayer of thanksgiving ? They have no way of knowing what you are saying .
46014017	Even if your prayer of thanks to God is quite good , other people are not helped at all .
46014018	I thank God that I speak in strange tongues much more than any of you .
46014019	But in church worship I would rather speak five words that can be understood , in order to teach others , than speak thousands of words in strange tongues .
46014020	Do not be like children in your thinking , my friends ; be children so far as evil is concerned , but be grown up in your thinking .
46014021	In the Scriptures it is written , “ By means of people speaking strange languages I will speak to my people , says the Lord . I will speak through lips of foreigners , but even then my people will not listen to me . ”
46014023	If , then , the whole church meets together and everyone starts speaking in strange tongues—and if some ordinary people or unbelievers come in , won't they say that you are all crazy ?
46014024	But if everyone is proclaiming God's message when some unbelievers or ordinary people come in , they will be convinced of their sin by what they hear . They will be judged by all they hear ,
46014025	their secret thoughts will be brought into the open , and they will bow down and worship God , confessing , “ Truly God is here among you ! ”
46014026	This is what I mean , my friends . When you meet for worship , one person has a hymn , another a teaching , another a revelation from God , another a message in strange tongues , and still another the explanation of what is said . Everything must be of help to the church .
46014027	If someone is going to speak in strange tongues , two or three at the most should speak , one after the other , and someone else must explain what is being said .
46014028	But if no one is there who can explain , then the one who speaks in strange tongues must be quiet and speak only to himself and to God .
46014029	Two or three who are given God's message should speak , while the others are to judge what they say .
46014030	But if someone sitting in the meeting receives a message from God , the one who is speaking should stop .
46014031	All of you may proclaim God's message , one by one , so that everyone will learn and be encouraged .
46014032	The gift of proclaiming God's message should be under the speaker's control ,
46014033	because God does not want us to be in disorder but in harmony and peace . As in all the churches of God's people ,
46014034	the women should keep quiet in the meetings . They are not allowed to speak ; as the Jewish Law says , they must not be in charge .
46014035	If they want to find out about something , they should ask their husbands at home . It is a disgraceful thing for a woman to speak in a church meeting .
46014036	Or could it be that the word of God came from you ? Or are you the only ones to whom it came ?
46014037	If anyone supposes he is God's messenger or has a spiritual gift , he must realize that what I am writing to you is the Lord's command .
46014038	But if he does not pay attention to this , pay no attention to him .
46014039	So then , my friends , set your heart on proclaiming God's message , but do not forbid the speaking in strange tongues .
46014040	Everything must be done in a proper and orderly way .
46015001	And now I want to remind you , my friends , of the Good News which I preached to you , which you received , and on which your faith stands firm .
46015002	That is the gospel , the message that I preached to you . You are saved by the gospel if you hold firmly to it—unless it was for nothing that you believed .
46015003	I passed on to you what I received , which is of the greatest importance : that Christ died for our sins , as written in the Scriptures ;
46015004	that he was buried and that he was raised to life three days later , as written in the Scriptures ;
46015005	that he appeared to Peter and then to all twelve apostles .
46015006	Then he appeared to more than five hundred of his followers at once , most of whom are still alive , although some have died .
46015007	Then he appeared to James , and afterward to all the apostles .
46015008	Last of all he appeared also to me—even though I am like someone whose birth was abnormal .
46015009	For I am the least of all the apostles—I do not even deserve to be called an apostle , because I persecuted God's church .
46015010	But by God's grace I am what I am , and the grace that he gave me was not without effect . On the contrary , I have worked harder than any of the other apostles , although it was not really my own doing , but God's grace working with me .
46015011	So then , whether it came from me or from them , this is what we all preach , and this is what you believe .
46015012	Now , since our message is that Christ has been raised from death , how can some of you say that the dead will not be raised to life ?
46015013	If that is true , it means that Christ was not raised ;
46015014	and if Christ has not been raised from death , then we have nothing to preach and you have nothing to believe .
46015015	More than that , we are shown to be lying about God , because we said that he raised Christ from death—but if it is true that the dead are not raised to life , then he did not raise Christ .
46015016	For if the dead are not raised , neither has Christ been raised .
46015017	And if Christ has not been raised , then your faith is a delusion and you are still lost in your sins .
46015018	It would also mean that the believers in Christ who have died are lost .
46015019	If our hope in Christ is good for this life only and no more , then we deserve more pity than anyone else in all the world .
46015020	But the truth is that Christ has been raised from death , as the guarantee that those who sleep in death will also be raised .
46015021	For just as death came by means of a man , in the same way the rising from death comes by means of a man .
46015022	For just as all people die because of their union with Adam , in the same way all will be raised to life because of their union with Christ .
46015023	But each one will be raised in proper order : Christ , first of all ; then , at the time of his coming , those who belong to him .
46015024	Then the end will come ; Christ will overcome all spiritual rulers , authorities , and powers , and will hand over the Kingdom to God the Father .
46015025	For Christ must rule until God defeats all enemies and puts them under his feet .
46015026	The last enemy to be defeated will be death .
46015027	For the scripture says , “ God put all things under his feet . ” It is clear , of course , that the words “ all things ” do not include God himself , who puts all things under Christ .
46015028	But when all things have been placed under Christ's rule , then he himself , the Son , will place himself under God , who placed all things under him ; and God will rule completely over all .
46015029	Now , what about those people who are baptized for the dead ? What do they hope to accomplish ? If it is true , as some claim , that the dead are not raised to life , why are those people being baptized for the dead ?
46015030	And as for us—why would we run the risk of danger every hour ?
46015031	My friends , I face death every day ! The pride I have in you , in our life in union with Christ Jesus our Lord , makes me declare this .
46015032	If I have , as it were , fought “ wild beasts ” here in Ephesus simply from human motives , what have I gained ? But if the dead are not raised to life , then , as the saying goes , “ Let us eat and drink , for tomorrow we will die . ”
46015033	Do not be fooled . “ Bad companions ruin good character . ”
46015034	Come back to your right senses and stop your sinful ways . I declare to your shame that some of you do not know God .
46015035	Someone will ask , “ How can the dead be raised to life ? What kind of body will they have ? ”
46015036	You fool ! When you plant a seed in the ground , it does not sprout to life unless it dies .
46015037	And what you plant is a bare seed , perhaps a grain of wheat or some other grain , not the full-bodied plant that will later grow up .
46015038	God provides that seed with the body he wishes ; he gives each seed its own proper body .
46015039	And the flesh of living beings is not all the same kind of flesh ; human beings have one kind of flesh , animals another , birds another , and fish another .
46015040	And there are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies ; the beauty that belongs to heavenly bodies is different from the beauty that belongs to earthly bodies .
46015041	The sun has its own beauty , the moon another beauty , and the stars a different beauty ; and even among stars there are different kinds of beauty .
46015042	This is how it will be when the dead are raised to life . When the body is buried , it is mortal ; when raised , it will be immortal .
46015043	When buried , it is ugly and weak ; when raised , it will be beautiful and strong .
46015044	When buried , it is a physical body ; when raised , it will be a spiritual body . There is , of course , a physical body , so there has to be a spiritual body .
46015045	For the scripture says , “ The first man , Adam , was created a living being ” ; but the last Adam is the life-giving Spirit .
46015046	It is not the spiritual that comes first , but the physical , and then the spiritual .
46015047	The first Adam , made of earth , came from the earth ; the second Adam came from heaven .
46015048	Those who belong to the earth are like the one who was made of earth ; those who are of heaven are like the one who came from heaven .
46015049	Just as we wear the likeness of the man made of earth , so we will wear the likeness of the Man from heaven .
46015050	What I mean , friends , is that what is made of flesh and blood cannot share in God's Kingdom , and what is mortal cannot possess immortality .
46015053	For what is mortal must be changed into what is immortal ; what will die must be changed into what cannot die .
46015054	So when this takes place , and the mortal has been changed into the immortal , then the scripture will come true : “ Death is destroyed ; victory is complete ! ”
46015055	“ Where , Death , is your victory ? Where , Death , is your power to hurt ? ”
46015058	So then , my dear friends , stand firm and steady . Keep busy always in your work for the Lord , since you know that nothing you do in the Lord's service is ever useless .
46016001	Now , concerning what you wrote about the money to be raised to help God's people in Judea . You must do what I told the churches in Galatia to do .
46016002	Every Sunday each of you must put aside some money , in proportion to what you have earned , and save it up , so that there will be no need to collect money when I come .
46016003	After I come , I shall give letters of introduction to those you have approved , and send them to take your gift to Jerusalem .
46016004	If it seems worthwhile for me to go , then they can go along with me .
46016005	I shall come to you after I have gone through Macedonia—for I have to go through Macedonia .
46016006	I shall probably spend some time with you , perhaps the whole winter , and then you can help me to continue my trip , wherever it is I shall go next .
46016007	I want to see you more than just briefly in passing ; I hope to spend quite a long time with you , if the Lord allows .
46016008	I will stay here in Ephesus until the day of Pentecost .
46016009	There is a real opportunity here for great and worthwhile work , even though there are many opponents .
46016010	If Timothy comes your way , be sure to make him feel welcome among you , because he is working for the Lord , just as I am .
46016011	No one should look down on him , but you must help him continue his trip in peace , so that he will come back to me ; for I am expecting him back with the believers .
46016012	Now , about brother Apollos . I have often encouraged him to visit you with the other believers , but he is not completely convinced that he should go at this time . When he gets the chance , however , he will go .
46016013	Be alert , stand firm in the faith , be brave , be strong .
46016014	Do all your work in love .
46016015	You know about Stephanas and his family ; they are the first Christian converts in Achaia and have given themselves to the service of God's people . I beg you , my friends ,
46016016	to follow the leadership of such people as these , and of anyone else who works and serves with them .
46016017	I am happy about the coming of Stephanas , Fortunatus , and Achaicus ; they have made up for your absence
46016018	and have cheered me up , just as they cheered you up . Such men as these deserve notice .
46016019	The churches in the province of Asia send you their greetings ; Aquila and Priscilla and the church that meets in their house send warm Christian greetings .
46016020	All the believers here send greetings . Greet one another with the kiss of peace .
46016021	With my own hand I write this : Greetings from Paul .
46016022	Whoever does not love the Lord—a curse on him ! Marana tha —Our Lord , come !
46016023	The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you .
46016024	My love be with you all in Christ Jesus .
47001001	From Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus by God's will , and from our brother Timothy— To the church of God in Corinth , and to all God's people throughout Achaia :
47001002	May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace .
47001003	Let us give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the merciful Father , the God from whom all help comes !
47001004	He helps us in all our troubles , so that we are able to help others who have all kinds of troubles , using the same help that we ourselves have received from God .
47001005	Just as we have a share in Christ's many sufferings , so also through Christ we share in God's great help .
47001006	If we suffer , it is for your help and salvation ; if we are helped , then you too are helped and given the strength to endure with patience the same sufferings that we also endure .
47001007	So our hope in you is never shaken ; we know that just as you share in our sufferings , you also share in the help we receive .
47001008	We want to remind you , friends , of the trouble we had in the province of Asia . The burdens laid upon us were so great and so heavy that we gave up all hope of staying alive .
47001009	We felt that the death sentence had been passed on us . But this happened so that we should rely , not on ourselves , but only on God , who raises the dead .
47001010	From such terrible dangers of death he saved us , and will save us ; and we have placed our hope in him that he will save us again ,
47001011	as you help us by means of your prayers for us . So it will be that the many prayers for us will be answered , and God will bless us ; and many will raise their voices to him in thanksgiving for us .
47001012	We are proud that our conscience assures us that our lives in this world , and especially our relations with you , have been ruled by God-given frankness and sincerity , by the power of God's grace and not by human wisdom .
47001015	I was so sure of all this that I made plans at first to visit you , in order that you might be blessed twice .
47001016	For I planned to visit you on my way to Macedonia and again on my way back , in order to get help from you for my trip to Judea .
47001017	In planning this , did I appear fickle ? When I make my plans , do I make them from selfish motives , ready to say “ Yes , yes ” and “ No , no ” at the same time ?
47001018	As surely as God speaks the truth , my promise to you was not a “ Yes ” and a “ No . ”
47001019	For Jesus Christ , the Son of God , who was preached among you by Silas , Timothy , and myself , is not one who is “ Yes ” and “ No . ” On the contrary , he is God's “ Yes ” ;
47001020	for it is he who is the “ Yes ” to all of God's promises . This is why through Jesus Christ our “ Amen ” is said to the glory of God .
47001021	It is God himself who makes us , together with you , sure of our life in union with Christ ; it is God himself who has set us apart ,
47001022	who has placed his mark of ownership upon us , and who has given us the Holy Spirit in our hearts as the guarantee of all that he has in store for us .
47001023	I call God as my witness—he knows my heart ! It was in order to spare you that I decided not to go to Corinth .
47001024	We are not trying to dictate to you what you must believe ; we know that you stand firm in the faith . Instead , we are working with you for your own happiness .
47002001	So I made up my mind not to come to you again to make you sad .
47002002	For if I were to make you sad , who would be left to cheer me up ? Only the very persons I had made sad .
47002003	That is why I wrote that letter to you—I did not want to come to you and be made sad by the very people who should make me glad . For I am convinced that when I am happy , then all of you are happy too .
47002004	I wrote you with a greatly troubled and distressed heart and with many tears ; my purpose was not to make you sad , but to make you realize how much I love you all .
47002005	Now , if anyone has made somebody sad , he has not done it to me but to all of you—in part , at least . ( I say this because I do not want to be too hard on him . )
47002006	It is enough that this person has been punished in this way by most of you .
47002007	Now , however , you should forgive him and encourage him , in order to keep him from becoming so sad as to give up completely .
47002008	And so I beg you to let him know that you really do love him .
47002009	I wrote you that letter because I wanted to find out how well you had stood the test and whether you are always ready to obey my instructions .
47002010	When you forgive people for what they have done , I forgive them too . For when I forgive—if , indeed , I need to forgive anything—I do it in Christ's presence because of you ,
47002011	in order to keep Satan from getting the upper hand over us ; for we know what his plans are .
47002012	When I arrived in Troas to preach the Good News about Christ , I found that the Lord had opened the way for the work there .
47002013	But I was deeply worried , because I could not find our brother Titus . So I said good-bye to the people there and went on to Macedonia .
47002014	But thanks be to God ! For in union with Christ we are always led by God as prisoners in Christ's victory procession . God uses us to make the knowledge about Christ spread everywhere like a sweet fragrance .
47002015	For we are like a sweet-smelling incense offered by Christ to God , which spreads among those who are being saved and those who are being lost .
47002016	For those who are being lost , it is a deadly stench that kills ; but for those who are being saved , it is a fragrance that brings life . Who , then , is capable for such a task ?
47002017	We are not like so many others , who handle God's message as if it were cheap merchandise ; but because God has sent us , we speak with sincerity in his presence , as servants of Christ .
47003001	Does this sound as if we were again boasting about ourselves ? Could it be that , like some other people , we need letters of recommendation to you or from you ?
47003002	You yourselves are the letter we have , written on our hearts for everyone to know and read .
47003003	It is clear that Christ himself wrote this letter and sent it by us . It is written , not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God , and not on stone tablets but on human hearts .
47003004	We say this because we have confidence in God through Christ .
47003005	There is nothing in us that allows us to claim that we are capable of doing this work . The capacity we have comes from God ;
47003006	it is he who made us capable of serving the new covenant , which consists not of a written law but of the Spirit . The written law brings death , but the Spirit gives life .
47003007	The Law was carved in letters on stone tablets , and God's glory appeared when it was given . Even though the brightness on Moses' face was fading , it was so strong that the people of Israel could not keep their eyes fixed on him . If the Law , which brings death when it is in force , came with such glory ,
47003008	how much greater is the glory that belongs to the activity of the Spirit !
47003009	The system which brings condemnation was glorious ; how much more glorious is the activity which brings salvation !
47003010	We may say that because of the far brighter glory now the glory that was so bright in the past is gone .
47003011	For if there was glory in that which lasted for a while , how much more glory is there in that which lasts forever !
47003012	Because we have this hope , we are very bold .
47003013	We are not like Moses , who had to put a veil over his face so that the people of Israel would not see the brightness fade and disappear .
47003014	Their minds , indeed , were closed ; and to this very day their minds are covered with the same veil as they read the books of the old covenant . The veil is removed only when a person is joined to Christ .
47003015	Even today , whenever they read the Law of Moses , the veil still covers their minds .
47003016	But it can be removed , as the scripture says about Moses : “ His veil was removed when he turned to the Lord . ”
47003017	Now , “ the Lord ” in this passage is the Spirit ; and where the Spirit of the Lord is present , there is freedom .
47003018	All of us , then , reflect the glory of the Lord with uncovered faces ; and that same glory , coming from the Lord , who is the Spirit , transforms us into his likeness in an ever greater degree of glory .
47004001	God in his mercy has given us this work to do , and so we do not become discouraged .
47004002	We put aside all secret and shameful deeds ; we do not act with deceit , nor do we falsify the word of God . In the full light of truth we live in God's sight and try to commend ourselves to everyone's good conscience .
47004003	For if the gospel we preach is hidden , it is hidden only from those who are being lost .
47004004	They do not believe , because their minds have been kept in the dark by the evil god of this world . He keeps them from seeing the light shining on them , the light that comes from the Good News about the glory of Christ , who is the exact likeness of God .
47004005	For it is not ourselves that we preach ; we preach Jesus Christ as Lord , and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake .
47004006	The God who said , “ Out of darkness the light shall shine ! ” is the same God who made his light shine in our hearts , to bring us the knowledge of God's glory shining in the face of Christ .
47004007	Yet we who have this spiritual treasure are like common clay pots , in order to show that the supreme power belongs to God , not to us .
47004008	We are often troubled , but not crushed ; sometimes in doubt , but never in despair ;
47004009	there are many enemies , but we are never without a friend ; and though badly hurt at times , we are not destroyed .
47004010	At all times we carry in our mortal bodies the death of Jesus , so that his life also may be seen in our bodies .
47004011	Throughout our lives we are always in danger of death for Jesus' sake , in order that his life may be seen in this mortal body of ours .
47004012	This means that death is at work in us , but life is at work in you .
47004013	The scripture says , “ I spoke because I believed . ” In the same spirit of faith we also speak because we believe .
47004014	We know that God , who raised the Lord Jesus to life , will also raise us up with Jesus and take us , together with you , into his presence .
47004015	All this is for your sake ; and as God's grace reaches more and more people , they will offer to the glory of God more prayers of thanksgiving .
47004016	For this reason we never become discouraged . Even though our physical being is gradually decaying , yet our spiritual being is renewed day after day .
47004017	And this small and temporary trouble we suffer will bring us a tremendous and eternal glory , much greater than the trouble .
47004018	For we fix our attention , not on things that are seen , but on things that are unseen . What can be seen lasts only for a time , but what cannot be seen lasts forever .
47005001	For we know that when this tent we live in—our body here on earth—is torn down , God will have a house in heaven for us to live in , a home he himself has made , which will last forever .
47005002	And now we sigh , so great is our desire that our home which comes from heaven should be put on over us ;
47005003	by being clothed with it we shall not be without a body .
47005004	While we live in this earthly tent , we groan with a feeling of oppression ; it is not that we want to get rid of our earthly body , but that we want to have the heavenly one put on over us , so that what is mortal will be transformed by life .
47005005	God is the one who has prepared us for this change , and he gave us his Spirit as the guarantee of all that he has in store for us .
47005006	So we are always full of courage . We know that as long as we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord's home .
47005007	For our life is a matter of faith , not of sight .
47005008	We are full of courage and would much prefer to leave our home in the body and be at home with the Lord .
47005009	More than anything else , however , we want to please him , whether in our home here or there .
47005010	For all of us must appear before Christ , to be judged by him . We will each receive what we deserve , according to everything we have done , good or bad , in our bodily life .
47005011	We know what it means to fear the Lord , and so we try to persuade others . God knows us completely , and I hope that in your hearts you know me as well .
47005012	We are not trying again to recommend ourselves to you ; rather , we are trying to give you a good reason to be proud of us , so that you will be able to answer those who boast about people's appearance and not about their character .
47005013	Are we really insane ? It is for God's sake . Or are we sane ? Then it is for your sake .
47005014	We are ruled by the love of Christ , now that we recognize that one man died for everyone , which means that they all share in his death .
47005015	He died for all , so that those who live should no longer live for themselves , but only for him who died and was raised to life for their sake .
47005016	No longer , then , do we judge anyone by human standards . Even if at one time we judged Christ according to human standards , we no longer do so .
47005017	Anyone who is joined to Christ is a new being ; the old is gone , the new has come .
47005018	All this is done by God , who through Christ changed us from enemies into his friends and gave us the task of making others his friends also .
47005019	Our message is that God was making all human beings his friends through Christ . God did not keep an account of their sins , and he has given us the message which tells how he makes them his friends .
47005020	Here we are , then , speaking for Christ , as though God himself were making his appeal through us . We plead on Christ's behalf : let God change you from enemies into his friends !
47005021	Christ was without sin , but for our sake God made him share our sin in order that in union with him we might share the righteousness of God .
47006001	In our work together with God , then , we beg you who have received God's grace not to let it be wasted .
47006002	Hear what God says : “ When the time came for me to show you favor , I heard you ; when the day arrived for me to save you , I helped you . ”
47006003	We do not want anyone to find fault with our work , so we try not to put obstacles in anyone's way .
47006004	Instead , in everything we do we show that we are God's servants by patiently enduring troubles , hardships , and difficulties .
47006005	We have been beaten , jailed , and mobbed ; we have been overworked and have gone without sleep or food .
47006006	By our purity , knowledge , patience , and kindness we have shown ourselves to be God's servants—by the Holy Spirit , by our true love ,
47006007	by our message of truth , and by the power of God . We have righteousness as our weapon , both to attack and to defend ourselves .
47006008	We are honored and disgraced ; we are insulted and praised . We are treated as liars , yet we speak the truth ;
47006009	as unknown , yet we are known by all ; as though we were dead , but , as you see , we live on . Although punished , we are not killed ;
47006010	although saddened , we are always glad ; we seem poor , but we make many people rich ; we seem to have nothing , yet we really possess everything .
47006011	Dear friends in Corinth ! We have spoken frankly to you ; we have opened our hearts wide .
47006012	It is not we who have closed our hearts to you ; it is you who have closed your hearts to us .
47006013	I speak now as though you were my children : show us the same feelings that we have for you . Open your hearts wide !
47006014	Do not try to work together as equals with unbelievers , for it cannot be done . How can right and wrong be partners ? How can light and darkness live together ?
47006015	How can Christ and the Devil agree ? What does a believer have in common with an unbeliever ?
47006016	How can God's temple come to terms with pagan idols ? For we are the temple of the living God ! As God himself has said , “ I will make my home with my people and live among them ; I will be their God , and they shall be my people . ” “ You must leave them and separate yourselves from them . Have nothing to do with what is unclean , and I will accept you .
47006018	I will be your father , and you shall be my sons and daughters , says the Lord Almighty . ”
47007001	All these promises are made to us , my dear friends . So then , let us purify ourselves from everything that makes body or soul unclean , and let us be completely holy by living in awe of God .
47007002	Make room for us in your hearts . We have wronged no one ; we have ruined no one , nor tried to take advantage of anyone .
47007003	I do not say this to condemn you ; for , as I have said before , you are so dear to us that we are always together , whether we live or die .
47007004	I am so sure of you ; I take such pride in you ! In all our troubles I am still full of courage ; I am running over with joy .
47007005	Even after we arrived in Macedonia , we did not have any rest . There were troubles everywhere , quarrels with others , fears in our hearts .
47007006	But God , who encourages the downhearted , encouraged us with the coming of Titus .
47007007	It was not only his coming that cheered us , but also his report of how you encouraged him . He told us how much you want to see me , how sorry you are , how ready you are to defend me ; and so I am even happier now .
47007008	For even if that letter of mine made you sad , I am not sorry I wrote it . I could have been sorry when I saw that it made you sad for a while .
47007009	But now I am happy—not because I made you sad , but because your sadness made you change your ways . That sadness was used by God , and so we caused you no harm .
47007010	For the sadness that is used by God brings a change of heart that leads to salvation—and there is no regret in that ! But sadness that is merely human causes death .
47007011	See what God did with this sadness of yours : how earnest it has made you , how eager to prove your innocence ! Such indignation , such alarm , such feelings , such devotion , such readiness to punish wrongdoing ! You have shown yourselves to be without fault in the whole matter .
47007012	So , even though I wrote that letter , it was not because of the one who did wrong or the one who was wronged . Instead , I wrote it to make plain to you , in God's sight , how deep your devotion to us really is .
47007013	That is why we were encouraged . Not only were we encouraged ; how happy Titus made us with his happiness over the way in which all of you helped to cheer him up !
47007014	I did boast of you to him , and you have not disappointed me . We have always spoken the truth to you , and in the same way the boast we made to Titus has proved true .
47007015	And so his love for you grows stronger , as he remembers how all of you were ready to obey his instructions , how you welcomed him with fear and trembling .
47007016	How happy I am that I can depend on you completely !
47008001	Our friends , we want you to know what God's grace has accomplished in the churches in Macedonia .
47008002	They have been severely tested by the troubles they went through ; but their joy was so great that they were extremely generous in their giving , even though they are very poor .
47008003	I can assure you that they gave as much as they could , and even more than they could . Of their own free will
47008004	they begged us and pleaded for the privilege of having a part in helping God's people in Judea .
47008005	It was more than we could have hoped for ! First they gave themselves to the Lord ; and then , by God's will they gave themselves to us as well .
47008006	So we urged Titus , who began this work , to continue it and help you complete this special service of love .
47008007	You are so rich in all you have : in faith , speech , and knowledge , in your eagerness to help and in your love for us . And so we want you to be generous also in this service of love .
47008008	I am not laying down any rules . But by showing how eager others are to help , I am trying to find out how real your own love is .
47008009	You know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ ; rich as he was , he made himself poor for your sake , in order to make you rich by means of his poverty .
47008010	My opinion is that it is better for you to finish now what you began last year . You were the first , not only to act , but also to be willing to act .
47008011	On with it , then , and finish the job ! Be as eager to finish it as you were to plan it , and do it with what you now have .
47008012	If you are eager to give , God will accept your gift on the basis of what you have to give , not on what you don't have .
47008015	As the scripture says , “ The one who gathered much did not have too much , and the one who gathered little did not have too little . ”
47008016	How we thank God for making Titus as eager as we are to help you !
47008017	Not only did he welcome our request ; he was so eager to help that of his own free will he decided to go to you .
47008018	With him we are sending the brother who is highly respected in all the churches for his work in preaching the gospel .
47008019	And besides that , he has been chosen and appointed by the churches to travel with us as we carry out this service of love for the sake of the Lord's glory and in order to show that we want to help .
47008020	We are being careful not to stir up any complaints about the way we handle this generous gift .
47008021	Our purpose is to do what is right , not only in the sight of the Lord , but also in the sight of others .
47008022	So we are sending our brother with them ; we have tested him many times and found him always very eager to help . And now that he has so much confidence in you , he is all the more eager to help .
47008023	As for Titus , he is my partner and works with me to help you ; as for the other brothers who are going with him , they represent the churches and bring glory to Christ .
47008024	Show your love to them , so that all the churches will be sure of it and know that we are right in boasting about you .
47009001	There is really no need for me to write you about the help being sent to God's people in Judea .
47009002	I know that you are willing to help , and I have boasted of you to the people in Macedonia . “ The believers in Achaia , ” I said , “ have been ready to help since last year . ” Your eagerness has stirred up most of them .
47009003	Now I am sending these believers , so that our boasting about you in this matter may not turn out to be empty words . But , just as I said , you will be ready with your help .
47009004	However , if the people from Macedonia should come with me and find out that you are not ready , how ashamed we would be—not to speak of your shame—for feeling so sure of you !
47009005	So I thought it was necessary to urge these believers to go to you ahead of me and get ready in advance the gift you promised to make . Then it will be ready when I arrive , and it will show that you give because you want to , not because you have to .
47009006	Remember that the person who plants few seeds will have a small crop ; the one who plants many seeds will have a large crop .
47009007	You should each give , then , as you have decided , not with regret or out of a sense of duty ; for God loves the one who gives gladly .
47009008	And God is able to give you more than you need , so that you will always have all you need for yourselves and more than enough for every good cause .
47009009	As the scripture says , “ He gives generously to the needy ; his kindness lasts forever . ”
47010001	I , Paul , make a personal appeal to you—I who am said to be meek and mild when I am with you , but harsh with you when I am away . By the gentleness and kindness of Christ
47010002	I beg you not to force me to be harsh when I come ; for I am sure I can deal harshly with those who say that we act from worldly motives .
47010003	It is true that we live in the world , but we do not fight from worldly motives .
47010004	The weapons we use in our fight are not the world's weapons but God's powerful weapons , which we use to destroy strongholds . We destroy false arguments ;
47010005	we pull down every proud obstacle that is raised against the knowledge of God ; we take every thought captive and make it obey Christ .
47010006	And after you have proved your complete loyalty , we will be ready to punish any act of disloyalty .
47010007	You are looking at the outward appearance of things . Are there some there who reckon themselves to belong to Christ ? Well , let them think again about themselves , because we belong to Christ just as much as they do .
47010008	For I am not ashamed , even if I have boasted somewhat too much about the authority that the Lord has given us—authority to build you up , not to tear you down .
47010009	I do not want it to appear that I am trying to frighten you with my letters .
47010010	Someone will say , “ Paul's letters are severe and strong , but when he is with us in person , he is weak , and his words are nothing ! ”
47010011	Such a person must understand that there is no difference between what we write in our letters when we are away and what we will do when we are there with you .
47010012	Of course we would not dare classify ourselves or compare ourselves with those who rate themselves so highly . How stupid they are ! They make up their own standards to measure themselves by , and they judge themselves by their own standards !
47010013	As for us , however , our boasting will not go beyond certain limits ; it will stay within the limits of the work which God has set for us , and this includes our work among you .
47010014	And since you are within those limits , we were not going beyond them when we came to you , bringing the Good News about Christ .
47010015	So we do not boast about the work that others have done beyond the limits God set for us . Instead , we hope that your faith may grow and that we may be able to do a much greater work among you , always within the limits that God has set .
47010016	Then we can preach the Good News in other countries beyond you and shall not have to boast about work already done in someone else's field .
47010017	But as the scripture says , “ Whoever wants to boast must boast about what the Lord has done . ”
47010018	For it is when the Lord thinks well of us that we are really approved , and not when we think well of ourselves .
47011001	I wish you would tolerate me , even when I am a bit foolish . Please do !
47011002	I am jealous for you , just as God is ; you are like a pure virgin whom I have promised in marriage to one man only , Christ himself .
47011003	I am afraid that your minds will be corrupted and that you will abandon your full and pure devotion to Christ—in the same way that Eve was deceived by the snake's clever lies .
47011004	For you gladly tolerate anyone who comes to you and preaches a different Jesus , not the one we preached ; and you accept a spirit and a gospel completely different from the Spirit and the gospel you received from us !
47011005	I do not think that I am the least bit inferior to those very special so-called “ apostles ” of yours !
47011006	Perhaps I am an amateur in speaking , but certainly not in knowledge ; we have made this clear to you at all times and in all conditions .
47011007	I did not charge you a thing when I preached the Good News of God to you ; I humbled myself in order to make you important . Was that wrong of me ?
47011008	While I was working among you , I was paid by other churches . I was robbing them , so to speak , in order to help you .
47011009	And during the time I was with you I did not bother you for help when I needed money ; the believers who came from Macedonia brought me everything I needed . As in the past , so in the future : I will never be a burden to you !
47011010	By Christ's truth in me , I promise that this boast of mine will not be silenced anywhere in all of Achaia .
47011011	Do I say this because I don't love you ? God knows I love you !
47011012	I will go on doing what I am doing now , in order to keep those other “ apostles ” from having any reason for boasting and saying that they work in the same way that we do .
47011013	Those men are not true apostles—they are false apostles , who lie about their work and disguise themselves to look like real apostles of Christ .
47011014	Well , no wonder ! Even Satan can disguise himself to look like an angel of light !
47011015	So it is no great thing if his servants disguise themselves to look like servants of righteousness . In the end they will get exactly what their actions deserve .
47011016	I repeat : no one should think that I am a fool . But if you do , at least accept me as a fool , just so I will have a little to boast of .
47011017	Of course what I am saying now is not what the Lord would have me say ; in this matter of boasting I am really talking like a fool .
47011018	But since there are so many who boast for merely human reasons , I will do the same .
47011019	You yourselves are so wise , and so you gladly tolerate fools !
47011020	You tolerate anyone who orders you around or takes advantage of you or traps you or looks down on you or slaps you in the face .
47011021	I am ashamed to admit that we were too timid to do those things ! But if anyone dares to boast about something—I am talking like a fool—I will be just as daring .
47011022	Are they Hebrews ? So am I . Are they Israelites ? So am I . Are they Abraham's descendants ? So am I .
47011023	Are they Christ's servants ? I sound like a madman—but I am a better servant than they are ! I have worked much harder , I have been in prison more times , I have been whipped much more , and I have been near death more often .
47011024	Five times I was given the thirty-nine lashes by the Jews ;
47011025	three times I was whipped by the Romans ; and once I was stoned . I have been in three shipwrecks , and once I spent twenty-four hours in the water .
47011026	In my many travels I have been in danger from floods and from robbers , in danger from my own people and from Gentiles ; there have been dangers in the cities , dangers in the wilds , dangers on the high seas , and dangers from false friends .
47011027	There has been work and toil ; often I have gone without sleep ; I have been hungry and thirsty ; I have often been without enough food , shelter , or clothing .
47011028	And not to mention other things , every day I am under the pressure of my concern for all the churches .
47011029	When someone is weak , then I feel weak too ; when someone is led into sin , I am filled with distress .
47011030	If I must boast , I will boast about things that show how weak I am .
47011031	The God and Father of the Lord Jesus—blessed be his name forever ! —knows that I am not lying .
47011032	When I was in Damascus , the governor under King Aretas placed guards at the city gates to arrest me .
47011033	But I was let down in a basket through an opening in the wall and escaped from him .
47012001	I have to boast , even though it doesn't do any good . But I will now talk about visions and revelations given me by the Lord .
47012002	I know a certain Christian man who fourteen years ago was snatched up to the highest heaven ( I do not know whether this actually happened or whether he had a vision—only God knows ) .
47012005	So I will boast about this man—but I will not boast about myself , except the things that show how weak I am .
47012006	If I wanted to boast , I would not be a fool , because I would be telling the truth . But I will not boast , because I do not want any of you to have a higher opinion of me than you have as a result of what you have seen me do and heard me say .
47012007	But to keep me from being puffed up with pride because of the many wonderful things I saw , I was given a painful physical ailment , which acts as Satan's messenger to beat me and keep me from being proud .
47012008	Three times I prayed to the Lord about this and asked him to take it away .
47012009	But his answer was : “ My grace is all you need , for my power is greatest when you are weak . ” I am most happy , then , to be proud of my weaknesses , in order to feel the protection of Christ's power over me .
47012010	I am content with weaknesses , insults , hardships , persecutions , and difficulties for Christ's sake . For when I am weak , then I am strong .
47012011	I am acting like a fool—but you have made me do it . You are the ones who ought to show your approval of me . For even if I am nothing , I am in no way inferior to those very special “ apostles ” of yours .
47012012	The many miracles and wonders that prove that I am an apostle were performed among you with much patience .
47012013	How were you treated any worse than the other churches , except that I did not bother you for financial help ? Please forgive me for being so unfair !
47012014	This is now the third time that I am ready to come to visit you—and I will not make any demands on you . It is you I want , not your money . After all , children should not have to provide for their parents , but parents should provide for their children .
47012015	I will be glad to spend all I have , and myself as well , in order to help you . Will you love me less because I love you so much ?
47012016	You will agree , then , that I was not a burden to you . But someone will say that I was tricky , and trapped you with lies .
47012017	How ? Did I take advantage of you through any of the messengers I sent ?
47012018	I begged Titus to go , and I sent the other believer with him . Would you say that Titus took advantage of you ? Do not he and I act from the very same motives and behave in the same way ?
47012019	Perhaps you think that all along we have been trying to defend ourselves before you . No ! We speak as Christ would have us speak in the presence of God , and everything we do , dear friends , is done to help you .
47012020	I am afraid that when I get there I will find you different from what I would like you to be and you will find me different from what you would like me to be . I am afraid that I will find quarreling and jealousy , hot tempers and selfishness , insults and gossip , pride and disorder .
47012021	I am afraid that the next time I come my God will humiliate me in your presence , and I shall weep over many who sinned in the past and have not repented of the immoral things they have done—their lust and their sexual sins .
47013001	This is now the third time that I am coming to visit you . “ Any accusation must be upheld by the evidence of two or more witnesses ” —as the scripture says .
47013002	I want to tell those of you who have sinned in the past , and all the others ; I said it before during my second visit to you , but I will say it again now that I am away : the next time I come nobody will escape punishment .
47013003	You will have all the proof you want that Christ speaks through me . When he deals with you , he is not weak ; instead , he shows his power among you .
47013004	For even though it was in weakness that he was put to death on the cross , it is by God's power that he lives . In union with him we also are weak ; but in our relations with you we shall share God's power in his life .
47013005	Put yourselves to the test and judge yourselves , to find out whether you are living in faith . Surely you know that Christ Jesus is in you ? —unless you have completely failed .
47013006	I trust you will know that we are not failures .
47013007	We pray to God that you will do no wrong—not in order to show that we are a success , but so that you may do what is right , even though we may seem to be failures .
47013008	For we cannot do a thing against the truth , but only for it .
47013009	We are glad when we are weak but you are strong . And so we also pray that you will become perfect .
47013010	That is why I write this while I am away from you ; it is so that when I arrive I will not have to deal harshly with you in using the authority that the Lord has given me—authority to build you up , not to tear you down .
47013011	And now , my friends , good-bye ! Strive for perfection ; listen to my appeals ; agree with one another ; live in peace . And the God of love and peace will be with you .
47013012	Greet one another with the kiss of peace . All of God's people send you their greetings .
47013013	
47013014	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ , the love of God , and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all .
48001001	From Paul , whose call to be an apostle did not come from human beings or by human means , but from Jesus Christ and God the Father , who raised him from death .
48001002	All the believers who are here join me in sending greetings to the churches of Galatia :
48001003	May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace .
48001004	In order to set us free from this present evil age , Christ gave himself for our sins , in obedience to the will of our God and Father .
48001005	To God be the glory forever and ever ! Amen .
48001006	I am surprised at you ! In no time at all you are deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ , and are accepting another gospel .
48001007	Actually , there is no “ other gospel , ” but I say this because there are some people who are upsetting you and trying to change the gospel of Christ .
48001008	But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel that is different from the one we preached to you , may he be condemned to hell !
48001009	We have said it before , and now I say it again : if anyone preaches to you a gospel that is different from the one you accepted , may he be condemned to hell !
48001010	Does this sound as if I am trying to win human approval ? No indeed ! What I want is God's approval ! Am I trying to be popular with people ? If I were still trying to do so , I would not be a servant of Christ .
48001011	Let me tell you , my friends , that the gospel I preach is not of human origin .
48001012	I did not receive it from any human being , nor did anyone teach it to me . It was Jesus Christ himself who revealed it to me .
48001013	You have been told how I used to live when I was devoted to the Jewish religion , how I persecuted without mercy the church of God and did my best to destroy it .
48001014	I was ahead of most other Jews of my age in my practice of the Jewish religion , and was much more devoted to the traditions of our ancestors .
48001015	But God in his grace chose me even before I was born , and called me to serve him . And when he decided
48001016	to reveal his Son to me , so that I might preach the Good News about him to the Gentiles , I did not go to anyone for advice ,
48001017	nor did I go to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before me . Instead , I went at once to Arabia , and then I returned to Damascus .
48001018	It was three years later that I went to Jerusalem to obtain information from Peter , and I stayed with him for two weeks .
48001019	I did not see any other apostle except James , the Lord's brother .
48001020	What I write is true . God knows that I am not lying !
48001021	Afterward I went to places in Syria and Cilicia .
48001022	At that time the members of the churches in Judea did not know me personally .
48001023	They knew only what others were saying : “ The man who used to persecute us is now preaching the faith that he once tried to destroy ! ”
48001024	And so they praised God because of me .
48002001	Fourteen years later I went back to Jerusalem with Barnabas , taking Titus along with me .
48002002	I went because God revealed to me that I should go . In a private meeting with the leaders I explained the gospel message that I preach to the Gentiles . I did not want my work in the past or in the present to be a failure .
48002003	My companion Titus , even though he is Greek , was not forced to be circumcised ,
48002004	although some wanted it done . Pretending to be believers , these men slipped into our group as spies , in order to find out about the freedom we have through our union with Christ Jesus . They wanted to make slaves of us ,
48002005	but in order to keep the truth of the gospel safe for you , we did not give in to them for a minute .
48002006	But those who seemed to be the leaders—I say this because it makes no difference to me what they were ; God does not judge by outward appearances—those leaders , I say , made no new suggestions to me .
48002007	On the contrary , they saw that God had given me the task of preaching the gospel to the Gentiles , just as he had given Peter the task of preaching the gospel to the Jews .
48002008	For by God's power I was made an apostle to the Gentiles , just as Peter was made an apostle to the Jews .
48002009	James , Peter , and John , who seemed to be the leaders , recognized that God had given me this special task ; so they shook hands with Barnabas and me , as a sign that we were all partners . We agreed that Barnabas and I would work among the Gentiles and they among the Jews .
48002010	All they asked was that we should remember the needy in their group , which is the very thing I have been eager to do .
48002011	But when Peter came to Antioch , I opposed him in public , because he was clearly wrong .
48002012	Before some men who had been sent by James arrived there , Peter had been eating with the Gentile believers . But after these men arrived , he drew back and would not eat with the Gentiles , because he was afraid of those who were in favor of circumcising them .
48002013	The other Jewish believers also started acting like cowards along with Peter ; and even Barnabas was swept along by their cowardly action .
48002014	When I saw that they were not walking a straight path in line with the truth of the gospel , I said to Peter in front of them all , “ You are a Jew , yet you have been living like a Gentile , not like a Jew . How , then , can you try to force Gentiles to live like Jews ? ”
48002015	Indeed , we are Jews by birth and not “ Gentile sinners , ” as they are called .
48002016	Yet we know that a person is put right with God only through faith in Jesus Christ , never by doing what the Law requires . We , too , have believed in Christ Jesus in order to be put right with God through our faith in Christ , and not by doing what the Law requires . For no one is put right with God by doing what the Law requires .
48002017	If , then , as we try to be put right with God by our union with Christ , we are found to be sinners , as much as the Gentiles are—does this mean that Christ is serving the cause of sin ? By no means !
48002018	If I start to rebuild the system of Law that I tore down , then I show myself to be someone who breaks the Law .
48002019	So far as the Law is concerned , however , I am dead—killed by the Law itself—in order that I might live for God . I have been put to death with Christ on his cross ,
48002020	so that it is no longer I who live , but it is Christ who lives in me . This life that I live now , I live by faith in the Son of God , who loved me and gave his life for me .
48002021	I refuse to reject the grace of God . But if a person is put right with God through the Law , it means that Christ died for nothing !
48003001	You foolish Galatians ! Who put a spell on you ? Before your very eyes you had a clear description of the death of Jesus Christ on the cross !
48003002	Tell me this one thing : did you receive God's Spirit by doing what the Law requires or by hearing the gospel and believing it ?
48003003	How can you be so foolish ! You began by God's Spirit ; do you now want to finish by your own power ?
48003004	Did all your experience mean nothing at all ? Surely it meant something !
48003005	Does God give you the Spirit and work miracles among you because you do what the Law requires or because you hear the gospel and believe it ?
48003006	Consider the experience of Abraham ; as the scripture says , “ He believed God , and because of his faith God accepted him as righteous . ”
48003007	You should realize , then , that the real descendants of Abraham are the people who have faith .
48003008	The scripture predicted that God would put the Gentiles right with himself through faith . And so the scripture announced the Good News to Abraham : “ Through you God will bless all people . ”
48003009	Abraham believed and was blessed ; so all who believe are blessed as he was .
48003010	Those who depend on obeying the Law live under a curse . For the scripture says , “ Whoever does not always obey everything that is written in the book of the Law is under God's curse ! ”
48003011	Now , it is clear that no one is put right with God by means of the Law , because the scripture says , “ Only the person who is put right with God through faith shall live . ”
48003012	But the Law has nothing to do with faith . Instead , as the scripture says , “ Whoever does everything the Law requires will live . ”
48003013	But by becoming a curse for us Christ has redeemed us from the curse that the Law brings ; for the scripture says , “ Anyone who is hanged on a tree is under God's curse . ”
48003014	Christ did this in order that the blessing which God promised to Abraham might be given to the Gentiles by means of Christ Jesus , so that through faith we might receive the Spirit promised by God .
48003015	My friends , I am going to use an everyday example : when two people agree on a matter and sign an agreement , no one can break it or add anything to it .
48003016	Now , God made his promises to Abraham and to his descendant . The scripture does not use the plural “ descendants , ” meaning many people , but the singular “ descendant , ” meaning one person only , namely , Christ .
48003017	What I mean is that God made a covenant with Abraham and promised to keep it . The Law , which was given four hundred and thirty years later , cannot break that covenant and cancel God's promise .
48003018	For if God's gift depends on the Law , then it no longer depends on his promise . However , it was because of his promise that God gave that gift to Abraham .
48003019	What , then , was the purpose of the Law ? It was added in order to show what wrongdoing is , and it was meant to last until the coming of Abraham's descendant , to whom the promise was made . The Law was handed down by angels , with a man acting as a go-between .
48003020	But a go-between is not needed when only one person is involved ; and God is one .
48003021	Does this mean that the Law is against God's promises ? No , not at all ! For if human beings had received a law that could bring life , then everyone could be put right with God by obeying it .
48003022	But the scripture says that the whole world is under the power of sin ; and so the gift which is promised on the basis of faith in Jesus Christ is given to those who believe .
48003023	But before the time for faith came , the Law kept us all locked up as prisoners until this coming faith should be revealed .
48003024	And so the Law was in charge of us until Christ came , in order that we might then be put right with God through faith .
48003025	Now that the time for faith is here , the Law is no longer in charge of us .
48003026	It is through faith that all of you are God's children in union with Christ Jesus .
48003027	You were baptized into union with Christ , and now you are clothed , so to speak , with the life of Christ himself .
48003028	So there is no difference between Jews and Gentiles , between slaves and free people , between men and women ; you are all one in union with Christ Jesus .
48003029	If you belong to Christ , then you are the descendants of Abraham and will receive what God has promised .
48004001	But now to continue—the son who will receive his father's property is treated just like a slave while he is young , even though he really owns everything .
48004002	While he is young , there are men who take care of him and manage his affairs until the time set by his father .
48004003	In the same way , we too were slaves of the ruling spirits of the universe before we reached spiritual maturity .
48004004	But when the right time finally came , God sent his own Son . He came as the son of a human mother and lived under the Jewish Law ,
48004005	to redeem those who were under the Law , so that we might become God's children .
48004006	To show that you are his children , God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts , the Spirit who cries out , “ Father , my Father . ”
48004007	So then , you are no longer a slave but a child . And since you are his child , God will give you all that he has for his children .
48004008	In the past you did not know God , and so you were slaves of beings who are not gods .
48004009	But now that you know God—or , I should say , now that God knows you—how is it that you want to turn back to those weak and pitiful ruling spirits ? Why do you want to become their slaves all over again ?
48004010	You pay special attention to certain days , months , seasons , and years .
48004011	I am worried about you ! Can it be that all my work for you has been for nothing ?
48004012	I beg you , my friends , be like me . After all , I am like you . You have not done me any wrong .
48004013	You remember why I preached the gospel to you the first time ; it was because I was sick .
48004014	But even though my physical condition was a great trial to you , you did not despise or reject me . Instead , you received me as you would an angel from heaven ; you received me as you would Christ Jesus .
48004015	You were so happy ! What has happened ? I myself can say that you would have taken out your own eyes , if you could , and given them to me .
48004016	Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth ?
48004017	Those other people show a deep interest in you , but their intentions are not good . All they want is to separate you from me , so that you will have the same interest in them as they have in you .
48004018	Now , it is good to have such a deep interest if the purpose is good—this is true always , and not merely when I am with you .
48004019	My dear children ! Once again , just like a mother in childbirth , I feel the same kind of pain for you until Christ's nature is formed in you .
48004020	How I wish I were with you now , so that I could take a different attitude toward you . I am so worried about you !
48004021	Let me ask those of you who want to be subject to the Law : do you not hear what the Law says ?
48004022	It says that Abraham had two sons , one by a slave woman , the other by a free woman .
48004023	His son by the slave woman was born in the usual way , but his son by the free woman was born as a result of God's promise .
48004024	These things can be understood as a figure : the two women represent two covenants . The one whose children are born in slavery is Hagar , and she represents the covenant made at Mount Sinai .
48004025	Hagar , who stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia , is a figure of the present city of Jerusalem , in slavery with all its people .
48004026	But the heavenly Jerusalem is free , and she is our mother .
48004027	For the scripture says , “ Be happy , you childless woman ! Shout and cry with joy , you who never felt the pains of childbirth ! For the woman who was deserted will have more children than the woman whose husband never left her . ”
48004028	Now , you , my friends , are God's children as a result of his promise , just as Isaac was .
48004029	At that time the son who was born in the usual way persecuted the one who was born because of God's Spirit ; and it is the same now .
48004030	But what does the scripture say ? It says , “ Send the slave woman and her son away ; for the son of the slave woman will not have a part of the father's property along with the son of the free woman . ”
48004031	So then , my friends , we are not the children of a slave woman but of a free woman .
48005001	Freedom is what we have—Christ has set us free ! Stand , then , as free people , and do not allow yourselves to become slaves again .
48005002	Listen ! I , Paul , tell you that if you allow yourselves to be circumcised , it means that Christ is of no use to you at all .
48005003	Once more I warn any man who allows himself to be circumcised that he is obliged to obey the whole Law .
48005004	Those of you who try to be put right with God by obeying the Law have cut yourselves off from Christ . You are outside God's grace .
48005005	As for us , our hope is that God will put us right with him ; and this is what we wait for by the power of God's Spirit working through our faith .
48005006	For when we are in union with Christ Jesus , neither circumcision nor the lack of it makes any difference at all ; what matters is faith that works through love .
48005007	You were doing so well ! Who made you stop obeying the truth ? How did he persuade you ?
48005008	It was not done by God , who calls you .
48005009	“ It takes only a little yeast to make the whole batch of dough rise , ” as they say .
48005010	But I still feel confident about you . Our life in union with the Lord makes me confident that you will not take a different view and that whoever is upsetting you will be punished by God .
48005011	But as for me , my friends , if I continue to preach that circumcision is necessary , why am I still being persecuted ? If that were true , then my preaching about the cross of Christ would cause no trouble .
48005012	I wish that the people who are upsetting you would go all the way ; let them go on and castrate themselves !
48005013	As for you , my friends , you were called to be free . But do not let this freedom become an excuse for letting your physical desires control you . Instead , let love make you serve one another .
48005014	For the whole Law is summed up in one commandment : “ Love your neighbor as you love yourself . ”
48005015	But if you act like wild animals , hurting and harming each other , then watch out , or you will completely destroy one another .
48005016	What I say is this : let the Spirit direct your lives , and you will not satisfy the desires of the human nature .
48005017	For what our human nature wants is opposed to what the Spirit wants , and what the Spirit wants is opposed to what our human nature wants . These two are enemies , and this means that you cannot do what you want to do .
48005018	If the Spirit leads you , then you are not subject to the Law .
48005019	What human nature does is quite plain . It shows itself in immoral , filthy , and indecent actions ;
48005020	in worship of idols and witchcraft . People become enemies and they fight ; they become jealous , angry , and ambitious . They separate into parties and groups ;
48005021	they are envious , get drunk , have orgies , and do other things like these . I warn you now as I have before : those who do these things will not possess the Kingdom of God .
48005022	But the Spirit produces love , joy , peace , patience , kindness , goodness , faithfulness ,
48005023	humility , and self-control . There is no law against such things as these .
48005024	And those who belong to Christ Jesus have put to death their human nature with all its passions and desires .
48005025	The Spirit has given us life ; he must also control our lives .
48005026	We must not be proud or irritate one another or be jealous of one another .
48006001	My friends , if someone is caught in any kind of wrongdoing , those of you who are spiritual should set him right ; but you must do it in a gentle way . And keep an eye on yourselves , so that you will not be tempted , too .
48006002	Help carry one another's burdens , and in this way you will obey the law of Christ .
48006003	If you think you are something when you really are nothing , you are only deceiving yourself .
48006004	You should each judge your own conduct . If it is good , then you can be proud of what you yourself have done , without having to compare it with what someone else has done .
48006005	For each of you have to carry your own load .
48006006	If you are being taught the Christian message , you should share all the good things you have with your teacher .
48006007	Do not deceive yourselves ; no one makes a fool of God . You will reap exactly what you plant .
48006008	If you plant in the field of your natural desires , from it you will gather the harvest of death ; if you plant in the field of the Spirit , from the Spirit you will gather the harvest of eternal life .
48006009	So let us not become tired of doing good ; for if we do not give up , the time will come when we will reap the harvest .
48006010	So then , as often as we have the chance , we should do good to everyone , and especially to those who belong to our family in the faith .
48006011	See what big letters I make as I write to you now with my own hand !
48006012	The people who are trying to force you to be circumcised are the ones who want to show off and boast about external matters . They do it , however , only so that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ .
48006013	Even those who practice circumcision do not obey the Law ; they want you to be circumcised so that they can boast that you submitted to this physical ceremony .
48006014	As for me , however , I will boast only about the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ ; for by means of his cross the world is dead to me , and I am dead to the world .
48006015	It does not matter at all whether or not one is circumcised ; what does matter is being a new creature .
48006016	As for those who follow this rule in their lives , may peace and mercy be with them—with them and with all of God's people !
48006017	To conclude : let no one give me any more trouble , because the scars I have on my body show that I am the slave of Jesus .
48006018	May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all , my friends . Amen .
49001001	From Paul , who by God's will is an apostle of Christ Jesus— To God's people in Ephesus , who are faithful in their life in union with Christ Jesus :
49001002	May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace .
49001003	Let us give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ! For in our union with Christ he has blessed us by giving us every spiritual blessing in the heavenly world .
49001004	Even before the world was made , God had already chosen us to be his through our union with Christ , so that we would be holy and without fault before him . Because of his love
49001005	God had already decided that through Jesus Christ he would make us his children—this was his pleasure and purpose .
49001006	Let us praise God for his glorious grace , for the free gift he gave us in his dear Son !
49001007	For by the blood of Christ we are set free , that is , our sins are forgiven . How great is the grace of God ,
49001008	which he gave to us in such large measure ! In all his wisdom and insight
49001009	God did what he had purposed , and made known to us the secret plan he had already decided to complete by means of Christ .
49001010	This plan , which God will complete when the time is right , is to bring all creation together , everything in heaven and on earth , with Christ as head .
49001011	All things are done according to God's plan and decision ; and God chose us to be his own people in union with Christ because of his own purpose , based on what he had decided from the very beginning .
49001012	Let us , then , who were the first to hope in Christ , praise God's glory !
49001013	And you also became God's people when you heard the true message , the Good News that brought you salvation . You believed in Christ , and God put his stamp of ownership on you by giving you the Holy Spirit he had promised .
49001014	The Spirit is the guarantee that we shall receive what God has promised his people , and this assures us that God will give complete freedom to those who are his . Let us praise his glory !
49001015	For this reason , ever since I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all of God's people ,
49001016	I have not stopped giving thanks to God for you . I remember you in my prayers
49001017	and ask the God of our Lord Jesus Christ , the glorious Father , to give you the Spirit , who will make you wise and reveal God to you , so that you will know him .
49001018	I ask that your minds may be opened to see his light , so that you will know what is the hope to which he has called you , how rich are the wonderful blessings he promises his people ,
49001019	and how very great is his power at work in us who believe . This power working in us is the same as the mighty strength
49001020	which he used when he raised Christ from death and seated him at his right side in the heavenly world .
49001021	Christ rules there above all heavenly rulers , authorities , powers , and lords ; he has a title superior to all titles of authority in this world and in the next .
49001022	God put all things under Christ's feet and gave him to the church as supreme Lord over all things .
49001023	The church is Christ's body , the completion of him who himself completes all things everywhere .
49002001	In the past you were spiritually dead because of your disobedience and sins .
49002002	At that time you followed the world's evil way ; you obeyed the ruler of the spiritual powers in space , the spirit who now controls the people who disobey God .
49002003	Actually all of us were like them and lived according to our natural desires , doing whatever suited the wishes of our own bodies and minds . In our natural condition we , like everyone else , were destined to suffer God's anger .
49002004	But God's mercy is so abundant , and his love for us is so great ,
49002005	that while we were spiritually dead in our disobedience he brought us to life with Christ . It is by God's grace that you have been saved .
49002006	In our union with Christ Jesus he raised us up with him to rule with him in the heavenly world .
49002007	He did this to demonstrate for all time to come the extraordinary greatness of his grace in the love he showed us in Christ Jesus .
49002010	God has made us what we are , and in our union with Christ Jesus he has created us for a life of good deeds , which he has already prepared for us to do .
49002011	You Gentiles by birth—called “ the uncircumcised ” by the Jews , who call themselves the circumcised ( which refers to what men do to their bodies ) —remember what you were in the past .
49002012	At that time you were apart from Christ . You were foreigners and did not belong to God's chosen people . You had no part in the covenants , which were based on God's promises to his people , and you lived in this world without hope and without God .
49002013	But now , in union with Christ Jesus you , who used to be far away , have been brought near by the blood of Christ .
49002014	For Christ himself has brought us peace by making Jews and Gentiles one people . With his own body he broke down the wall that separated them and kept them enemies .
49002015	He abolished the Jewish Law with its commandments and rules , in order to create out of the two races one new people in union with himself , in this way making peace .
49002016	By his death on the cross Christ destroyed their enmity ; by means of the cross he united both races into one body and brought them back to God .
49002017	So Christ came and preached the Good News of peace to all—to you Gentiles , who were far away from God , and to the Jews , who were near to him .
49002018	It is through Christ that all of us , Jews and Gentiles , are able to come in the one Spirit into the presence of the Father .
49002019	So then , you Gentiles are not foreigners or strangers any longer ; you are now citizens together with God's people and members of the family of God .
49002020	You , too , are built upon the foundation laid by the apostles and prophets , the cornerstone being Christ Jesus himself .
49002021	He is the one who holds the whole building together and makes it grow into a sacred temple dedicated to the Lord .
49002022	In union with him you too are being built together with all the others into a place where God lives through his Spirit .
49003001	For this reason I , Paul , the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles , pray to God .
49003002	Surely you have heard that God in his grace has given me this work to do for your good .
49003003	God revealed his secret plan and made it known to me . ( I have written briefly about this ,
49003004	and if you will read what I have written , you can learn about my understanding of the secret of Christ . )
49003005	In past times human beings were not told this secret , but God has revealed it now by the Spirit to his holy apostles and prophets .
49003006	The secret is that by means of the gospel the Gentiles have a part with the Jews in God's blessings ; they are members of the same body and share in the promise that God made through Christ Jesus .
49003007	I was made a servant of the gospel by God's special gift , which he gave me through the working of his power .
49003008	I am less than the least of all God's people ; yet God gave me this privilege of taking to the Gentiles the Good News about the infinite riches of Christ ,
49003009	and of making all people see how God's secret plan is to be put into effect . God , who is the Creator of all things , kept his secret hidden through all the past ages ,
49003010	in order that at the present time , by means of the church , the angelic rulers and powers in the heavenly world might learn of his wisdom in all its different forms .
49003011	God did this according to his eternal purpose , which he achieved through Christ Jesus our Lord .
49003012	In union with Christ and through our faith in him we have the boldness to go into God's presence with all confidence .
49003013	I beg you , then , not to be discouraged because I am suffering for you ; it is all for your benefit .
49003014	For this reason I fall on my knees before the Father ,
49003015	from whom every family in heaven and on earth receives its true name .
49003016	I ask God from the wealth of his glory to give you power through his Spirit to be strong in your inner selves ,
49003017	and I pray that Christ will make his home in your hearts through faith . I pray that you may have your roots and foundation in love ,
49003018	so that you , together with all God's people , may have the power to understand how broad and long , how high and deep , is Christ's love .
49003019	Yes , may you come to know his love—although it can never be fully known—and so be completely filled with the very nature of God .
49003020	To him who by means of his power working in us is able to do so much more than we can ever ask for , or even think of :
49003021	to God be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus for all time , forever and ever ! Amen .
49004001	I urge you , then—I who am a prisoner because I serve the Lord : live a life that measures up to the standard God set when he called you .
49004002	Be always humble , gentle , and patient . Show your love by being tolerant with one another .
49004003	Do your best to preserve the unity which the Spirit gives by means of the peace that binds you together .
49004004	There is one body and one Spirit , just as there is one hope to which God has called you .
49004005	There is one Lord , one faith , one baptism ;
49004006	there is one God and Father of all people , who is Lord of all , works through all , and is in all .
49004007	Each one of us has received a special gift in proportion to what Christ has given .
49004008	As the scripture says , “ When he went up to the very heights , he took many captives with him ; he gave gifts to people . ”
49004017	In the Lord's name , then , I warn you : do not continue to live like the heathen , whose thoughts are worthless
49004018	and whose minds are in the dark . They have no part in the life that God gives , for they are completely ignorant and stubborn .
49004019	They have lost all feeling of shame ; they give themselves over to vice and do all sorts of indecent things without restraint .
49004020	That was not what you learned about Christ !
49004021	You certainly heard about him , and as his followers you were taught the truth that is in Jesus .
49004022	So get rid of your old self , which made you live as you used to—the old self that was being destroyed by its deceitful desires .
49004023	Your hearts and minds must be made completely new ,
49004024	and you must put on the new self , which is created in God's likeness and reveals itself in the true life that is upright and holy .
49004025	No more lying , then ! Each of you must tell the truth to the other believer , because we are all members together in the body of Christ .
49004026	If you become angry , do not let your anger lead you into sin , and do not stay angry all day .
49004027	Don't give the Devil a chance .
49004028	If you used to rob , you must stop robbing and start working , in order to earn an honest living for yourself and to be able to help the poor .
49004029	Do not use harmful words , but only helpful words , the kind that build up and provide what is needed , so that what you say will do good to those who hear you .
49004030	And do not make God's Holy Spirit sad ; for the Spirit is God's mark of ownership on you , a guarantee that the Day will come when God will set you free .
49004031	Get rid of all bitterness , passion , and anger . No more shouting or insults , no more hateful feelings of any sort .
49004032	Instead , be kind and tender-hearted to one another , and forgive one another , as God has forgiven you through Christ .
49005001	Since you are God's dear children , you must try to be like him .
49005002	Your life must be controlled by love , just as Christ loved us and gave his life for us as a sweet-smelling offering and sacrifice that pleases God .
49005003	Since you are God's people , it is not right that any matters of sexual immorality or indecency or greed should even be mentioned among you .
49005004	Nor is it fitting for you to use language which is obscene , profane , or vulgar . Rather you should give thanks to God .
49005005	You may be sure that no one who is immoral , indecent , or greedy ( for greed is a form of idolatry ) will ever receive a share in the Kingdom of Christ and of God .
49005006	Do not let anyone deceive you with foolish words ; it is because of these very things that God's anger will come upon those who do not obey him .
49005007	So have nothing at all to do with such people .
49005008	You yourselves used to be in the darkness , but since you have become the Lord's people , you are in the light . So you must live like people who belong to the light ,
49005009	for it is the light that brings a rich harvest of every kind of goodness , righteousness , and truth .
49005010	Try to learn what pleases the Lord .
49005011	Have nothing to do with the worthless things that people do , things that belong to the darkness . Instead , bring them out to the light . (
49005012	It is really too shameful even to talk about the things they do in secret . )
49005013	And when all things are brought out to the light , then their true nature is clearly revealed ;
49005014	for anything that is clearly revealed becomes light . That is why it is said , “ Wake up , sleeper , and rise from death , and Christ will shine on you . ”
49005015	So be careful how you live . Don't live like ignorant people , but like wise people .
49005016	Make good use of every opportunity you have , because these are evil days .
49005017	Don't be fools , then , but try to find out what the Lord wants you to do .
49005018	Do not get drunk with wine , which will only ruin you ; instead , be filled with the Spirit .
49005019	Speak to one another with the words of psalms , hymns , and sacred songs ; sing hymns and psalms to the Lord with praise in your hearts .
49005020	In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , always give thanks for everything to God the Father .
49005021	Submit yourselves to one another because of your reverence for Christ .
49005022	Wives , submit yourselves to your husbands as to the Lord .
49005023	For a husband has authority over his wife just as Christ has authority over the church ; and Christ is himself the Savior of the church , his body .
49005024	And so wives must submit themselves completely to their husbands just as the church submits itself to Christ .
49005025	Husbands , love your wives just as Christ loved the church and gave his life for it .
49005026	He did this to dedicate the church to God by his word , after making it clean by washing it in water ,
49005027	in order to present the church to himself in all its beauty—pure and faultless , without spot or wrinkle or any other imperfection .
49005028	Men ought to love their wives just as they love their own bodies . A man who loves his wife loves himself . (
49005029	None of us ever hate our own bodies . Instead , we feed them , and take care of them , just as Christ does the church ;
49005030	for we are members of his body . )
49005031	As the scripture says , “ For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and unite with his wife , and the two will become one . ”
49005032	There is a deep secret truth revealed in this scripture , which I understand as applying to Christ and the church .
49005033	But it also applies to you : every husband must love his wife as himself , and every wife must respect her husband .
49006001	Children , it is your Christian duty to obey your parents , for this is the right thing to do .
49006002	“ Respect your father and mother ” is the first commandment that has a promise added :
49006003	“ so that all may go well with you , and you may live a long time in the land . ”
49006004	Parents , do not treat your children in such a way as to make them angry . Instead , raise them with Christian discipline and instruction .
49006005	Slaves , obey your human masters with fear and trembling ; and do it with a sincere heart , as though you were serving Christ .
49006006	Do this not only when they are watching you , because you want to gain their approval ; but with all your heart do what God wants , as slaves of Christ .
49006007	Do your work as slaves cheerfully , as though you served the Lord , and not merely human beings .
49006008	Remember that the Lord will reward each of us , whether slave or free , for the good work we do .
49006009	Masters , behave in the same way toward your slaves and stop using threats . Remember that you and your slaves belong to the same Master in heaven , who judges everyone by the same standard .
49006010	Finally , build up your strength in union with the Lord and by means of his mighty power .
49006011	Put on all the armor that God gives you , so that you will be able to stand up against the Devil's evil tricks .
49006012	For we are not fighting against human beings but against the wicked spiritual forces in the heavenly world , the rulers , authorities , and cosmic powers of this dark age .
49006013	So put on God's armor now ! Then when the evil day comes , you will be able to resist the enemy's attacks ; and after fighting to the end , you will still hold your ground .
49006014	So stand ready , with truth as a belt tight around your waist , with righteousness as your breastplate ,
49006015	and as your shoes the readiness to announce the Good News of peace .
49006016	At all times carry faith as a shield ; for with it you will be able to put out all the burning arrows shot by the Evil One .
49006017	And accept salvation as a helmet , and the word of God as the sword which the Spirit gives you .
49006018	Do all this in prayer , asking for God's help . Pray on every occasion , as the Spirit leads . For this reason keep alert and never give up ; pray always for all God's people .
49006019	And pray also for me , that God will give me a message when I am ready to speak , so that I may speak boldly and make known the gospel's secret .
49006020	For the sake of this gospel I am an ambassador , though now I am in prison . Pray that I may be bold in speaking about the gospel as I should .
49006021	Tychicus , our dear brother and faithful servant in the Lord's work , will give you all the news about me , so that you may know how I am getting along .
49006022	That is why I am sending him to you—to tell you how all of us are getting along and to encourage you .
49006023	May God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give to all Christians peace and love with faith .
49006024	May God's grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with undying love .
50001001	From Paul and Timothy , servants of Christ Jesus— To all God's people in Philippi who are in union with Christ Jesus , including the church leaders and helpers :
50001002	May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace .
50001003	I thank my God for you every time I think of you ;
50001004	and every time I pray for you all , I pray with joy
50001005	because of the way in which you have helped me in the work of the gospel from the very first day until now .
50001006	And so I am sure that God , who began this good work in you , will carry it on until it is finished on the Day of Christ Jesus .
50001007	You are always in my heart ! And so it is only right for me to feel as I do about you . For you have all shared with me in this privilege that God has given me , both now that I am in prison and also while I was free to defend the gospel and establish it firmly .
50001008	God is my witness that I tell the truth when I say that my deep feeling for you all comes from the heart of Christ Jesus himself .
50001009	I pray that your love will keep on growing more and more , together with true knowledge and perfect judgment ,
50001010	so that you will be able to choose what is best . Then you will be free from all impurity and blame on the Day of Christ .
50001011	Your lives will be filled with the truly good qualities which only Jesus Christ can produce , for the glory and praise of God .
50001012	I want you to know , my friends , that the things that have happened to me have really helped the progress of the gospel .
50001013	As a result , the whole palace guard and all the others here know that I am in prison because I am a servant of Christ .
50001014	And my being in prison has given most of the believers more confidence in the Lord , so that they grow bolder all the time to preach the message fearlessly .
50001015	Of course some of them preach Christ because they are jealous and quarrelsome , but others from genuine good will .
50001016	These do so from love , because they know that God has given me the work of defending the gospel .
50001017	The others do not proclaim Christ sincerely , but from a spirit of selfish ambition ; they think that they will make more trouble for me while I am in prison .
50001018	It does not matter ! I am happy about it—just so Christ is preached in every way possible , whether from wrong or right motives . And I will continue to be happy ,
50001019	because I know that by means of your prayers and the help which comes from the Spirit of Jesus Christ I shall be set free .
50001020	My deep desire and hope is that I shall never fail in my duty , but that at all times , and especially right now , I shall be full of courage , so that with my whole being I shall bring honor to Christ , whether I live or die .
50001021	For what is life ? To me , it is Christ . Death , then , will bring more .
50001022	But if by continuing to live I can do more worthwhile work , then I am not sure which I should choose .
50001023	I am pulled in two directions . I want very much to leave this life and be with Christ , which is a far better thing ;
50001024	but for your sake it is much more important that I remain alive .
50001025	I am sure of this , and so I know that I will stay . I will stay on with you all , to add to your progress and joy in the faith ,
50001026	so that when I am with you again , you will have even more reason to be proud of me in your life in union with Christ Jesus .
50001027	Now , the important thing is that your way of life should be as the gospel of Christ requires , so that , whether or not I am able to go and see you , I will hear that you are standing firm with one common purpose and that with only one desire you are fighting together for the faith of the gospel .
50001028	Don't be afraid of your enemies ; always be courageous , and this will prove to them that they will lose and that you will win , because it is God who gives you the victory .
50001029	For you have been given the privilege of serving Christ , not only by believing in him , but also by suffering for him .
50001030	Now you can take part with me in the battle . It is the same battle you saw me fighting in the past , and as you hear , the one I am fighting still .
50002001	Your life in Christ makes you strong , and his love comforts you . You have fellowship with the Spirit , and you have kindness and compassion for one another .
50002002	I urge you , then , to make me completely happy by having the same thoughts , sharing the same love , and being one in soul and mind .
50002003	Don't do anything from selfish ambition or from a cheap desire to boast , but be humble toward one another , always considering others better than yourselves .
50002004	And look out for one another's interests , not just for your own .
50002005	The attitude you should have is the one that Christ Jesus had :
50002006	He always had the nature of God , but he did not think that by force he should try to remain equal with God .
50002007	Instead of this , of his own free will he gave up all he had , and took the nature of a servant . He became like a human being and appeared in human likeness .
50002008	He was humble and walked the path of obedience all the way to death— his death on the cross .
50002009	For this reason God raised him to the highest place above and gave him the name that is greater than any other name .
50002010	And so , in honor of the name of Jesus all beings in heaven , on earth , and in the world below will fall on their knees ,
50002011	and all will openly proclaim that Jesus Christ is Lord , to the glory of God the Father .
50002012	So then , dear friends , as you always obeyed me when I was with you , it is even more important that you obey me now while I am away from you . Keep on working with fear and trembling to complete your salvation ,
50002013	because God is always at work in you to make you willing and able to obey his own purpose .
50002014	Do everything without complaining or arguing ,
50002015	so that you may be innocent and pure as God's perfect children , who live in a world of corrupt and sinful people . You must shine among them like stars lighting up the sky ,
50002016	as you offer them the message of life . If you do so , I shall have reason to be proud of you on the Day of Christ , because it will show that all my effort and work have not been wasted .
50002017	Perhaps my life's blood is to be poured out like an offering on the sacrifice that your faith offers to God . If that is so , I am glad and share my joy with you all .
50002018	In the same way , you too must be glad and share your joy with me .
50002019	If it is the Lord's will , I hope that I will be able to send Timothy to you soon , so that I may be encouraged by news about you .
50002020	He is the only one who shares my feelings and who really cares about you .
50002021	Everyone else is concerned only with their own affairs , not with the cause of Jesus Christ .
50002022	And you yourselves know how he has proved his worth , how he and I , like a son and his father , have worked together for the sake of the gospel .
50002023	So I hope to send him to you as soon as I know how things are going to turn out for me .
50002024	And I trust in the Lord that I myself will be able to come to you soon .
50002025	I have thought it necessary to send to you our brother Epaphroditus , who has worked and fought by my side and who has served as your messenger in helping me .
50002026	He is anxious to see you all and is very upset because you had heard that he was sick .
50002027	Indeed he was sick and almost died . But God had pity on him , and not only on him but on me , too , and spared me an even greater sorrow .
50002028	I am all the more eager , then , to send him to you , so that you will be glad again when you see him , and my own sorrow will disappear .
50002029	Receive him , then , with joy , as a believer in the Lord . Show respect to all such people as he ,
50002030	because he risked his life and nearly died for the sake of the work of Christ , in order to give me the help that you yourselves could not give .
50003001	In conclusion , my friends , be joyful in your union with the Lord . I don't mind repeating what I have written before , and you will be safer if I do so .
50003002	Watch out for those who do evil things , those dogs , those who insist on cutting the body .
50003003	It is we , not they , who have received the true circumcision , for we worship God by means of his Spirit and rejoice in our life in union with Christ Jesus . We do not put any trust in external ceremonies .
50003004	I could , of course , put my trust in such things . If any of you think you can trust in external ceremonies , I have even more reason to feel that way .
50003005	I was circumcised when I was a week old . I am an Israelite by birth , of the tribe of Benjamin , a pure-blooded Hebrew . As far as keeping the Jewish Law is concerned , I was a Pharisee ,
50003006	and I was so zealous that I persecuted the church . As far as a person can be righteous by obeying the commands of the Law , I was without fault .
50003007	But all those things that I might count as profit I now reckon as loss for Christ's sake .
50003008	Not only those things ; I reckon everything as complete loss for the sake of what is so much more valuable , the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord . For his sake I have thrown everything away ; I consider it all as mere garbage , so that I may gain Christ
50003009	and be completely united with him . I no longer have a righteousness of my own , the kind that is gained by obeying the Law . I now have the righteousness that is given through faith in Christ , the righteousness that comes from God and is based on faith .
50003010	All I want is to know Christ and to experience the power of his resurrection , to share in his sufferings and become like him in his death ,
50003011	in the hope that I myself will be raised from death to life .
50003012	I do not claim that I have already succeeded or have already become perfect . I keep striving to win the prize for which Christ Jesus has already won me to himself .
50003013	Of course , my friends , I really do not think that I have already won it ; the one thing I do , however , is to forget what is behind me and do my best to reach what is ahead .
50003014	So I run straight toward the goal in order to win the prize , which is God's call through Christ Jesus to the life above .
50003015	All of us who are spiritually mature should have this same attitude . But if some of you have a different attitude , God will make this clear to you .
50003016	However that may be , let us go forward according to the same rules we have followed until now .
50003017	Keep on imitating me , my friends . Pay attention to those who follow the right example that we have set for you .
50003018	I have told you this many times before , and now I repeat it with tears : there are many whose lives make them enemies of Christ's death on the cross .
50003019	They are going to end up in hell , because their god is their bodily desires . They are proud of what they should be ashamed of , and they think only of things that belong to this world .
50003020	We , however , are citizens of heaven , and we eagerly wait for our Savior , the Lord Jesus Christ , to come from heaven .
50003021	He will change our weak mortal bodies and make them like his own glorious body , using that power by which he is able to bring all things under his rule .
50004001	So then , my friends , how dear you are to me and how I miss you ! How happy you make me , and how proud I am of you ! —this , dear friends , is how you should stand firm in your life in the Lord .
50004002	Euodia and Syntyche , please , I beg you , try to agree as sisters in the Lord .
50004003	And you too , my faithful partner , I want you to help these women ; for they have worked hard with me to spread the gospel , together with Clement and all my other fellow workers , whose names are in God's book of the living .
50004004	May you always be joyful in your union with the Lord . I say it again : rejoice !
50004005	Show a gentle attitude toward everyone . The Lord is coming soon .
50004006	Don't worry about anything , but in all your prayers ask God for what you need , always asking him with a thankful heart .
50004007	And God's peace , which is far beyond human understanding , will keep your hearts and minds safe in union with Christ Jesus .
50004008	In conclusion , my friends , fill your minds with those things that are good and that deserve praise : things that are true , noble , right , pure , lovely , and honorable .
50004009	Put into practice what you learned and received from me , both from my words and from my actions . And the God who gives us peace will be with you .
50004010	In my life in union with the Lord it is a great joy to me that after so long a time you once more had the chance of showing that you care for me . I don't mean that you had stopped caring for me—you just had no chance to show it .
50004011	And I am not saying this because I feel neglected , for I have learned to be satisfied with what I have .
50004012	I know what it is to be in need and what it is to have more than enough . I have learned this secret , so that anywhere , at any time , I am content , whether I am full or hungry , whether I have too much or too little .
50004013	I have the strength to face all conditions by the power that Christ gives me .
50004014	But it was very good of you to help me in my troubles .
50004015	You Philippians know very well that when I left Macedonia in the early days of preaching the Good News , you were the only church to help me ; you were the only ones who shared my profits and losses .
50004016	More than once when I needed help in Thessalonica , you sent it to me .
50004017	It is not that I just want to receive gifts ; rather , I want to see profit added to your account .
50004018	Here , then , is my receipt for everything you have given me—and it has been more than enough ! I have all I need now that Epaphroditus has brought me all your gifts . They are like a sweet-smelling offering to God , a sacrifice which is acceptable and pleasing to him .
50004019	And with all his abundant wealth through Christ Jesus , my God will supply all your needs .
50004020	To our God and Father be the glory forever and ever ! Amen .
50004021	Greetings to each one of God's people who belong to Christ Jesus . The believers here with me send you their greetings .
50004022	All God's people here send greetings , especially those who belong to the Emperor's palace .
50004023	May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you all .
51001001	From Paul , who by God's will is an apostle of Christ Jesus , and from our brother Timothy—
51001002	To God's people in Colossae , who are our faithful friends in union with Christ : May God our Father give you grace and peace .
51001003	We always give thanks to God , the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , when we pray for you .
51001004	For we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of your love for all God's people .
51001005	When the true message , the Good News , first came to you , you heard about the hope it offers . So your faith and love are based on what you hope for , which is kept safe for you in heaven .
51001006	The gospel keeps bringing blessings and is spreading throughout the world , just as it has among you ever since the day you first heard about the grace of God and came to know it as it really is .
51001007	You learned of God's grace from Epaphras , our dear fellow servant , who is Christ's faithful worker on our behalf .
51001008	He has told us of the love that the Spirit has given you .
51001009	For this reason we have always prayed for you , ever since we heard about you . We ask God to fill you with the knowledge of his will , with all the wisdom and understanding that his Spirit gives .
51001010	Then you will be able to live as the Lord wants and will always do what pleases him . Your lives will produce all kinds of good deeds , and you will grow in your knowledge of God .
51001013	He rescued us from the power of darkness and brought us safe into the kingdom of his dear Son ,
51001014	by whom we are set free , that is , our sins are forgiven .
51001015	Christ is the visible likeness of the invisible God . He is the first-born Son , superior to all created things .
51001016	For through him God created everything in heaven and on earth , the seen and the unseen things , including spiritual powers , lords , rulers , and authorities . God created the whole universe through him and for him .
51001017	Christ existed before all things , and in union with him all things have their proper place .
51001018	He is the head of his body , the church ; he is the source of the body's life . He is the first-born Son , who was raised from death , in order that he alone might have the first place in all things .
51001019	For it was by God's own decision that the Son has in himself the full nature of God .
51001020	Through the Son , then , God decided to bring the whole universe back to himself . God made peace through his Son's blood on the cross and so brought back to himself all things , both on earth and in heaven .
51001021	At one time you were far away from God and were his enemies because of the evil things you did and thought .
51001022	But now , by means of the physical death of his Son , God has made you his friends , in order to bring you , holy , pure , and faultless , into his presence .
51001023	You must , of course , continue faithful on a firm and sure foundation , and must not allow yourselves to be shaken from the hope you gained when you heard the gospel . It is of this gospel that I , Paul , became a servant—this gospel which has been preached to everybody in the world .
51001024	And now I am happy about my sufferings for you , for by means of my physical sufferings I am helping to complete what still remains of Christ's sufferings on behalf of his body , the church .
51001025	And I have been made a servant of the church by God , who gave me this task to perform for your good . It is the task of fully proclaiming his message ,
51001026	which is the secret he hid through all past ages from all human beings but has now revealed to his people .
51001027	God's plan is to make known his secret to his people , this rich and glorious secret which he has for all peoples . And the secret is that Christ is in you , which means that you will share in the glory of God .
51001028	So we preach Christ to everyone . With all possible wisdom we warn and teach them in order to bring each one into God's presence as a mature individual in union with Christ .
51001029	To get this done I toil and struggle , using the mighty strength which Christ supplies and which is at work in me .
51002001	Let me tell you how hard I have worked for you and for the people in Laodicea and for all others who do not know me personally .
51002002	I do this in order that they may be filled with courage and may be drawn together in love , and so have the full wealth of assurance which true understanding brings . In this way they will know God's secret , which is Christ himself .
51002003	He is the key that opens all the hidden treasures of God's wisdom and knowledge .
51002004	I tell you , then , do not let anyone deceive you with false arguments , no matter how good they seem to be .
51002005	For even though I am absent in body , yet I am with you in spirit , and I am glad as I see the resolute firmness with which you stand together in your faith in Christ .
51002006	Since you have accepted Christ Jesus as Lord , live in union with him .
51002007	Keep your roots deep in him , build your lives on him , and become stronger in your faith , as you were taught . And be filled with thanksgiving .
51002008	See to it , then , that no one enslaves you by means of the worthless deceit of human wisdom , which comes from the teachings handed down by human beings and from the ruling spirits of the universe , and not from Christ .
51002009	For the full content of divine nature lives in Christ , in his humanity ,
51002010	and you have been given full life in union with him . He is supreme over every spiritual ruler and authority .
51002011	In union with Christ you were circumcised , not with the circumcision that is made by human beings , but with the circumcision made by Christ , which consists of being freed from the power of this sinful self .
51002012	For when you were baptized , you were buried with Christ , and in baptism you were also raised with Christ through your faith in the active power of God , who raised him from death .
51002013	You were at one time spiritually dead because of your sins and because you were Gentiles without the Law . But God has now brought you to life with Christ . God forgave us all our sins ;
51002014	he canceled the unfavorable record of our debts with its binding rules and did away with it completely by nailing it to the cross .
51002015	And on that cross Christ freed himself from the power of the spiritual rulers and authorities ; he made a public spectacle of them by leading them as captives in his victory procession .
51002016	So let no one make rules about what you eat or drink or about holy days or the New Moon Festival or the Sabbath .
51002017	All such things are only a shadow of things in the future ; the reality is Christ .
51002018	Do not allow yourselves to be condemned by anyone who claims to be superior because of special visions and who insists on false humility and the worship of angels . For no reason at all , such people are all puffed up by their human way of thinking
51002019	and have stopped holding on to Christ , who is the head of the body . Under Christ's control the whole body is nourished and held together by its joints and ligaments , and it grows as God wants it to grow .
51002020	You have died with Christ and are set free from the ruling spirits of the universe . Why , then , do you live as though you belonged to this world ? Why do you obey such rules as
51002021	“ Don't handle this , ” “ Don't taste that , ” “ Don't touch the other ” ?
51002022	All these refer to things which become useless once they are used ; they are only human rules and teachings .
51002023	Of course such rules appear to be based on wisdom in their forced worship of angels , and false humility , and severe treatment of the body ; but they have no real value in controlling physical passions .
51003001	You have been raised to life with Christ , so set your hearts on the things that are in heaven , where Christ sits on his throne at the right side of God .
51003002	Keep your minds fixed on things there , not on things here on earth .
51003003	For you have died , and your life is hidden with Christ in God .
51003004	Your real life is Christ and when he appears , then you too will appear with him and share his glory !
51003005	You must put to death , then , the earthly desires at work in you , such as sexual immorality , indecency , lust , evil passions , and greed ( for greed is a form of idolatry ) .
51003006	Because of such things God's anger will come upon those who do not obey him .
51003007	At one time you yourselves used to live according to such desires , when your life was dominated by them .
51003008	But now you must get rid of all these things : anger , passion , and hateful feelings . No insults or obscene talk must ever come from your lips .
51003009	Do not lie to one another , for you have put off the old self with its habits
51003010	and have put on the new self . This is the new being which God , its Creator , is constantly renewing in his own image , in order to bring you to a full knowledge of himself .
51003011	As a result , there is no longer any distinction between Gentiles and Jews , circumcised and uncircumcised , barbarians , savages , slaves , and free , but Christ is all , Christ is in all .
51003012	You are the people of God ; he loved you and chose you for his own . So then , you must clothe yourselves with compassion , kindness , humility , gentleness , and patience .
51003013	Be tolerant with one another and forgive one another whenever any of you has a complaint against someone else . You must forgive one another just as the Lord has forgiven you .
51003014	And to all these qualities add love , which binds all things together in perfect unity .
51003015	The peace that Christ gives is to guide you in the decisions you make ; for it is to this peace that God has called you together in the one body . And be thankful .
51003016	Christ's message in all its richness must live in your hearts . Teach and instruct one another with all wisdom . Sing psalms , hymns , and sacred songs ; sing to God with thanksgiving in your hearts .
51003017	Everything you do or say , then , should be done in the name of the Lord Jesus , as you give thanks through him to God the Father .
51003018	Wives , submit yourselves to your husbands , for that is what you should do as Christians .
51003019	Husbands , love your wives and do not be harsh with them .
51003020	Children , it is your Christian duty to obey your parents always , for that is what pleases God .
51003021	Parents , do not irritate your children , or they will become discouraged .
51003022	Slaves , obey your human masters in all things , not only when they are watching you because you want to gain their approval ; but do it with a sincere heart because of your reverence for the Lord .
51003023	Whatever you do , work at it with all your heart , as though you were working for the Lord and not for people .
51003024	Remember that the Lord will give you as a reward what he has kept for his people . For Christ is the real Master you serve .
51003025	And all wrongdoers will be repaid for the wrong things they do , because God judges everyone by the same standard .
51004001	Masters , be fair and just in the way you treat your slaves . Remember that you too have a Master in heaven .
51004002	Be persistent in prayer , and keep alert as you pray , giving thanks to God .
51004003	At the same time pray also for us , so that God will give us a good opportunity to preach his message about the secret of Christ . For that is why I am now in prison .
51004004	Pray , then , that I may speak , as I should , in such a way as to make it clear .
51004005	Be wise in the way you act toward those who are not believers , making good use of every opportunity you have .
51004006	Your speech should always be pleasant and interesting , and you should know how to give the right answer to everyone .
51004007	Our dear friend Tychicus , who is a faithful worker and fellow servant in the Lord's work , will give you all the news about me .
51004008	That is why I am sending him to you , in order to cheer you up by telling you how all of us are getting along .
51004009	With him goes Onesimus , that dear and faithful friend , who belongs to your group . They will tell you everything that is happening here .
51004010	Aristarchus , who is in prison with me , sends you greetings , and so does Mark , the cousin of Barnabas . ( You have already received instructions to welcome Mark if he comes your way . )
51004011	Joshua , also called Justus , sends greetings too . These three are the only Jewish believers who work with me for the Kingdom of God , and they have been a great help to me .
51004012	Greetings from Epaphras , another member of your group and a servant of Christ Jesus . He always prays fervently for you , asking God to make you stand firm , as mature and fully convinced Christians , in complete obedience to God's will .
51004013	I can personally testify to his hard work for you and for the people in Laodicea and Hierapolis .
51004014	Luke , our dear doctor , and Demas send you their greetings .
51004015	Give our best wishes to the believers in Laodicea and to Nympha and the church that meets in her house .
51004016	After you read this letter , make sure that it is read also in the church at Laodicea . At the same time , you are to read the letter that the believers in Laodicea will send you .
51004017	And tell Archippus , “ Be sure to finish the task you were given in the Lord's service . ”
51004018	With my own hand I write this : Greetings from Paul Do not forget my chains ! May God's grace be with you .
52001001	From Paul , Silas , and Timothy— To the people of the church in Thessalonica , who belong to God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ : May grace and peace be yours .
52001002	We always thank God for you all and always mention you in our prayers .
52001003	For we remember before our God and Father how you put your faith into practice , how your love made you work so hard , and how your hope in our Lord Jesus Christ is firm .
52001004	Our friends , we know that God loves you and has chosen you to be his own .
52001005	For we brought the Good News to you , not with words only , but also with power and the Holy Spirit , and with complete conviction of its truth . You know how we lived when we were with you ; it was for your own good .
52001006	You imitated us and the Lord ; and even though you suffered much , you received the message with the joy that comes from the Holy Spirit .
52001007	So you became an example to all believers in Macedonia and Achaia .
52001008	For not only did the message about the Lord go out from you throughout Macedonia and Achaia , but the news about your faith in God has gone everywhere . There is nothing , then , that we need to say .
52001009	All those people speak about how you received us when we visited you , and how you turned away from idols to God , to serve the true and living God
52001010	and to wait for his Son to come from heaven—his Son Jesus , whom he raised from death and who rescues us from God's anger that is coming .
52002001	Our friends , you yourselves know that our visit to you was not a failure .
52002002	You know how we had already been mistreated and insulted in Philippi before we came to you in Thessalonica . And even though there was much opposition , our God gave us courage to tell you the Good News that comes from him .
52002003	Our appeal to you is not based on error or impure motives , nor do we try to trick anyone .
52002004	Instead , we always speak as God wants us to , because he has judged us worthy to be entrusted with the Good News . We do not try to please people , but to please God , who tests our motives .
52002005	You know very well that we did not come to you with flattering talk , nor did we use words to cover up greed—God is our witness !
52002006	We did not try to get praise from anyone , either from you or from others ,
52002007	even though as apostles of Christ we could have made demands on you . But we were gentle when we were with you , like a mother taking care of her children .
52002008	Because of our love for you we were ready to share with you not only the Good News from God but even our own lives . You were so dear to us !
52002009	Surely you remember , our friends , how we worked and toiled ! We worked day and night so that we would not be any trouble to you as we preached to you the Good News from God .
52002010	You are our witnesses , and so is God , that our conduct toward you who believe was pure , right , and without fault .
52002011	You know that we treated each one of you just as parents treat their own children .
52002012	We encouraged you , we comforted you , and we kept urging you to live the kind of life that pleases God , who calls you to share in his own Kingdom and glory .
52002013	And there is another reason why we always give thanks to God . When we brought you God's message , you heard it and accepted it , not as a message from human beings but as God's message , which indeed it is . For God is at work in you who believe .
52002014	Our friends , the same things happened to you that happened to the churches of God in Judea , to the people there who belong to Christ Jesus . You suffered the same persecutions from your own people that they suffered from the Jews ,
52002015	who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets , and persecuted us . How displeasing they are to God ! How hostile they are to everyone !
52002016	They even tried to stop us from preaching to the Gentiles the message that would bring them salvation . In this way they have brought to completion all the sins they have always committed . And now God's anger has at last come down on them !
52002017	As for us , friends , when we were separated from you for a little while—not in our thoughts , of course , but only in body—how we missed you and how hard we tried to see you again !
52002018	We wanted to return to you . I myself tried to go back more than once , but Satan would not let us .
52002019	After all , it is you—you , no less than others ! —who are our hope , our joy , and our reason for boasting of our victory in the presence of our Lord Jesus when he comes .
52002020	Indeed , you are our pride and our joy !
52003001	Finally , we could not bear it any longer . So we decided to stay on alone in Athens
52003002	while we sent Timothy , our brother who works with us for God in preaching the Good News about Christ . We sent him to strengthen you and help your faith ,
52003003	so that none of you should turn back because of these persecutions . You yourselves know that such persecutions are part of God's will for us .
52003004	For while we were still with you , we told you ahead of time that we were going to be persecuted ; and as you well know , that is exactly what happened .
52003005	That is why I had to send Timothy . I could not bear it any longer , so I sent him to find out about your faith . Surely it could not be that the Devil had tempted you and all our work had been for nothing !
52003006	Now Timothy has come back , and he has brought us the welcome news about your faith and love . He has told us that you always think well of us and that you want to see us just as much as we want to see you .
52003007	So , in all our trouble and suffering we have been encouraged about you , friends . It was your faith that encouraged us ,
52003008	because now we really live if you stand firm in your life in union with the Lord .
52003009	Now we can give thanks to our God for you . We thank him for the joy we have in his presence because of you .
52003010	Day and night we ask him with all our heart to let us see you personally and supply what is needed in your faith .
52003011	May our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus prepare the way for us to come to you !
52003012	May the Lord make your love for one another and for all people grow more and more and become as great as our love for you .
52003013	In this way he will strengthen you , and you will be perfect and holy in the presence of our God and Father when our Lord Jesus comes with all who belong to him .
52004001	Finally , our friends , you learned from us how you should live in order to please God . This is , of course , the way you have been living . And now we beg and urge you in the name of the Lord Jesus to do even more .
52004002	For you know the instructions we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus .
52004003	God wants you to be holy and completely free from sexual immorality .
52004004	Each of you should know how to live with your wife in a holy and honorable way ,
52004005	not with a lustful desire , like the heathen who do not know God .
52004006	In this matter , then , none of you should do wrong to other Christians or take advantage of them . We have told you this before , and we strongly warned you that the Lord will punish those who do that .
52004007	God did not call us to live in immorality , but in holiness .
52004008	So then , whoever rejects this teaching is not rejecting a human being , but God , who gives you his Holy Spirit .
52004009	There is no need to write you about love for each other . You yourselves have been taught by God how you should love one another .
52004010	And you have , in fact , behaved like this toward all the believers in all of Macedonia . So we beg you , our friends , to do even more .
52004011	Make it your aim to live a quiet life , to mind your own business , and to earn your own living , just as we told you before .
52004012	In this way you will win the respect of those who are not believers , and you will not have to depend on anyone for what you need .
52004013	Our friends , we want you to know the truth about those who have died , so that you will not be sad , as are those who have no hope .
52004014	We believe that Jesus died and rose again , and so we believe that God will take back with Jesus those who have died believing in him .
52004015	What we are teaching you now is the Lord's teaching : we who are alive on the day the Lord comes will not go ahead of those who have died .
52004016	There will be the shout of command , the archangel's voice , the sound of God's trumpet , and the Lord himself will come down from heaven . Those who have died believing in Christ will rise to life first ;
52004017	then we who are living at that time will be gathered up along with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air . And so we will always be with the Lord .
52004018	So then , encourage one another with these words .
52005001	There is no need to write you , friends , about the times and occasions when these things will happen .
52005002	For you yourselves know very well that the Day of the Lord will come as a thief comes at night .
52005003	When people say , “ Everything is quiet and safe , ” then suddenly destruction will hit them ! It will come as suddenly as the pains that come upon a woman in labor , and people will not escape .
52005004	But you , friends , are not in the darkness , and the Day should not take you by surprise like a thief .
52005005	All of you are people who belong to the light , who belong to the day . We do not belong to the night or to the darkness .
52005006	So then , we should not be sleeping like the others ; we should be awake and sober .
52005007	It is at night when people sleep ; it is at night when they get drunk .
52005008	But we belong to the day , and we should be sober . We must wear faith and love as a breastplate , and our hope of salvation as a helmet .
52005009	God did not choose us to suffer his anger , but to possess salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ ,
52005010	who died for us in order that we might live together with him , whether we are alive or dead when he comes .
52005011	And so encourage one another and help one another , just as you are now doing .
52005012	We beg you , our friends , to pay proper respect to those who work among you , who guide and instruct you in the Christian life .
52005013	Treat them with the greatest respect and love because of the work they do . Be at peace among yourselves .
52005014	We urge you , our friends , to warn the idle , encourage the timid , help the weak , be patient with everyone .
52005015	See that no one pays back wrong for wrong , but at all times make it your aim to do good to one another and to all people .
52005016	Be joyful always ,
52005017	pray at all times ,
52005018	be thankful in all circumstances . This is what God wants from you in your life in union with Christ Jesus .
52005019	Do not restrain the Holy Spirit ;
52005020	do not despise inspired messages .
52005021	Put all things to the test : keep what is good
52005022	and avoid every kind of evil .
52005023	May the God who gives us peace make you holy in every way and keep your whole being—spirit , soul , and body—free from every fault at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ .
52005024	He who calls you will do it , because he is faithful .
52005025	Pray also for us , friends .
52005026	Greet all the believers with the kiss of peace .
52005027	I urge you by the authority of the Lord to read this letter to all the believers .
52005028	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you .
53001001	From Paul , Silas , and Timothy— To the people of the church in Thessalonica , who belong to God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ :
53001002	May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace .
53001003	Our friends , we must thank God at all times for you . It is right for us to do so , because your faith is growing so much and the love each of you has for the others is becoming greater .
53001004	That is why we ourselves boast about you in the churches of God . We boast about the way you continue to endure and believe through all the persecutions and sufferings you are experiencing .
53001005	All of this proves that God's judgment is just and as a result you will become worthy of his Kingdom , for which you are suffering .
53001006	God will do what is right : he will bring suffering on those who make you suffer ,
53001007	and he will give relief to you who suffer and to us as well . He will do this when the Lord Jesus appears from heaven with his mighty angels ,
53001008	with a flaming fire , to punish those who reject God and who do not obey the Good News about our Lord Jesus .
53001009	They will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction , separated from the presence of the Lord and from his glorious might ,
53001010	when he comes on that Day to receive glory from all his people and honor from all who believe . You too will be among them , because you have believed the message that we told you .
53001011	That is why we always pray for you . We ask our God to make you worthy of the life he has called you to live . May he fulfill by his power all your desire for goodness and complete your work of faith .
53001012	In this way the name of our Lord Jesus will receive glory from you , and you from him , by the grace of our God and of the Lord Jesus Christ .
53002001	Concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered together to be with him : I beg you , my friends ,
53002002	not to be so easily confused in your thinking or upset by the claim that the Day of the Lord has come . Perhaps it is thought that we said this while prophesying or preaching , or that we wrote it in a letter .
53002003	Do not let anyone deceive you in any way . For the Day will not come until the final Rebellion takes place and the Wicked One appears , who is destined to hell .
53002004	He will oppose every so-called god or object of worship and will put himself above them all . He will even go in and sit down in God's Temple and claim to be God .
53002005	Don't you remember ? I told you all this while I was with you .
53002006	Yet there is something that keeps this from happening now , and you know what it is . At the proper time , then , the Wicked One will appear .
53002007	The Mysterious Wickedness is already at work , but what is going to happen will not happen until the one who holds it back is taken out of the way .
53002008	Then the Wicked One will be revealed , but when the Lord Jesus comes , he will kill him with the breath from his mouth and destroy him with his dazzling presence .
53002009	The Wicked One will come with the power of Satan and perform all kinds of false miracles and wonders ,
53002010	and use every kind of wicked deceit on those who will perish . They will perish because they did not welcome and love the truth so as to be saved .
53002011	And so God sends the power of error to work in them so that they believe what is false .
53002012	The result is that all who have not believed the truth , but have taken pleasure in sin , will be condemned .
53002013	We must thank God at all times for you , friends , you whom the Lord loves . For God chose you as the first to be saved by the Spirit's power to make you his holy people and by your faith in the truth .
53002014	God called you to this through the Good News we preached to you ; he called you to possess your share of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ .
53002015	So then , our friends , stand firm and hold on to those truths which we taught you , both in our preaching and in our letter .
53002016	May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father , who loved us and in his grace gave us unfailing courage and a firm hope ,
53002017	encourage you and strengthen you to always do and say what is good .
53003001	Finally , our friends , pray for us that the Lord's message may continue to spread rapidly and be received with honor , just as it was among you .
53003002	Pray also that God will rescue us from wicked and evil people ; for not everyone believes the message .
53003003	But the Lord is faithful , and he will strengthen you and keep you safe from the Evil One .
53003004	And the Lord gives us confidence in you , and we are sure that you are doing and will continue to do what we tell you .
53003005	May the Lord lead you into a greater understanding of God's love and the endurance that is given by Christ .
53003006	Our friends , we command you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to keep away from all believers who are living a lazy life and who do not follow the instructions that we gave them .
53003007	You yourselves know very well that you should do just what we did . We were not lazy when we were with you .
53003008	We did not accept anyone's support without paying for it . Instead , we worked and toiled ; we kept working day and night so as not to be an expense to any of you .
53003009	We did this , not because we do not have the right to demand our support ; we did it to be an example for you to follow .
53003010	While we were with you , we used to tell you , “ Whoever refuses to work is not allowed to eat . ”
53003011	We say this because we hear that there are some people among you who live lazy lives and who do nothing except meddle in other people's business .
53003012	In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we command these people and warn them to lead orderly lives and work to earn their own living .
53003013	But you , friends , must not become tired of doing good .
53003014	It may be that some there will not obey the message we send you in this letter . If so , take note of them and have nothing to do with them , so that they will be ashamed .
53003015	But do not treat them as enemies ; instead , warn them as believers .
53003016	May the Lord himself , who is our source of peace , give you peace at all times and in every way . The Lord be with you all .
53003017	With my own hand I write this : Greetings from Paul This is the way I sign every letter ; this is how I write .
53003018	May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all .
54001001	From Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus by order of God our Savior and Christ Jesus our hope—
54001002	To Timothy , my true son in the faith : May God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord give you grace , mercy , and peace .
54001003	I want you to stay in Ephesus , just as I urged you when I was on my way to Macedonia . Some people there are teaching false doctrines , and you must order them to stop .
54001004	Tell them to give up those legends and those long lists of ancestors , which only produce arguments ; they do not serve God's plan , which is known by faith .
54001005	The purpose of this order is to arouse the love that comes from a pure heart , a clear conscience , and a genuine faith .
54001006	Some people have turned away from these and have lost their way in foolish discussions .
54001007	They want to be teachers of God's law , but they do not understand their own words or the matters about which they speak with so much confidence .
54001008	We know that the Law is good if it is used as it should be used .
54001009	It must be remembered , of course , that laws are made , not for good people , but for lawbreakers and criminals , for the godless and sinful , for those who are not religious or spiritual , for those who kill their fathers or mothers , for murderers ,
54001010	for the immoral , for sexual perverts , for kidnappers , for those who lie and give false testimony or who do anything else contrary to sound doctrine .
54001011	That teaching is found in the gospel that was entrusted to me to announce , the Good News from the glorious and blessed God .
54001012	I give thanks to Christ Jesus our Lord , who has given me strength for my work . I thank him for considering me worthy and appointing me to serve him ,
54001013	even though in the past I spoke evil of him and persecuted and insulted him . But God was merciful to me because I did not yet have faith and so did not know what I was doing .
54001014	And our Lord poured out his abundant grace on me and gave me the faith and love which are ours in union with Christ Jesus .
54001015	This is a true saying , to be completely accepted and believed : Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners . I am the worst of them ,
54001016	but God was merciful to me in order that Christ Jesus might show his full patience in dealing with me , the worst of sinners , as an example for all those who would later believe in him and receive eternal life .
54001017	To the eternal King , immortal and invisible , the only God—to him be honor and glory forever and ever ! Amen .
54001018	Timothy , my child , I entrust to you this command , which is in accordance with the words of prophecy spoken in the past about you . Use those words as weapons in order to fight well ,
54001019	and keep your faith and a clear conscience . Some people have not listened to their conscience and have made a ruin of their faith .
54001020	Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander , whom I have punished by handing them over to the power of Satan ; this will teach them to stop their blasphemy .
54002001	First of all , then , I urge that petitions , prayers , requests , and thanksgivings be offered to God for all people ;
54002002	for kings and all others who are in authority , that we may live a quiet and peaceful life with all reverence toward God and with proper conduct .
54002003	This is good and it pleases God our Savior ,
54002004	who wants everyone to be saved and to come to know the truth .
54002005	For there is one God , and there is one who brings God and human beings together , the man Christ Jesus ,
54002006	who gave himself to redeem the whole human race . That was the proof at the right time that God wants everyone to be saved ,
54002007	and that is why I was sent as an apostle and teacher of the Gentiles , to proclaim the message of faith and truth . I am not lying ; I am telling the truth !
54002008	In every church service I want the men to pray , men who are dedicated to God and can lift up their hands in prayer without anger or argument .
54002009	I also want the women to be modest and sensible about their clothes and to dress properly ; not with fancy hair styles or with gold ornaments or pearls or expensive dresses ,
54002010	but with good deeds , as is proper for women who claim to be religious .
54002011	Women should learn in silence and all humility .
54002012	I do not allow them to teach or to have authority over men ; they must keep quiet .
54002013	For Adam was created first , and then Eve .
54002014	And it was not Adam who was deceived ; it was the woman who was deceived and broke God's law .
54002015	But a woman will be saved through having children , if she perseveres in faith and love and holiness , with modesty .
54003001	This is a true saying : If a man is eager to be a church leader , he desires an excellent work .
54003002	A church leader must be without fault ; he must have only one wife , be sober , self-controlled , and orderly ; he must welcome strangers in his home ; he must be able to teach ;
54003003	he must not be a drunkard or a violent man , but gentle and peaceful ; he must not love money ;
54003004	he must be able to manage his own family well and make his children obey him with all respect .
54003005	For if a man does not know how to manage his own family , how can he take care of the church of God ?
54003006	He must be mature in the faith , so that he will not swell up with pride and be condemned , as the Devil was .
54003007	He should be a man who is respected by the people outside the church , so that he will not be disgraced and fall into the Devil's trap .
54003008	Church helpers must also have a good character and be sincere ; they must not drink too much wine or be greedy for money ;
54003009	they should hold to the revealed truth of the faith with a clear conscience .
54003010	They should be tested first , and then , if they pass the test , they are to serve .
54003011	Their wives also must be of good character and must not gossip ; they must be sober and honest in everything .
54003012	A church helper must have only one wife , and be able to manage his children and family well .
54003013	Those helpers who do their work well win for themselves a good standing and are able to speak boldly about their faith in Christ Jesus .
54003014	As I write this letter to you , I hope to come and see you soon .
54003015	But if I delay , this letter will let you know how we should conduct ourselves in God's household , which is the church of the living God , the pillar and support of the truth .
54003016	No one can deny how great is the secret of our religion : He appeared in human form , was shown to be right by the Spirit , and was seen by angels . He was preached among the nations , was believed in throughout the world , and was taken up to heaven .
54004001	The Spirit says clearly that some people will abandon the faith in later times ; they will obey lying spirits and follow the teachings of demons .
54004002	Such teachings are spread by deceitful liars , whose consciences are dead , as if burnt with a hot iron .
54004003	Such people teach that it is wrong to marry and to eat certain foods . But God created those foods to be eaten , after a prayer of thanks , by those who are believers and have come to know the truth .
54004004	Everything that God has created is good ; nothing is to be rejected , but everything is to be received with a prayer of thanks ,
54004005	because the word of God and the prayer make it acceptable to God .
54004006	If you give these instructions to the believers , you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus , as you feed yourself spiritually on the words of faith and of the true teaching which you have followed .
54004007	But keep away from those godless legends , which are not worth telling . Keep yourself in training for a godly life .
54004008	Physical exercise has some value , but spiritual exercise is valuable in every way , because it promises life both for the present and for the future .
54004009	This is a true saying , to be completely accepted and believed .
54004010	We struggle and work hard , because we have placed our hope in the living God , who is the Savior of all and especially of those who believe .
54004011	Give them these instructions and these teachings .
54004012	Do not let anyone look down on you because you are young , but be an example for the believers in your speech , your conduct , your love , faith , and purity .
54004013	Until I come , give your time and effort to the public reading of the Scriptures and to preaching and teaching .
54004014	Do not neglect the spiritual gift that is in you , which was given to you when the prophets spoke and the elders laid their hands on you .
54004015	Practice these things and devote yourself to them , in order that your progress may be seen by all .
54004016	Watch yourself and watch your teaching . Keep on doing these things , because if you do , you will save both yourself and those who hear you .
54005001	Do not rebuke an older man , but appeal to him as if he were your father . Treat the younger men as your brothers ,
54005002	the older women as mothers , and the younger women as sisters , with all purity .
54005003	Show respect for widows who really are all alone .
54005004	But if a widow has children or grandchildren , they should learn first to carry out their religious duties toward their own family and in this way repay their parents and grandparents , because that is what pleases God .
54005005	A widow who is all alone , with no one to take care of her , has placed her hope in God and continues to pray and ask him for his help night and day .
54005006	But a widow who gives herself to pleasure has already died , even though she lives .
54005007	Give them these instructions , so that no one will find fault with them .
54005008	But if any do not take care of their relatives , especially the members of their own family , they have denied the faith and are worse than an unbeliever .
54005009	Do not add any widow to the list of widows unless she is over sixty years of age . In addition , she must have been married only once
54005010	and have a reputation for good deeds : a woman who brought up her children well , received strangers in her home , performed humble duties for other Christians , helped people in trouble , and devoted herself to doing good .
54005011	But do not include younger widows in the list ; because when their desires make them want to marry , they turn away from Christ ,
54005012	and so become guilty of breaking their earlier promise to him .
54005013	They also learn to waste their time in going around from house to house ; but even worse , they learn to be gossips and busybodies , talking of things they should not .
54005014	So I would prefer that the younger widows get married , have children , and take care of their homes , so as to give our enemies no chance of speaking evil of us .
54005015	For some widows have already turned away to follow Satan .
54005016	But if any Christian woman has widows in her family , she must take care of them and not put the burden on the church , so that it may take care of the widows who are all alone .
54005017	The elders who do good work as leaders should be considered worthy of receiving double pay , especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching .
54005018	For the scripture says , “ Do not muzzle an ox when you are using it to thresh grain ” and “ Workers should be given their pay . ”
54005019	Do not listen to an accusation against an elder unless it is brought by two or more witnesses .
54005020	Rebuke publicly all those who commit sins , so that the rest may be afraid .
54005021	In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of the holy angels I solemnly call upon you to obey these instructions without showing any prejudice or favor to anyone in anything you do .
54005022	Be in no hurry to lay hands on people to dedicate them to the Lord's service . Take no part in the sins of others ; keep yourself pure .
54005023	Do not drink water only , but take a little wine to help your digestion , since you are sick so often .
54005024	The sins of some people are plain to see , and their sins go ahead of them to judgment ; but the sins of others are seen only later .
54005025	In the same way good deeds are plainly seen , and even those that are not so plain cannot be hidden .
54006001	Those who are slaves must consider their masters worthy of all respect , so that no one will speak evil of the name of God and of our teaching .
54006002	Slaves belonging to Christian masters must not despise them , for they are believers too . Instead , they are to serve them even better , because those who benefit from their work are believers whom they love . You must teach and preach these things .
54006003	Whoever teaches a different doctrine and does not agree with the true words of our Lord Jesus Christ and with the teaching of our religion
54006004	is swollen with pride and knows nothing . He has an unhealthy desire to argue and quarrel about words , and this brings on jealousy , disputes , insults , evil suspicions ,
54006005	and constant arguments from people whose minds do not function and who no longer have the truth . They think that religion is a way to become rich .
54006006	Well , religion does make us very rich , if we are satisfied with what we have .
54006007	What did we bring into the world ? Nothing ! What can we take out of the world ? Nothing !
54006008	So then , if we have food and clothes , that should be enough for us .
54006009	But those who want to get rich fall into temptation and are caught in the trap of many foolish and harmful desires , which pull them down to ruin and destruction .
54006010	For the love of money is a source of all kinds of evil . Some have been so eager to have it that they have wandered away from the faith and have broken their hearts with many sorrows .
54006011	But you , man of God , avoid all these things . Strive for righteousness , godliness , faith , love , endurance , and gentleness .
54006012	Run your best in the race of faith , and win eternal life for yourself ; for it was to this life that God called you when you firmly professed your faith before many witnesses .
54006013	Before God , who gives life to all things , and before Christ Jesus , who firmly professed his faith before Pontius Pilate , I command you
54006014	to obey your orders and keep them faithfully until the Day when our Lord Jesus Christ will appear .
54006015	His appearing will be brought about at the right time by God , the blessed and only Ruler , the King of kings and the Lord of lords .
54006016	He alone is immortal ; he lives in the light that no one can approach . No one has ever seen him ; no one can ever see him . To him be honor and eternal power ! Amen .
54006017	Command those who are rich in the things of this life not to be proud , but to place their hope , not in such an uncertain thing as riches , but in God , who generously gives us everything for our enjoyment .
54006018	Command them to do good , to be rich in good works , to be generous and ready to share with others .
54006019	In this way they will store up for themselves a treasure which will be a solid foundation for the future . And then they will be able to win the life which is true life .
54006020	Timothy , keep safe what has been entrusted to your care . Avoid the profane talk and foolish arguments of what some people wrongly call “ Knowledge . ”
54006021	For some have claimed to possess it , and as a result they have lost the way of faith . God's grace be with you all .
55001001	From Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus by God's will , sent to proclaim the promised life which we have in union with Christ Jesus—
55001002	To Timothy , my dear son : May God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord give you grace , mercy , and peace .
55001003	I give thanks to God , whom I serve with a clear conscience , as my ancestors did . I thank him as I remember you always in my prayers night and day .
55001004	I remember your tears , and I want to see you very much , so that I may be filled with joy .
55001005	I remember the sincere faith you have , the kind of faith that your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice also had . I am sure that you have it also .
55001006	For this reason I remind you to keep alive the gift that God gave you when I laid my hands on you .
55001007	For the Spirit that God has given us does not make us timid ; instead , his Spirit fills us with power , love , and self-control .
55001008	Do not be ashamed , then , of witnessing for our Lord ; neither be ashamed of me , a prisoner for Christ's sake . Instead , take your part in suffering for the Good News , as God gives you the strength for it .
55001009	He saved us and called us to be his own people , not because of what we have done , but because of his own purpose and grace . He gave us this grace by means of Christ Jesus before the beginning of time ,
55001010	but now it has been revealed to us through the coming of our Savior , Christ Jesus . He has ended the power of death and through the gospel has revealed immortal life .
55001011	God has appointed me as an apostle and teacher to proclaim the Good News ,
55001012	and it is for this reason that I suffer these things . But I am still full of confidence , because I know whom I have trusted , and I am sure that he is able to keep safe until that Day what he has entrusted to me .
55001013	Hold firmly to the true words that I taught you , as the example for you to follow , and remain in the faith and love that are ours in union with Christ Jesus .
55001014	Through the power of the Holy Spirit , who lives in us , keep the good things that have been entrusted to you .
55001015	You know that everyone in the province of Asia , including Phygelus and Hermogenes , has deserted me .
55001016	May the Lord show mercy to the family of Onesiphorus , because he cheered me up many times . He was not ashamed that I am in prison ,
55001017	but as soon as he arrived in Rome , he started looking for me until he found me .
55001018	May the Lord grant him his mercy on that Day ! And you know very well how much he did for me in Ephesus .
55002001	As for you , my son , be strong through the grace that is ours in union with Christ Jesus .
55002002	Take the teachings that you heard me proclaim in the presence of many witnesses , and entrust them to reliable people , who will be able to teach others also .
55002003	Take your part in suffering , as a loyal soldier of Christ Jesus .
55002004	A soldier on active duty wants to please his commanding officer and so does not get mixed up in the affairs of civilian life .
55002005	An athlete who runs in a race cannot win the prize unless he obeys the rules .
55002006	The farmer who has done the hard work should have the first share of the harvest .
55002007	Think about what I am saying , because the Lord will enable you to understand it all .
55002008	Remember Jesus Christ , who was raised from death , who was a descendant of David , as is taught in the Good News I preach .
55002009	Because I preach the Good News , I suffer and I am even chained like a criminal . But the word of God is not in chains ,
55002010	and so I endure everything for the sake of God's chosen people , in order that they too may obtain the salvation that comes through Christ Jesus and brings eternal glory .
55002011	This is a true saying : “ If we have died with him , we shall also live with him .
55002012	If we continue to endure , we shall also rule with him . If we deny him , he also will deny us .
55002013	If we are not faithful , he remains faithful , because he cannot be false to himself . ”
55002014	Remind your people of this , and give them a solemn warning in God's presence not to fight over words . It does no good , but only ruins the people who listen .
55002015	Do your best to win full approval in God's sight , as a worker who is not ashamed of his work , one who correctly teaches the message of God's truth .
55002016	Keep away from profane and foolish discussions , which only drive people farther away from God .
55002017	Such teaching is like an open sore that eats away the flesh . Two men who have taught such things are Hymenaeus and Philetus .
55002018	They have left the way of truth and are upsetting the faith of some believers by saying that our resurrection has already taken place .
55002019	But the solid foundation that God has laid cannot be shaken ; and on it are written these words : “ The Lord knows those who are his ” and “ Those who say that they belong to the Lord must turn away from wrongdoing . ”
55002020	In a large house there are dishes and bowls of all kinds : some are made of silver and gold , others of wood and clay ; some are for special occasions , others for ordinary use .
55002021	Those who make themselves clean from all those evil things , will be used for special purposes , because they are dedicated and useful to their Master , ready to be used for every good deed .
55002022	Avoid the passions of youth , and strive for righteousness , faith , love , and peace , together with those who with a pure heart call out to the Lord for help .
55002023	But keep away from foolish and ignorant arguments ; you know that they end up in quarrels .
55002024	As the Lord's servant , you must not quarrel . You must be kind toward all , a good and patient teacher ,
55002025	who is gentle as you correct your opponents , for it may be that God will give them the opportunity to repent and come to know the truth .
55002026	And then they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the Devil , who had caught them and made them obey his will .
55003001	Remember that there will be difficult times in the last days .
55003002	People will be selfish , greedy , boastful , and conceited ; they will be insulting , disobedient to their parents , ungrateful , and irreligious ;
55003003	they will be unkind , merciless , slanderers , violent , and fierce ; they will hate the good ;
55003004	they will be treacherous , reckless , and swollen with pride ; they will love pleasure rather than God ;
55003005	they will hold to the outward form of our religion , but reject its real power . Keep away from such people .
55003006	Some of them go into people's houses and gain control over weak women who are burdened by the guilt of their sins and driven by all kinds of desires ,
55003007	women who are always trying to learn but who can never come to know the truth .
55003008	As Jannes and Jambres were opposed to Moses , so also these people are opposed to the truth—people whose minds do not function and who are failures in the faith .
55003009	But they will not get very far , because everyone will see how stupid they are . That is just what happened to Jannes and Jambres .
55003010	But you have followed my teaching , my conduct , and my purpose in life ; you have observed my faith , my patience , my love , my endurance ,
55003011	my persecutions , and my sufferings . You know all that happened to me in Antioch , Iconium , and Lystra , the terrible persecutions I endured ! But the Lord rescued me from them all .
55003012	Everyone who wants to live a godly life in union with Christ Jesus will be persecuted ;
55003013	and evil persons and impostors will keep on going from bad to worse , deceiving others and being deceived themselves .
55003014	But as for you , continue in the truths that you were taught and firmly believe . You know who your teachers were ,
55003015	and you remember that ever since you were a child , you have known the Holy Scriptures , which are able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith in Christ Jesus .
55003016	All Scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching the truth , rebuking error , correcting faults , and giving instruction for right living ,
55003017	so that the person who serves God may be fully qualified and equipped to do every kind of good deed .
55004001	In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus , who will judge the living and the dead , and because he is coming to rule as King , I solemnly urge you
55004002	to preach the message , to insist upon proclaiming it ( whether the time is right or not ) , to convince , reproach , and encourage , as you teach with all patience .
55004003	The time will come when people will not listen to sound doctrine , but will follow their own desires and will collect for themselves more and more teachers who will tell them what they are itching to hear .
55004004	They will turn away from listening to the truth and give their attention to legends .
55004005	But you must keep control of yourself in all circumstances ; endure suffering , do the work of a preacher of the Good News , and perform your whole duty as a servant of God .
55004006	As for me , the hour has come for me to be sacrificed ; the time is here for me to leave this life .
55004007	I have done my best in the race , I have run the full distance , and I have kept the faith .
55004008	And now there is waiting for me the victory prize of being put right with God , which the Lord , the righteous Judge , will give me on that Day—and not only to me , but to all those who wait with love for him to appear .
55004009	Do your best to come to me soon .
55004010	Demas fell in love with this present world and has deserted me , going off to Thessalonica . Crescens went to Galatia , and Titus to Dalmatia .
55004011	Only Luke is with me . Get Mark and bring him with you , because he can help me in the work .
55004012	I sent Tychicus to Ephesus .
55004013	When you come , bring my coat that I left in Troas with Carpus ; bring the books too , and especially the ones made of parchment .
55004014	Alexander the metalworker did me great harm ; the Lord will reward him according to what he has done .
55004015	Be on your guard against him yourself , because he was violently opposed to our message .
55004016	No one stood by me the first time I defended myself ; all deserted me . May God not count it against them !
55004017	But the Lord stayed with me and gave me strength , so that I was able to proclaim the full message for all the Gentiles to hear ; and I was rescued from being sentenced to death .
55004018	And the Lord will rescue me from all evil and take me safely into his heavenly Kingdom . To him be the glory forever and ever ! Amen .
55004019	I send greetings to Priscilla and Aquila and to the family of Onesiphorus .
55004020	Erastus stayed in Corinth , and I left Trophimus in Miletus , because he was sick .
55004021	Do your best to come before winter . Eubulus , Pudens , Linus , and Claudia send their greetings , and so do all the other Christians .
55004022	The Lord be with your spirit . God's grace be with you all .
56001001	From Paul , a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ . I was chosen and sent to help the faith of God's chosen people and to lead them to the truth taught by our religion ,
56001002	which is based on the hope for eternal life . God , who does not lie , promised us this life before the beginning of time ,
56001003	and at the right time he revealed it in his message . This was entrusted to me , and I proclaim it by order of God our Savior .
56001004	I write to Titus , my true son in the faith that we have in common . May God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior give you grace and peace .
56001005	I left you in Crete , so that you could put in order the things that still needed doing and appoint church elders in every town . Remember my instructions :
56001006	an elder must be without fault ; he must have only one wife , and his children must be believers and not have the reputation of being wild or disobedient .
56001007	For since a church leader is in charge of God's work , he should be without fault . He must not be arrogant or quick-tempered , or a drunkard or violent or greedy for money .
56001008	He must be hospitable and love what is good . He must be self-controlled , upright , holy , and disciplined .
56001009	He must hold firmly to the message which can be trusted and which agrees with the doctrine . In this way he will be able to encourage others with the true teaching and also to show the error of those who are opposed to it .
56001010	For there are many , especially the converts from Judaism , who rebel and deceive others with their nonsense .
56001011	It is necessary to stop their talk , because they are upsetting whole families by teaching what they should not , and all for the shameful purpose of making money .
56001014	and no longer hold on to Jewish legends and to human commandments which come from people who have rejected the truth .
56001015	Everything is pure to those who are themselves pure ; but nothing is pure to those who are defiled and unbelieving , for their minds and consciences have been defiled .
56001016	They claim that they know God , but their actions deny it . They are hateful and disobedient , not fit to do anything good .
56002001	But you must teach what agrees with sound doctrine .
56002002	Instruct the older men to be sober , sensible , and self-controlled ; to be sound in their faith , love , and endurance .
56002003	In the same way instruct the older women to behave as women should who live a holy life . They must not be slanderers or slaves to wine . They must teach what is good ,
56002004	in order to train the younger women to love their husbands and children ,
56002005	to be self-controlled and pure , and to be good housewives who submit themselves to their husbands , so that no one will speak evil of the message that comes from God .
56002006	In the same way urge the young men to be self-controlled .
56002007	In all things you yourself must be an example of good behavior . Be sincere and serious in your teaching .
56002008	Use sound words that cannot be criticized , so that your enemies may be put to shame by not having anything bad to say about us .
56002009	Slaves are to submit themselves to their masters and please them in all things . They must not talk back to them
56002010	or steal from them . Instead , they must show that they are always good and faithful , so as to bring credit to the teaching about God our Savior in all they do .
56002011	For God has revealed his grace for the salvation of all people .
56002012	That grace instructs us to give up ungodly living and worldly passions , and to live self-controlled , upright , and godly lives in this world ,
56002013	as we wait for the blessed Day we hope for , when the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ will appear .
56002014	He gave himself for us , to rescue us from all wickedness and to make us a pure people who belong to him alone and are eager to do good .
56002015	Teach these things and use your full authority as you encourage and rebuke your hearers . Let none of them look down on you .
56003001	Remind your people to submit to rulers and authorities , to obey them , and to be ready to do good in every way .
56003002	Tell them not to speak evil of anyone , but to be peaceful and friendly , and always to show a gentle attitude toward everyone .
56003003	For we ourselves were once foolish , disobedient , and wrong . We were slaves to passions and pleasures of all kinds . We spent our lives in malice and envy ; others hated us and we hated them .
56003004	But when the kindness and love of God our Savior was revealed ,
56003005	he saved us . It was not because of any good deeds that we ourselves had done , but because of his own mercy that he saved us , through the Holy Spirit , who gives us new birth and new life by washing us .
56003006	God poured out the Holy Spirit abundantly on us through Jesus Christ our Savior ,
56003007	so that by his grace we might be put right with God and come into possession of the eternal life we hope for .
56003008	This is a true saying . I want you to give special emphasis to these matters , so that those who believe in God may be concerned with giving their time to doing good deeds , which are good and useful for everyone .
56003009	But avoid stupid arguments , long lists of ancestors , quarrels , and fights about the Law . They are useless and worthless .
56003010	Give at least two warnings to those who cause divisions , and then have nothing more to do with them .
56003011	You know that such people are corrupt , and their sins prove that they are wrong .
56003012	When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you , do your best to come to me in Nicopolis , because I have decided to spend the winter there .
56003013	Do your best to help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos to get started on their travels , and see to it that they have everything they need .
56003014	Our people must learn to spend their time doing good , in order to provide for real needs ; they should not live useless lives .
56003015	All who are with me send you greetings . Give our greetings to our friends in the faith . God's grace be with you all .
57001001	From Paul , a prisoner for the sake of Christ Jesus , and from our brother Timothy— To our friend and fellow worker Philemon ,
57001002	and the church that meets in your house , and our sister Apphia , and our fellow soldier Archippus :
57001003	May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace .
57001004	Brother Philemon , every time I pray , I mention you and give thanks to my God .
57001005	For I hear of your love for all of God's people and the faith you have in the Lord Jesus .
57001006	My prayer is that our fellowship with you as believers will bring about a deeper understanding of every blessing which we have in our life in union with Christ .
57001007	Your love , dear brother , has brought me great joy and much encouragement ! You have cheered the hearts of all of God's people .
57001008	For this reason I could be bold enough , as your brother in Christ , to order you to do what should be done .
57001009	But because I love you , I make a request instead . I do this even though I am Paul , the ambassador of Christ Jesus , and at present also a prisoner for his sake .
57001010	So I make a request to you on behalf of Onesimus , who is my own son in Christ ; for while in prison I have become his spiritual father .
57001011	At one time he was of no use to you , but now he is useful both to you and to me .
57001012	I am sending him back to you now , and with him goes my heart .
57001013	I would like to keep him here with me , while I am in prison for the gospel's sake , so that he could help me in your place .
57001014	However , I do not want to force you to help me ; rather , I would like for you to do it of your own free will . So I will not do anything unless you agree .
57001015	It may be that Onesimus was away from you for a short time so that you might have him back for all time .
57001016	And now he is not just a slave , but much more than a slave : he is a dear brother in Christ . How much he means to me ! And how much more he will mean to you , both as a slave and as a brother in the Lord !
57001017	So , if you think of me as your partner , welcome him back just as you would welcome me .
57001018	If he has done you any wrong or owes you anything , charge it to my account .
57001019	Here , I will write this with my own hand : I , Paul , will pay you back ( I should not have to remind you , of course , that you owe your very self to me . )
57001020	So , my brother , please do me this favor for the Lord's sake ; as a brother in Christ , cheer me up !
57001021	I am sure , as I write this , that you will do what I ask—in fact I know that you will do even more .
57001022	At the same time , get a room ready for me , because I hope that God will answer the prayers of all of you and give me back to you .
57001023	Epaphras , who is in prison with me for the sake of Christ Jesus , sends you his greetings ,
57001024	and so do my co-workers Mark , Aristarchus , Demas , and Luke .
57001025	May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you all .
58001001	In the past God spoke to our ancestors many times and in many ways through the prophets ,
58001002	but in these last days he has spoken to us through his Son . He is the one through whom God created the universe , the one whom God has chosen to possess all things at the end .
58001003	He reflects the brightness of God's glory and is the exact likeness of God's own being , sustaining the universe with his powerful word . After achieving forgiveness for the sins of all human beings , he sat down in heaven at the right side of God , the Supreme Power .
58001004	The Son was made greater than the angels , just as the name that God gave him is greater than theirs .
58001005	For God never said to any of his angels , “ You are my Son ; today I have become your Father . ” “ I will be his Father , and he will be my Son . ” “ All of God's angels must worship him . ”
58001007	But about the angels God said , “ God makes his angels winds , and his servants flames of fire . ” “ Your kingdom , O God , will last forever and ever ! You rule over your people with justice .
58001009	You love what is right and hate what is wrong . That is why God , your God , has chosen you and has given you the joy of an honor far greater than he gave to your companions . ” “ You , Lord , in the beginning created the earth , and with your own hands you made the heavens .
58001011	They will disappear , but you will remain ; they will all wear out like clothes .
58001012	You will fold them up like a coat , and they will be changed like clothes . But you are always the same , and your life never ends . ” “ Sit here at my right side until I put your enemies as a footstool under your feet . ”
58001014	What are the angels , then ? They are spirits who serve God and are sent by him to help those who are to receive salvation .
58002001	That is why we must hold on all the more firmly to the truths we have heard , so that we will not be carried away .
58002002	The message given to our ancestors by the angels was shown to be true , and those who did not follow it or obey it received the punishment they deserved .
58002003	How , then , shall we escape if we pay no attention to such a great salvation ? The Lord himself first announced this salvation , and those who heard him proved to us that it is true .
58002004	At the same time God added his witness to theirs by performing all kinds of miracles and wonders and by distributing the gifts of the Holy Spirit according to his will .
58002005	God has not placed the angels as rulers over the new world to come—the world of which we speak .
58002006	Instead , as it is said somewhere in the Scriptures : “ What are human beings , O God , that you should think of them ; mere human beings , that you should care for them ?
58002007	You made them for a little while lower than the angels ; you crowned them with glory and honor ,
58002008	and made them rulers over all things . ”
58002011	He purifies people from their sins , and both he and those who are made pure all have the same Father . That is why Jesus is not ashamed to call them his family .
58002012	He says to God , “ I will tell my people what you have done ; I will praise you in their meeting . ”
58002014	Since the children , as he calls them , are people of flesh and blood , Jesus himself became like them and shared their human nature . He did this so that through his death he might destroy the Devil , who has the power over death ,
58002015	and in this way set free those who were slaves all their lives because of their fear of death .
58002016	For it is clear that it is not the angels that he helps . Instead , he helps the descendants of Abraham .
58002017	This means that he had to become like his people in every way , in order to be their faithful and merciful High Priest in his service to God , so that the people's sins would be forgiven .
58002018	And now he can help those who are tempted , because he himself was tempted and suffered .
58003001	My Christian friends , who also have been called by God ! Think of Jesus , whom God sent to be the High Priest of the faith we profess .
58003002	He was faithful to God , who chose him to do this work , just as Moses was faithful in his work in God's house .
58003003	A man who builds a house receives more honor than the house itself . In the same way Jesus is worthy of much greater honor than Moses .
58003004	Every house , of course , is built by someone—and God is the one who has built all things .
58003005	Moses was faithful in God's house as a servant , and he spoke of the things that God would say in the future .
58003006	But Christ is faithful as the Son in charge of God's house . We are his house if we keep up our courage and our confidence in what we hope for .
58003007	So then , as the Holy Spirit says , “ If you hear God's voice today ,
58003008	do not be stubborn , as your ancestors were when they rebelled against God , as they were that day in the desert when they put him to the test .
58003009	There they put me to the test and tried me , says God , although they had seen what I did for forty years .
58003010	And so I was angry with those people and said , ‘ They are always disloyal and refuse to obey my commands . ’
58003011	I was angry and made a solemn promise : ‘ They will never enter the land where I would have given them rest ! ’ ”
58003012	My friends , be careful that none of you have a heart so evil and unbelieving that you will turn away from the living God .
58003013	Instead , in order that none of you be deceived by sin and become stubborn , you must help one another every day , as long as the word “ Today ” in the scripture applies to us .
58003014	For we are all partners with Christ if we hold firmly to the end the confidence we had at the beginning .
58003015	This is what the scripture says : “ If you hear God's voice today , do not be stubborn , as your ancestors were when they rebelled against God . ”
58003016	Who were the people who heard God's voice and rebelled against him ? All those who were led out of Egypt by Moses .
58003017	With whom was God angry for forty years ? With the people who sinned , who fell down dead in the desert .
58003018	When God made his solemn promise , “ They will never enter the land where I would have given them rest ” —of whom was he speaking ? Of those who rebelled .
58003019	We see , then , that they were not able to enter the land , because they did not believe .
58004001	Now , God has offered us the promise that we may receive that rest he spoke about . Let us take care , then , that none of you will be found to have failed to receive that promised rest .
58004002	For we have heard the Good News , just as they did . They heard the message , but it did them no good , because when they heard it , they did not accept it with faith .
58004003	We who believe , then , do receive that rest which God promised . It is just as he said , “ I was angry and made a solemn promise : ‘ They will never enter the land where I would have given them rest ! ’ ” “ If you hear God's voice today , do not be stubborn . ”
58004008	If Joshua had given the people the rest that God had promised , God would not have spoken later about another day .
58004009	As it is , however , there still remains for God's people a rest like God's resting on the seventh day .
58004010	For those who receive that rest which God promised will rest from their own work , just as God rested from his .
58004011	Let us , then , do our best to receive that rest , so that no one of us will fail as they did because of their lack of faith .
58004012	The word of God is alive and active , sharper than any double-edged sword . It cuts all the way through , to where soul and spirit meet , to where joints and marrow come together . It judges the desires and thoughts of the heart .
58004013	There is nothing that can be hid from God ; everything in all creation is exposed and lies open before his eyes . And it is to him that we must all give an account of ourselves .
58004014	Let us , then , hold firmly to the faith we profess . For we have a great High Priest who has gone into the very presence of God—Jesus , the Son of God .
58004015	Our High Priest is not one who cannot feel sympathy for our weaknesses . On the contrary , we have a High Priest who was tempted in every way that we are , but did not sin .
58004016	Let us have confidence , then , and approach God's throne , where there is grace . There we will receive mercy and find grace to help us just when we need it .
58005001	Every high priest is chosen from his fellow-men and appointed to serve God on their behalf , to offer sacrifices and offerings for sins .
58005002	Since he himself is weak in many ways , he is able to be gentle with those who are ignorant and make mistakes .
58005003	And because he is himself weak , he must offer sacrifices not only for the sins of the people but also for his own sins .
58005004	No one chooses for himself the honor of being a high priest . It is only by God's call that a man is made a high priest—just as Aaron was .
58005005	In the same way , Christ did not take upon himself the honor of being a high priest . Instead , God said to him , “ You are my Son ; today I have become your Father . ” “ You will be a priest forever , in the priestly order of Melchizedek . ”
58005007	In his life on earth Jesus made his prayers and requests with loud cries and tears to God , who could save him from death . Because he was humble and devoted , God heard him .
58005008	But even though he was God's Son , he learned through his sufferings to be obedient .
58005009	When he was made perfect , he became the source of eternal salvation for all those who obey him ,
58005010	and God declared him to be high priest , in the priestly order of Melchizedek .
58005011	There is much we have to say about this matter , but it is hard to explain to you , because you are so slow to understand .
58005012	There has been enough time for you to be teachers—yet you still need someone to teach you the first lessons of God's message . Instead of eating solid food , you still have to drink milk .
58005013	Anyone who has to drink milk is still a child , without any experience in the matter of right and wrong .
58005014	Solid food , on the other hand , is for adults , who through practice are able to distinguish between good and evil .
58006001	Let us go forward , then , to mature teaching and leave behind us the first lessons of the Christian message . We should not lay again the foundation of turning away from useless works and believing in God ;
58006002	of the teaching about baptisms and the laying on of hands ; of the resurrection of the dead and the eternal judgment .
58006003	Let us go forward ! And this is what we will do , if God allows .
58006004	For how can those who abandon their faith be brought back to repent again ? They were once in God's light ; they tasted heaven's gift and received their share of the Holy Spirit ;
58006005	they knew from experience that God's word is good , and they had felt the powers of the coming age .
58006006	And then they abandoned their faith ! It is impossible to bring them back to repent again , because they are again crucifying the Son of God and exposing him to public shame .
58006007	God blesses the soil which drinks in the rain that often falls on it and which grows plants that are useful to those for whom it is cultivated .
58006008	But if it grows thorns and weeds , it is worth nothing ; it is in danger of being cursed by God and will be destroyed by fire .
58006009	But even if we speak like this , dear friends , we feel sure about you . We know that you have the better blessings that belong to your salvation .
58006010	God is not unfair . He will not forget the work you did or the love you showed for him in the help you gave and are still giving to other Christians .
58006011	Our great desire is that each of you keep up your eagerness to the end , so that the things you hope for will come true .
58006012	We do not want you to become lazy , but to be like those who believe and are patient , and so receive what God has promised .
58006013	When God made his promise to Abraham , he made a vow to do what he had promised . Since there was no one greater than himself , he used his own name when he made his vow .
58006014	He said , “ I promise you that I will bless you and give you many descendants . ”
58006015	Abraham was patient , and so he received what God had promised .
58006016	When we make a vow , we use the name of someone greater than ourselves , and the vow settles all arguments .
58006017	To those who were to receive what he promised , God wanted to make it very clear that he would never change his purpose ; so he added his vow to the promise .
58006018	There are these two things , then , that cannot change and about which God cannot lie . So we who have found safety with him are greatly encouraged to hold firmly to the hope placed before us .
58006019	We have this hope as an anchor for our lives . It is safe and sure , and goes through the curtain of the heavenly temple into the inner sanctuary .
58006020	On our behalf Jesus has gone in there before us and has become a high priest forever , in the priestly order of Melchizedek .
58007001	This Melchizedek was king of Salem and a priest of the Most High God . As Abraham was coming back from the battle in which he defeated the four kings , Melchizedek met him and blessed him ,
58007002	and Abraham gave him one tenth of all he had taken . ( The first meaning of Melchizedek's name is “ King of Righteousness ” ; and because he was king of Salem , his name also means “ King of Peace . ” )
58007003	There is no record of Melchizedek's father or mother or of any of his ancestors ; no record of his birth or of his death . He is like the Son of God ; he remains a priest forever .
58007004	You see , then , how great he was . Abraham , our famous ancestor , gave him one tenth of all he got in the battle .
58007005	And those descendants of Levi who are priests are commanded by the Law to collect one tenth from the people of Israel , that is , from their own people , even though they are also descendants of Abraham .
58007006	Melchizedek was not descended from Levi , but he collected one tenth from Abraham and blessed him , the man who received God's promises .
58007007	There is no doubt that the one who blesses is greater than the one who is blessed .
58007008	In the case of the priests the tenth is collected by men who die ; but as for Melchizedek the tenth was collected by one who lives , as the scripture says .
58007009	And , so to speak , when Abraham paid the tenth , Levi ( whose descendants collect the tenth ) also paid it .
58007010	For Levi had not yet been born , but was , so to speak , in the body of his ancestor Abraham when Melchizedek met him .
58007011	It was on the basis of the levitical priesthood that the Law was given to the people of Israel . Now , if the work of the levitical priests had been perfect , there would have been no need for a different kind of priest to appear , one who is in the priestly order of Melchizedek , not of Aaron .
58007012	For when the priesthood is changed , there also has to be a change in the law .
58007013	And our Lord , of whom these things are said , belonged to a different tribe , and no member of his tribe ever served as a priest .
58007014	It is well known that he was born a member of the tribe of Judah ; and Moses did not mention this tribe when he spoke of priests .
58007015	The matter becomes even plainer ; a different priest has appeared , who is like Melchizedek .
58007016	He was made a priest , not by human rules and regulations , but through the power of a life which has no end .
58007017	For the scripture says , “ You will be a priest forever , in the priestly order of Melchizedek . ”
58007018	The old rule , then , is set aside , because it was weak and useless .
58007019	For the Law of Moses could not make anything perfect . And now a better hope has been provided through which we come near to God .
58007020	In addition , there is also God's vow . There was no such vow when the others were made priests .
58007021	But Jesus became a priest by means of a vow when God said to him , “ The Lord has made a solemn promise and will not take it back : ‘ You will be a priest forever . ’ ”
58007023	There is another difference : there were many of those other priests , because they died and could not continue their work .
58007024	But Jesus lives on forever , and his work as priest does not pass on to someone else .
58007025	And so he is able , now and always , to save those who come to God through him , because he lives forever to plead with God for them .
58007026	Jesus , then , is the High Priest that meets our needs . He is holy ; he has no fault or sin in him ; he has been set apart from sinners and raised above the heavens .
58007027	He is not like other high priests ; he does not need to offer sacrifices every day for his own sins first and then for the sins of the people . He offered one sacrifice , once and for all , when he offered himself .
58007028	The Law of Moses appoints men who are imperfect to be high priests ; but God's promise made with the vow , which came later than the Law , appoints the Son , who has been made perfect forever .
58008001	The whole point of what we are saying is that we have such a High Priest , who sits at the right of the throne of the Divine Majesty in heaven .
58008002	He serves as high priest in the Most Holy Place , that is , in the real tent which was put up by the Lord , not by human hands .
58008003	Every high priest is appointed to present offerings and animal sacrifices to God , and so our High Priest must also have something to offer .
58008004	If he were on earth , he would not be a priest at all , since there are priests who offer the gifts required by the Jewish Law .
58008005	The work they do as priests is really only a copy and a shadow of what is in heaven . It is the same as it was with Moses . When he was about to build the Sacred Tent , God told him , “ Be sure to make everything according to the pattern you were shown on the mountain . ”
58008006	But now , Jesus has been given priestly work which is superior to theirs , just as the covenant which he arranged between God and his people is a better one , because it is based on promises of better things .
58008007	If there had been nothing wrong with the first covenant , there would have been no need for a second one .
58008008	But God finds fault with his people when he says , “ The days are coming , says the Lord , when I will draw up a new covenant with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah .
58008009	It will not be like the covenant that I made with their ancestors on the day I took them by the hand and led them out of Egypt . They were not faithful to the covenant I made with them , and so I paid no attention to them .
58008010	Now , this is the covenant that I will make with the people of Israel in the days to come , says the Lord : I will put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts . I will be their God , and they will be my people .
58008011	None of them will have to teach their friends or tell their neighbors , ‘ Know the Lord . ’ For they will all know me , from the least to the greatest .
58008012	I will forgive their sins and will no longer remember their wrongs . ”
58009001	The first covenant had rules for worship and a place made for worship as well .
58009002	A tent was put up , the outer one , which was called the Holy Place . In it were the lampstand and the table with the bread offered to God .
58009003	Behind the second curtain was the tent called the Most Holy Place .
58009004	In it were the gold altar for the burning of incense and the Covenant Box all covered with gold and containing the gold jar with the manna in it , Aaron's stick that had sprouted leaves , and the two stone tablets with the commandments written on them .
58009005	Above the Box were the winged creatures representing God's presence , with their wings spread over the place where sins were forgiven . But now is not the time to explain everything in detail .
58009006	This is how those things have been arranged . The priests go into the outer tent every day to perform their duties ,
58009007	but only the high priest goes into the inner tent , and he does so only once a year . He takes with him blood which he offers to God on behalf of himself and for the sins which the people have committed without knowing they were sinning .
58009008	The Holy Spirit clearly teaches from all these arrangements that the way into the Most Holy Place has not yet been opened as long as the outer tent still stands .
58009009	This is a symbol which points to the present time . It means that the offerings and animal sacrifices presented to God cannot make the worshiper's heart perfect ,
58009010	since they have to do only with food , drink , and various purification ceremonies . These are all outward rules , which apply only until the time when God will establish the new order .
58009011	But Christ has already come as the High Priest of the good things that are already here . The tent in which he serves is greater and more perfect ; it is not a tent made by human hands , that is , it is not a part of this created world .
58009012	When Christ went through the tent and entered once and for all into the Most Holy Place , he did not take the blood of goats and bulls to offer as a sacrifice ; rather , he took his own blood and obtained eternal salvation for us .
58009013	The blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a burnt calf are sprinkled on the people who are ritually unclean , and this purifies them by taking away their ritual impurity .
58009014	Since this is true , how much more is accomplished by the blood of Christ ! Through the eternal Spirit he offered himself as a perfect sacrifice to God . His blood will purify our consciences from useless rituals , so that we may serve the living God .
58009015	For this reason Christ is the one who arranges a new covenant , so that those who have been called by God may receive the eternal blessings that God has promised . This can be done because there has been a death which sets people free from the wrongs they did while the first covenant was in effect .
58009016	In the case of a will it is necessary to prove that the person who made it has died ,
58009017	for a will means nothing while the person who made it is alive ; it goes into effect only after his death .
58009018	That is why even the first covenant went into effect only with the use of blood .
58009019	First , Moses proclaimed to the people all the commandments as set forth in the Law . Then he took the blood of bulls and goats , mixed it with water , and sprinkled it on the book of the Law and all the people , using a sprig of hyssop and some red wool .
58009020	He said , “ This is the blood which seals the covenant that God has commanded you to obey . ”
58009021	In the same way Moses also sprinkled the blood on the Sacred Tent and over all the things used in worship .
58009022	Indeed , according to the Law almost everything is purified by blood , and sins are forgiven only if blood is poured out .
58009023	Those things , which are copies of the heavenly originals , had to be purified in that way . But the heavenly things themselves require much better sacrifices .
58009024	For Christ did not go into a Holy Place made by human hands , which was a copy of the real one . He went into heaven itself , where he now appears on our behalf in the presence of God .
58009025	The Jewish high priest goes into the Most Holy Place every year with the blood of an animal . But Christ did not go in to offer himself many times ,
58009026	for then he would have had to suffer many times ever since the creation of the world . Instead , now when all ages of time are nearing the end , he has appeared once and for all , to remove sin through the sacrifice of himself .
58009027	Everyone must die once , and after that be judged by God .
58009028	In the same manner Christ also was offered in sacrifice once to take away the sins of many . He will appear a second time , not to deal with sin , but to save those who are waiting for him .
58010001	The Jewish Law is not a full and faithful model of the real things ; it is only a faint outline of the good things to come . The same sacrifices are offered forever , year after year . How can the Law , then , by means of these sacrifices make perfect the people who come to God ?
58010002	If the people worshiping God had really been purified from their sins , they would not feel guilty of sin any more , and all sacrifices would stop .
58010003	As it is , however , the sacrifices serve year after year to remind people of their sins .
58010004	For the blood of bulls and goats can never take away sins .
58010005	For this reason , when Christ was about to come into the world , he said to God : “ You do not want sacrifices and offerings , but you have prepared a body for me .
58010006	You are not pleased with animals burned whole on the altar or with sacrifices to take away sins .
58010007	Then I said , ‘ Here I am , to do your will , O God , just as it is written of me in the book of the Law . ’ ”
58010011	Every Jewish priest performs his services every day and offers the same sacrifices many times ; but these sacrifices can never take away sins .
58010012	Christ , however , offered one sacrifice for sins , an offering that is effective forever , and then he sat down at the right side of God .
58010013	There he now waits until God puts his enemies as a footstool under his feet .
58010014	With one sacrifice , then , he has made perfect forever those who are purified from sin .
58010015	And the Holy Spirit also gives us his witness . First he says ,
58010016	“ This is the covenant that I will make with them in the days to come , says the Lord : I will put my laws in their hearts and write them on their minds . ”
58010019	We have , then , my friends , complete freedom to go into the Most Holy Place by means of the death of Jesus .
58010020	He opened for us a new way , a living way , through the curtain—that is , through his own body .
58010021	We have a great priest in charge of the house of God .
58010022	So let us come near to God with a sincere heart and a sure faith , with hearts that have been purified from a guilty conscience and with bodies washed with clean water .
58010023	Let us hold on firmly to the hope we profess , because we can trust God to keep his promise .
58010024	Let us be concerned for one another , to help one another to show love and to do good .
58010025	Let us not give up the habit of meeting together , as some are doing . Instead , let us encourage one another all the more , since you see that the Day of the Lord is coming nearer .
58010026	For there is no longer any sacrifice that will take away sins if we purposely go on sinning after the truth has been made known to us .
58010027	Instead , all that is left is to wait in fear for the coming Judgment and the fierce fire which will destroy those who oppose God !
58010028	Anyone who disobeys the Law of Moses is put to death without any mercy when judged guilty from the evidence of two or more witnesses .
58010029	What , then , of those who despise the Son of God ? who treat as a cheap thing the blood of God's covenant which purified them from sin ? who insult the Spirit of grace ? Just think how much worse is the punishment they will deserve !
58010030	For we know who said , “ I will take revenge , I will repay ” ; and who also said , “ The Lord will judge his people . ”
58010031	It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God !
58010032	Remember how it was with you in the past . In those days , after God's light had shone on you , you suffered many things , yet were not defeated by the struggle .
58010033	You were at times publicly insulted and mistreated , and at other times you were ready to join those who were being treated in this way .
58010034	You shared the sufferings of prisoners , and when all your belongings were seized , you endured your loss gladly , because you knew that you still possessed something much better , which would last forever .
58010035	Do not lose your courage , then , because it brings with it a great reward .
58010036	You need to be patient , in order to do the will of God and receive what he promises .
58010037	For , as the scripture says , “ Just a little while longer , and he who is coming will come ; he will not delay .
58010038	My righteous people , however , will believe and live ; but if any of them turns back , I will not be pleased with them . ”
58011001	To have faith is to be sure of the things we hope for , to be certain of the things we cannot see .
58011002	It was by their faith that people of ancient times won God's approval .
58011003	It is by faith that we understand that the universe was created by God's word , so that what can be seen was made out of what cannot be seen .
58011004	It was faith that made Abel offer to God a better sacrifice than Cain's . Through his faith he won God's approval as a righteous man , because God himself approved of his gifts . By means of his faith Abel still speaks , even though he is dead .
58011005	It was faith that kept Enoch from dying . Instead , he was taken up to God , and nobody could find him , because God had taken him up . The scripture says that before Enoch was taken up , he had pleased God .
58011006	No one can please God without faith , for whoever comes to God must have faith that God exists and rewards those who seek him .
58011007	It was faith that made Noah hear God's warnings about things in the future that he could not see . He obeyed God and built a boat in which he and his family were saved . As a result , the world was condemned , and Noah received from God the righteousness that comes by faith .
58011008	It was faith that made Abraham obey when God called him to go out to a country which God had promised to give him . He left his own country without knowing where he was going .
58011009	By faith he lived as a foreigner in the country that God had promised him . He lived in tents , as did Isaac and Jacob , who received the same promise from God .
58011010	For Abraham was waiting for the city which God has designed and built , the city with permanent foundations .
58011011	It was faith that made Abraham able to become a father , even though he was too old and Sarah herself could not have children . He trusted God to keep his promise .
58011012	Though Abraham was practically dead , from this one man came as many descendants as there are stars in the sky , as many as the numberless grains of sand on the seashore .
58011013	It was in faith that all these persons died . They did not receive the things God had promised , but from a long way off they saw them and welcomed them , and admitted openly that they were foreigners and refugees on earth .
58011014	Those who say such things make it clear that they are looking for a country of their own .
58011015	They did not keep thinking about the country they had left ; if they had , they would have had the chance to return .
58011016	Instead , it was a better country they longed for , the heavenly country . And so God is not ashamed for them to call him their God , because he has prepared a city for them .
58011017	It was faith that made Abraham offer his son Isaac as a sacrifice when God put Abraham to the test . Abraham was the one to whom God had made the promise , yet he was ready to offer his only son as a sacrifice .
58011018	God had said to him , “ It is through Isaac that you will have the descendants I promised . ”
58011019	Abraham reckoned that God was able to raise Isaac from death—and , so to speak , Abraham did receive Isaac back from death .
58011020	It was faith that made Isaac promise blessings for the future to Jacob and Esau .
58011021	It was faith that made Jacob bless each of the sons of Joseph just before he died . He leaned on the top of his walking stick and worshiped God .
58011022	It was faith that made Joseph , when he was about to die , speak of the departure of the Israelites from Egypt , and leave instructions about what should be done with his body .
58011023	It was faith that made the parents of Moses hide him for three months after he was born . They saw that he was a beautiful child , and they were not afraid to disobey the king's order .
58011024	It was faith that made Moses , when he had grown up , refuse to be called the son of the king's daughter .
58011025	He preferred to suffer with God's people rather than to enjoy sin for a little while .
58011026	He reckoned that to suffer scorn for the Messiah was worth far more than all the treasures of Egypt , for he kept his eyes on the future reward .
58011027	It was faith that made Moses leave Egypt without being afraid of the king's anger . As though he saw the invisible God , he refused to turn back .
58011028	It was faith that made him establish the Passover and order the blood to be sprinkled on the doors , so that the Angel of Death would not kill the first-born sons of the Israelites .
58011029	It was faith that made the Israelites able to cross the Red Sea as if on dry land ; when the Egyptians tried to do it , the water swallowed them up .
58011030	It was faith that made the walls of Jericho fall down after the Israelites had marched around them for seven days .
58011031	It was faith that kept the prostitute Rahab from being killed with those who disobeyed God , for she gave the Israelite spies a friendly welcome .
58011032	Should I go on ? There isn't enough time for me to speak of Gideon , Barak , Samson , Jephthah , David , Samuel , and the prophets .
58011033	Through faith they fought whole countries and won . They did what was right and received what God had promised . They shut the mouths of lions ,
58011034	put out fierce fires , escaped being killed by the sword . They were weak , but became strong ; they were mighty in battle and defeated the armies of foreigners .
58011035	Through faith women received their dead relatives raised back to life . Others , refusing to accept freedom , died under torture in order to be raised to a better life .
58011036	Some were mocked and whipped , and others were put in chains and taken off to prison .
58011037	They were stoned , they were sawed in two , they were killed by the sword . They went around clothed in skins of sheep or goats—poor , persecuted , and mistreated .
58011038	The world was not good enough for them ! They wandered like refugees in the deserts and hills , living in caves and holes in the ground .
58011039	What a record all of these have won by their faith ! Yet they did not receive what God had promised ,
58011040	because God had decided on an even better plan for us . His purpose was that only in company with us would they be made perfect .
58012001	As for us , we have this large crowd of witnesses around us . So then , let us rid ourselves of everything that gets in the way , and of the sin which holds on to us so tightly , and let us run with determination the race that lies before us .
58012002	Let us keep our eyes fixed on Jesus , on whom our faith depends from beginning to end . He did not give up because of the cross ! On the contrary , because of the joy that was waiting for him , he thought nothing of the disgrace of dying on the cross , and he is now seated at the right side of God's throne .
58012003	Think of what he went through ; how he put up with so much hatred from sinners ! So do not let yourselves become discouraged and give up .
58012004	For in your struggle against sin you have not yet had to resist to the point of being killed .
58012005	Have you forgotten the encouraging words which God speaks to you as his children ? “ My child , pay attention when the Lord corrects you , and do not be discouraged when he rebukes you .
58012006	Because the Lord corrects everyone he loves , and punishes everyone he accepts as a child . ”
58012012	Lift up your tired hands , then , and strengthen your trembling knees !
58012013	Keep walking on straight paths , so that the lame foot may not be disabled , but instead be healed .
58012014	Try to be at peace with everyone , and try to live a holy life , because no one will see the Lord without it .
58012015	Guard against turning back from the grace of God . Let no one become like a bitter plant that grows up and causes many troubles with its poison .
58012016	Let no one become immoral or unspiritual like Esau , who for a single meal sold his rights as the older son .
58012017	Afterward , you know , he wanted to receive his father's blessing ; but he was turned back , because he could not find any way to change what he had done , even though in tears he looked for it .
58012018	You have not come , as the people of Israel came , to what you can feel , to Mount Sinai with its blazing fire , the darkness and the gloom , the storm ,
58012019	the blast of a trumpet , and the sound of a voice . When the people heard the voice , they begged not to hear another word ,
58012020	because they could not bear the order which said , “ If even an animal touches the mountain , it must be stoned to death . ”
58012021	The sight was so terrifying that Moses said , “ I am trembling and afraid ! ”
58012022	Instead , you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God , the heavenly Jerusalem , with its thousands of angels .
58012023	You have come to the joyful gathering of God's first-born , whose names are written in heaven . You have come to God , who is the judge of all people , and to the spirits of good people made perfect .
58012024	You have come to Jesus , who arranged the new covenant , and to the sprinkled blood that promises much better things than does the blood of Abel .
58012025	Be careful , then , and do not refuse to hear him who speaks . Those who refused to hear the one who gave the divine message on earth did not escape . How much less shall we escape , then , if we turn away from the one who speaks from heaven !
58012026	His voice shook the earth at that time , but now he has promised , “ I will once more shake not only the earth but heaven as well . ”
58012027	The words “ once more ” plainly show that the created things will be shaken and removed , so that the things that cannot be shaken will remain .
58012028	Let us be thankful , then , because we receive a kingdom that cannot be shaken . Let us be grateful and worship God in a way that will please him , with reverence and awe ;
58012029	because our God is indeed a destroying fire .
58013001	Keep on loving one another as Christians .
58013002	Remember to welcome strangers in your homes . There were some who did that and welcomed angels without knowing it .
58013003	Remember those who are in prison , as though you were in prison with them . Remember those who are suffering , as though you were suffering as they are .
58013004	Marriage is to be honored by all , and husbands and wives must be faithful to each other . God will judge those who are immoral and those who commit adultery .
58013005	Keep your lives free from the love of money , and be satisfied with what you have . For God has said , “ I will never leave you ; I will never abandon you . ”
58013006	Let us be bold , then , and say , “ The Lord is my helper , I will not be afraid . What can anyone do to me ? ”
58013007	Remember your former leaders , who spoke God's message to you . Think back on how they lived and died , and imitate their faith .
58013008	Jesus Christ is the same yesterday , today , and forever .
58013009	Do not let all kinds of strange teachings lead you from the right way . It is good to receive inner strength from God's grace , and not by obeying rules about foods ; those who obey these rules have not been helped by them .
58013010	The priests who serve in the Jewish place of worship have no right to eat any of the sacrifice on our altar .
58013011	The Jewish high priest brings the blood of the animals into the Most Holy Place to offer it as a sacrifice for sins ; but the bodies of the animals are burned outside the camp .
58013012	For this reason Jesus also died outside the city , in order to purify the people from sin with his own blood .
58013013	Let us , then , go to him outside the camp and share his shame .
58013014	For there is no permanent city for us here on earth ; we are looking for the city which is to come .
58013015	Let us , then , always offer praise to God as our sacrifice through Jesus , which is the offering presented by lips that confess him as Lord .
58013016	Do not forget to do good and to help one another , because these are the sacrifices that please God .
58013017	Obey your leaders and follow their orders . They watch over your souls without resting , since they must give to God an account of their service . If you obey them , they will do their work gladly ; if not , they will do it with sadness , and that would be of no help to you .
58013018	Keep on praying for us . We are sure we have a clear conscience , because we want to do the right thing at all times .
58013019	And I beg you even more earnestly to pray that God will send me back to you soon .
58013022	I beg you , my friends , to listen patiently to this message of encouragement ; for this letter I have written you is not very long .
58013023	I want you to know that our brother Timothy has been let out of prison . If he comes soon enough , I will have him with me when I see you .
58013024	Give our greetings to all your leaders and to all God's people . The believers from Italy send you their greetings .
58013025	May God's grace be with you all .
59001001	From James , a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ : Greetings to all God's people scattered over the whole world .
59001002	My friends , consider yourselves fortunate when all kinds of trials come your way ,
59001003	for you know that when your faith succeeds in facing such trials , the result is the ability to endure .
59001004	Make sure that your endurance carries you all the way without failing , so that you may be perfect and complete , lacking nothing .
59001005	But if any of you lack wisdom , you should pray to God , who will give it to you ; because God gives generously and graciously to all .
59001006	But when you pray , you must believe and not doubt at all . Whoever doubts is like a wave in the sea that is driven and blown about by the wind .
59001009	Those Christians who are poor must be glad when God lifts them up ,
59001010	and the rich Christians must be glad when God brings them down . For the rich will pass away like the flower of a wild plant .
59001011	The sun rises with its blazing heat and burns the plant ; its flower falls off , and its beauty is destroyed . In the same way the rich will be destroyed while they go about their business .
59001012	Happy are those who remain faithful under trials , because when they succeed in passing such a test , they will receive as their reward the life which God has promised to those who love him .
59001013	If we are tempted by such trials , we must not say , “ This temptation comes from God . ” For God cannot be tempted by evil , and he himself tempts no one .
59001014	But we are tempted when we are drawn away and trapped by our own evil desires .
59001015	Then our evil desires conceive and give birth to sin ; and sin , when it is full-grown , gives birth to death .
59001016	Do not be deceived , my dear friends !
59001017	Every good gift and every perfect present comes from heaven ; it comes down from God , the Creator of the heavenly lights , who does not change or cause darkness by turning .
59001018	By his own will he brought us into being through the word of truth , so that we should have first place among all his creatures .
59001019	Remember this , my dear friends ! Everyone must be quick to listen , but slow to speak and slow to become angry .
59001020	Human anger does not achieve God's righteous purpose .
59001021	So get rid of every filthy habit and all wicked conduct . Submit to God and accept the word that he plants in your hearts , which is able to save you .
59001022	Do not deceive yourselves by just listening to his word ; instead , put it into practice .
59001023	If you listen to the word , but do not put it into practice you are like people who look in a mirror and see themselves as they are .
59001024	They take a good look at themselves and then go away and at once forget what they look like .
59001025	But if you look closely into the perfect law that sets people free , and keep on paying attention to it and do not simply listen and then forget it , but put it into practice—you will be blessed by God in what you do .
59001026	Do any of you think you are religious ? If you do not control your tongue , your religion is worthless and you deceive yourself .
59001027	What God the Father considers to be pure and genuine religion is this : to take care of orphans and widows in their suffering and to keep oneself from being corrupted by the world .
59002001	My friends , as believers in our Lord Jesus Christ , the Lord of glory , you must never treat people in different ways according to their outward appearance .
59002002	Suppose a rich man wearing a gold ring and fine clothes comes to your meeting , and a poor man in ragged clothes also comes .
59002003	If you show more respect to the well-dressed man and say to him , “ Have this best seat here , ” but say to the poor man , “ Stand over there , or sit here on the floor by my feet , ”
59002004	then you are guilty of creating distinctions among yourselves and of making judgments based on evil motives .
59002005	Listen , my dear friends ! God chose the poor people of this world to be rich in faith and to possess the kingdom which he promised to those who love him .
59002006	But you dishonor the poor ! Who are the ones who oppress you and drag you before the judges ? The rich !
59002007	They are the ones who speak evil of that good name which has been given to you .
59002008	You will be doing the right thing if you obey the law of the Kingdom , which is found in the scripture , “ Love your neighbor as you love yourself . ”
59002009	But if you treat people according to their outward appearance , you are guilty of sin , and the Law condemns you as a lawbreaker .
59002010	Whoever breaks one commandment is guilty of breaking them all .
59002011	For the same one who said , “ Do not commit adultery , ” also said , “ Do not commit murder . ” Even if you do not commit adultery , you have become a lawbreaker if you commit murder .
59002012	Speak and act as people who will be judged by the law that sets us free .
59002013	For God will not show mercy when he judges the person who has not been merciful ; but mercy triumphs over judgment .
59002014	My friends , what good is it for one of you to say that you have faith if your actions do not prove it ? Can that faith save you ?
59002015	Suppose there are brothers or sisters who need clothes and don't have enough to eat .
59002016	What good is there in your saying to them , “ God bless you ! Keep warm and eat well ! ” —if you don't give them the necessities of life ?
59002017	So it is with faith : if it is alone and includes no actions , then it is dead .
59002018	But someone will say , “ One person has faith , another has actions . ” My answer is , “ Show me how anyone can have faith without actions . I will show you my faith by my actions . ”
59002019	Do you believe that there is only one God ? Good ! The demons also believe—and tremble with fear .
59002020	You fool ! Do you want to be shown that faith without actions is useless ?
59002021	How was our ancestor Abraham put right with God ? It was through his actions , when he offered his son Isaac on the altar .
59002022	Can't you see ? His faith and his actions worked together ; his faith was made perfect through his actions .
59002023	And the scripture came true that said , “ Abraham believed God , and because of his faith God accepted him as righteous . ” And so Abraham was called God's friend .
59002024	You see , then , that it is by our actions that we are put right with God , and not by our faith alone .
59002025	It was the same with the prostitute Rahab . She was put right with God through her actions , by welcoming the Israelite spies and helping them to escape by a different road .
59002026	So then , as the body without the spirit is dead , also faith without actions is dead .
59003001	My friends , not many of you should become teachers . As you know , we teachers will be judged with greater strictness than others .
59003002	All of us often make mistakes . But if a person never makes a mistake in what he says , he is perfect and is also able to control his whole being .
59003003	We put a bit into the mouth of a horse to make it obey us , and we are able to make it go where we want .
59003004	Or think of a ship : big as it is and driven by such strong winds , it can be steered by a very small rudder , and it goes wherever the pilot wants it to go .
59003005	So it is with the tongue : small as it is , it can boast about great things . Just think how large a forest can be set on fire by a tiny flame !
59003006	And the tongue is like a fire . It is a world of wrong , occupying its place in our bodies and spreading evil through our whole being . It sets on fire the entire course of our existence with the fire that comes to it from hell itself .
59003007	We humans are able to tame and have tamed all other creatures—wild animals and birds , reptiles and fish .
59003008	But no one has ever been able to tame the tongue . It is evil and uncontrollable , full of deadly poison .
59003009	We use it to give thanks to our Lord and Father and also to curse other people , who are created in the likeness of God .
59003010	Words of thanksgiving and cursing pour out from the same mouth . My friends , this should not happen !
59003011	No spring of water pours out sweet water and bitter water from the same opening .
59003012	A fig tree , my friends , cannot bear olives ; a grapevine cannot bear figs , nor can a salty spring produce sweet water .
59003013	Are there any of you who are wise and understanding ? You are to prove it by your good life , by your good deeds performed with humility and wisdom .
59003014	But if in your heart you are jealous , bitter , and selfish , don't sin against the truth by boasting of your wisdom .
59003015	Such wisdom does not come down from heaven ; it belongs to the world , it is unspiritual and demonic .
59003016	Where there is jealousy and selfishness , there is also disorder and every kind of evil .
59003017	But the wisdom from above is pure first of all ; it is also peaceful , gentle , and friendly ; it is full of compassion and produces a harvest of good deeds ; it is free from prejudice and hypocrisy .
59003018	And goodness is the harvest that is produced from the seeds the peacemakers plant in peace .
59004001	Where do all the fights and quarrels among you come from ? They come from your desires for pleasure , which are constantly fighting within you .
59004002	You want things , but you cannot have them , so you are ready to kill ; you strongly desire things , but you cannot get them , so you quarrel and fight . You do not have what you want because you do not ask God for it .
59004003	And when you ask , you do not receive it , because your motives are bad ; you ask for things to use for your own pleasures .
59004004	Unfaithful people ! Don't you know that to be the world's friend means to be God's enemy ? If you want to be the world's friend , you make yourself God's enemy .
59004005	Don't think that there is no truth in the scripture that says , “ The spirit that God placed in us is filled with fierce desires . ”
59004006	But the grace that God gives is even stronger . As the scripture says , “ God resists the proud , but gives grace to the humble . ”
59004007	So then , submit yourselves to God . Resist the Devil , and he will run away from you .
59004008	Come near to God , and he will come near to you . Wash your hands , you sinners ! Purify your hearts , you hypocrites !
59004009	Be sorrowful , cry , and weep ; change your laughter into crying , your joy into gloom !
59004010	Humble yourselves before the Lord , and he will lift you up .
59004011	Do not criticize one another , my friends . If you criticize or judge another Christian , you criticize and judge the Law . If you judge the Law , then you are no longer one who obeys the Law , but one who judges it .
59004012	God is the only lawgiver and judge . He alone can save and destroy . Who do you think you are , to judge someone else ?
59004013	Now listen to me , you that say , “ Today or tomorrow we will travel to a certain city , where we will stay a year and go into business and make a lot of money . ”
59004014	You don't even know what your life tomorrow will be ! You are like a puff of smoke , which appears for a moment and then disappears .
59004015	What you should say is this : “ If the Lord is willing , we will live and do this or that . ”
59004016	But now you are proud , and you boast ; all such boasting is wrong .
59004017	So then , if we do not do the good we know we should do , we are guilty of sin .
59005001	And now , you rich people , listen to me ! Weep and wail over the miseries that are coming upon you !
59005002	Your riches have rotted away , and your clothes have been eaten by moths .
59005003	Your gold and silver are covered with rust , and this rust will be a witness against you and will eat up your flesh like fire . You have piled up riches in these last days .
59005004	You have not paid any wages to those who work in your fields . Listen to their complaints ! The cries of those who gather in your crops have reached the ears of God , the Lord Almighty .
59005005	Your life here on earth has been full of luxury and pleasure . You have made yourselves fat for the day of slaughter .
59005006	You have condemned and murdered innocent people , and they do not resist you .
59005007	Be patient , then , my friends , until the Lord comes . See how patient farmers are as they wait for their land to produce precious crops . They wait patiently for the autumn and spring rains .
59005008	You also must be patient . Keep your hopes high , for the day of the Lord's coming is near .
59005009	Do not complain against one another , my friends , so that God will not judge you . The Judge is near , ready to appear .
59005010	My friends , remember the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord . Take them as examples of patient endurance under suffering .
59005011	We call them happy because they endured . You have heard of Job's patience , and you know how the Lord provided for him in the end . For the Lord is full of mercy and compassion .
59005012	Above all , my friends , do not use an oath when you make a promise . Do not swear by heaven or by earth or by anything else . Say only “ Yes ” when you mean yes , and “ No ” when you mean no , and then you will not come under God's judgment .
59005013	Are any among you in trouble ? They should pray . Are any among you happy ? They should sing praises .
59005014	Are any among you sick ? They should send for the church elders , who will pray for them and rub olive oil on them in the name of the Lord .
59005015	This prayer made in faith will heal the sick ; the Lord will restore them to health , and the sins they have committed will be forgiven .
59005016	So then , confess your sins to one another and pray for one another , so that you will be healed . The prayer of a good person has a powerful effect .
59005017	Elijah was the same kind of person as we are . He prayed earnestly that there would be no rain , and no rain fell on the land for three and a half years .
59005018	Once again he prayed , and the sky poured out its rain and the earth produced its crops .
59005019	My friends , if any of you wander away from the truth and another one brings you back again ,
59005020	remember this : whoever turns a sinner back from the wrong way will save that sinner's soul from death and bring about the forgiveness of many sins .
60001001	From Peter , apostle of Jesus Christ— To God's chosen people who live as refugees scattered throughout the provinces of Pontus , Galatia , Cappadocia , Asia , and Bithynia .
60001002	You were chosen according to the purpose of God the Father and were made a holy people by his Spirit , to obey Jesus Christ and be purified by his blood . May grace and peace be yours in full measure .
60001003	Let us give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ! Because of his great mercy he gave us new life by raising Jesus Christ from death . This fills us with a living hope ,
60001004	and so we look forward to possessing the rich blessings that God keeps for his people . He keeps them for you in heaven , where they cannot decay or spoil or fade away .
60001005	They are for you , who through faith are kept safe by God's power for the salvation which is ready to be revealed at the end of time .
60001006	Be glad about this , even though it may now be necessary for you to be sad for a while because of the many kinds of trials you suffer .
60001007	Their purpose is to prove that your faith is genuine . Even gold , which can be destroyed , is tested by fire ; and so your faith , which is much more precious than gold , must also be tested , so that it may endure . Then you will receive praise and glory and honor on the Day when Jesus Christ is revealed .
60001008	You love him , although you have not seen him , and you believe in him , although you do not now see him . So you rejoice with a great and glorious joy which words cannot express ,
60001009	because you are receiving the salvation of your souls , which is the purpose of your faith in him .
60001010	It was concerning this salvation that the prophets made careful search and investigation , and they prophesied about this gift which God would give you .
60001011	They tried to find out when the time would be and how it would come . This was the time to which Christ's Spirit in them was pointing , in predicting the sufferings that Christ would have to endure and the glory that would follow .
60001012	God revealed to these prophets that their work was not for their own benefit , but for yours , as they spoke about those things which you have now heard from the messengers who announced the Good News by the power of the Holy Spirit sent from heaven . These are things which even the angels would like to understand .
60001013	So then , have your minds ready for action . Keep alert and set your hope completely on the blessing which will be given you when Jesus Christ is revealed .
60001014	Be obedient to God , and do not allow your lives to be shaped by those desires you had when you were still ignorant .
60001015	Instead , be holy in all that you do , just as God who called you is holy .
60001016	The scripture says , “ Be holy because I am holy . ”
60001017	You call him Father , when you pray to God , who judges all people by the same standard , according to what each one has done ; so then , spend the rest of your lives here on earth in reverence for him .
60001018	For you know what was paid to set you free from the worthless manner of life handed down by your ancestors . It was not something that can be destroyed , such as silver or gold ;
60001019	it was the costly sacrifice of Christ , who was like a lamb without defect or flaw .
60001020	He had been chosen by God before the creation of the world and was revealed in these last days for your sake .
60001021	Through him you believe in God , who raised him from death and gave him glory ; and so your faith and hope are fixed on God .
60001022	Now that by your obedience to the truth you have purified yourselves and have come to have a sincere love for other believers , love one another earnestly with all your heart .
60001023	For through the living and eternal word of God you have been born again as the children of a parent who is immortal , not mortal .
60001024	As the scripture says , “ All human beings are like grass , and all their glory is like wild flowers . The grass withers , and the flowers fall ,
60001025	but the word of the Lord remains forever . ”
60002001	Rid yourselves , then , of all evil ; no more lying or hypocrisy or jealousy or insulting language .
60002002	Be like newborn babies , always thirsty for the pure spiritual milk , so that by drinking it you may grow up and be saved .
60002003	As the scripture says , “ You have found out for yourselves how kind the Lord is . ”
60002004	Come to the Lord , the living stone rejected by people as worthless but chosen by God as valuable .
60002005	Come as living stones , and let yourselves be used in building the spiritual temple , where you will serve as holy priests to offer spiritual and acceptable sacrifices to God through Jesus Christ .
60002006	For the scripture says , “ I chose a valuable stone , which I am placing as the cornerstone in Zion ; and whoever believes in him will never be disappointed . ” “ The stone which the builders rejected as worthless turned out to be the most important of all . ” “ This is the stone that will make people stumble , the rock that will make them fall . ”
60002009	But you are the chosen race , the King's priests , the holy nation , God's own people , chosen to proclaim the wonderful acts of God , who called you out of darkness into his own marvelous light .
60002010	At one time you were not God's people , but now you are his people ; at one time you did not know God's mercy , but now you have received his mercy .
60002011	I appeal to you , my friends , as strangers and refugees in this world ! Do not give in to bodily passions , which are always at war against the soul .
60002012	Your conduct among the heathen should be so good that when they accuse you of being evildoers , they will have to recognize your good deeds and so praise God on the Day of his coming .
60002013	For the sake of the Lord submit yourselves to every human authority : to the Emperor , who is the supreme authority ,
60002014	and to the governors , who have been appointed by him to punish the evildoers and to praise those who do good .
60002015	For God wants you to silence the ignorant talk of foolish people by the good things you do .
60002016	Live as free people ; do not , however , use your freedom to cover up any evil , but live as God's slaves .
60002017	Respect everyone , love other believers , honor God , and respect the Emperor .
60002018	You servants must submit yourselves to your masters and show them complete respect , not only to those who are kind and considerate , but also to those who are harsh .
60002019	God will bless you for this , if you endure the pain of undeserved suffering because you are conscious of his will .
60002020	For what credit is there if you endure the beatings you deserve for having done wrong ? But if you endure suffering even when you have done right , God will bless you for it .
60002021	It was to this that God called you , for Christ himself suffered for you and left you an example , so that you would follow in his steps .
60002022	He committed no sin , and no one ever heard a lie come from his lips .
60002023	When he was insulted , he did not answer back with an insult ; when he suffered , he did not threaten , but placed his hopes in God , the righteous Judge .
60002024	Christ himself carried our sins in his body to the cross , so that we might die to sin and live for righteousness . It is by his wounds that you have been healed .
60002025	You were like sheep that had lost their way , but now you have been brought back to follow the Shepherd and Keeper of your souls .
60003001	In the same way you wives must submit yourselves to your husbands , so that if any of them do not believe God's word , your conduct will win them over to believe . It will not be necessary for you to say a word ,
60003002	because they will see how pure and reverent your conduct is .
60003003	You should not use outward aids to make yourselves beautiful , such as the way you fix your hair , or the jewelry you put on , or the dresses you wear .
60003004	Instead , your beauty should consist of your true inner self , the ageless beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit , which is of the greatest value in God's sight .
60003005	For the devout women of the past who placed their hope in God used to make themselves beautiful by submitting themselves to their husbands .
60003006	Sarah was like that ; she obeyed Abraham and called him her master . You are now her daughters if you do good and are not afraid of anything .
60003007	In the same way you husbands must live with your wives with the proper understanding that they are more delicate than you . Treat them with respect , because they also will receive , together with you , God's gift of life . Do this so that nothing will interfere with your prayers .
60003008	To conclude : you must all have the same attitude and the same feelings ; love one another , and be kind and humble with one another .
60003009	Do not pay back evil with evil or cursing with cursing ; instead , pay back with a blessing , because a blessing is what God promised to give you when he called you .
60003010	As the scripture says , “ If you want to enjoy life and wish to see good times , you must keep from speaking evil and stop telling lies .
60003011	You must turn away from evil and do good ; you must strive for peace with all your heart .
60003012	For the Lord watches over the righteous and listens to their prayers ; but he opposes those who do evil . ”
60003013	Who will harm you if you are eager to do what is good ?
60003014	But even if you should suffer for doing what is right , how happy you are ! Do not be afraid of anyone , and do not worry .
60003015	But have reverence for Christ in your hearts , and honor him as Lord . Be ready at all times to answer anyone who asks you to explain the hope you have in you ,
60003016	but do it with gentleness and respect . Keep your conscience clear , so that when you are insulted , those who speak evil of your good conduct as followers of Christ will become ashamed of what they say .
60003017	For it is better to suffer for doing good , if this should be God's will , than for doing evil .
60003018	For Christ died for sins once and for all , a good man on behalf of sinners , in order to lead you to God . He was put to death physically , but made alive spiritually ,
60003019	and in his spiritual existence he went and preached to the imprisoned spirits .
60003020	These were the spirits of those who had not obeyed God when he waited patiently during the days that Noah was building his boat . The few people in the boat—eight in all—were saved by the water ,
60003021	which was a symbol pointing to baptism , which now saves you . It is not the washing off of bodily dirt , but the promise made to God from a good conscience . It saves you through the resurrection of Jesus Christ ,
60003022	who has gone to heaven and is at the right side of God , ruling over all angels and heavenly authorities and powers .
60004001	Since Christ suffered physically , you too must strengthen yourselves with the same way of thinking that he had ; because whoever suffers physically is no longer involved with sin .
60004002	From now on , then , you must live the rest of your earthly lives controlled by God's will and not by human desires .
60004003	You have spent enough time in the past doing what the heathen like to do . Your lives were spent in indecency , lust , drunkenness , orgies , drinking parties , and the disgusting worship of idols .
60004004	And now the heathen are surprised when you do not join them in the same wild and reckless living , and so they insult you .
60004005	But they will have to give an account of themselves to God , who is ready to judge the living and the dead .
60004006	That is why the Good News was preached also to the dead , to those who had been judged in their physical existence as everyone is judged ; it was preached to them so that in their spiritual existence they may live as God lives .
60004007	The end of all things is near . You must be self-controlled and alert , to be able to pray .
60004008	Above everything , love one another earnestly , because love covers over many sins .
60004009	Open your homes to each other without complaining .
60004010	Each one , as a good manager of God's different gifts , must use for the good of others the special gift he has received from God .
60004011	Those who preach must preach God's messages ; those who serve must serve with the strength that God gives them , so that in all things praise may be given to God through Jesus Christ , to whom belong glory and power forever and ever . Amen .
60004012	My dear friends , do not be surprised at the painful test you are suffering , as though something unusual were happening to you .
60004013	Rather be glad that you are sharing Christ's sufferings , so that you may be full of joy when his glory is revealed .
60004014	Happy are you if you are insulted because you are Christ's followers ; this means that the glorious Spirit , the Spirit of God , is resting on you .
60004015	If you suffer , it must not be because you are a murderer or a thief or a criminal or a meddler in other people's affairs .
60004016	However , if you suffer because you are a Christian , don't be ashamed of it , but thank God that you bear Christ's name .
60004017	The time has come for judgment to begin , and God's own people are the first to be judged . If it starts with us , how will it end with those who do not believe the Good News from God ?
60004018	As the scripture says , “ It is difficult for good people to be saved ; what , then , will become of godless sinners ? ”
60005001	I , who am an elder myself , appeal to the church elders among you . I am a witness of Christ's sufferings , and I will share in the glory that will be revealed . I appeal to you
60005002	to be shepherds of the flock that God gave you and to take care of it willingly , as God wants you to , and not unwillingly . Do your work , not for mere pay , but from a real desire to serve .
60005003	Do not try to rule over those who have been put in your care , but be examples to the flock .
60005004	And when the Chief Shepherd appears , you will receive the glorious crown which will never lose its brightness .
60005005	In the same way you younger people must submit yourselves to your elders . And all of you must put on the apron of humility , to serve one another ; for the scripture says , “ God resists the proud , but shows favor to the humble . ”
60005006	Humble yourselves , then , under God's mighty hand , so that he will lift you up in his own good time .
60005007	Leave all your worries with him , because he cares for you .
60005008	Be alert , be on watch ! Your enemy , the Devil , roams around like a roaring lion , looking for someone to devour .
60005009	Be firm in your faith and resist him , because you know that other believers in all the world are going through the same kind of sufferings .
60005010	But after you have suffered for a little while , the God of all grace , who calls you to share his eternal glory in union with Christ , will himself perfect you and give you firmness , strength , and a sure foundation .
60005011	To him be the power forever ! Amen .
60005012	I write you this brief letter with the help of Silas , whom I regard as a faithful Christian . I want to encourage you and give my testimony that this is the true grace of God . Stand firm in it .
60005013	Your sister church in Babylon , also chosen by God , sends you greetings , and so does my son Mark .
60005014	Greet one another with the kiss of Christian love . May peace be with all of you who belong to Christ .
61001001	From Simon Peter , a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ— To those who through the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ have been given a faith as precious as ours :
61001002	May grace and peace be yours in full measure through your knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord .
61001003	God's divine power has given us everything we need to live a truly religious life through our knowledge of the one who called us to share in his own glory and goodness .
61001004	In this way he has given us the very great and precious gifts he promised , so that by means of these gifts you may escape from the destructive lust that is in the world , and may come to share the divine nature .
61001005	For this very reason do your best to add goodness to your faith ; to your goodness add knowledge ;
61001006	to your knowledge add self-control ; to your self-control add endurance ; to your endurance add godliness ;
61001007	to your godliness add Christian affection ; and to your Christian affection add love .
61001008	These are the qualities you need , and if you have them in abundance , they will make you active and effective in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ .
61001009	But if you do not have them , you are so shortsighted that you cannot see and have forgotten that you have been purified from your past sins .
61001010	So then , my friends , try even harder to make God's call and his choice of you a permanent experience ; if you do so , you will never abandon your faith .
61001011	In this way you will be given the full right to enter the eternal Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ .
61001012	And so I will always remind you of these matters , even though you already know them and are firmly grounded in the truth you have received .
61001013	I think it only right for me to stir up your memory of these matters as long as I am still alive .
61001014	I know that I shall soon put off this mortal body , as our Lord Jesus Christ plainly told me .
61001015	I will do my best , then , to provide a way for you to remember these matters at all times after my death .
61001016	We have not depended on made-up stories in making known to you the mighty coming of our Lord Jesus Christ . With our own eyes we saw his greatness .
61001017	We were there when he was given honor and glory by God the Father , when the voice came to him from the Supreme Glory , saying , “ This is my own dear Son , with whom I am pleased ! ”
61001018	We ourselves heard this voice coming from heaven , when we were with him on the holy mountain .
61001019	So we are even more confident of the message proclaimed by the prophets . You will do well to pay attention to it , because it is like a lamp shining in a dark place until the Day dawns and the light of the morning star shines in your hearts .
61001020	Above all else , however , remember that none of us can explain by ourselves a prophecy in the Scriptures .
61001021	For no prophetic message ever came just from the human will , but people were under the control of the Holy Spirit as they spoke the message that came from God .
61002001	False prophets appeared in the past among the people , and in the same way false teachers will appear among you . They will bring in destructive , untrue doctrines , and will deny the Master who redeemed them , and so they will bring upon themselves sudden destruction .
61002002	Even so , many will follow their immoral ways ; and because of what they do , others will speak evil of the Way of truth .
61002003	In their greed these false teachers will make a profit out of telling you made-up stories . For a long time now their Judge has been ready , and their Destroyer has been wide awake !
61002004	God did not spare the angels who sinned , but threw them into hell , where they are kept chained in darkness , waiting for the Day of Judgment .
61002005	God did not spare the ancient world , but brought the flood on the world of godless people ; the only ones he saved were Noah , who preached righteousness , and seven other people .
61002006	God condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah , destroying them with fire , and made them an example of what will happen to the godless .
61002007	He rescued Lot , a good man , who was distressed by the immoral conduct of lawless people .
61002008	That good man lived among them , and day after day he suffered agony as he saw and heard their evil actions .
61002009	And so the Lord knows how to rescue godly people from their trials and how to keep the wicked under punishment for the Day of Judgment ,
61002010	especially those who follow their filthy bodily lusts and despise God's authority . These false teachers are bold and arrogant , and show no respect for the glorious beings above ; instead , they insult them .
61002011	Even the angels , who are so much stronger and mightier than these false teachers , do not accuse them with insults in the presence of the Lord .
61002012	But these people act by instinct , like wild animals born to be captured and killed ; they attack with insults anything they do not understand . They will be destroyed like wild animals ,
61002013	and they will be paid with suffering for the suffering they have caused . Pleasure for them is to do anything in broad daylight that will satisfy their bodily appetites ; they are a shame and a disgrace as they join you in your meals , all the while enjoying their deceitful ways !
61002014	They want to look for nothing but the chance to commit adultery ; their appetite for sin is never satisfied . They lead weak people into a trap . Their hearts are trained to be greedy . They are under God's curse !
61002015	They have left the straight path and have lost their way ; they have followed the path taken by Balaam son of Beor , who loved the money he would get for doing wrong
61002016	and was rebuked for his sin . His donkey spoke with a human voice and stopped the prophet's insane action .
61002017	These people are like dried-up springs , like clouds blown along by a storm ; God has reserved a place for them in the deepest darkness .
61002018	They make proud and stupid statements , and use immoral bodily lusts to trap those who are just beginning to escape from among people who live in error .
61002019	They promise them freedom while they themselves are slaves of destructive habits—for we are slaves of anything that has conquered us .
61002020	If people have escaped from the corrupting forces of the world through their knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ , and then are again caught and conquered by them , such people are in worse condition at the end than they were at the beginning .
61002021	It would have been much better for them never to have known the way of righteousness than to know it and then turn away from the sacred command that was given them .
61002022	What happened to them shows that the proverbs are true : “ A dog goes back to what it has vomited ” and “ A pig that has been washed goes back to roll in the mud . ”
61003001	My dear friends , this is now the second letter I have written you . In both letters I have tried to arouse pure thoughts in your minds by reminding you of these things .
61003002	I want you to remember the words that were spoken long ago by the holy prophets , and the command from the Lord and Savior which was given you by your apostles .
61003003	First of all , you must understand that in the last days some people will appear whose lives are controlled by their own lusts . They will make fun of you
61003004	and will ask , “ He promised to come , didn't he ? Where is he ? Our ancestors have already died , but everything is still the same as it was since the creation of the world ! ”
61003005	They purposely ignore the fact that long ago God gave a command , and the heavens and earth were created . The earth was formed out of water and by water ,
61003006	and it was also by water , the water of the flood , that the old world was destroyed .
61003007	But the heavens and the earth that now exist are being preserved by the same command of God , in order to be destroyed by fire . They are being kept for the day when godless people will be judged and destroyed .
61003008	But do not forget one thing , my dear friends ! There is no difference in the Lord's sight between one day and a thousand years ; to him the two are the same .
61003009	The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised , as some think . Instead , he is patient with you , because he does not want anyone to be destroyed , but wants all to turn away from their sins .
61003010	But the Day of the Lord will come like a thief . On that Day the heavens will disappear with a shrill noise , the heavenly bodies will burn up and be destroyed , and the earth with everything in it will vanish .
61003011	Since all these things will be destroyed in this way , what kind of people should you be ? Your lives should be holy and dedicated to God ,
61003012	as you wait for the Day of God and do your best to make it come soon—the Day when the heavens will burn up and be destroyed , and the heavenly bodies will be melted by the heat .
61003013	But we wait for what God has promised : new heavens and a new earth , where righteousness will be at home .
61003014	And so , my friends , as you wait for that Day , do your best to be pure and faultless in God's sight and to be at peace with him .
61003015	Look on our Lord's patience as the opportunity he is giving you to be saved , just as our dear friend Paul wrote to you , using the wisdom that God gave him .
61003016	This is what he says in all his letters when he writes on the subject . There are some difficult things in his letters which ignorant and unstable people explain falsely , as they do with other passages of the Scriptures . So they bring on their own destruction .
61003017	But you , my friends , already know this . Be on your guard , then , so that you will not be led away by the errors of lawless people and fall from your safe position .
61003018	But continue to grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ . To him be the glory , now and forever ! Amen .
62001001	We write to you about the Word of life , which has existed from the very beginning . We have heard it , and we have seen it with our eyes ; yes , we have seen it , and our hands have touched it .
62001002	When this life became visible , we saw it ; so we speak of it and tell you about the eternal life which was with the Father and was made known to us .
62001003	What we have seen and heard we announce to you also , so that you will join with us in the fellowship that we have with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ .
62001004	We write this in order that our joy may be complete .
62001005	Now the message that we have heard from his Son and announce is this : God is light , and there is no darkness at all in him .
62001006	If , then , we say that we have fellowship with him , yet at the same time live in the darkness , we are lying both in our words and in our actions .
62001007	But if we live in the light—just as he is in the light—then we have fellowship with one another , and the blood of Jesus , his Son , purifies us from every sin .
62001008	If we say that we have no sin , we deceive ourselves , and there is no truth in us .
62001009	But if we confess our sins to God , he will keep his promise and do what is right : he will forgive us our sins and purify us from all our wrongdoing .
62001010	If we say that we have not sinned , we make a liar out of God , and his word is not in us .
62002001	I am writing this to you , my children , so that you will not sin ; but if anyone does sin , we have someone who pleads with the Father on our behalf—Jesus Christ , the righteous one .
62002002	And Christ himself is the means by which our sins are forgiven , and not our sins only , but also the sins of everyone .
62002003	If we obey God's commands , then we are sure that we know him .
62002004	If we say that we know him , but do not obey his commands , we are liars and there is no truth in us .
62002005	But if we obey his word , we are the ones whose love for God has really been made perfect . This is how we can be sure that we are in union with God :
62002006	if we say that we remain in union with God , we should live just as Jesus Christ did .
62002007	My dear friends , this command I am writing you is not new ; it is the old command , the one you have had from the very beginning . The old command is the message you have already heard .
62002008	However , the command I now write you is new , because its truth is seen in Christ and also in you . For the darkness is passing away , and the real light is already shining .
62002009	If we say that we are in the light , yet hate others , we are in the darkness to this very hour .
62002010	If we love others , we live in the light , and so there is nothing in us that will cause someone else to sin .
62002011	But if we hate others , we are in the darkness ; we walk in it and do not know where we are going , because the darkness has made us blind .
62002012	I write to you , my children , because your sins are forgiven for the sake of Christ .
62002013	I write to you , fathers , because you know him who has existed from the beginning . I write to you , young people , because you have defeated the Evil One .
62002014	I write to you , my children , because you know the Father . I write to you , fathers , because you know him who has existed from the beginning . I write to you , young people , because you are strong ; the word of God lives in you , and you have defeated the Evil One .
62002015	Do not love the world or anything that belongs to the world . If you love the world , you do not love the Father .
62002016	Everything that belongs to the world—what the sinful self desires , what people see and want , and everything in this world that people are so proud of—none of this comes from the Father ; it all comes from the world .
62002017	The world and everything in it that people desire is passing away ; but those who do the will of God live forever .
62002018	My children , the end is near ! You were told that the Enemy of Christ would come ; and now many enemies of Christ have already appeared , and so we know that the end is near .
62002019	These people really did not belong to our fellowship , and that is why they left us ; if they had belonged to our fellowship , they would have stayed with us . But they left so that it might be clear that none of them really belonged to us .
62002020	But you have had the Holy Spirit poured out on you by Christ , and so all of you know the truth .
62002021	I write you , then , not because you do not know the truth ; instead , it is because you do know it , and you also know that no lie ever comes from the truth .
62002022	Who , then , is the liar ? It is those who say that Jesus is not the Messiah . Such people are the Enemy of Christ—they reject both the Father and the Son .
62002023	For those who reject the Son reject also the Father ; those who accept the Son have the Father also .
62002024	Be sure , then , to keep in your hearts the message you heard from the beginning . If you keep that message , then you will always live in union with the Son and the Father .
62002025	And this is what Christ himself promised to give us—eternal life .
62002026	I am writing this to you about those who are trying to deceive you .
62002027	But as for you , Christ has poured out his Spirit on you . As long as his Spirit remains in you , you do not need anyone to teach you . For his Spirit teaches you about everything , and what he teaches is true , not false . Obey the Spirit's teaching , then , and remain in union with Christ .
62002028	Yes , my children , remain in union with him , so that when he appears we may be full of courage and need not hide in shame from him on the Day he comes .
62002029	You know that Christ is righteous ; you should know , then , that everyone who does what is right is God's child .
62003001	See how much the Father has loved us ! His love is so great that we are called God's children—and so , in fact , we are . This is why the world does not know us : it has not known God .
62003002	My dear friends , we are now God's children , but it is not yet clear what we shall become . But we know that when Christ appears , we shall be like him , because we shall see him as he really is .
62003003	Everyone who has this hope in Christ keeps himself pure , just as Christ is pure .
62003004	Whoever sins is guilty of breaking God's law , because sin is a breaking of the law .
62003005	You know that Christ appeared in order to take away sins , and that there is no sin in him .
62003006	So everyone who lives in union with Christ does not continue to sin ; but whoever continues to sin has never seen him or known him .
62003007	Let no one deceive you , my children ! Whoever does what is right is righteous , just as Christ is righteous .
62003008	Whoever continues to sin belongs to the Devil , because the Devil has sinned from the very beginning . The Son of God appeared for this very reason , to destroy what the Devil had done .
62003009	Those who are children of God do not continue to sin , for God's very nature is in them ; and because God is their Father , they cannot continue to sin .
62003010	Here is the clear difference between God's children and the Devil's children : those who do not do what is right or do not love others are not God's children .
62003011	The message you heard from the very beginning is this : we must love one another .
62003012	We must not be like Cain ; he belonged to the Evil One and murdered his own brother Abel . Why did Cain murder him ? Because the things he himself did were wrong , and the things his brother did were right .
62003013	So do not be surprised , my friends , if the people of the world hate you .
62003014	We know that we have left death and come over into life ; we know it because we love others . Those who do not love are still under the power of death .
62003015	Those who hate others are murderers , and you know that murderers do not have eternal life in them .
62003016	This is how we know what love is : Christ gave his life for us . We too , then , ought to give our lives for others !
62003017	If we are rich and see others in need , yet close our hearts against them , how can we claim that we love God ?
62003018	My children , our love should not be just words and talk ; it must be true love , which shows itself in action .
62003019	This , then , is how we will know that we belong to the truth ; this is how we will be confident in God's presence .
62003020	If our conscience condemns us , we know that God is greater than our conscience and that he knows everything .
62003021	And so , my dear friends , if our conscience does not condemn us , we have courage in God's presence .
62003022	We receive from him whatever we ask , because we obey his commands and do what pleases him .
62003023	What he commands is that we believe in his Son Jesus Christ and love one another , just as Christ commanded us .
62003024	Those who obey God's commands live in union with God and God lives in union with them . And because of the Spirit that God has given us we know that God lives in union with us .
62004001	My dear friends , do not believe all who claim to have the Spirit , but test them to find out if the spirit they have comes from God . For many false prophets have gone out everywhere .
62004002	This is how you will be able to know whether it is God's Spirit : anyone who acknowledges that Jesus Christ came as a human being has the Spirit who comes from God .
62004003	But anyone who denies this about Jesus does not have the Spirit from God . The spirit that he has is from the Enemy of Christ ; you heard that it would come , and now it is here in the world already .
62004004	But you belong to God , my children , and have defeated the false prophets , because the Spirit who is in you is more powerful than the spirit in those who belong to the world .
62004005	Those false prophets speak about matters of the world , and the world listens to them because they belong to the world .
62004006	But we belong to God . Whoever knows God listens to us ; whoever does not belong to God does not listen to us . This , then , is how we can tell the difference between the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error .
62004007	Dear friends , let us love one another , because love comes from God . Whoever loves is a child of God and knows God .
62004008	Whoever does not love does not know God , for God is love .
62004009	And God showed his love for us by sending his only Son into the world , so that we might have life through him .
62004010	This is what love is : it is not that we have loved God , but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the means by which our sins are forgiven .
62004011	Dear friends , if this is how God loved us , then we should love one another .
62004012	No one has ever seen God , but if we love one another , God lives in union with us , and his love is made perfect in us .
62004013	We are sure that we live in union with God and that he lives in union with us , because he has given us his Spirit .
62004014	And we have seen and tell others that the Father sent his Son to be the Savior of the world .
62004015	If we declare that Jesus is the Son of God , we live in union with God and God lives in union with us .
62004016	And we ourselves know and believe the love which God has for us . God is love , and those who live in love live in union with God and God lives in union with them .
62004017	Love is made perfect in us in order that we may have courage on the Judgment Day ; and we will have it because our life in this world is the same as Christ's .
62004018	There is no fear in love ; perfect love drives out all fear . So then , love has not been made perfect in anyone who is afraid , because fear has to do with punishment .
62004019	We love because God first loved us .
62004020	If we say we love God , but hate others , we are liars . For we cannot love God , whom we have not seen , if we do not love others , whom we have seen .
62004021	The command that Christ has given us is this : whoever loves God must love others also .
62005001	Whoever believes that Jesus is the Messiah is a child of God ; and whoever loves a father loves his child also .
62005002	This is how we know that we love God's children : it is by loving God and obeying his commands .
62005003	For our love for God means that we obey his commands . And his commands are not too hard for us ,
62005004	because every child of God is able to defeat the world . And we win the victory over the world by means of our faith .
62005005	Who can defeat the world ? Only the person who believes that Jesus is the Son of God .
62005006	Jesus Christ is the one who came with the water of his baptism and the blood of his death . He came not only with the water , but with both the water and the blood . And the Spirit himself testifies that this is true , because the Spirit is truth .
62005007	There are three witnesses :
62005008	the Spirit , the water , and the blood ; and all three give the same testimony .
62005009	We believe human testimony ; but God's testimony is much stronger , and he has given this testimony about his Son .
62005010	So those who believe in the Son of God have this testimony in their own heart ; but those who do not believe God , have made a liar of him , because they have not believed what God has said about his Son .
62005011	The testimony is this : God has given us eternal life , and this life has its source in his Son .
62005012	Whoever has the Son has this life ; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life .
62005013	I am writing this to you so that you may know that you have eternal life—you that believe in the Son of God .
62005014	We have courage in God's presence , because we are sure that he hears us if we ask him for anything that is according to his will .
62005015	He hears us whenever we ask him ; and since we know this is true , we know also that he gives us what we ask from him .
62005016	If you see a believer commit a sin that does not lead to death , you should pray to God , who will give that person life . This applies to those whose sins do not lead to death . But there is sin which leads to death , and I do not say that you should pray to God about that .
62005017	All wrongdoing is sin , but there is sin which does not lead to death .
62005018	We know that no children of God keep on sinning , for the Son of God keeps them safe , and the Evil One cannot harm them .
62005019	We know that we belong to God even though the whole world is under the rule of the Evil One .
62005020	We know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding , so that we know the true God . We live in union with the true God—in union with his Son Jesus Christ . This is the true God , and this is eternal life .
62005021	My children , keep yourselves safe from false gods !
63001001	From the Elder— To the dear Lady and to her children , whom I truly love . And I am not the only one , but all who know the truth love you ,
63001002	because the truth remains in us and will be with us forever .
63001003	May God the Father and Jesus Christ , the Father's Son , give us grace , mercy , and peace ; may they be ours in truth and love .
63001004	How happy I was to find that some of your children live in the truth , just as the Father commanded us .
63001005	And so I ask you , dear Lady : let us all love one another . This is no new command I am writing you ; it is the command which we have had from the beginning .
63001006	This love I speak of means that we must live in obedience to God's commands . The command , as you have all heard from the beginning , is that you must all live in love .
63001007	Many deceivers have gone out over the world , people who do not acknowledge that Jesus Christ came as a human being . Such a person is a deceiver and the Enemy of Christ .
63001008	Be on your guard , then , so that you will not lose what we have worked for , but will receive your reward in full .
63001009	Anyone who does not stay with the teaching of Christ , but goes beyond it , does not have God . Whoever does stay with the teaching has both the Father and the Son .
63001010	So then , if some come to you who do not bring this teaching , do not welcome them in your homes ; do not even say , “ Peace be with you . ”
63001011	For anyone who wishes them peace becomes their partner in the evil things they do .
63001012	I have so much to tell you , but I would rather not do it with paper and ink ; instead , I hope to visit you and talk with you personally , so that we shall be completely happy .
63001013	The children of your dear Sister send you their greetings .
64001001	From the Elder— To my dear Gaius , whom I truly love .
64001002	My dear friend , I pray that everything may go well with you and that you may be in good health—as I know you are well in spirit .
64001003	I was so happy when some Christians arrived and told me how faithful you are to the truth—just as you always live in the truth .
64001004	Nothing makes me happier than to hear that my children live in the truth .
64001005	My dear friend , you are so faithful in the work you do for other Christians , even when they are strangers .
64001006	They have spoken to the church here about your love . Please help them to continue their trip in a way that will please God .
64001007	For they set out on their trip in the service of Christ without accepting any help from unbelievers .
64001008	We Christians , then , must help these people , so that we may share in their work for the truth .
64001009	I wrote a short letter to the church ; but Diotrephes , who likes to be their leader , will not pay any attention to what I say .
64001010	When I come , then , I will bring up everything he has done : the terrible things he says about us and the lies he tells ! But that is not enough for him ; he will not receive the Christians when they come , and even stops those who want to receive them and tries to drive them out of the church !
64001011	My dear friend , do not imitate what is bad , but imitate what is good . Whoever does good belongs to God ; whoever does what is bad has not seen God .
64001012	Everyone speaks well of Demetrius ; truth itself speaks well of him . And we add our testimony , and you know that what we say is true .
64001013	I have so much to tell you , but I do not want to do it with pen and ink .
64001014	I hope to see you soon , and then we will talk personally .
64001015	Peace be with you . All your friends send greetings . Greet all our friends personally .
65001001	From Jude , servant of Jesus Christ , and brother of James— To those who have been called by God , who live in the love of God the Father and the protection of Jesus Christ :
65001002	May mercy , peace , and love be yours in full measure .
65001003	My dear friends , I was doing my best to write to you about the salvation we share in common , when I felt the need of writing at once to encourage you to fight on for the faith which once and for all God has given to his people .
65001004	For some godless people have slipped in unnoticed among us , persons who distort the message about the grace of our God in order to excuse their immoral ways , and who reject Jesus Christ , our only Master and Lord . Long ago the Scriptures predicted the condemnation they have received .
65001005	For even though you know all this , I want to remind you of how the Lord once rescued the people of Israel from Egypt , but afterward destroyed those who did not believe .
65001006	Remember the angels who did not stay within the limits of their proper authority , but abandoned their own dwelling place : they are bound with eternal chains in the darkness below , where God is keeping them for that great Day on which they will be condemned .
65001007	Remember Sodom and Gomorrah , and the nearby towns , whose people acted as those angels did and indulged in sexual immorality and perversion : they suffer the punishment of eternal fire as a plain warning to all .
65001008	In the same way also , these people have visions which make them sin against their own bodies ; they despise God's authority and insult the glorious beings above .
65001009	Not even the chief angel Michael did this . In his quarrel with the Devil , when they argued about who would have the body of Moses , Michael did not dare condemn the Devil with insulting words , but said , “ The Lord rebuke you ! ”
65001010	But these people attack with insults anything they do not understand ; and those things that they know by instinct , like wild animals , are the very things that destroy them .
65001011	How terrible for them ! They have followed the way that Cain took . For the sake of money they have given themselves over to the error that Balaam committed . They have rebelled as Korah rebelled , and like him they are destroyed .
65001012	With their shameless carousing they are like dirty spots in your fellowship meals . They take care only of themselves . They are like clouds carried along by the wind , but bringing no rain . They are like trees that bear no fruit , even in autumn , trees that have been pulled up by the roots and are completely dead .
65001013	They are like wild waves of the sea , with their shameful deeds showing up like foam . They are like wandering stars , for whom God has reserved a place forever in the deepest darkness .
65001014	It was Enoch , the seventh direct descendant from Adam , who long ago prophesied this about them : “ The Lord will come with many thousands of his holy angels
65001015	to bring judgment on all , to condemn them all for the godless deeds they have performed and for all the terrible words that godless sinners have spoken against him ! ”
65001016	These people are always grumbling and blaming others ; they follow their own evil desires ; they brag about themselves and flatter others in order to get their own way .
65001017	But remember , my friends , what you were told in the past by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ .
65001018	They said to you , “ When the last days come , people will appear who will make fun of you , people who follow their own godless desires . ”
65001019	These are the people who cause divisions , who are controlled by their natural desires , who do not have the Spirit .
65001020	But you , my friends , keep on building yourselves up on your most sacred faith . Pray in the power of the Holy Spirit ,
65001021	and keep yourselves in the love of God , as you wait for our Lord Jesus Christ in his mercy to give you eternal life .
65001022	Show mercy toward those who have doubts ;
65001023	save others by snatching them out of the fire ; and to others show mercy mixed with fear , but hate their very clothes , stained by their sinful lusts .
65001024	To him who is able to keep you from falling and to bring you faultless and joyful before his glorious presence—
65001025	to the only God our Savior , through Jesus Christ our Lord , be glory , majesty , might , and authority , from all ages past , and now , and forever and ever ! Amen .
66001001	This book is the record of the events that Jesus Christ revealed . God gave him this revelation in order to show to his servants what must happen very soon . Christ made these things known to his servant John by sending his angel to him ,
66001002	and John has told all that he has seen . This is his report concerning the message from God and the truth revealed by Jesus Christ .
66001003	Happy is the one who reads this book , and happy are those who listen to the words of this prophetic message and obey what is written in this book ! For the time is near when all these things will happen .
66001004	From John to the seven churches in the province of Asia : Grace and peace be yours from God , who is , who was , and who is to come , and from the seven spirits in front of his throne ,
66001005	and from Jesus Christ , the faithful witness , the first to be raised from death and who is also the ruler of the kings of the world . He loves us , and by his sacrificial death he has freed us from our sins
66001006	and made us a kingdom of priests to serve his God and Father . To Jesus Christ be the glory and power forever and ever ! Amen .
66001007	Look , he is coming on the clouds ! Everyone will see him , including those who pierced him . All peoples on earth will mourn over him . So shall it be !
66001008	“ I am the first and the last , ” says the Lord God Almighty , who is , who was , and who is to come .
66001009	I am John , your brother , and as a follower of Jesus I am your partner in patiently enduring the suffering that comes to those who belong to his Kingdom . I was put on the island of Patmos because I had proclaimed God's word and the truth that Jesus revealed .
66001010	On the Lord's day the Spirit took control of me , and I heard a loud voice , that sounded like a trumpet , speaking behind me .
66001011	It said , “ Write down what you see , and send the book to the churches in these seven cities : Ephesus , Smyrna , Pergamum , Thyatira , Sardis , Philadelphia , and Laodicea . ”
66001012	I turned around to see who was talking to me , and I saw seven gold lampstands ,
66001013	and among them there was what looked like a human being , wearing a robe that reached to his feet , and a gold band around his chest .
66001014	His hair was white as wool , or as snow , and his eyes blazed like fire ;
66001015	his feet shone like brass that has been refined and polished , and his voice sounded like a roaring waterfall .
66001016	He held seven stars in his right hand , and a sharp two-edged sword came out of his mouth . His face was as bright as the midday sun .
66001017	When I saw him , I fell down at his feet like a dead man . He placed his right hand on me and said , “ Don't be afraid ! I am the first and the last .
66001018	I am the living one ! I was dead , but now I am alive forever and ever . I have authority over death and the world of the dead .
66001019	Write , then , the things you see , both the things that are now and the things that will happen afterward .
66001020	Here is the secret meaning of the seven stars that you see in my right hand , and of the seven gold lampstands : the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches , and the seven lampstands are the seven churches .
66002001	“ To the angel of the church in Ephesus write : “ This is the message from the one who holds the seven stars in his right hand and who walks among the seven gold lampstands .
66002002	I know what you have done ; I know how hard you have worked and how patient you have been . I know that you cannot tolerate evil people and that you have tested those who say they are apostles but are not , and have found out that they are liars .
66002003	You are patient , you have suffered for my sake , and you have not given up .
66002004	But this is what I have against you : you do not love me now as you did at first .
66002005	Think how far you have fallen ! Turn from your sins and do what you did at first . If you don't turn from your sins , I will come to you and take your lampstand from its place .
66002006	But this is what you have in your favor : you hate what the Nicolaitans do , as much as I do .
66002007	“ If you have ears , then , listen to what the Spirit says to the churches ! “ To those who win the victory I will give the right to eat the fruit of the tree of life that grows in the Garden of God .
66002008	“ To the angel of the church in Smyrna write : “ This is the message from the one who is the first and the last , who died and lived again .
66002009	I know your troubles ; I know that you are poor—but really you are rich ! I know the evil things said against you by those who claim to be Jews but are not ; they are a group that belongs to Satan !
66002010	Don't be afraid of anything you are about to suffer . Listen ! The Devil will put you to the test by having some of you thrown into prison , and your troubles will last ten days . Be faithful to me , even if it means death , and I will give you life as your prize of victory .
66002011	“ If you have ears , then , listen to what the Spirit says to the churches ! “ Those who win the victory will not be hurt by the second death .
66002012	“ To the angel of the church in Pergamum write : “ This is the message from the one who has the sharp two-edged sword .
66002013	I know where you live , there where Satan has his throne . You are true to me , and you did not abandon your faith in me even during the time when Antipas , my faithful witness , was killed there where Satan lives .
66002014	But there are a few things I have against you : there are some among you who follow the teaching of Balaam , who taught Balak how to lead the people of Israel into sin by persuading them to eat food that had been offered to idols and to practice sexual immorality .
66002015	In the same way you have people among you who follow the teaching of the Nicolaitans .
66002016	Now turn from your sins ! If you don't , I will come to you soon and fight against those people with the sword that comes out of my mouth .
66002017	“ If you have ears , then , listen to what the Spirit says to the churches ! “ To those who win the victory I will give some of the hidden manna . I will also give each of them a white stone on which is written a new name that no one knows except the one who receives it .
66002018	“ To the angel of the church in Thyatira write : “ This is the message from the Son of God , whose eyes blaze like fire , whose feet shine like polished brass .
66002019	I know what you do . I know your love , your faithfulness , your service , and your patience . I know that you are doing more now than you did at first .
66002020	But this is what I have against you : you tolerate that woman Jezebel , who calls herself a messenger of God . By her teaching she misleads my servants into practicing sexual immorality and eating food that has been offered to idols .
66002021	I have given her time to repent of her sins , but she does not want to turn from her immorality .
66002022	And so I will throw her on a bed where she and those who committed adultery with her will suffer terribly . I will do this now unless they repent of the wicked things they did with her .
66002023	I will also kill her followers , and then all the churches will know that I am the one who knows everyone's thoughts and wishes . I will repay each of you according to what you have done .
66002024	“ But the rest of you in Thyatira have not followed this evil teaching ; you have not learned what the others call ‘ the deep secrets of Satan . ’ I say to you that I will not put any other burden on you .
66002025	But until I come , you must hold firmly to what you have .
66002029	“ If you have ears , then , listen to what the Spirit says to the churches !
66003001	“ To the angel of the church in Sardis write : “ This is the message from the one who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars . I know what you are doing ; I know that you have the reputation of being alive , even though you are dead !
66003002	So wake up , and strengthen what you still have before it dies completely . For I find that what you have done is not yet perfect in the sight of my God .
66003003	Remember , then , what you were taught and what you heard ; obey it and turn from your sins . If you do not wake up , I will come upon you like a thief , and you will not even know the time when I will come .
66003004	But a few of you there in Sardis have kept your clothes clean . You will walk with me , clothed in white , because you are worthy to do so .
66003005	Those who win the victory will be clothed like this in white , and I will not remove their names from the book of the living . In the presence of my Father and of his angels I will declare openly that they belong to me .
66003006	“ If you have ears , then , listen to what the Spirit says to the churches !
66003007	“ To the angel of the church in Philadelphia write : “ This is the message from the one who is holy and true . He has the key that belonged to David , and when he opens a door , no one can close it , and when he closes it , no one can open it .
66003008	I know what you do ; I know that you have a little power ; you have followed my teaching and have been faithful to me . I have opened a door in front of you , which no one can close .
66003009	Listen ! As for that group that belongs to Satan , those liars who claim that they are Jews but are not , I will make them come and bow down at your feet . They will all know that I love you .
66003010	Because you have kept my command to endure , I will also keep you safe from the time of trouble which is coming upon the world to test all the people on earth .
66003011	I am coming soon . Keep safe what you have , so that no one will rob you of your victory prize .
66003012	I will make those who are victorious pillars in the temple of my God , and they will never leave it . I will write on them the name of my God and the name of the city of my God , the new Jerusalem , which will come down out of heaven from my God . I will also write on them my new name .
66003013	“ If you have ears , then , listen to what the Spirit says to the churches !
66003014	“ To the angel of the church in Laodicea write : “ This is the message from the Amen , the faithful and true witness , who is the origin of all that God has created .
66003015	I know what you have done ; I know that you are neither cold nor hot . How I wish you were either one or the other !
66003016	But because you are lukewarm , neither hot nor cold , I am going to spit you out of my mouth !
66003017	You say , ‘ I am rich and well off ; I have all I need . ’ But you do not know how miserable and pitiful you are ! You are poor , naked , and blind .
66003018	I advise you , then , to buy gold from me , pure gold , in order to be rich . Buy also white clothing to dress yourself and cover up your shameful nakedness . Buy also some ointment to put on your eyes , so that you may see .
66003019	I rebuke and punish all whom I love . Be in earnest , then , and turn from your sins .
66003020	Listen ! I stand at the door and knock ; if any hear my voice and open the door , I will come into their house and eat with them , and they will eat with me .
66003021	To those who win the victory I will give the right to sit beside me on my throne , just as I have been victorious and now sit by my Father on his throne .
66003022	“ If you have ears , then , listen to what the Spirit says to the churches ! ”
66004001	At this point I had another vision and saw an open door in heaven . And the voice that sounded like a trumpet , which I had heard speaking to me before , said , “ Come up here , and I will show you what must happen after this . ”
66004002	At once the Spirit took control of me . There in heaven was a throne with someone sitting on it .
66004003	His face gleamed like such precious stones as jasper and carnelian , and all around the throne there was a rainbow the color of an emerald .
66004004	In a circle around the throne were twenty-four other thrones , on which were seated twenty-four elders dressed in white and wearing crowns of gold .
66004005	From the throne came flashes of lightning , rumblings , and peals of thunder . In front of the throne seven lighted torches were burning , which are the seven spirits of God .
66004006	Also in front of the throne there was what looked like a sea of glass , clear as crystal . Surrounding the throne on each of its sides , were four living creatures covered with eyes in front and behind .
66004007	The first one looked like a lion ; the second looked like a bull ; the third had a face like a human face ; and the fourth looked like an eagle in flight .
66004008	Each one of the four living creatures had six wings , and they were covered with eyes , inside and out . Day and night they never stop singing : “ Holy , holy , holy , is the Lord God Almighty , who was , who is , and who is to come . ”
66004009	The four living creatures sing songs of glory and honor and thanks to the one who sits on the throne , who lives forever and ever . When they do so ,
66004010	the twenty-four elders fall down before the one who sits on the throne , and worship him who lives forever and ever . They throw their crowns down in front of the throne and say ,
66004011	“ Our Lord and God ! You are worthy to receive glory , honor , and power . For you created all things , and by your will they were given existence and life . ”
66005001	I saw a scroll in the right hand of the one who sits on the throne ; it was covered with writing on both sides and was sealed with seven seals .
66005002	And I saw a mighty angel , who announced in a loud voice , “ Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll ? ”
66005003	But there was no one in heaven or on earth or in the world below who could open the scroll and look inside it .
66005004	I cried bitterly because no one could be found who was worthy to open the scroll or look inside it .
66005005	Then one of the elders said to me , “ Don't cry . Look ! The Lion from Judah's tribe , the great descendant of David , has won the victory , and he can break the seven seals and open the scroll . ”
66005006	Then I saw a Lamb standing in the center of the throne , surrounded by the four living creatures and the elders . The Lamb appeared to have been killed . It had seven horns and seven eyes , which are the seven spirits of God that have been sent through the whole earth .
66005007	The Lamb went and took the scroll from the right hand of the one who sits on the throne .
66005008	As he did so , the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb . Each had a harp and gold bowls filled with incense , which are the prayers of God's people .
66005009	They sang a new song : “ You are worthy to take the scroll and to break open its seals . For you were killed , and by your sacrificial death you bought for God people from every tribe , language , nation , and race .
66005010	You have made them a kingdom of priests to serve our God , and they shall rule on earth . ”
66005011	Again I looked , and I heard angels , thousands and millions of them ! They stood around the throne , the four living creatures , and the elders ,
66005012	and sang in a loud voice : “ The Lamb who was killed is worthy to receive power , wealth , wisdom , and strength , honor , glory , and praise ! ” “ To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb , be praise and honor , glory and might , forever and ever ! ”
66006001	Then I saw the Lamb break open the first of the seven seals , and I heard one of the four living creatures say in a voice that sounded like thunder , “ Come ! ”
66006002	I looked , and there was a white horse . Its rider held a bow , and he was given a crown . He rode out as a conqueror to conquer .
66006003	Then the Lamb broke open the second seal ; and I heard the second living creature say , “ Come ! ”
66006004	Another horse came out , a red one . Its rider was given the power to bring war on the earth , so that people should kill each other . He was given a large sword .
66006005	Then the Lamb broke open the third seal ; and I heard the third living creature say , “ Come ! ” I looked , and there was a black horse . Its rider held a pair of scales in his hand .
66006006	I heard what sounded like a voice coming from among the four living creatures , which said , “ A quart of wheat for a day's wages , and three quarts of barley for a day's wages . But do not damage the olive trees and the vineyards ! ”
66006007	Then the Lamb broke open the fourth seal ; and I heard the fourth living creature say , “ Come ! ”
66006008	I looked , and there was a pale-colored horse . Its rider was named Death , and Hades followed close behind . They were given authority over one fourth of the earth , to kill by means of war , famine , disease , and wild animals .
66006009	Then the Lamb broke open the fifth seal . I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been killed because they had proclaimed God's word and had been faithful in their witnessing .
66006010	They shouted in a loud voice , “ Almighty Lord , holy and true ! How long will it be until you judge the people on earth and punish them for killing us ? ”
66006011	Each of them was given a white robe , and they were told to rest a little while longer , until the complete number of other servants and believers were killed , as they had been .
66006012	And I saw the Lamb break open the sixth seal . There was a violent earthquake , and the sun became black like coarse black cloth , and the moon turned completely red like blood .
66006013	The stars fell down to the earth , like unripe figs falling from the tree when a strong wind shakes it .
66006014	The sky disappeared like a scroll being rolled up , and every mountain and island was moved from its place .
66006015	Then the kings of the earth , the rulers and the military chiefs , the rich and the powerful , and all other people , slave and free , hid themselves in caves and under rocks on the mountains .
66006016	They called out to the mountains and to the rocks , “ Fall on us and hide us from the eyes of the one who sits on the throne and from the anger of the Lamb !
66006017	The terrible day of their anger is here , and who can stand up against it ? ”
66007001	After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth , holding back the four winds so that no wind should blow on the earth or the sea or against any tree .
66007002	And I saw another angel coming up from the east with the seal of the living God . He called out in a loud voice to the four angels to whom God had given the power to damage the earth and the sea .
66007003	The angel said , “ Do not harm the earth , the sea , or the trees , until we mark the servants of our God with a seal on their foreheads . ”
66007004	And I was told that the number of those who were marked with God's seal on their foreheads was 144,000 . They were from the twelve tribes of Israel ,
66007009	After this I looked , and there was an enormous crowd—no one could count all the people ! They were from every race , tribe , nation , and language , and they stood in front of the throne and of the Lamb , dressed in white robes and holding palm branches in their hands .
66007010	They called out in a loud voice : “ Salvation comes from our God , who sits on the throne , and from the Lamb ! ”
66007011	All the angels stood around the throne , the elders , and the four living creatures . Then they threw themselves face downward in front of the throne and worshiped God ,
66007012	saying , “ Amen ! Praise , glory , wisdom , thanksgiving , honor , power , and might belong to our God forever and ever ! Amen ! ”
66007013	One of the elders asked me , “ Who are these people dressed in white robes , and where do they come from ? ”
66007014	“ I don't know , sir . You do , ” I answered . He said to me , “ These are the people who have come safely through the terrible persecution . They have washed their robes and made them white with the blood of the Lamb .
66007015	That is why they stand before God's throne and serve him day and night in his temple . He who sits on the throne will protect them with his presence .
66007016	Never again will they hunger or thirst ; neither sun nor any scorching heat will burn them ,
66007017	because the Lamb , who is in the center of the throne , will be their shepherd , and he will guide them to springs of life-giving water . And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes . ”
66008001	When the Lamb broke open the seventh seal , there was silence in heaven for about half an hour .
66008002	Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God , and they were given seven trumpets .
66008003	Another angel , who had a gold incense container , came and stood at the altar . He was given a lot of incense to add to the prayers of all God's people and to offer it on the gold altar that stands before the throne .
66008004	The smoke of the burning incense went up with the prayers of God's people from the hands of the angel standing before God .
66008005	Then the angel took the incense container , filled it with fire from the altar , and threw it on the earth . There were rumblings and peals of thunder , flashes of lightning , and an earthquake .
66008006	Then the seven angels with the seven trumpets prepared to blow them .
66008007	The first angel blew his trumpet . Hail and fire , mixed with blood , came pouring down on the earth . A third of the earth was burned up , a third of the trees , and every blade of green grass .
66008008	Then the second angel blew his trumpet . Something that looked like a huge mountain on fire was thrown into the sea . A third of the sea was turned into blood ,
66008009	a third of the living creatures in the sea died , and a third of the ships were destroyed .
66008010	Then the third angel blew his trumpet . A large star , burning like a torch , dropped from the sky and fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water .
66008011	( The name of the star is “ Bitterness . ” ) A third of the water turned bitter , and many people died from drinking the water , because it had turned bitter .
66008012	Then the fourth angel blew his trumpet . A third of the sun was struck , and a third of the moon , and a third of the stars , so that their light lost a third of its brightness ; there was no light during a third of the day and a third of the night also .
66008013	Then I looked , and I heard an eagle that was flying high in the air say in a loud voice , “ O horror ! horror ! How horrible it will be for all who live on earth when the sound comes from the trumpets that the other three angels must blow ! ”
66009001	Then the fifth angel blew his trumpet . I saw a star which had fallen down to the earth , and it was given the key to the abyss .
66009002	The star opened the abyss , and smoke poured out of it , like the smoke from a large furnace ; the sunlight and the air were darkened by the smoke from the abyss .
66009003	Locusts came down out of the smoke upon the earth , and they were given the same kind of power that scorpions have .
66009004	They were told not to harm the grass or the trees or any other plant ; they could harm only the people who did not have the mark of God's seal on their foreheads .
66009005	The locusts were not allowed to kill these people , but only to torture them for five months . The pain caused by the torture is like the pain caused by a scorpion's sting .
66009006	During those five months they will seek death , but will not find it ; they will want to die , but death will flee from them .
66009007	The locusts looked like horses ready for battle ; on their heads they had what seemed to be crowns of gold , and their faces were like human faces .
66009008	Their hair was like women's hair , their teeth were like lions' teeth .
66009009	Their chests were covered with what looked like iron breastplates , and the sound made by their wings was like the noise of many horse-drawn chariots rushing into battle .
66009010	They have tails and stings like those of a scorpion , and it is with their tails that they have the power to hurt people for five months .
66009011	They have a king ruling over them , who is the angel in charge of the abyss . His name in Hebrew is Abaddon ; in Greek the name is Apollyon ( meaning “ The Destroyer ” ) .
66009012	The first horror is over ; after this there are still two more horrors to come .
66009013	Then the sixth angel blew his trumpet . I heard a voice coming from the four corners of the gold altar standing before God .
66009014	The voice said to the sixth angel , “ Release the four angels who are bound at the great Euphrates River ! ”
66009015	The four angels were released ; for this very hour of this very day of this very month and year they had been kept ready to kill a third of all the human race .
66009016	I was told the number of the mounted troops : it was two hundred million .
66009017	And in my vision I saw the horses and their riders : they had breastplates red as fire , blue as sapphire , and yellow as sulfur . The horses' heads were like lions' heads , and from their mouths came out fire , smoke , and sulfur .
66009018	A third of the human race was killed by those three plagues : the fire , the smoke , and the sulfur coming out of the horses' mouths .
66009019	For the power of the horses is in their mouths and also in their tails . Their tails are like snakes with heads , and they use them to hurt people .
66009020	The rest of the human race , all those who had not been killed by these plagues , did not turn away from what they themselves had made . They did not stop worshiping demons , nor the idols of gold , silver , bronze , stone , and wood , which cannot see , hear , or walk .
66009021	Nor did they repent of their murders , their magic , their sexual immorality , or their stealing .
66010001	Then I saw another mighty angel coming down out of heaven . He was wrapped in a cloud and had a rainbow around his head ; his face was like the sun , and his legs were like columns of fire .
66010002	He had a small scroll open in his hand . He put his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land ,
66010003	and called out in a loud voice that sounded like the roar of lions . After he had called out , the seven thunders answered with a roar .
66010004	As soon as they spoke , I was about to write . But I heard a voice speak from heaven , “ Keep secret what the seven thunders have said ; do not write it down ! ”
66010005	Then the angel that I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven
66010006	and took a vow in the name of God , who lives forever and ever , who created heaven , earth , and the sea , and everything in them . The angel said , “ There will be no more delay !
66010007	But when the seventh angel blows his trumpet , then God will accomplish his secret plan , as he announced to his servants , the prophets . ”
66010008	Then the voice that I had heard speaking from heaven spoke to me again , saying , “ Go and take the open scroll which is in the hand of the angel standing on the sea and on the land . ”
66010009	I went to the angel and asked him to give me the little scroll . He said to me , “ Take it and eat it ; it will turn sour in your stomach , but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey . ”
66010010	I took the little scroll from his hand and ate it , and it tasted sweet as honey in my mouth . But after I swallowed it , it turned sour in my stomach .
66010011	Then I was told , “ Once again you must proclaim God's message about many nations , races , languages , and kings . ”
66011001	I was then given a stick that looked like a measuring-rod , and was told , “ Go and measure the temple of God and the altar , and count those who are worshiping in the temple .
66011002	But do not measure the outer courts , because they have been given to the heathen , who will trample on the Holy City for forty-two months .
66011003	I will send my two witnesses dressed in sackcloth , and they will proclaim God's message during those 1 , 260 days . ”
66011004	The two witnesses are the two olive trees and the two lamps that stand before the Lord of the earth .
66011005	If anyone tries to harm them , fire comes out of their mouths and destroys their enemies ; and in this way whoever tries to harm them will be killed .
66011006	They have authority to shut up the sky so that there will be no rain during the time they proclaim God's message . They have authority also over the springs of water , to turn them into blood ; they have authority also to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they wish .
66011007	When they finish proclaiming their message , the beast that comes up out of the abyss will fight against them . He will defeat them and kill them ,
66011008	and their bodies will lie in the street of the great city , where their Lord was crucified . The symbolic name of that city is Sodom , or Egypt .
66011009	People from all nations , tribes , languages , and races will look at their bodies for three and a half days and will not allow them to be buried .
66011010	The people of the earth will be happy because of the death of these two . They will celebrate and send presents to each other , because those two prophets brought much suffering upon the whole human race .
66011011	After three and a half days a life-giving breath came from God and entered them , and they stood up ; and all who saw them were terrified .
66011012	Then the two prophets heard a loud voice say to them from heaven , “ Come up here ! ” As their enemies watched , they went up into heaven in a cloud .
66011013	At that very moment there was a violent earthquake ; a tenth of the city was destroyed , and seven thousand people were killed . The rest of the people were terrified and praised the greatness of the God of heaven .
66011014	The second horror is over , but the third horror will come soon !
66011015	Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet , and there were loud voices in heaven , saying , “ The power to rule over the world belongs now to our Lord and his Messiah , and he will rule forever and ever ! ”
66011016	Then the twenty-four elders who sit on their thrones in front of God threw themselves face downward and worshiped God ,
66011017	saying : “ Lord God Almighty , the one who is and who was ! We thank you that you have taken your great power and have begun to rule !
66011018	The heathen were filled with rage , because the time for your anger has come , the time for the dead to be judged . The time has come to reward your servants , the prophets , and all your people , all who have reverence for you , great and small alike . The time has come to destroy those who destroy the earth ! ”
66011019	God's temple in heaven was opened , and the Covenant Box was seen there . Then there were flashes of lightning , rumblings and peals of thunder , an earthquake , and heavy hail .
66012001	Then a great and mysterious sight appeared in the sky . There was a woman , whose dress was the sun and who had the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head .
66012002	She was soon to give birth , and the pains and suffering of childbirth made her cry out .
66012003	Another mysterious sight appeared in the sky . There was a huge red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and a crown on each of his heads .
66012004	With his tail he dragged a third of the stars out of the sky and threw them down to the earth . He stood in front of the woman , in order to eat her child as soon as it was born .
66012005	Then she gave birth to a son , who will rule over all nations with an iron rod . But the child was snatched away and taken to God and his throne .
66012006	The woman fled to the desert , to a place God had prepared for her , where she will be taken care of for 1,260 days .
66012007	Then war broke out in heaven . Michael and his angels fought against the dragon , who fought back with his angels ;
66012008	but the dragon was defeated , and he and his angels were not allowed to stay in heaven any longer .
66012009	The huge dragon was thrown out—that ancient serpent , named the Devil , or Satan , that deceived the whole world . He was thrown down to earth , and all his angels with him .
66012010	Then I heard a loud voice in heaven saying , “ Now God's salvation has come ! Now God has shown his power as King ! Now his Messiah has shown his authority ! For the one who stood before our God and accused believers day and night has been thrown out of heaven .
66012011	They won the victory over him by the blood of the Lamb and by the truth which they proclaimed ; and they were willing to give up their lives and die .
66012012	And so be glad , you heavens , and all you that live there ! But how terrible for the earth and the sea ! For the Devil has come down to you , and he is filled with rage , because he knows that he has only a little time left . ”
66012013	When the dragon realized that he had been thrown down to the earth , he began to pursue the woman who had given birth to the boy .
66012014	She was given the two wings of a large eagle in order to fly to her place in the desert , where she will be taken care of for three and a half years , safe from the dragon's attack .
66012015	And then from his mouth the dragon poured out a flood of water after the woman , so that it would carry her away .
66012016	But the earth helped the woman ; it opened its mouth and swallowed the water that had come from the dragon's mouth .
66012017	The dragon was furious with the woman and went off to fight against the rest of her descendants , all those who obey God's commandments and are faithful to the truth revealed by Jesus .
66013001	And the dragon stood on the seashore . Then I saw a beast coming up out of the sea . It had ten horns and seven heads ; on each of its horns there was a crown , and on each of its heads there was a name that was insulting to God .
66013002	The beast looked like a leopard , with feet like a bear's feet and a mouth like a lion's mouth . The dragon gave the beast his own power , his throne , and his vast authority .
66013003	One of the heads of the beast seemed to have been fatally wounded , but the wound had healed . The whole earth was amazed and followed the beast .
66013004	Everyone worshiped the dragon because he had given his authority to the beast . They worshiped the beast also , saying , “ Who is like the beast ? Who can fight against it ? ”
66013005	The beast was allowed to make proud claims which were insulting to God , and it was permitted to have authority for forty-two months .
66013006	It began to curse God , his name , the place where he lives , and all those who live in heaven .
66013007	It was allowed to fight against God's people and to defeat them , and it was given authority over every tribe , nation , language , and race .
66013008	All people living on earth will worship it , except those whose names were written before the creation of the world in the book of the living which belongs to the Lamb that was killed .
66013009	“ Listen , then , if you have ears !
66013010	Whoever is meant to be captured will surely be captured ; whoever is meant to be killed by the sword will surely be killed by the sword . This calls for endurance and faith on the part of God's people . ”
66013011	Then I saw another beast , which came up out of the earth . It had two horns like a lamb's horns , and it spoke like a dragon .
66013012	It used the vast authority of the first beast in its presence . It forced the earth and all who live on it to worship the first beast , whose wound had healed .
66013013	This second beast performed great miracles ; it made fire come down out of heaven to earth in the sight of everyone .
66013014	And it deceived all the people living on earth by means of the miracles which it was allowed to perform in the presence of the first beast . The beast told them to build an image in honor of the beast that had been wounded by the sword and yet lived .
66013015	The second beast was allowed to breathe life into the image of the first beast , so that the image could talk and put to death all those who would not worship it .
66013016	The beast forced all the people , small and great , rich and poor , slave and free , to have a mark placed on their right hands or on their foreheads .
66013017	No one could buy or sell without this mark , that is , the beast's name or the number that stands for the name .
66013018	This calls for wisdom . Whoever is intelligent can figure out the meaning of the number of the beast , because the number stands for the name of someone . Its number is 666 .
66014001	Then I looked , and there was the Lamb standing on Mount Zion ; with him were 144,000 people who have his name and his Father's name written on their foreheads .
66014002	And I heard a voice from heaven that sounded like a roaring waterfall , like a loud peal of thunder . It sounded like the music made by musicians playing their harps .
66014003	The 144,000 people stood before the throne , the four living creatures , and the elders ; they were singing a new song , which only they could learn . Of the whole human race they are the only ones who have been redeemed .
66014004	They are the men who have kept themselves pure by not having sexual relations with women ; they are virgins . They follow the Lamb wherever he goes . They have been redeemed from the rest of the human race and are the first ones to be offered to God and to the Lamb .
66014005	They have never been known to tell lies ; they are faultless .
66014006	Then I saw another angel flying high in the air , with an eternal message of Good News to announce to the peoples of the earth , to every race , tribe , language , and nation .
66014007	He said in a loud voice , “ Honor God and praise his greatness ! For the time has come for him to judge all people . Worship him who made heaven , earth , sea , and the springs of water ! ”
66014008	A second angel followed the first one , saying , “ She has fallen ! Great Babylon has fallen ! She made all peoples drink her wine—the strong wine of her immoral lust ! ”
66014009	A third angel followed the first two , saying in a loud voice , “ Those who worship the beast and its image and receive the mark on their forehead or on their hand
66014010	will themselves drink God's wine , the wine of his fury , which he has poured at full strength into the cup of his anger ! All who do this will be tormented in fire and sulfur before the holy angels and the Lamb .
66014011	The smoke of the fire that torments them goes up forever and ever . There is no relief day or night for those who worship the beast and its image , for anyone who has the mark of its name . ”
66014012	This calls for endurance on the part of God's people , those who obey God's commandments and are faithful to Jesus .
66014013	Then I heard a voice from heaven saying , “ Write this : Happy are those who from now on die in the service of the Lord ! ” “ Yes indeed ! ” answers the Spirit . “ They will enjoy rest from their hard work , because the results of their service go with them . ”
66014014	Then I looked , and there was a white cloud , and sitting on the cloud was what looked like a human being , with a crown of gold on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand .
66014015	Then another angel came out from the temple and cried out in a loud voice to the one who was sitting on the cloud , “ Use your sickle and reap the harvest , because the time has come ; the earth is ripe for the harvest ! ”
66014016	Then the one who sat on the cloud swung his sickle on the earth , and the earth's harvest was reaped .
66014017	Then I saw another angel come out of the temple in heaven , and he also had a sharp sickle .
66014018	Then another angel , who is in charge of the fire , came from the altar . He shouted in a loud voice to the angel who had the sharp sickle , “ Use your sickle , and cut the grapes from the vineyard of the earth , because the grapes are ripe ! ”
66014019	So the angel swung his sickle on the earth , cut the grapes from the vine , and threw them into the wine press of God's furious anger .
66014020	The grapes were squeezed out in the wine press outside the city , and blood came out of the wine press in a flood two hundred miles long and about five feet deep .
66015001	Then I saw in the sky another mysterious sight , great and amazing . There were seven angels with seven plagues , which are the last ones , because they are the final expression of God's anger .
66015002	Then I saw what looked like a sea of glass mixed with fire . I also saw those who had won the victory over the beast and its image and over the one whose name is represented by a number . They were standing by the sea of glass , holding harps that God had given them
66015003	and singing the song of Moses , the servant of God , and the song of the Lamb : “ Lord God Almighty , how great and wonderful are your deeds ! King of the nations , how right and true are your ways !
66015004	Who will not stand in awe of you , Lord ? Who will refuse to declare your greatness ? You alone are holy . All the nations will come and worship you , because your just actions are seen by all . ”
66015005	After this I saw the temple in heaven open , with the Sacred Tent in it .
66015006	The seven angels who had the seven plagues came out of the temple , dressed in clean shining linen and with gold bands tied around their chests .
66015007	Then one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven gold bowls full of the anger of God , who lives forever and ever .
66015008	The temple was filled with smoke from the glory and power of God , and no one could go into the temple until the seven plagues brought by the seven angels had come to an end .
66016001	Then I heard a loud voice speaking from the temple to the seven angels : “ Go and pour out the seven bowls of God's anger on the earth ! ”
66016002	The first angel went and poured out his bowl on the earth . Terrible and painful sores appeared on those who had the mark of the beast and on those who had worshiped its image .
66016003	Then the second angel poured out his bowl on the sea . The water became like the blood of a dead person , and every living creature in the sea died .
66016004	Then the third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and the springs of water , and they turned into blood .
66016005	I heard the angel in charge of the waters say , “ The judgments you have made are just , O Holy One , you who are and who were !
66016006	They poured out the blood of God's people and of the prophets , and so you have given them blood to drink . They are getting what they deserve ! ”
66016007	Then I heard a voice from the altar saying , “ Lord God Almighty ! True and just indeed are your judgments ! ”
66016008	Then the fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun , and it was allowed to burn people with its fiery heat .
66016009	They were burned by the fierce heat , and they cursed the name of God , who has authority over these plagues . But they would not turn from their sins and praise his greatness .
66016010	Then the fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast . Darkness fell over the beast's kingdom , and people bit their tongues because of their pain ,
66016011	and they cursed the God of heaven for their pains and sores . But they did not turn from their evil ways .
66016012	Then the sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great Euphrates River . The river dried up , to provide a way for the kings who come from the east .
66016013	Then I saw three unclean spirits that looked like frogs . They were coming out of the mouth of the dragon , the mouth of the beast , and the mouth of the false prophet .
66016014	They are the spirits of demons that perform miracles . These three spirits go out to all the kings of the world , to bring them together for the battle on the great Day of Almighty God .
66016015	“ Listen ! I am coming like a thief ! Happy is he who stays awake and guards his clothes , so that he will not walk around naked and be ashamed in public ! ”
66016016	Then the spirits brought the kings together in the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon .
66016017	Then the seventh angel poured out his bowl in the air . A loud voice came from the throne in the temple , saying , “ It is done ! ”
66016018	There were flashes of lightning , rumblings and peals of thunder , and a terrible earthquake . There has never been such an earthquake since the creation of human beings ; this was the worst earthquake of all !
66016019	The great city was split into three parts , and the cities of all countries were destroyed . God remembered great Babylon and made her drink the wine from his cup—the wine of his furious anger .
66016020	All the islands disappeared , all the mountains vanished .
66016021	Huge hailstones , each weighing as much as a hundred pounds , fell from the sky on people , who cursed God on account of the plague of hail , because it was such a terrible plague .
66017001	Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came to me and said , “ Come , and I will show you how the famous prostitute is to be punished , that great city that is built near many rivers .
66017002	The kings of the earth practiced sexual immorality with her , and the people of the world became drunk from drinking the wine of her immorality . ”
66017003	The Spirit took control of me , and the angel carried me to a desert . There I saw a woman sitting on a red beast that had names insulting to God written all over it ; the beast had seven heads and ten horns .
66017004	The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet , and covered with gold ornaments , precious stones , and pearls . In her hand she held a gold cup full of obscene and filthy things , the result of her immorality .
66017005	On her forehead was written a name that has a secret meaning : “ Great Babylon , the mother of all prostitutes and perverts in the world . ”
66017006	And I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of God's people and the blood of those who were killed because they had been loyal to Jesus . When I saw her , I was completely amazed .
66017007	“ Why are you amazed ? ” the angel asked me . “ I will tell you the secret meaning of the woman and of the beast that carries her , the beast with seven heads and ten horns .
66017008	That beast was once alive , but lives no longer ; it is about to come up from the abyss and will go off to be destroyed . The people living on earth whose names have not been written before the creation of the world in the book of the living , will all be amazed as they look at the beast . It was once alive ; now it no longer lives , but it will reappear .
66017009	“ This calls for wisdom and understanding . The seven heads are seven hills , on which the woman sits . They are also seven kings :
66017010	five of them have fallen , one still rules , and the other one has not yet come ; when he comes , he must rule only a little while .
66017011	And the beast that was once alive , but lives no longer , is itself an eighth king who is one of the seven and is going off to be destroyed .
66017012	“ The ten horns you saw are ten kings who have not yet begun to rule , but who will be given authority to rule as kings for one hour with the beast .
66017013	These ten all have the same purpose , and they give their power and authority to the beast .
66017014	They will fight against the Lamb ; but the Lamb , together with his called , chosen , and faithful followers , will defeat them , because he is Lord of lords and King of kings . ”
66017015	The angel also said to me , “ The waters you saw , on which the prostitute sits , are nations , peoples , races , and languages .
66017016	The ten horns you saw and the beast will hate the prostitute ; they will take away everything she has and leave her naked ; they will eat her flesh and destroy her with fire .
66017017	For God has placed in their hearts the will to carry out his purpose by acting together and giving to the beast their power to rule until God's words come true .
66017018	“ The woman you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth . ”
66018001	After this I saw another angel coming down out of heaven . He had great authority , and his splendor brightened the whole earth .
66018002	He cried out in a loud voice : “ She has fallen ! Great Babylon has fallen ! She is now haunted by demons and unclean spirits ; all kinds of filthy and hateful birds live in her .
66018003	For all the nations have drunk her wine—the strong wine of her immoral lust . The kings of the earth practiced sexual immorality with her , and the merchants of the world grew rich from her unrestrained lust . ”
66018004	Then I heard another voice from heaven , saying , “ Come out , my people ! Come out from her ! You must not take part in her sins ; you must not share in her punishment !
66018005	For her sins are piled up as high as heaven , and God remembers her wicked ways .
66018006	Treat her exactly as she has treated you ; pay her back double for all she has done . Fill her cup with a drink twice as strong as the drink she prepared for you .
66018007	Give her as much suffering and grief as the glory and luxury she gave herself . For she keeps telling herself : ‘ Here I sit , a queen ! I am no widow , I will never know grief ’
66018008	Because of this , in one day she will be struck with plagues— disease , grief , and famine . And she will be burned with fire , because the Lord God , who judges her , is mighty . ”
66018009	The kings of the earth who took part in her immorality and lust will cry and weep over the city when they see the smoke from the flames that consume her .
66018010	They stand a long way off , because they are afraid of sharing in her suffering . They say , “ How terrible ! How awful ! This great and mighty city Babylon ! In just one hour you have been punished ! ”
66018011	The merchants of the earth also cry and mourn for her , because no one buys their goods any longer ;
66018012	no one buys their gold , silver , precious stones , and pearls ; their goods of linen , purple cloth , silk , and scarlet cloth ; all kinds of rare woods and all kinds of objects made of ivory and of expensive wood , of bronze , iron , and marble ;
66018013	and cinnamon , spice , incense , myrrh , and frankincense ; wine and oil , flour and wheat , cattle and sheep , horses and carriages , slaves , and even human lives .
66018014	The merchants say to her , “ All the good things you longed to own have disappeared , and all your wealth and glamor are gone , and you will never find them again ! ”
66018015	The merchants , who became rich from doing business in that city , will stand a long way off , because they are afraid of sharing in her suffering . They will cry and mourn ,
66018016	and say , “ How terrible ! How awful for the great city ! She used to dress herself in linen , purple , and scarlet , and cover herself with gold ornaments , precious stones , and pearls !
66018017	And in one hour she has lost all this wealth ! ” All the ships' captains and passengers , the sailors and all others who earn their living on the sea , stood a long way off ,
66018018	and cried out as they saw the smoke from the flames that consumed her : “ There never has been another city like this great city ! ”
66018019	They threw dust on their heads , they cried and mourned , saying , “ How terrible ! How awful for the great city ! She is the city where all who have ships sailing the seas became rich on her wealth ! And in one hour she has lost everything ! ”
66018020	Be glad , heaven , because of her destruction ! Be glad , God's people and the apostles and prophets ! For God has condemned her for what she did to you !
66018021	Then a mighty angel picked up a stone the size of a large millstone and threw it into the sea , saying , “ This is how the great city Babylon will be violently thrown down and will never be seen again .
66018022	The music of harps and of human voices , of players of the flute and the trumpet , will never be heard in you again ! No workman in any trade will ever be found in you again ; and the sound of the millstone will be heard no more !
66018023	Never again will the light of a lamp be seen in you ; no more will the voices of brides and grooms be heard in you . Your merchants were the most powerful in all the world , and with your false magic you deceived all the peoples of the world ! ”
66018024	Babylon was punished because the blood of prophets and of God's people was found in the city ; yes , the blood of all those who have been killed on earth .
66019001	After this I heard what sounded like the roar of a large crowd of people in heaven , saying , “ Praise God ! Salvation , glory , and power belong to our God !
66019002	True and just are his judgments ! He has condemned the prostitute who was corrupting the earth with her immorality . God has punished her because she killed his servants . ”
66019003	Again they shouted , “ Praise God ! The smoke from the flames that consume the great city goes up forever and ever ! ”
66019004	The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God , who was seated on the throne . They said , “ Amen ! Praise God ! ”
66019005	Then there came from the throne the sound of a voice , saying , “ Praise our God , all his servants and all people , both great and small , who have reverence for him ! ”
66019006	Then I heard what sounded like a crowd , like the sound of a roaring waterfall , like loud peals of thunder . I heard them say , “ Praise God ! For the Lord , our Almighty God , is King !
66019007	Let us rejoice and be glad ; let us praise his greatness ! For the time has come for the wedding of the Lamb , and his bride has prepared herself for it .
66019008	She has been given clean shining linen to wear . ” ( The linen is the good deeds of God's people . )
66019009	Then the angel said to me , “ Write this : Happy are those who have been invited to the wedding feast of the Lamb . ” And the angel added , “ These are the true words of God . ”
66019010	I fell down at his feet to worship him , but he said to me , “ Don't do it ! I am a servant together with you and with other believers , all those who hold to the truth that Jesus revealed . Worship God ! ” For the truth that Jesus revealed is what inspires the prophets .
66019011	Then I saw heaven open , and there was a white horse . Its rider is called Faithful and True ; it is with justice that he judges and fights his battles .
66019012	His eyes were like a flame of fire , and he wore many crowns on his head . He had a name written on him , but no one except himself knows what it is .
66019013	The robe he wore was covered with blood . His name is “ The Word of God . ”
66019014	The armies of heaven followed him , riding on white horses and dressed in clean white linen .
66019015	Out of his mouth came a sharp sword , with which he will defeat the nations . He will rule over them with a rod of iron , and he will trample out the wine in the wine press of the furious anger of the Almighty God .
66019016	On his robe and on his thigh was written the name : “ King of kings and Lord of lords . ”
66019017	Then I saw an angel standing on the sun . He shouted in a loud voice to all the birds flying in midair : “ Come and gather together for God's great feast !
66019018	Come and eat the flesh of kings , generals , and soldiers , the flesh of horses and their riders , the flesh of all people , slave and free , great and small ! ”
66019019	Then I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered to fight against the one who was riding the horse and against his army .
66019020	The beast was taken prisoner , together with the false prophet who had performed miracles in his presence . ( It was by those miracles that he had deceived those who had the mark of the beast and those who had worshiped the image of the beast . ) The beast and the false prophet were both thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur .
66019021	Their armies were killed by the sword that comes out of the mouth of the one who was riding the horse ; and all the birds ate all they could of their flesh .
66020001	Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven , holding in his hand the key of the abyss and a heavy chain .
66020002	He seized the dragon , that ancient serpent—that is , the Devil , or Satan—and chained him up for a thousand years .
66020003	The angel threw him into the abyss , locked it , and sealed it , so that he could not deceive the nations any more until the thousand years were over . After that he must be set loose for a little while .
66020004	Then I saw thrones , and those who sat on them were given the power to judge . I also saw the souls of those who had been executed because they had proclaimed the truth that Jesus revealed and the word of God . They had not worshiped the beast or its image , nor had they received the mark of the beast on their foreheads or their hands . They came to life and ruled as kings with Christ for a thousand years .
66020005	( The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were over . ) This is the first raising of the dead .
66020006	Happy and greatly blessed are those who are included in this first raising of the dead . The second death has no power over them ; they shall be priests of God and of Christ , and they will rule with him for a thousand years .
66020007	After the thousand years are over , Satan will be set loose from his prison ,
66020008	and he will go out to deceive the nations scattered over the whole world , that is , Gog and Magog . Satan will bring them all together for battle , as many as the grains of sand on the seashore .
66020009	They spread out over the earth and surrounded the camp of God's people and the city that he loves . But fire came down from heaven and destroyed them .
66020010	Then the Devil , who deceived them , was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur , where the beast and the false prophet had already been thrown ; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever .
66020011	Then I saw a great white throne and the one who sits on it . Earth and heaven fled from his presence and were seen no more .
66020012	And I saw the dead , great and small alike , standing before the throne . Books were opened , and then another book was opened , the book of the living . The dead were judged according to what they had done , as recorded in the books .
66020013	Then the sea gave up its dead . Death and the world of the dead also gave up the dead they held . And all were judged according to what they had done .
66020014	Then death and the world of the dead were thrown into the lake of fire . ( This lake of fire is the second death . )
66020015	Those who did not have their name written in the book of the living were thrown into the lake of fire .
66021001	Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth . The first heaven and the first earth disappeared , and the sea vanished .
66021002	And I saw the Holy City , the new Jerusalem , coming down out of heaven from God , prepared and ready , like a bride dressed to meet her husband .
66021003	I heard a loud voice speaking from the throne : “ Now God's home is with people ! He will live with them , and they shall be his people . God himself will be with them , and he will be their God .
66021004	He will wipe away all tears from their eyes . There will be no more death , no more grief or crying or pain . The old things have disappeared . ”
66021005	Then the one who sits on the throne said , “ And now I make all things new ! ” He also said to me , “ Write this , because these words are true and can be trusted . ”
66021006	And he said , “ It is done ! I am the first and the last , the beginning and the end . To anyone who is thirsty I will give the right to drink from the spring of the water of life without paying for it .
66021007	Those who win the victory will receive this from me : I will be their God , and they will be my children .
66021008	But cowards , traitors , perverts , murderers , the immoral , those who practice magic , those who worship idols , and all liars—the place for them is the lake burning with fire and sulfur , which is the second death . ”
66021009	One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came to me and said , “ Come , and I will show you the Bride , the wife of the Lamb . ”
66021010	The Spirit took control of me , and the angel carried me to the top of a very high mountain . He showed me Jerusalem , the Holy City , coming down out of heaven from God
66021011	and shining with the glory of God . The city shone like a precious stone , like a jasper , clear as crystal .
66021012	It had a great , high wall with twelve gates and with twelve angels in charge of the gates . On the gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of the people of Israel .
66021013	There were three gates on each side : three on the east , three on the south , three on the north , and three on the west .
66021014	The city's wall was built on twelve foundation stones , on which were written the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb .
66021015	The angel who spoke to me had a gold measuring stick to measure the city , its gates , and its wall .
66021016	The city was perfectly square , as wide as it was long . The angel measured the city with his measuring stick : it was fifteen hundred miles long and was as wide and as high as it was long .
66021017	The angel also measured the wall , and it was 216 feet high , according to the standard unit of measure which he was using .
66021018	The wall was made of jasper , and the city itself was made of pure gold , as clear as glass .
66021019	The foundation stones of the city wall were adorned with all kinds of precious stones . The first foundation stone was jasper , the second sapphire , the third agate , the fourth emerald ,
66021020	the fifth onyx , the sixth carnelian , the seventh yellow quartz , the eighth beryl , the ninth topaz , the tenth chalcedony , the eleventh turquoise , the twelfth amethyst .
66021021	The twelve gates were twelve pearls ; each gate was made from a single pearl . The street of the city was of pure gold , transparent as glass .
66021022	I did not see a temple in the city , because its temple is the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb .
66021023	The city has no need of the sun or the moon to shine on it , because the glory of God shines on it , and the Lamb is its lamp .
66021024	The peoples of the world will walk by its light , and the kings of the earth will bring their wealth into it .
66021025	The gates of the city will stand open all day ; they will never be closed , because there will be no night there .
66021026	The greatness and the wealth of the nations will be brought into the city .
66021027	But nothing that is impure will enter the city , nor anyone who does shameful things or tells lies . Only those whose names are written in the Lamb's book of the living will enter the city .
66022001	The angel also showed me the river of the water of life , sparkling like crystal , and coming from the throne of God and of the Lamb
66022002	and flowing down the middle of the city's street . On each side of the river was the tree of life , which bears fruit twelve times a year , once each month ; and its leaves are for the healing of the nations .
66022003	Nothing that is under God's curse will be found in the city . The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city , and his servants will worship him .
66022004	They will see his face , and his name will be written on their foreheads .
66022005	There shall be no more night , and they will not need lamps or sunlight , because the Lord God will be their light , and they will rule as kings forever and ever .
66022006	Then the angel said to me , “ These words are true and can be trusted . And the Lord God , who gives his Spirit to the prophets , has sent his angel to show his servants what must happen very soon . ”
66022007	“ Listen ! ” says Jesus . “ I am coming soon ! Happy are those who obey the prophetic words in this book ! ”
66022008	I , John , have heard and seen all these things . And when I finished hearing and seeing them , I fell down at the feet of the angel who had shown me these things , and I was about to worship him .
66022009	But he said to me , “ Don't do it ! I am a servant together with you and with your brothers the prophets and of all those who obey the words in this book . Worship God ! ”
66022010	And he said to me , “ Do not keep the prophetic words of this book a secret , because the time is near when all this will happen .
66022011	Whoever is evil must go on doing evil , and whoever is filthy must go on being filthy ; whoever is good must go on doing good , and whoever is holy must go on being holy . ”
66022012	“ Listen ! ” says Jesus . “ I am coming soon ! I will bring my rewards with me , to give to each one according to what he has done .
66022013	I am the first and the last , the beginning and the end . ”
66022014	Happy are those who wash their robes clean and so have the right to eat the fruit from the tree of life and to go through the gates into the city .
66022015	But outside the city are the perverts and those who practice magic , the immoral and the murderers , those who worship idols and those who are liars both in words and deeds .
66022016	“ I , Jesus , have sent my angel to announce these things to you in the churches . I am descended from the family of David ; I am the bright morning star . ”
66022017	The Spirit and the Bride say , “ Come ! ” Everyone who hears this must also say , “ Come ! ” Come , whoever is thirsty ; accept the water of life as a gift , whoever wants it .
66022018	I , John , solemnly warn everyone who hears the prophetic words of this book : if any add anything to them , God will add to their punishment the plagues described in this book .
66022019	And if any take anything away from the prophetic words of this book , God will take away from them their share of the fruit of the tree of life and of the Holy City , which are described in this book .
66022020	He who gives his testimony to all this says , “ Yes indeed ! I am coming soon ! ” So be it . Come , Lord Jesus !
66022021	May the grace of the Lord Jesus be with everyone .
