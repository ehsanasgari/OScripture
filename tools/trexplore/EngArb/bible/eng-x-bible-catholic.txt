40001001	The book of the lineage of Jesus Christ , the son of David , the son of Abraham .
40001002	Abraham conceived Isaac . And Isaac conceived Jacob . And Jacob conceived Judah and his brothers .
40001003	And Judah conceived Perez and Zerah by Tamar . And Perez conceived Hezron . And Hezron conceived Ram .
40001004	And Ram conceived Amminadab . And Amminadab conceived Nahshon . And Nahshon conceived Salmon .
40001005	And Salmon conceived Boaz by Rahab . And Boaz conceived Obed by Ruth . And Obed conceived Jesse .
40001006	And Jesse conceived king David . And king David conceived Solomon , by her who had been the wife of Uriah .
40001007	And Solomon conceived Rehoboam . And Rehoboam conceived Abijah . And Abijah conceived Asa .
40001008	And Asa conceived Jehoshaphat . And Jehoshaphat conceived Joram . And Joram conceived Uzziah .
40001009	And Uzziah conceived Jotham . And Jotham conceived Ahaz . And Ahaz conceived Hezekiah .
40001010	And Hezekiah conceived Manasseh . And Manasseh conceived Amos . And Amos conceived Josiah .
40001011	And Josiah conceived Jechoniah and his brothers in the transmigration of Babylon .
40001012	And after the transmigration of Babylon , Jechoniah conceived Shealtiel . And Shealtiel conceived Zerubbabel .
40001013	And Zerubbabel conceived Abiud . And Abiud conceived Eliakim . And Eliakim conceived Azor .
40001014	And Azor conceived Zadok . And Zadok conceived Achim . And Achim conceived Eliud .
40001015	And Eliud conceived Eleazar . And Eleazar conceived Matthan . And Matthan conceived Jacob .
40001016	And Jacob conceived Joseph , the husband of Mary , of whom was born Jesus , who is called Christ .
40001017	And so , all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations ; and from David to the transmigration of Babylon , fourteen generations ; and from the transmigration of Babylon to the Christ , fourteen generations .
40001018	Now the procreation of the Christ occurred in this way . After his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph , before they lived together , she was found to have conceived in her womb by the Holy Spirit .
40001019	Then Joseph , her husband , since he was just and was not willing to hand her over , preferred to send her away secretly .
40001020	But while thinking over these things , behold , an Angel of the Lord appeared to him in his sleep , saying : “ Joseph , son of David , do not be afraid to accept Mary as your wife . For what has been formed in her is of the Holy Spirit .
40001021	And she shall give birth to a son . And you shall call his name JESUS . For he shall accomplish the salvation of his people from their sins . ”
40001022	Now all this occurred in order to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet , saying :
40001023	“ Behold , a virgin shall conceive in her womb , and she shall give birth to a son . And they shall call his name Emmanuel , which means : God is with us . ”
40001024	Then Joseph , arising from sleep , did just as the Angel of the Lord had instructed him , and he accepted her as his wife .
40001025	And he knew her not , yet she bore her son , the firstborn . And he called his name JESUS .
40002001	And so , when Jesus had been born in Bethlehem of Judah , in the days of king Herod , behold , Magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem ,
40002002	saying : “ Where is he who was born king of the Jews ? For we have seen his star in the east , and we have come to adore him . ”
40002003	Now king Herod , hearing this , was disturbed , and all Jerusalem with him .
40002004	And gathering together all the leaders of the priests , and the scribes of the people , he consulted with them as to where the Christ would be born .
40002005	And they said to him : “ In Bethlehem of Judea . For so it has been written by the prophet :
40002006	‘ And you , Bethlehem , the land of Judah , are by no means least among the leaders of Judah . For from you shall go forth the ruler who shall guide my people Israel . ’ ”
40002007	Then Herod , quietly calling the Magi , diligently learned from them the time when the star appeared to them .
40002008	And sending them into Bethlehem , he said : “ Go and diligently ask questions about the boy . And when you have found him , report back to me , so that I , too , may come and adore him . ”
40002009	And when they had heard the king , they went away . And behold , the star that they had seen in the east went before them , even until , arriving , it stood still above the place where the child was .
40002010	Then , seeing the star , they were gladdened by a very great joy .
40002011	And entering the home , they found the boy with his mother Mary . And so , falling prostrate , they adored him . And opening their treasures , they offered him gifts : gold , frankincense , and myrrh .
40002012	And having received a response in sleep that they should not return to Herod , they went back by another way to their own region .
40002013	And after they had gone away , behold , an Angel of the Lord appeared in sleep to Joseph , saying : “ Rise up , and take the boy and his mother , and flee into Egypt . And remain there until I tell you . For it will happen that Herod will seek the boy to destroy him . ”
40002014	And getting up , he took the boy and his mother by night , and withdrew into Egypt .
40002015	And he remained there , until the death of Herod , in order to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet , saying : “ Out of Egypt , I called my son . ”
40002016	Then Herod , seeing that he had been fooled by the Magi , was very angry . And so he sent to kill all the boys who were in Bethlehem , and in all its borders , from two years of age and under , according to the time that he had learned by questioning the Magi .
40002017	Then what was spoken through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled , saying :
40002018	“ A voice has been heard in Ramah , great weeping and wailing : Rachel crying for her sons . And she was not willing to be consoled , because they were no more . ”
40002019	Then , when Herod had passed away , behold , an Angel of the Lord appeared in sleep to Joseph in Egypt ,
40002020	saying : “ Rise up , and take the boy and his mother , and go into the land of Israel . For those who were seeking the life of the boy have passed away . ”
40002021	And rising up , he took the boy and his mother , and he went into the land of Israel .
40002022	Then , hearing that Archelaus reigned in Judea in place of his father Herod , he was afraid to go there . And being warned in sleep , he withdrew into parts of Galilee .
40002023	And arriving , he lived in a city which is called Nazareth , in order to fulfill what was spoken through the prophets : “ For he shall be called a Nazarene . ”
40003001	Now in those days , John the Baptist arrived , preaching in the desert of Judea ,
40003002	and saying : “ Repent . For the kingdom of heaven has drawn near . ”
40003003	For this is the one who was spoken of through the prophet Isaiah , saying : “ A voice crying out in the desert : Prepare the way of the Lord . Make straight his paths . ”
40003004	Now the same John had a garment made from the hair of camels , and a leather belt around his waist . And his food was locusts and wild honey .
40003005	Then Jerusalem , and all Judea , and the entire region around the Jordan went out to him .
40003006	And they were baptized by him in the Jordan , acknowledging their sins .
40003007	Then , seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees arriving for his baptism , he said to them : “ Progeny of vipers , who warned to you to flee from the approaching wrath ?
40003008	Therefore , produce fruit worthy of repentance .
40003009	And do not choose to say within yourselves , ‘ We have Abraham as our father . ’ For I tell you that God has the power to raise up sons to Abraham from these stones .
40003010	For even now the axe has been placed at the root of the trees . Therefore , every tree that does not produce good fruit shall be cut down and cast into the fire .
40003011	Indeed , I baptize you with water for repentance , but he who will come after me is more powerful than me . I am not worthy to carry his shoes . He will baptize you with the fire of the Holy Spirit .
40003012	His winnowing fan is in his hand . And he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor . And he will gather his wheat into the barn . But the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire . ”
40003013	Then Jesus came from Galilee , to John at the Jordan , in order to be baptized by him .
40003014	But John refused him , saying , “ I ought to be baptized by you , and yet you come to me ? ”
40003015	And responding , Jesus said to him : “ Permit this for now . For in this way it is fitting for us to fulfill all justice . ” Then he allowed him .
40003016	And Jesus , having been baptized , ascended from the water immediately , and behold , the heavens were opened to him . And he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove , and alighting on him .
40003017	And behold , there was a voice from heaven , saying : “ This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased . ”
40004001	Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the desert , in order to be tempted by the devil .
40004002	And when he had fasted for forty days and forty nights , afterwards he was hungry .
40004003	And approaching , the tempter said to him , “ If you are the Son of God , tell these stones to become bread . ”
40004004	And in response he said , “ It has been written : ‘ Not by bread alone shall man live , but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God . ’ ”
40004005	Then the devil took him up , into the holy city , and set him on the pinnacle of the temple ,
40004006	and said to him : “ If you are the Son of God , cast yourself down . For it has been written : ‘ For he has given charge of you to his angels , and they shall take you into their hands , lest perhaps you may hurt your foot against a stone . ’ ”
40004007	Jesus said to him , “ Again , it has been written : ‘ You shall not tempt the Lord your God . ’ ”
40004008	Again , the devil took him up , onto a very high mountain , and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory ,
40004009	and said to him , “ All these things I will give to you , if you will fall down and adore me . ”
40004010	Then Jesus said to him : “ Go away , Satan . For it has been written : ‘ You shall adore the Lord your God , and him only shall you serve . ’ ”
40004011	Then the devil left him . And behold , Angels approached and ministered to him .
40004012	And when Jesus had heard that John had been handed over , he withdrew into Galilee .
40004013	And leaving behind the city of Nazareth , he went and lived in Capernaum , near the sea , at the borders of Zebulun and of Naphtali ,
40004014	in order to fulfill what was said through the prophet Isaiah :
40004015	“ Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali , the way of the sea across the Jordan , Galilee of the Gentiles :
40004016	A people who were sitting in darkness have seen a great light . And unto those sitting in the region of the shadow of death , a light has risen . ”
40004017	From that time , Jesus began to preach , and to say : “ Repent . For the kingdom of heaven has drawn near . ”
40004018	And Jesus , walking near the Sea of Galilee , saw two brothers , Simon who is called Peter , and his brother Andrew , casting a net into the sea ( for they were fishermen ) .
40004019	And he said to them : “ Follow me , and I will make you fishers of men . ”
40004020	And at once , leaving behind their nets , they followed him .
40004021	And continuing on from there , he saw another two brothers , James of Zebedee , and his brother John , in a ship with their father Zebedee , repairing their nets . And he called them .
40004022	And immediately , leaving their nets and their father behind , they followed him .
40004023	And Jesus traveled throughout all of Galilee , teaching in their synagogues , and preaching the Gospel of the kingdom , and healing every sickness and every infirmity among the people .
40004024	And reports of him went out to all of Syria , and they brought to him all those who had maladies , those who were in the grasp of various sicknesses and torments , and those who were in the hold of demons , and the mentally ill , and paralytics . And he cured them .
40004025	And a great crowd followed him from Galilee , and from the Ten Cities , and from Jerusalem , and from Judea , and from across the Jordan .
40005001	Then , seeing the crowds , he ascended the mountain , and when he had sat down , his disciples drew near to him ,
40005002	and opening his mouth , he taught them , saying :
40005003	“ Blessed are the poor in spirit , for theirs is the kingdom of heaven .
40005004	Blessed are the meek , for they shall possess the earth .
40005005	Blessed are those who mourn , for they shall be consoled .
40005006	Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for justice , for they shall be satisfied .
40005007	Blessed are the merciful , for they shall obtain mercy .
40005008	Blessed are the pure in heart , for they shall see God .
40005009	Blessed are the peacemakers , for they shall be called sons of God .
40005010	Blessed are those who endure persecution for the sake of justice , for theirs is the kingdom of heaven .
40005011	Blessed are you when they have slandered you , and persecuted you , and spoken all kinds of evil against you , falsely , for my sake :
40005012	be glad and exult , for your reward in heaven is plentiful . For so they persecuted the prophets who were before you .
40005013	You are the salt of the earth . But if salt loses its saltiness , with what will it be salted ? It is no longer useful at all , except to be cast out and trampled under by men .
40005014	You are the light of the world . A city set on a mountain cannot be hidden .
40005015	And they do not light a lamp and put it under a basket , but on a lampstand , so that it may shine to all who are in the house .
40005016	So then , let your light shine in the sight of men , so that they may see your good works , and may glorify your Father , who is in heaven .
40005017	Do not think that I have come to loosen the law or the prophets . I have not come to loosen , but to fulfill .
40005018	Amen I say to you , certainly , until heaven and earth pass away , not one iota , not one dot shall pass away from the law , until all is done .
40005019	Therefore , whoever will have loosened one of the least of these commandments , and have taught men so , shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven . But whoever will have done and taught these , such a one shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven .
40005020	For I say to you , that unless your justice has surpassed that of the scribes and the Pharisees you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven .
40005021	You have heard that it was said to the ancients : ‘ You shall not murder ; whoever will have murdered shall be liable to judgment . ’
40005022	But I say to you , that anyone who becomes angry with his brother shall be liable to judgment . But whoever will have called his brother , ‘ Idiot , ’ shall be liable to the council . Then , whoever will have called him , ‘ Worthless , ’ shall be liable to the fires of Hell .
40005023	Therefore , if you offer your gift at the altar , and there you remember that your brother has something against you ,
40005024	leave your gift there , before the altar , and go first to be reconciled to your brother , and then you may approach and offer your gift .
40005025	Be reconciled with your adversary quickly , while you are still on the way with him , lest perhaps the adversary may hand you over to the judge , and the judge may hand you over to the officer , and you will be thrown in prison .
40005026	Amen I say to you , that you shall not go forth from there , until you have repaid the last quarter .
40005027	You have heard that it was said to the ancients : ‘ You shall not commit adultery . ’
40005028	But I say to you , that anyone who will have looked at a woman , so as to lust after her , has already committed adultery with her in his heart .
40005029	And if your right eye causes you to sin , root it out and cast it away from you . For it is better for you that one of your members perish , than that your whole body be cast into Hell .
40005030	And if your right hand causes you to sin , cut it off and cast it away from you . For it is better for you that one of your members perish , than that your whole body go into Hell .
40005031	And it has been said : ‘ Whoever would dismiss his wife , let him give her a bill of divorce . ’
40005032	But I say to you , that anyone who will have dismissed his wife , except in the case of fornication , causes her to commit adultery ; and whoever will have married her who has been dismissed commits adultery .
40005033	Again , you have heard that it was said to the ancients : ‘ You shall not swear falsely . For you shall repay your oaths to the Lord . ’
40005034	But I say to you , do not swear an oath at all , neither by heaven , for it is the throne of God ,
40005035	nor by earth , for it is his footstool , nor by Jerusalem , for it is the city of the great king .
40005036	Neither shall you swear an oath by your own head , because you are not able to cause one hair to become white or black .
40005037	But let your word ‘ Yes ’ mean ‘ Yes , ’ and ‘ No ’ mean ‘ No . ’ For anything beyond that is of evil .
40005038	You have heard that it was said : ‘ An eye for an eye , and a tooth for a tooth . ’
40005039	But I say to you , do not resist one who is evil , but if anyone will have struck you on your right cheek , offer to him the other also .
40005040	And anyone who wishes to contend with you in judgment , and to take away your tunic , release to him your cloak also .
40005041	And whoever will have compelled you for one thousand steps , go with him even for two thousand steps .
40005042	Whoever asks of you , give to him . And if anyone would borrow from you , do not turn away from him .
40005043	You have heard that it was said , ‘ You shall love your neighbor , and you shall have hatred for your enemy . ’
40005044	But I say to you : Love your enemies . Do good to those who hate you . And pray for those who persecute and slander you .
40005045	In this way , you shall be sons of your Father , who is in heaven . He causes his sun to rise upon the good and the bad , and he causes it to rain upon the just and the unjust .
40005046	For if you love those who love you , what reward will you have ? Do not even tax collectors behave this way ?
40005047	And if you greet only your brothers , what more have you done ? Do not even the pagans behave this way ?
40005048	Therefore , be perfect , even as your heavenly Father is perfect . ”
40006001	“ Pay attention , lest you perform your justice before men , in order to be seen by them ; otherwise you shall not have a reward with your Father , who is in heaven .
40006002	Therefore , when you give alms , do not choose to sound a trumpet before you , as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the towns , so that they may be honored by men . Amen I say to you , they have received their reward .
40006003	But when you give alms , do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing ,
40006004	so that your almsgiving may be in secret , and your Father , who sees in secret , will repay you .
40006005	And when you pray , you should not be like the hypocrites , who love standing in the synagogues and at the corners of the streets to pray , so that they may be seen by men . Amen I say to you , they have received their reward .
40006006	But you , when you pray , enter into your room , and having shut the door , pray to your Father in secret , and your Father , who sees in secret , will repay you .
40006007	And when praying , do not choose many words , as the pagans do . For they think that by their excess of words they might be heeded .
40006008	Therefore , do not choose to imitate them . For your Father knows what your needs may be , even before you ask him .
40006009	Therefore , you shall pray in this way : Our Father , who is in heaven : May your name be kept holy .
40006010	May your kingdom come . May your will be done , as in heaven , so also on earth .
40006011	Give us this day our life-sustaining bread .
40006012	And forgive us our debts , as we also forgive our debtors .
40006013	And lead us not into temptation . But free us from evil . Amen .
40006014	For if you will forgive men their sins , your heavenly Father also will forgive you your offenses .
40006015	But if you will not forgive men , neither will your Father forgive you your sins .
40006016	And when you fast , do not choose to become gloomy , like the hypocrites . For they alter their faces , so that their fasting may be apparent to men . Amen I say to you , that they have received their reward .
40006017	But as for you , when you fast , anoint your head and wash your face ,
40006018	so that your fasting will not be apparent to men , but to your Father , who is in secret . And your Father , who sees in secret , will repay you .
40006019	Do not choose to store up for yourselves treasures on earth : where rust and moth consume , and where thieves break in and steal .
40006020	Instead , store up for yourselves treasures in heaven : where neither rust nor moth consumes , and where thieves do not break in and steal .
40006021	For where your treasure is , there also is your heart .
40006022	The lamp of your body is your eye . If your eye is wholesome , your entire body will be filled with light .
40006023	But if your eye has been corrupted , your entire body will be darkened . If then the light that is in you is darkness , how great will that darkness be !
40006024	No one is able to serve two masters . For either he will have hatred for the one , and love the other , or he will persevere with the one , and despise the other . You cannot serve God and wealth .
40006025	And so I say to you , do not be anxious about your life , as to what you will eat , nor about your body , as to what you will wear . Is not life more than food , and the body more than clothing ?
40006026	Consider the birds of the air , how they neither sow , nor reap , nor gather into barns , and yet your heavenly Father feeds them . Are you not of much greater value than they are ?
40006027	And which of you , by thinking , is able to add one cubit to his stature ?
40006028	And as for clothing , why are you anxious ? Consider the lilies of the field , how they grow ; they neither work nor weave .
40006029	But I say to you , that not even Solomon , in all his glory , was arrayed like one of these .
40006030	So if God so clothes the grass of the field , which is here today , and cast into the oven tomorrow , how much more will he care for you , O little in faith ?
40006031	Therefore , do not choose to be anxious , saying : ‘ What shall we eat , and what shall we drink , and with what shall we be clothed ? ’
40006032	For the Gentiles seek all these things . Yet your Father knows that you need all these things .
40006033	Therefore , seek first the kingdom of God and his justice , and all these things shall be added to you as well .
40006034	Therefore , do not be anxious about tomorrow ; for the future day will be anxious for itself . Sufficient for the day is its evil . ”
40007001	“ Do not judge , so that you may not be judged .
40007002	For with whatever judgment you judge , so shall you be judged ; and with whatever measure you measure out , so shall it be measured back to you .
40007003	And how can you see the splinter in your brother’s eye , and not see the board in your own eye ?
40007004	Or how can you say to your brother , ‘ Let me take the splinter from your eye , ’ while , behold , a board is in your own eye ?
40007005	Hypocrite , first remove the board from your own eye , and then you will see clearly enough to remove the splinter from your brother’s eye .
40007006	Do not give what is holy to dogs , and do not cast your pearls before swine , lest perhaps they may trample them under their feet , and then , turning , they may tear you apart .
40007007	Ask , and it shall be given to you . Seek , and you shall find . Knock , and it shall be opened to you .
40007008	For everyone who asks , receives ; and whoever seeks , finds ; and to anyone who knocks , it will be opened .
40007009	Or what man is there among you , who , if his son were to ask him for bread , would offer him a stone ;
40007010	or if he were to ask him for a fish , would offer him a snake ?
40007011	Therefore , if you , though you are evil , know how to give good gifts to your sons , how much more will your Father , who is in heaven , give good things to those who ask him ?
40007012	Therefore , all things whatsoever that you wish that men would do to you , do so also to them . For this is the law and the prophets .
40007013	Enter through the narrow gate . For wide is the gate , and broad is the way , which leads to perdition , and many there are who enter through it .
40007014	How narrow is the gate , and how straight is the way , which leads to life , and few there are who find it !
40007015	Beware of false prophets , who come to you in sheep’s clothing , but inwardly are ravenous wolves .
40007016	You shall know them by their fruits . Can grapes be gathered from thorns , or figs from thistles ?
40007017	So then , every good tree produces good fruit , and the evil tree produces evil fruit .
40007018	A good tree is not able to produce evil fruit , and an evil tree is not able to produce good fruit .
40007019	Every tree which does not produce good fruit shall be cut down and cast into the fire .
40007020	Therefore , by their fruits you will know them .
40007021	Not all who say to me , ‘ Lord , Lord , ’ will enter into the kingdom of heaven . But whoever does the will of my Father , who is in heaven , the same shall enter into the kingdom of heaven .
40007022	Many will say to me in that day , ‘ Lord , Lord , did we not prophesy in your name , and cast out demons in your name , and perform many powerful deeds in your name ? ’
40007023	And then will I disclose to them : ‘ I have never known you . Depart from me , you workers of iniquity . ’
40007024	Therefore , everyone who hears these words of mine and does them shall be compared to a wise man , who built his house upon the rock .
40007025	And the rains descended , and the floods rose up , and the winds blew , and rushed upon that house , but it did not fall , for it was founded on the rock .
40007026	And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them shall be like a foolish man , who built his house upon the sand .
40007027	And the rains descended , and the floods rose up , and the winds blew , and rushed upon that house , and it did fall , and great was its ruin . ”
40007028	And it happened , when Jesus had completed these words , that the crowds were astonished at his doctrine .
40007029	For he was teaching them as one who has authority , and not like their scribes and Pharisees .
40008001	And when he had descended from the mountain , great crowds followed him .
40008002	And behold , a leper , drawing near , adored him , saying , “ Lord , if you are willing , you are able to cleanse me . ”
40008003	And Jesus , extending his hand , touched him , saying : “ I am willing . Be cleansed . ” And immediately his leprosy was cleansed .
40008004	And Jesus said to him : “ See to it that you tell no one . But go , show yourself to the priest , and offer the gift that Moses instructed , as a testimony for them . ”
40008005	And when he had entered into Capernaum , a centurion approached , petitioning him ,
40008006	and saying , “ Lord , my servant lies at home paralyzed and badly tormented . ”
40008007	And Jesus said to him , “ I will come and heal him . ”
40008008	And responding , the centurion said : “ Lord , I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof , but only say the word , and my servant shall be healed .
40008009	For I , too , am a man placed under authority , having soldiers under me . And I say to one , ‘ Go , ’ and he goes , and to another , ‘ Come , ’ and he comes , and to my servant , ‘ Do this , ’ and he does it . ”
40008010	And , hearing this , Jesus wondered . And he said to those following him : “ Amen I say to you , I have not found so great a faith in Israel .
40008011	For I say to you , that many shall come from the east and the west , and they shall sit at table with Abraham , and Isaac , and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven .
40008012	But the sons of the kingdom shall be cast into the outer darkness , where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth . ”
40008013	And Jesus said to the centurion , “ Go , and just as you have believed , so let it be done for you . ” And the servant was healed at that very hour .
40008014	And when Jesus had arrived at the house of Peter , he saw his mother-in-law lying ill with a fever .
40008015	And he touched her hand , and the fever left her , and she rose up and ministered to them .
40008016	And when evening arrived , they brought to him many who had demons , and he cast out the spirits with a word . And he healed all those having maladies ,
40008017	in order to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah , saying , “ He took our infirmities , and he carried away our diseases . ”
40008018	Then Jesus , seeing the great crowds encircling him , gave orders to go across the sea .
40008019	And one scribe , approaching , said to him , “ Teacher , I will follow you wherever you will go . ”
40008020	And Jesus said to him , “ Foxes have dens , and the birds of the air have nests , but the Son of man has nowhere to rest his head . ”
40008021	Then another of his disciples said to him , “ Lord , permit me first to go and bury my father . ”
40008022	But Jesus said to him , “ Follow me , and allow the dead to bury their dead . ”
40008023	And climbing into a boat , his disciples followed him .
40008024	And behold , a great tempest occurred in the sea , so much so that the boat was covered with waves ; yet truly , he was sleeping .
40008025	And his disciples drew near to him , and they awakened him , saying : “ Lord , save us , we are perishing . ”
40008026	And Jesus said to them , “ Why are you afraid , O little in faith ? ” Then rising up , he commanded the winds , and the sea . And a great tranquility occurred .
40008027	Moreover , the men wondered , saying : “ What kind of man is this ? For even the winds and the sea obey him . ”
40008028	And when he had arrived across the sea , into the region of the Gerasenes , he was met by two who had demons , who were so exceedingly savage , as they went out from among the tombs , that no one was able to cross by that way .
40008029	And behold , they cried out , saying : “ What are we to you , O Jesus , the Son of God ? Have you come here to torment us before the time ? ”
40008030	Now there was , not far from them , a herd of many swine feeding .
40008031	Then the demons petitioned him , saying : “ If you cast us from here , send us into the herd of swine . ”
40008032	And he said to them , “ Go . ” And they , going out , went into the swine . And behold , the entire herd suddenly rushed along a steep place into the sea . And they died in the waters .
40008033	Then the shepherds fled , and arriving in the city , they reported on all this , and on those who had had the demons .
40008034	And behold , the entire city went out to meet Jesus . And having seen him , they petitioned him , so that he would cross from their borders .
40009001	And climbing into a boat , he crossed the sea , and he arrived at his own city .
40009002	And behold , they brought to him a paralytic , lying on a bed . And Jesus , seeing their faith , said to the paralytic , “ Be strengthened in faith , son ; your sins are forgiven you . ”
40009003	And behold , some of the scribes said within themselves , “ He is blaspheming . ”
40009004	And when Jesus had perceived their thoughts , he said : “ Why do you think such evil in your hearts ?
40009005	Which is easier to say , ‘ Your sins are forgiven you , ’ or to say , ‘ Rise up and walk ? ’
40009006	But , so that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins , ” he then said to the paralytic , “ Rise up , take up your bed , and go into your house . ”
40009007	And he arose and went into his house .
40009008	Then the crowd , seeing this , was frightened , and they glorified God , who gave such power to men .
40009009	And when Jesus passed on from there , he saw , sitting at the tax office , a man named Matthew . And he said to him , “ Follow me . ” And rising up , he followed him .
40009010	And it happened that , as he was sitting down to eat in the house , behold , many tax collectors and sinners arrived , and they sat down to eat with Jesus and his disciples .
40009011	And the Pharisees , seeing this , said to his disciples , “ Why does your Teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners ? ”
40009012	But Jesus , hearing this , said : “ It is not those who are healthy who are in need of a physician , but those who have maladies .
40009013	So then , go out and learn what this means : ‘ I desire mercy and not sacrifice . ’ For I have not come to call the just , but sinners . ”
40009014	Then the disciples of John drew near to him , saying , “ Why do we and the Pharisees fast frequently , but your disciples do not fast ? ”
40009015	And Jesus said to them : “ How can the sons of the groom mourn , while the groom is still with them ? But the days will arrive when the groom will be taken away from them . And then they shall fast .
40009016	For no one would sew a patch of new cloth onto an old garment . For it pulls its fullness away from the garment , and the tear is made worse .
40009017	Neither do they pour new wine into old wineskins . Otherwise , the wineskins rupture , and the wine pours out , and the wineskins are destroyed . Instead , they pour new wine into new wineskins . And so , both are preserved . ”
40009018	As he was speaking these things to them , behold , a certain ruler approached and adored him , saying : “ Lord , my daughter has recently passed away . But come and impose your hand upon her , and she will live . ”
40009019	And Jesus , rising up , followed him , with his disciples .
40009020	And behold , a woman , who had suffered from a flow of blood for twelve years , approached from behind and touched the hem of his garment .
40009021	For she said within herself , “ If I will touch even his garment , I shall be saved . ”
40009022	But Jesus , turning and seeing her , said : “ Be strengthened in faith , daughter ; your faith has made you well . ” And the woman was made well from that hour .
40009023	And when Jesus had arrived in the house of the ruler , and he had seen the musicians and the tumultuous crowd ,
40009024	he said , “ Depart . For the girl is not dead , but asleep . ” And they derided him .
40009025	And when the crowd had been sent away , he entered . And he took her by the hand . And the girl rose up .
40009026	And the news of this went out to that entire land .
40009027	And as Jesus passed from there , two blind men followed him , crying out and saying , “ Take pity on us , Son of David . ”
40009028	And when he had arrived at the house , the blind men approached him . And Jesus said to them , “ Do you trust that I am able to do this for you ? ” They say to him , “ Certainly , Lord . ”
40009029	Then he touched their eyes , saying , “ According to your faith , so let it be done for you . ”
40009030	And their eyes were opened . And Jesus warned them , saying , “ See to it that no one knows of this . ”
40009031	But going out , they spread the news of it to all that land .
40009032	Then , when they had departed , behold , they brought him a man who was mute , having a demon .
40009033	And after the demon was cast out , the mute man spoke . And the crowds wondered , saying , “ Never has anything like this been seen in Israel . ”
40009034	But the Pharisees said , “ By the prince of demons does he cast out demons . ”
40009035	And Jesus traveled throughout all of the cities and towns , teaching in their synagogues , and preaching the Gospel of the kingdom , and healing every illness and every infirmity .
40009036	Then , seeing the multitudes , he had compassion on them , because they were distressed and were reclining , like sheep without a shepherd .
40009037	Then he said to his disciples : “ The harvest indeed is great , but the laborers are few .
40009038	Therefore , petition the Lord of the harvest , so that he may sent out laborers to his harvest . ”
40010001	And having called together his twelve disciples , he gave them authority over unclean spirits , to cast them out and to cure every sickness and every infirmity .
40010002	Now the names of the twelve Apostles are these : the First , Simon , who is called Peter , and Andrew his brother ,
40010003	James of Zebedee , and John his brother , Philip and Bartholomew , Thomas and Matthew the tax collector , and James of Alphaeus , and Thaddaeus ,
40010004	Simon the Canaanite , and Judas Iscariot , who also betrayed him .
40010005	Jesus sent these twelve , instructing them , saying : “ Do not travel by the way of the Gentiles , and do not enter into the city of the Samaritans ,
40010006	but instead go to the sheep who have fallen away from the house of Israel .
40010007	And going forth , preach , saying : ‘ For the kingdom of heaven has drawn near . ’
40010008	Cure the infirm , raise the dead , cleanse lepers , cast out demons . You have received freely , so give freely .
40010009	Do not choose to possess gold , nor silver , nor money in your belts ,
40010010	nor provisions for the journey , nor two tunics , nor shoes , nor a staff . For the laborer deserves his portion .
40010011	Now , into whatever city or town you will enter , inquire as to who is worthy within it . And stay there until you depart .
40010012	Then , when you enter into the house , greet it , saying , ‘ Peace to this house . ’
40010013	And if , indeed , that house is worthy , your peace will rest upon it . But if it is not worthy , your peace will return to you .
40010014	And whoever has neither received you , nor listened to your words , departing from that house or city , shake off the dust from your feet .
40010015	Amen I say to you , it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment , than for that city .
40010016	Behold , I am sending you like sheep in the midst of wolves . Therefore , be as prudent as serpents and as simple as doves .
40010017	But beware of men . For they will hand you over to councils , and they will scourge you in their synagogues .
40010018	And you shall be led before both rulers and kings for my sake , as a testimony to them and to the Gentiles .
40010019	But when they hand you over , do not choose to think about how or what to speak . For what to speak shall be given to you in that hour .
40010020	For it is not you who will be speaking , but the Spirit of your Father , who will speak in you .
40010021	And brother will hand over brother to death , and father will hand over son . And children will rise up against parents and bring about their deaths .
40010022	And you will be hated by all for the sake of my name . But whoever will have persevered , even to the end , the same shall be saved .
40010023	Now when they persecute you in one city , flee into another . Amen I say to you , you will not have exhausted all the cities of Israel , before the Son of man returns .
40010024	The disciple is not above the teacher , nor is the servant above his master .
40010025	It is sufficient for the disciple that he be like his teacher , and the servant , like his master . If they have called the Father of the family , ‘ Beelzebub , ’ how much more those of his household ?
40010026	Therefore , do not fear them . For nothing is covered that shall not be revealed , nor hidden that shall not be known .
40010027	What I tell you in darkness , speak in the light . And what you hear whispered in the ear , preach above the rooftops .
40010028	And do not be afraid of those who kill the body , but are not able to kill the soul . But instead fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Hell .
40010029	Are not two sparrows sold for one small coin ? And yet not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father .
40010030	For even the hairs of your head have all been numbered .
40010031	Therefore , do not be afraid . You are worth more than many sparrows .
40010032	Therefore , everyone who acknowledges me before men , I also will acknowledge before my Father , who is in heaven .
40010033	But whoever will have denied me before men , I also will deny before my Father , who is in heaven .
40010034	Do not think that I came to send peace upon the earth . I came , not to send peace , but the sword .
40010035	For I came to divide a man against his father , and a daughter against her mother , and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law .
40010036	And the enemies of a man will be those of his own household .
40010037	Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me . And whoever loves son or daughter above me is not worthy of me .
40010038	And whoever does not take up his cross , and follow me is not worthy of me .
40010039	Whoever finds his life , will lose it . And whoever will have lost his life because of me , shall find it .
40010040	Whoever receives you , receives me . And whoever receives me , receives him who sent me .
40010041	Whoever receives a prophet , in the name of a prophet , shall receive the reward of a prophet . And whoever receives the just in the name of the just shall receive the reward of the just .
40010042	And whoever shall give , even to one of the least of these , a cup of cold water to drink , solely in the name of a disciple : Amen I say to you , he shall not lose his reward . ”
40011001	And it happened that , when Jesus had completed instructing his twelve disciples , he went away from there in order to teach and to preach in their cities .
40011002	Now when John had heard , in prison , about the works of Christ , sending two of his disciples , he said to him ,
40011003	“ Are you he who is to come , or should we expect another ? ”
40011004	And Jesus , responding , said to them : “ Go and report to John what you have heard and seen .
40011005	The blind see , the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed , the deaf hear , the dead rise again , the poor are evangelized .
40011006	And blessed is he who has found no offense in me . ”
40011007	Then , after they departed , Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John : “ What did you go out to the desert to see ? A reed shaken by the wind ?
40011008	So what did you go out to see ? A man in soft garments ? Behold , those who are clothed in soft garments are in the houses of kings .
40011009	Then what did you go out to see ? A prophet ? Yes , I tell you , and more than a prophet .
40011010	For this is he , of whom it is written : ‘ Behold , I send my Angel before your face , who shall prepare your way before you . ’
40011011	Amen I say to you , among those born of women , there has arisen no one greater than John the Baptist . Yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he .
40011012	But from the days of John the Baptist , even until now , the kingdom of heaven has endured violence , and the violent carry it away .
40011013	For all the prophets and the law prophesied , even until John .
40011014	And if you are willing to accept it , he is the Elijah , who is to come .
40011015	Whoever has ears to hear , let him hear .
40011016	But to what shall I compare this generation ? It is like children sitting in the marketplace ,
40011017	who , calling out to their companions , say : ‘ We played music for you , and you did not dance . We lamented , and you did not mourn . ’
40011018	For John came neither eating nor drinking ; and they say , ‘ He has a demon . ’
40011019	The Son of man came eating and drinking ; and they say , ‘ Behold , a man who eats voraciously and who drinks wine , a friend of tax collectors and sinners . ’ But wisdom is justified by her sons . ”
40011020	Then he began to rebuke the cities in which many of his miracles were accomplished , for they still had not repented .
40011021	“ Woe to you , Chorazin ! Woe to you , Bethsaida ! For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon , they would have repented long ago in haircloth and ashes .
40011022	Yet truly , I say to you , Tyre and Sidon shall be forgiven more than you , on the day of judgment .
40011023	And you , Capernaum , would you be exalted all the way to heaven ? You shall descend all the way to Hell . For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Sodom , perhaps it would have remained , even to this day .
40011024	Yet truly , I say to you , that the land of Sodom shall be forgiven more than you , on the day of judgment . ”
40011025	At that time , Jesus responded and said : “ I acknowledge you , Father , Lord of Heaven and earth , because you have hidden these things from the wise and the prudent , and have revealed them to little ones .
40011026	Yes , Father , for this was pleasing before you .
40011027	All things have been delivered to me by my Father . And no one knows the Son except the Father , nor does anyone know the Father except the Son , and those to whom the Son is willing to reveal him .
40011028	Come to me , all you who labor and have been burdened , and I will refresh you .
40011029	Take my yoke upon you , and learn from me , for I am meek and humble of heart ; and you shall find rest for your souls .
40011030	For my yoke is sweet and my burden is light . ”
40012001	At that time , Jesus went out through the ripe grain on the Sabbath . And his disciples , being hungry , began to separate the grain and to eat .
40012002	Then the Pharisees , seeing this , said to him , “ Behold , your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbaths . ”
40012003	But he said to them : “ Have you not read what David did , when he was hungry , and those who were with him :
40012004	how he entered the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence , which was not lawful for him to eat , nor for those who were with him , but only for the priests ?
40012005	Or have you not read in the law , that on the Sabbaths the priests in the temple violate the Sabbath , and they are without guilt ?
40012006	But I say to you , that something greater than the temple is here .
40012007	And if you knew what this means , ‘ I desire mercy , and not sacrifice , ’ you would never have condemned the innocent .
40012008	For the Son of man is Lord even of the Sabbath . ”
40012009	And when he had passed from there , he went into their synagogues .
40012010	And behold , there was a man who had a withered hand , and they questioned him , so that they might accuse him , saying , “ Is it lawful to cure on the Sabbaths ? ”
40012011	But he said to them : “ Who is there among you , having even one sheep , if it will have fallen into a pit on the Sabbath , would not take hold of it and lift it up ?
40012012	How much better is a man than a sheep ? And so , it is lawful to do good on the Sabbaths . ”
40012013	Then he said to the man , “ Extend your hand . ” And he extended it , and it was restored to health , just like the other one .
40012014	Then the Pharisees , departing , took council against him , as to how they might destroy him .
40012015	But Jesus , knowing this , withdrew from there . And many followed him , and he cured them all .
40012016	And he instructed them , lest they make him known .
40012017	Then what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah was fulfilled , saying :
40012018	“ Behold , my servant whom I have chosen , my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased . I will place my Spirit over him , and he shall announce judgment to the nations .
40012019	He shall not contend , nor cry out , neither shall anyone hear his voice in the streets .
40012020	He shall not crush the bruised reed , and he shall not extinguish the smoking wick , until he sends forth judgment unto victory .
40012021	And the Gentiles shall hope in his name . ”
40012022	Then one who had a demon , who was blind and mute , was brought to him . And he cured him , so that he spoke and saw .
40012023	And all the crowds were stupefied , and they said , “ Could this be the son of David ? ”
40012024	But the Pharisees , hearing it , said , “ This man does not cast out demons , except by Beelzebub , the prince of the demons . ”
40012025	But Jesus , knowing their thoughts , said to them : “ Every kingdom divided against itself will become desolate . And every city or house divided against itself will not stand .
40012026	So if Satan casts out Satan , then he is divided against himself . How then will his kingdom stand ?
40012027	And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub , by whom do your own sons cast them out ? Therefore , they shall be your judges .
40012028	But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God , then the kingdom of God has arrived among you .
40012029	Or how can anyone enter into the house of a strong man , and plunder his belongings , unless he first restrains the strong man ? And then he will plunder his house .
40012030	Whoever is not with me , is against me . And whoever does not gather with me , scatters .
40012031	For this reason , I say to you : Every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven men , but blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven .
40012032	And anyone who will have spoken a word against the Son of man shall be forgiven . But whoever will have spoken against the Holy Spirit shall not be forgiven , neither in this age , nor in the future age .
40012033	Either make the tree good and its fruit good , or make the tree evil and its fruit evil . For certainly a tree is known by its fruit .
40012034	Progeny of vipers , how are you able to speak good things while you are evil ? For out of the abundance of the heart , the mouth speaks .
40012035	A good man offers good things from a good storehouse . And an evil man offers evil things from an evil storehouse .
40012036	But I say to you , that for every idle word which men will have spoken , they shall render an account in the day of judgment .
40012037	For by your words shall you be justified , and by your words shall you be condemned . ”
40012038	Then certain ones from the scribes and the Pharisees responded to him , saying , “ Teacher , we want to see a sign from you . ”
40012039	And answering , he said to them : “ An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign . But a sign will not be given to it , except the sign of the prophet Jonah .
40012040	For just as Jonah was in the belly of the whale for three days and three nights , so shall the Son of man be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights .
40012041	The men of Nineveh shall arise in judgment with this generation , and they shall condemn it . For , at the preaching of Jonah , they repented . And behold , there is a greater than Jonah here .
40012042	The Queen of the South shall arise in judgment with this generation , and she shall condemn it . For she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon . And behold , there is a greater than Solomon here .
40012043	Now when an unclean spirit departs from a man , he walks through dry places , seeking rest , and he does not find it .
40012044	Then he says , ‘ I will return to my house , from which I departed ’ . And arriving , he finds it vacant , swept clean , and decorated .
40012045	Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself , and they enter in and live there . And in the end , the man becomes worse than he was at first . So , too , shall it be with this most wicked generation . ”
40012046	While he was still speaking to the crowds , behold , his mother and his brothers were standing outside , seeking to speak with him .
40012047	And someone said to him : “ Behold , your mother and your brothers are standing outside , seeking you . ”
40012048	But responding to the one speaking to him , he said , “ Which one is my mother , and who are my brothers ? ”
40012049	And extending his hand to his disciples , he said : “ Behold : my mother and my brothers .
40012050	For anyone who does the will of my Father , who is in heaven , the same is my brother , and sister , and mother . ”
40013001	In that day , Jesus , departing from the house , sat down beside the sea .
40013002	And such great crowds were gathered to him that he climbed into a boat and he sat down . And the entire multitude stood on the shore .
40013003	And he spoke many things to them in parables , saying : “ Behold , a sower went out to sow seed .
40013004	And while he was sowing , some fell beside the road , and the birds of the air came and ate it .
40013005	Then others fell in a rocky place , where they did not have much soil . And they sprung up promptly , because they had no depth of soil .
40013006	But when the sun rose up , they were scorched , and because they had no roots , they withered .
40013007	Still others fell among thorns , and the thorns increased and suffocated them .
40013008	Yet some others fell upon good soil , and they produced fruit : some one hundred fold , some sixty fold , some thirty fold .
40013009	Whoever has ears to hear , let him hear . ”
40013010	And his disciples drew near to him and said , “ Why do you speak to them in parables ? ”
40013011	Responding , he said to them : “ Because it has been given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven , but it has not been given to them .
40013012	For whoever has , it shall be given to him , and he shall have in abundance . But whoever has not , even what he has shall be taken away from him .
40013013	For this reason , I speak to them in parables : because seeing , they do not see , and hearing they do not hear , nor do they understand .
40013014	And so , in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah , who said , ‘ Hearing , you shall hear , but not understand ; and seeing , you shall see , but not perceive .
40013015	For the heart of this people has grown fat , and with their ears they hear heavily , and they have closed their eyes , lest at any time they might see with their eyes , and hear with their ears , and understand with their heart , and be converted , and then I would heal them . ’
40013016	But blessed are your eyes , because they see , and your ears , because they hear .
40013017	Amen I say to you , certainly , that many of the prophets and the just desired to see what you see , and yet they did not see it , and to hear what you hear , and yet they did not hear it .
40013018	Listen , then , to the parable of the sower .
40013019	With anyone who hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it , evil comes and carries away what was sown in his heart . This is he who received the seed by the side of the road .
40013020	Then whoever has received the seed upon a rocky place , this is one who hears the word and promptly accepts it with joy .
40013021	But he has no root in himself , so it is only for a time ; then , when tribulation and persecution occur because of the word , he promptly stumbles .
40013022	And whoever has received the seed among thorns , this is he who hears the word , but the cares of this age and the falseness of riches suffocate the word , and he is effectively without fruit .
40013023	Yet truly , whoever has received the seed into good soil , this is he who hears the word , and understands it , and so he bears fruit , and he produces : some a hundred fold , and another sixty fold , and another thirty fold . ”
40013024	He proposed another parable to them , saying : “ The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field .
40013025	But while the men were sleeping , his enemy came and sowed weeds amid the wheat , and then went away .
40013026	And when the plants had grown , and had produced fruit , then the weeds also appeared .
40013027	So the servants of the Father of the family , approaching , said to him : ‘ Lord , did you not sow good seed in your field ? Then how is it that it has weeds ? ’
40013028	And he said to them , ‘ A man who is an enemy has done this . ’ So the servants said to him , ‘ Is it your will that we should go and gather them up ? ’
40013029	And he said : ‘ No , lest perhaps in gathering the weeds , you might also root out the wheat together with it .
40013030	Permit both to grow until the harvest , and at the time of the harvest , I will say to the reapers : Gather first the weeds , and bind them into bundles to burn , but the wheat gather into my storehouse . ’ ”
40013031	He proposed another parable to them , saying : “ The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed , which a man took and sowed in his field .
40013032	It is , indeed , the least of all seeds , but when it has grown , it is greater than all the plants , and it becomes a tree , so much so that the birds of the air come and dwell in its branches . ”
40013033	He spoke another parable to them : “ The kingdom of heaven is like leaven , which a woman took and hid in three measures of fine wheat flour , until it was entirely leavened . ”
40013034	All these things Jesus spoke in parables to the crowds . And he did not speak to them apart from parables ,
40013035	in order to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet , saying : “ I will open my mouth in parables . I will proclaim what has been hidden since the foundation of the world . ”
40013036	Then , dismissing the crowds , he went into the house . And his disciples drew near to him , saying , “ Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field . ”
40013037	Responding , he said to them : “ He who sows the good seed is the Son of man .
40013038	Now the field is the world . And the good seeds are the sons of the kingdom . But the weeds are the sons of wickedness .
40013039	So the enemy who sowed them is the devil . And truly , the harvest is the consummation of the age ; while the reapers are the Angels .
40013040	Therefore , just as weeds are gathered up and burned with fire , so shall it be at the consummation of the age .
40013041	The Son of man shall send out his Angels , and they shall gather from his kingdom all who lead astray and those who work iniquity .
40013042	And he shall cast them into the furnace of fire , where there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
40013043	Then the just ones shall shine like the sun , in the kingdom of their Father . Whoever has ears to hear , let him hear .
40013044	The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field . When a man finds it , he hides it , and , because of his joy , he goes and sells everything that he has , and he buys that field .
40013045	Again , the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking good pearls .
40013046	Having found one pearl of great value , he went away and sold all that he had , and he bought it .
40013047	Again , the kingdom of heaven is like a net cast into the sea , which gathers together all kinds of fish .
40013048	When it has been filled , drawing it out and sitting beside the shore , they selected the good into vessels , but the bad they threw away .
40013049	So shall it be at the consummation of the age . The Angels shall go forth and separate the bad from the midst of the just .
40013050	And they shall cast them into the furnace of fire , where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
40013051	Have you understood all these things ? ” They say to him , “ Yes . ”
40013052	He said to them , “ Therefore , every scribe well-taught about the kingdom of heaven , is like a man , the father of a family , who offers from his storehouse both the new and the old . ”
40013053	And it happened that , when Jesus had completed these parables , he went away from there .
40013054	And arriving in his own country , he taught them in their synagogues , so much so that they wondered and said : “ How can such wisdom and power be with this one ?
40013055	Is this not the son of a workman ? Is not his mother called Mary , and his brothers , James , and Joseph , and Simon , and Jude ?
40013056	And his sisters , are they not all with us ? Therefore , from where has this one obtained all these things ? ”
40013057	And they took offense at him . But Jesus said to them , “ A prophet is not without honor , except in his own country and in his own house . ”
40013058	And he did not work many miracles there , because of their unbelief .
40014001	In that time , Herod the Tetrarch heard the news about Jesus .
40014002	And he said to his servants : “ This is John the Baptist . He has risen from the dead , and that is why miracles are at work in him . ”
40014003	For Herod had apprehended John , and bound him , and put him in prison , because of Herodias , the wife of his brother .
40014004	For John was telling him , “ It is not lawful for you to have her . ”
40014005	And though he wanted to kill him , he feared the people , because they held him to be a prophet .
40014006	Then , on Herod’s birthday , the daughter of Herodias danced in their midst , and it pleased Herod .
40014007	And so he promised with an oath to give her whatever she would ask of him .
40014008	But , having been advised by her mother , she said , “ Give me here , on a platter , the head of John the Baptist . ”
40014009	And the king was greatly saddened . But because of his oath , and because of those who sat at table with him , he ordered it to be given .
40014010	And he sent and beheaded John in prison .
40014011	And his head was brought on a platter , and it was given to the girl , and she brought it to her mother .
40014012	And his disciples approached and took the body , and they buried it . And arriving , they reported it to Jesus .
40014013	When Jesus had heard it , he withdrew from there by boat , to a deserted place by himself . And when the crowds had heard of it , they followed him on foot from the cities .
40014014	And going out , he saw a great multitude , and he took pity on them , and he cured their sick .
40014015	And when evening had arrived , his disciples approached him , saying : “ This is a deserted place , and the hour has now passed . Dismiss the crowds , so that , by going into the towns , they may buy food for themselves . ”
40014016	But Jesus said to them : “ They have no need to go . Give them something to eat yourselves . ”
40014017	They answered him , “ We have nothing here , except five loaves and two fish . ”
40014018	He said to them , “ Bring them here to me . ”
40014019	And when he had ordered the multitude to sit down upon the grass , he took the five loaves and the two fish , and gazing up to heaven , he blessed and broke and gave the bread to the disciples , and then the disciples to the multitudes .
40014020	And they all ate and were satisfied . And they took up the remnants : twelve baskets full of fragments .
40014021	Now the number of those who ate was five thousand men , besides women and children .
40014022	And Jesus promptly compelled his disciples to climb into the boat , and to precede him in crossing the sea , while he dismissed the crowds .
40014023	And having dismissed the multitude , he ascended alone onto a mountain to pray . And when evening arrived , he was alone there .
40014024	But in the midst of the sea , the boat was being tossed about by the waves . For the wind was against them .
40014025	Then , in the fourth watch of the night , he came to them , walking upon the sea .
40014026	And seeing him walking upon the sea , they were disturbed , saying : “ It must be an apparition . ” And they cried out , because of fear .
40014027	And immediately , Jesus spoke to them , saying : “ Have faith . It is I . Do not be afraid . ”
40014028	Then Peter responded by saying , “ Lord , if it is you , order me come to you over the waters . ”
40014029	And he said , “ Come . ” And Peter , descending from the boat , walked over the water , so as to go to Jesus .
40014030	Yet truly , seeing that the wind was strong , he was afraid . And as he began to sink , he cried out , saying : “ Lord , save me . ”
40014031	And immediately Jesus extended his hand and took hold of him . And he said to him , “ O little in faith , why did you doubt ? ”
40014032	And when they had ascended into the boat , the wind ceased .
40014033	Then those who were in the boat drew near and adored him , saying : “ Truly , you are the Son of God . ”
40014034	And having crossed the sea , they arrived in the land of Genesaret .
40014035	And when the men of that place had recognized him , they sent into all that region , and they brought to him all who had maladies .
40014036	And they petitioned him , so that they might touch even the hem of his garment . And as many as touched it were made whole .
40015001	Then the scribes and the Pharisees came to him from Jerusalem , saying :
40015002	“ Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders ? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread . ”
40015003	But responding , he said to them : “ And why do you transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition ? For God said :
40015004	‘ Honor your father and mother , ’ and , ‘ Whoever will have cursed father or mother shall die a death . ’
40015005	But you say : ‘ If anyone will have said to father or mother , “ It is dedicated , so that whatever is from me will benefit you , ”
40015006	then he shall not honor his father or his mother . ’ So have you nullified the commandment of God , for the sake of your tradition .
40015007	Hypocrites ! How well did Isaiah prophesy about you , saying :
40015008	‘ This people honors me with their lips , but their heart is far from me .
40015009	For in vain do they worship me , teaching the doctrines and commandments of men . ’ ”
40015010	And having called the multitudes to him , he said to them : “ Listen and understand .
40015011	A man is not defiled by what enters into the mouth , but by what proceeds from the mouth . This is what defiles a man . ”
40015012	Then his disciples drew near and said to him , “ Do you know that the Pharisees , upon hearing this word , were offended ? ”
40015013	But in response he said : “ Every plant which has not been planted by my heavenly Father shall be uprooted .
40015014	Leave them alone . They are blind , and they lead the blind . But if the blind are in charge of the blind , both will fall into the pit . ”
40015015	And responding , Peter said to him , “ Explain this parable to us . ”
40015016	But he said : “ Are you , even now , without understanding ?
40015017	Do you not understand that everything that enters into the mouth goes into the gut , and is cast into the sewer ?
40015018	But what proceeds from the mouth , goes forth from the heart , and those are the things that defile a man .
40015019	For from the heart go out evil thoughts , murders , adulteries , fornications , thefts , false testimonies , blasphemies .
40015020	These are the things that defile a man . But to eat without washing hands does not defile a man . ”
40015021	And departing from there , Jesus withdrew into the areas of Tyre and Sidon .
40015022	And behold , a woman of Canaan , going out from those parts , cried out , saying to him : “ Take pity on me , Lord , Son of David . My daughter is badly afflicted by a demon . ”
40015023	He did not say a word to her . And his disciples , drawing near , petitioned him , saying : “ Dismiss her , for she is crying out after us . ”
40015024	And responding , he said , “ I was not sent except to the sheep who have fallen away from the house of Israel . ”
40015025	But she approached and adored him , saying , “ Lord , help me . ”
40015026	And responding , he said , “ It is not good to take the bread of the children and cast it to the dogs . ”
40015027	But she said , “ Yes , Lord , but the young dogs also eat from the crumbs that fall from the table of their masters . ”
40015028	Then Jesus , responding , said to her : “ O woman , great is your faith . Let it be done for you just as you wish . ” And her daughter was healed from that very hour .
40015029	And when Jesus had passed from there , he arrived beside the sea of Galilee . And ascending onto a mountain , he sat down there .
40015030	And great multitudes came to him , having with them the mute , the blind , the lame , the disabled , and many others . And they cast them down at his feet , and he cured them ,
40015031	so much so that the crowds wondered , seeing the mute speaking , the lame walking , the blind seeing . And they magnified the God of Israel .
40015032	And Jesus , calling together his disciples , said : “ I have compassion on the crowds , because they have persevered with me now for three days , and they do not have anything to eat . And I am not willing to dismiss them , fasting , lest they faint along the way . ”
40015033	And the disciples said to him : “ From where , then , in the desert , would we obtain enough bread to satisfy so a great multitude ? ”
40015034	And Jesus said to them , “ How many loaves of bread do you have ? ” But they said , “ Seven , and a few little fish . ”
40015035	And he instructed the crowds to recline upon the ground .
40015036	And taking the seven loaves and the fish , and giving thanks , he broke and gave to his disciples , and the disciples gave to the people .
40015037	And they all ate and were satisfied . And , from what was left over of the fragments , they took up seven full baskets .
40015038	But those who ate were four thousand men , plus children and women .
40015039	And having dismissed the crowd , he climbed into a boat . And he went into the coastal region of Magadan .
40016001	And Pharisees and Sadducees approached him to test him , and they asked him to show them a sign from heaven .
40016002	But he responded by saying to them : “ When evening arrives , you say , ‘ It will be calm , for the sky is red , ’
40016003	and in the morning , ‘ Today there will be a storm , for the sky is red and gloomy . ’ So then , you know how to judge the appearance of the sky , but you are unable to know the signs of the times ?
40016004	An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign . And a sign shall not be given to it , except the sign of the prophet Jonah . ” And leaving them behind , he went away .
40016005	And when his disciples went across the sea , they forgot to bring bread .
40016006	And he said to them , “ Consider and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees . ”
40016007	But they were thinking within themselves , saying , “ It is because we have not brought bread . ”
40016008	Then Jesus , knowing this , said : “ Why do you consider within yourselves , O little in faith , that it is because you have no bread ?
40016009	Do you not yet understand , nor remember , the five loaves among the five thousand men , and how many containers you took up ?
40016010	Or the seven loaves among the four thousand men , and how many baskets you took up ?
40016011	Why do you not understand that it was not because of bread that I said to you : Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees ? ”
40016012	Then they understood that he was not saying that they should beware of the leaven of bread , but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and the Sadducees .
40016013	Then Jesus went into parts of Caesarea Philippi . And he questioned his disciples , saying , “ Who do men say that the Son of man is ? ”
40016014	And they said , “ Some say John the Baptist , and others say Elijah , still others say Jeremiah or one of the prophets . ”
40016015	Jesus said to them , “ But who do you say that I am ? ”
40016016	Simon Peter responded by saying , “ You are the Christ , the Son of the living God . ”
40016017	And in response , Jesus said to him : “ Blessed are you , Simon son of Jonah . For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you , but my Father , who is in heaven .
40016018	And I say to you , that you are Peter , and upon this rock I will build my Church , and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it .
40016019	And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven . And whatever you shall bind on earth shall be bound , even in heaven . And whatever you shall release on earth shall be released , even in heaven . ”
40016020	Then he instructed his disciples that they should tell no one that he is Jesus the Christ .
40016021	From that time , Jesus began to reveal to his disciples that it was necessary for him to go to Jerusalem , and to suffer much from the elders and the scribes and the leaders of the priests , and to be killed , and to rise again on the third day .
40016022	And Peter , taking him aside , began to rebuke him , saying , “ Lord , may it be far from you ; this shall not happen to you . ”
40016023	And turning away , Jesus said to Peter : “ Get behind me , Satan ; you are an obstacle to me . For you are not behaving according to what is of God , but according to what is of men . ”
40016024	Then Jesus said to his disciples : “ If anyone is willing to come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
40016025	For whoever would save his life , will lose it . But whoever will have lost his life for my sake , shall find it .
40016026	For how does it benefit a man , if he gains the whole world , yet truly suffers damage to his soul ? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul ?
40016027	For the Son of man will arrive in the glory of his Father , with his Angels . And then he will repay each one according to his works .
40016028	Amen I say to you , there are some among those standing here , who shall not taste death , until they see the Son of man arriving in his reign . ”
40017001	And after six days , Jesus took Peter and James and his brother John , and he led them onto a lofty mountain separately .
40017002	And he was transfigured before them . And his face shined brightly like the sun . And his garments were made white like snow .
40017003	And behold , there appeared to them Moses and Elijah , speaking with him .
40017004	And Peter responded by saying to Jesus : “ Lord , it is good for us to be here . If you are willing , let us make three tabernacles here , one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . ”
40017005	And while he was still speaking , behold , a shining cloud overshadowed them . And behold , there was a voice from the cloud , saying : “ This is my beloved Son , with whom I am well pleased . Listen to him . ”
40017006	And the disciples , hearing this , fell prone on their face , and they were very afraid .
40017007	And Jesus drew near and touched them . And he said to them , “ Rise up and do not be afraid . ”
40017008	And lifting up their eyes , they saw no one , except Jesus alone .
40017009	And as they were descending from the mountain , Jesus instructed them , saying , “ Tell no one about the vision , until the Son of man has risen from the dead . ”
40017010	And his disciples questioned him , saying , “ Why then do the scribes say that it is necessary for Elijah to arrive first ? ”
40017011	But in response , he said to them : “ Elijah , indeed , shall arrive and restore all things .
40017012	But I say to you , that Elijah has already arrived , and they did not recognize him , but they did whatever they wanted to him . So also shall the Son of man suffer from them . ”
40017013	Then the disciples understood that he had spoken to them about John the Baptist .
40017014	And when he had arrived at the multitude , a man approached him , falling to his knees before him , saying :
40017015	“ Lord , take pity on my son , for he is an epileptic , and he suffers harm . For he frequently falls into fire , and often also into water .
40017016	And I brought him to your disciples , but they were not able to cure him . ”
40017017	Then Jesus responded by saying : “ What an unbelieving and perverse generation ! How long shall I be with you ? How long shall I endure you ? Bring him here to me . ”
40017018	And Jesus rebuked him , and the demon went out of him , and the boy was cured from that hour .
40017019	Then the disciples approached Jesus privately and said , “ Why were we unable to cast him out ? ”
40017020	Jesus said to them : “ Because of your unbelief . Amen I say to you , certainly , if you will have faith like a grain of mustard seed , you will say to this mountain , ‘ Move from here to there , ’ and it shall move . And nothing will be impossible for you .
40017021	But this kind is not cast out , except through prayer and fasting . ”
40017022	And when they were conversing together in Galilee , Jesus said to them : “ The Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men .
40017023	And they will kill him , but he will rise again on the third day . ” And they were extremely saddened .
40017024	And when they had arrived at Capernaum , those who collected the half shekel approached Peter , and they said to him , “ Doesn’t your Teacher pay the half shekel ? ”
40017025	He said , “ Yes . ” And when he had entered into the house , Jesus went before him , saying : “ How does it seem to you , Simon ? The kings of the earth , from whom do they receive tribute or the census tax : from their own sons or from foreigners ? ”
40017026	And he said , “ From foreigners . ” Jesus said to him : “ Then the sons are free .
40017027	But so that we may not become an obstacle to them : go to the sea , and cast in a hook , and take the first fish that is brought up , and when you have opened its mouth , you will find a shekel . Take it and give it to them , for me and for you . ”
40018001	In that hour , the disciples drew near to Jesus , saying , “ Whom do you consider to be greater in the kingdom of heaven ? ”
40018002	And Jesus , calling to himself a little child , placed him in their midst .
40018003	And he said : “ Amen I say to you , unless you change and become like little children , you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven .
40018004	Therefore , whoever will have humbled himself like this little child , such a one is greater in the kingdom of heaven .
40018005	And whoever shall accept one such little child in my name , accepts me .
40018006	But whoever will have led astray one of these little ones , who trust in me , it would be better for him to have a great millstone hung around his neck , and to be submerged in the depths of the sea .
40018007	Woe to a world that leads people astray ! Although it is necessary for temptations to arise , nevertheless : Woe to that man through whom temptation arises !
40018008	So if your hand or your foot leads you to sin , cut it off and cast it away from you . It is better for you to enter into life disabled or lame , than to be sent into eternal fire having two hands or two feet .
40018009	And if your eye leads you to sin , root it out and cast it away from you . It is better for you to enter into life with one eye , than to be sent into the fires of Hell having two eyes .
40018010	See to it that you do not despise even one of these little ones . For I say to you , that their Angels in heaven continually look upon the face of my Father , who is in heaven .
40018011	For the Son of man has come to save what had been lost .
40018012	How does it seem to you ? If someone has one hundred sheep , and if one of them has gone astray , should he not leave behind the ninety-nine in the mountains , and go out to seek what has gone astray ?
40018013	And if he should happen to find it : Amen I say to you , that he has more joy over that one , than over the ninety-nine which did not go astray .
40018014	Even so , it is not the will before your Father , who is in heaven , that one of these little ones should be lost .
40018015	But if your brother has sinned against you , go and correct him , between you and him alone . If he listens to you , you will have regained your brother .
40018016	But if he will not listen you , invite with you one or two more , so that every word may stand by the mouth of two or three witnesses .
40018017	And if he will not listen to them , tell the Church . But if he will not listen to the Church , let him be to you like the pagan and the tax collector .
40018018	Amen I say to you , whatever you will have bound on earth , shall be bound also in heaven , and whatever you will have released on earth , shall be released also in heaven .
40018019	Again I say to you , that if two of those among you have agreed on earth , about anything whatsoever that they have requested , it shall be done for them by my Father , who is in heaven .
40018020	For wherever two or three are gathered in my name , there am I , in their midst . ”
40018021	Then Peter , drawing near to him , said : “ Lord , how many times shall my brother sin against me , and I forgive him ? Even seven times ? ”
40018022	Jesus said to him : “ I do not say to you , even seven times , but even seventy times seven times .
40018023	Therefore , the kingdom of heaven is compared to a man who was king , who wanted to take account of his servants .
40018024	And when he had begun taking account , one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents .
40018025	But since he did not have any way to repay it , his lord ordered him to be sold , with his wife and children , and all that he had , in order to repay it .
40018026	But that servant , falling prostrate , begged him , saying , ‘ Have patience with me , and I will repay it all to you . ’
40018027	Then the lord of that servant , being moved with pity , released him , and he forgave his debt .
40018028	But when that servant departed , he found one of his fellow servants who owed him one hundred denarius . And taking hold of him , he choked him , saying : ‘ Repay what you owe . ’
40018029	And his fellow servant , falling prostrate , petitioned him , saying : ‘ Have patience with me , and I will repay it all to you . ’
40018030	But he was not willing . Instead , he went out and had him sent to prison , until he would repay the debt .
40018031	Now his fellow servants , seeing what was done , were greatly saddened , and they went and reported to their lord all that was done .
40018032	Then his lord called him , and he said to him : ‘ You wicked servant , I forgave you all your debt , because you pleaded with me .
40018033	Therefore , should you not also have had compassion on your fellow servant , just as I also had compassion on you ? ’
40018034	And his lord , being angry , handed him over to the torturers , until he repaid the entire debt .
40018035	So , too , shall my heavenly Father do to you , if each one of you will not forgive his brother from your hearts . ”
40019001	And it happened that , when Jesus had completed these words , he moved away from Galilee , and he arrived within the borders of Judea , across the Jordan .
40019002	And great crowds followed him , and he healed them there .
40019003	And the Pharisees approached him , testing him , and saying , “ Is it lawful for a man to separate from his wife , no matter what the cause ? ”
40019004	And he said to them in response , “ Have you not read that he who made man from the beginning , made them male and female ? ” And he said :
40019005	“ For this reason , a man shall separate from father and mother , and he shall cling to his wife , and these two shall become one flesh .
40019006	And so , now they are not two , but one flesh . Therefore , what God has joined together , let no man separate . ”
40019007	They said to him , “ Then why did Moses command him to give a bill of divorce , and to separate ? ”
40019008	He said to them : “ Although Moses permitted you to separate from your wives , due to the hardness of your heart , it was not that way from the beginning .
40019009	And I say to you , that whoever will have separated from his wife , except because of fornication , and who will have married another , commits adultery , and whoever will have married her who has been separated , commits adultery . ”
40019010	His disciples said to him , “ If such is the case for a man with a wife , then it is not expedient to marry . ”
40019011	And he said to them : “ Not everyone is able to grasp this word , but only those to whom it has been given .
40019012	For there are chaste persons who were born so from their mother’s womb , and there are chaste persons who have been made so by men , and there are chaste persons who have made themselves chaste for the sake of the kingdom of heaven . Whoever is able to grasp this , let him grasp it . ”
40019013	Then they brought to him little children , so that he would place his hands upon them and pray . But the disciples rebuked them .
40019014	Yet truly , Jesus said to them : “ Allow the little children to come to me , and do not choose to prohibit them . For the kingdom of heaven is among such as these . ”
40019015	And when he had imposed his hands upon them , he went away from there .
40019016	And behold , someone approached and said to him , “ Good Teacher , what good should I do , so that I may have eternal life ? ”
40019017	And he said to him : “ Why do you question me about what is good ? One is good : God . But if you wish to enter into life , observe the commandments . ”
40019018	He said to him , “ Which ? ” And Jesus said : “ You shall not murder . You shall not commit adultery . You shall not steal . You shall not give false testimony .
40019019	Honor your father and your mother . And , you shall love your neighbor as yourself . ”
40019020	The young man said to him : “ All these I have kept from my childhood . What is still lacking for me ? ”
40019021	Jesus said to him : “ If you are willing to be perfect , go , sell what you have , and give to the poor , and then you will have treasure in heaven . And come , follow me . ”
40019022	And when the young man had heard this word , he went away sad , for he had many possessions .
40019023	Then Jesus said to his disciples : “ Amen , I say to you , that the wealthy shall enter with difficulty into the kingdom of heaven .
40019024	And again I say to you , it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle , than for the wealthy to enter into the kingdom of heaven . ”
40019025	And upon hearing this , the disciples wondered greatly , saying : “ Then who will be able to be saved ? ”
40019026	But Jesus , gazing at them , said to them : “ With men , this is impossible . But with God , all things are possible . ”
40019027	Then Peter responded by saying to him : “ Behold , we have left behind all things , and we have followed you . So then , what will be for us ? ”
40019028	And Jesus said to them : “ Amen I say to you , that at the resurrection , when the Son of man shall sit on the seat of his majesty , those of you who have followed me shall also sit on twelve seats , judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
40019029	And anyone who has left behind home , or brothers , or sisters , or father , or mother , or wife , or children , or land , for the sake of my name , shall receive one hundred times more , and shall possess eternal life .
40019030	But many of those who are first shall be last , and the last shall be first . ”
40020001	“ The kingdom of heaven is like the father of a family who went out in early morning to lead workers into his vineyard .
40020002	Then , having made an agreement with the workers for one denarius per day , he sent them into his vineyard .
40020003	And going out about the third hour , he saw others standing idle in the marketplace .
40020004	And he said to them , ‘ You may go into my vineyard , too , and what I will give you will be just . ’
40020005	So they went forth . But again , he went out about the sixth , and about the ninth hour , and he acted similarly .
40020006	Yet truly , about the eleventh hour , he went out and found others standing , and he said to them , ‘ Why have you stood here idle all day ? ’
40020007	They say to him , ‘ Because no one has hired us . ’ He said to them , ‘ You also may go into my vineyard . ’
40020008	And when evening had arrived , the lord of the vineyard said to his manager , ‘ Call the workers and pay them their wages , beginning from the last , even to the first . ’
40020009	And so , when those who had arrived about the eleventh hour came forward , each received a single denarius .
40020010	Then when the first ones also came forward , they considered that they would receive more . But they , too , received one denarius .
40020011	And upon receiving it , they murmured against the father of the family ,
40020012	saying , ‘ These last have worked for one hour , and you have made them equal to us , who worked bearing the weight and heat of the day . ’
40020013	But responding to one of them , he said : ‘ Friend , I caused you no injury . Did you not agree with me to one denarius ?
40020014	Take what is yours and go . But it is my will to give to this last , just as to you .
40020015	And is it not lawful for me to do what I will ? Or is your eye wicked because I am good ? ’
40020016	So then , the last shall be first , and the first shall be last . For many are called , but few are chosen . ”
40020017	And Jesus , ascending to Jerusalem , took the twelve disciples aside in private and said to them :
40020018	“ Behold , we are ascending to Jerusalem , and the Son of man shall be handed over to the leaders of the priests and to the scribes . And they shall condemn him to death .
40020019	And they shall hand him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and scourged and crucified . And on the third day , he shall rise again . ”
40020020	Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee approached him , with her sons , adoring him , and petitioning something from him .
40020021	And he said to her , “ What do you want ? ” She said to him , “ Declare that these , my two sons , may sit , one at your right hand , and the other at your left , in your kingdom . ”
40020022	But Jesus , responding , said : “ You do not know what you are asking . Are you able to drink from the chalice , from which I will drink ? ” They said to him , “ We are able . ”
40020023	He said to them : “ From my chalice , indeed , you shall drink . But to sit at my right or my left is not mine to give to you , but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father . ”
40020024	And the ten , upon hearing this , became indignant with the two brothers .
40020025	But Jesus called them to himself and said : “ You know that the first ones among the Gentiles are their rulers , and that those who are greater exercise power among them .
40020026	It shall not be this way among you . But whoever will want to be greater among you , let him be your minister .
40020027	And whoever will want to be first among you , he shall be your servant ,
40020028	even as the Son of man has not come to be served , but to serve , and to give his life as a redemption for many . ”
40020029	And as they were departing from Jericho , a great crowd followed him .
40020030	And behold , two blind men , sitting by the way , heard that Jesus was passing by ; and they cried out , saying , “ Lord , Son of David , take pity on us . ”
40020031	But the crowd rebuked them to be quiet . But they cried out all the more , saying , “ Lord , Son of David , take pity on us . ”
40020032	And Jesus stood still , and he called them and said , “ What do you want , that I might do for you ? ”
40020033	They said to him , “ Lord , that our eyes be opened . ”
40020034	Then Jesus , taking pity on them , touched their eyes . And immediately they saw , and they followed him .
40021001	And when they had drawn near to Jerusalem , and had arrived at Bethphage , at the Mount of Olives , then Jesus sent two disciples ,
40021002	saying to them : “ Go into the town that is opposite you , and immediately you will find a donkey tied , and a colt with her . Release them , and lead them to me .
40021003	And if anyone will have said anything to you , say that the Lord has need of them . And he will promptly dismiss them . ”
40021004	Now all this was done in order to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet , saying ,
40021005	“ Tell the daughter of Zion : Behold , your king comes to you meekly , sitting on a donkey and on a colt , the son of one accustomed to the yoke . ”
40021006	Then the disciples , going out , did just as Jesus instructed them .
40021007	And they brought the donkey and the colt , and they laid their garments on them , and they helped him sit upon them .
40021008	Then a very numerous crowd spread their garments on the way . But others cut branches from the trees and scattered them on the way .
40021009	And the crowds that preceded him , and those that followed , cried out , saying : “ Hosanna to the Son of David ! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord . Hosanna in the highest ! ”
40021010	And when he had entered into Jerusalem , the entire city was stirred up , saying , “ Who is this ? ”
40021011	But the people were saying , “ This is Jesus , the Prophet from Nazareth of Galilee . ”
40021012	And Jesus entered into the temple of God , and he cast out all who were selling and buying in the temple , and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the chairs of the vendors of doves .
40021013	And he said to them : “ It is written : ‘ My house shall be called a house of prayer . But you have made it into a den of robbers . ’ ”
40021014	And the blind and the lame drew near to him in the temple ; and he healed them .
40021015	Then the leaders of the priests and the scribes became indignant , seeing the miracles that he wrought , and the children crying out in the temple , saying , “ Hosanna to the Son of David ! ”
40021016	And they said to him , “ Do you hear what these ones are saying ? ” But Jesus said to them , “ Certainly . Have you never read : For out of the mouth of babes and infants , you have perfected praise ? ”
40021017	And leaving them behind , he went out , beyond the city , into Bethania , and he lodged here .
40021018	Then , as he was returning to the city in the morning , he was hungry .
40021019	And seeing a certain fig tree beside the way , he approached it . And he found nothing on it , except only leaves . And he said to it , “ May fruit never spring forth from you , for all time . ” And immediately the fig tree was dried up .
40021020	And seeing this , the disciples wondered , saying , “ How did it dry up so quickly ? ”
40021021	And Jesus responded to them by saying : “ Amen I say to you , if you have faith and do not hesitate , not only shall you do this , concerning the fig tree , but even if you would say to this mountain , ‘ Take and cast yourself into the sea , ’ it shall be done .
40021022	And all things whatsoever that you shall ask for in prayer : believing , you shall receive . ”
40021023	And when he had arrived at the temple , as he was teaching , the leaders of the priests and the elders of the people approached him , saying : “ By what authority do you do these things ? And who has given this authority to you ? ”
40021024	In response , Jesus said to them : “ I also will question you with one word : if you tell me this , I also will tell you by what authority I do these things .
40021025	The baptism of John , where was it from ? Was it from heaven , or from men ? ” But they thought within themselves , saying :
40021026	“ If we say , ‘ From heaven , ’ he will say to us , ‘ Then why did you not believe him ? ’ But if we say , ‘ From men , ’ we have the crowd to fear , for they all hold John to be a prophet . ”
40021027	And so , they answered Jesus by saying , “ We do not know . ” So he also said to them : “ Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things .
40021028	But how does it seem to you ? A certain man had two sons . And approaching the first , he said : ‘ Son , go out today to work in my vineyard . ’
40021029	And responding , he said , ‘ I am not willing . ’ But afterwards , being moved by repentance , he went .
40021030	And approaching the other , he spoke similarly . And answering , he said , ‘ I am going , lord . ’ And he did not go .
40021031	Which of the two did the will of the father ? ” They said to him , “ The first . ” Jesus said to them : “ Amen I say to you , that tax collectors and prostitutes shall precede you , into the kingdom of God .
40021032	For John came to you in the way of justice , and you did not believe him . But the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him . Yet even after seeing this , you did not repent , so as to believe him .
40021033	Listen to another parable . There was a man , the father of a family , who planted a vineyard , and surrounded it with a hedge , and dug a press in it , and built a tower . And he loaned it out to farmers , and he set out to sojourn abroad .
40021034	Then , when the time of the fruits drew near , he sent his servants to the farmers , so that they might receive its fruits .
40021035	And the farmers apprehended his servants ; they struck one , and killed another , and stoned yet another .
40021036	Again , he sent other servants , more than before ; and they treated them similarly .
40021037	Then , at the very end , he sent his son to them , saying : ‘ They will revere my son . ’
40021038	But the farmers , seeing the son , said among themselves : ‘ This is the heir . Come , let us kill him , and then we will have his inheritance . ’
40021039	And apprehending him , they cast him outside the vineyard , and they killed him .
40021040	Therefore , when the lord of the vineyard arrives , what will he do to those farmers ? ”
40021041	They said to him , “ He will bring those evil men to an evil end , and he will loan out his vineyard to other farmers , who shall repay to him the fruit in its time . ”
40021042	Jesus said to them : “ Have you never read in the Scriptures : ‘ The stone that the builders have rejected has become the cornerstone . By the Lord has this been done , and it is wonderful in our eyes ? ’
40021043	Therefore , I say to you , that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you , and it shall be given to a people who shall produce its fruits .
40021044	And whoever will have fallen on this stone shall be broken , yet truly , on whomever it shall fall , it will crush him . ”
40021045	And when the leaders of the priests , and the Pharisees had heard his parables , they knew that he was speaking about them .
40021046	And though they sought to take hold of him , they feared the crowds , because they held him to be a prophet .
40022001	And responding , Jesus again spoke to them in parables , saying :
40022002	“ The kingdom of heaven is like a man who was king , who celebrated a wedding for his son .
40022003	And he sent his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding . But they were not willing to come .
40022004	Again , he sent other servants , saying , ‘ Tell the invited : Behold , I have prepared my meal . My bulls and fatlings have been killed , and all is ready . Come to the wedding . ’
40022005	But they ignored this and they went away : one to his country estate , and another to his business .
40022006	Yet truly , the rest took hold of his servants and , having treated them with contempt , killed them .
40022007	But when the king heard this , he was angry . And sending out his armies , he destroyed those murderers , and he burned their city .
40022008	Then he said to his servants : ‘ The wedding , indeed , has been prepared . But those who were invited were not worthy .
40022009	Therefore , go out to the ways , and call whomever you will find to the wedding . ’
40022010	And his servants , departing into the ways , gathered all those whom they found , bad and good , and the wedding was filled with guests .
40022011	Then the king entered to see the guests . And he saw a man there who was not clothed in a wedding garment .
40022012	And he said to him , ‘ Friend , how is it that you have entered here without having a wedding garment ? ’ But he was dumbstruck .
40022013	Then the king said to the ministers : ‘ Bind his hands and feet , and cast him into the outer darkness , where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
40022014	For many are called , but few are chosen . ’ ”
40022015	Then the Pharisees , going out , took counsel as to how they might entrap him in speech .
40022016	And they sent their disciples to him , with the Herodians , saying : “ Teacher , we know that you are truthful , and that you teach the way of God in truth , and that the influence of others is nothing to you . For you do not consider the reputation of men .
40022017	Therefore , tell us , how does it seem to you ? Is it lawful to pay the census tax to Caesar , or not ? ”
40022018	But Jesus , knowing their wickedness , said : “ Why do you test me , you hypocrites ?
40022019	Show me the coin of the census tax . ” And they offered him a denarius .
40022020	And Jesus said to them , “ Whose image is this , and whose inscription ? ”
40022021	They said to him , “ Caesar’s . ” Then he said to them , “ Then render to Caesar what is of Caesar ; and to God what is of God . ”
40022022	And hearing this , they wondered . And having left him behind , they went away .
40022023	In that day , the Sadducees , who say there is to be no resurrection , approached him . And they questioned him ,
40022024	saying : “ Teacher , Moses said : If anyone will have died , having no son , his brother shall marry his wife , and he shall raise up offspring to his brother .
40022025	Now there were seven brothers with us . And the first , having taken a wife , died . And having no offspring , he left his wife to his brother :
40022026	similarly with the second , and the third , even to the seventh .
40022027	And last of all , the woman also passed away .
40022028	In the resurrection , then , whose wife of the seven will she be ? For they all had her . ”
40022029	But Jesus responded to them by saying : “ You have gone astray by knowing neither the Scriptures , nor the power of God .
40022030	For in the resurrection , they shall neither marry , nor be given in marriage . Instead , they shall be like the Angels of God in heaven .
40022031	But concerning the resurrection of the dead , have you not read what was spoken by God , saying to you :
40022032	‘ I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ? ’ He is not the God of the dead , but of the living . ”
40022033	And when the crowds heard this , they wondered at his doctrine .
40022034	But the Pharisees , hearing that he had caused the Sadducees to be silent , came together as one .
40022035	And one of them , a doctor of the law , questioned him , to test him :
40022036	“ Teacher , which is the great commandment in the law ? ”
40022037	Jesus said to him : “ ‘ You shall love the Lord your God from all your heart , and with all your soul and with all your mind . ’
40022038	This is the greatest and first commandment .
40022039	But the second is similar to it : ‘ You shall love your neighbor as yourself . ’
40022040	On these two commandments the entire law depends , and also the prophets . ”
40022041	Then , when the Pharisees were gathered together , Jesus questioned them ,
40022042	saying : “ What do you think about the Christ ? Whose son is he ? ” They said to him , “ David’s . ”
40022043	He said to them : “ Then how can David , in the Spirit , call him Lord , saying :
40022044	‘ The Lord said to my Lord : Sit at my right hand , until I make your enemies your footstool ? ’
40022045	So then , if David calls him Lord , how can he be his son ? ”
40022046	And no one was able to respond to him a word . And neither did anyone dare , from that day forward , to question him .
40023001	Then Jesus spoke to the crowds , and to his disciples ,
40023002	saying : “ The scribes and the Pharisees have sat down in the chair of Moses .
40023003	Therefore , all things whatsoever that they shall say to you , observe and do . Yet truly , do not choose to act according to their works . For they say , but they do not do .
40023004	For they bind up heavy and unbearable burdens , and they impose them on men’s shoulders . But they are not willing to move them with even a finger of their own .
40023005	Truly , they do all their works so that they may be seen by men . For they enlarge their phylacteries and glorify their hems .
40023006	And they love the first places at feasts , and the first chairs in the synagogues ,
40023007	and greetings in the marketplace , and to be called Master by men .
40023008	But you must not be called Master . For One is your Master , and you are all brothers .
40023009	And do not choose to call anyone on earth your father . For One is your Father , who is in heaven .
40023010	Neither should you be called teachers . For One is your Teacher , the Christ .
40023011	Whoever is greater among you shall be your minister .
40023012	But whoever has exalted himself , shall be humbled . And whoever has humbled himself , shall be exalted .
40023013	So then : Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , you hypocrites ! For you close the kingdom of heaven before men . For you yourselves do not enter , and those who are entering , you would not permit to enter .
40023014	Woe to you scribes and Pharisees , you hypocrites ! For you consume the houses of widows , praying long prayers . Because of this , you shall receive the greater judgment .
40023015	Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , you hypocrites ! For you travel around by sea and by land , in order to make one convert . And when he has been converted , you make him twice the son of Hell that you are yourselves .
40023016	Woe to you , blind guides , who say : ‘ Whoever will have sworn by the temple , it is nothing . But whoever will have sworn by the gold of the temple is obligated . ’
40023017	You are foolish and blind ! For which is greater : the gold , or the temple that sanctifies the gold ?
40023018	And you say : ‘ Whoever will have sworn by the altar , it is nothing . But whoever will have sworn by the gift that is on the altar is obligated . ’
40023019	How blind you are ! For which is greater : the gift , or the altar that sanctifies the gift ?
40023020	Therefore , whoever swears by the altar , swears by it , and by all that is on it .
40023021	And whoever will have sworn by the temple , swears by it , and by him who dwells in it .
40023022	And whoever swears by heaven , swears by the throne of God , and by him who sits upon it .
40023023	Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , you hypocrites ! For you collect tithes on mint and dill and cumin , but you have abandoned the weightier things of the law : judgment and mercy and faith . These you ought to have done , while not omitting the others .
40023024	You blind guides , straining out a gnat , while swallowing a camel !
40023025	Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , you hypocrites ! For you clean what is outside the cup and the dish , but on the inside you are full of avarice and impurity .
40023026	You blind Pharisee ! First clean the inside of the cup and the dish , and then what is outside becomes clean .
40023027	Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , you hypocrites ! For you are like whitewashed sepulchers , which outwardly appear brilliant to men , yet truly , inside , they are filled with the bones of the dead and with all filth .
40023028	So also , you certainly appear to men outwardly to be just . But inwardly you are filled with hypocrisy and iniquity .
40023029	Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , you hypocrites , who build the sepulchers of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the just .
40023030	And then you say , ‘ If we had been there in the days of our fathers , we would not have joined with them in the blood of the prophets . ’
40023031	And so you are witnesses against yourselves , that you are the sons of those who killed the prophets .
40023032	Complete , then , the measure of your fathers .
40023033	You serpents , you brood of vipers ! How will you escape from the judgment of Hell ?
40023034	For this reason , behold , I send to you prophets and wisemen , and scribes . And some of these you will put to death and crucify ; and some you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city ,
40023035	so that upon you may fall all the blood of the just , which has been shed upon the earth , from the blood of Abel the just , even to the blood of Zechariah the son of Barachiah , whom you killed between the temple and the altar .
40023036	Amen I say to you , all these things shall fall upon this generation .
40023037	Jerusalem , Jerusalem ! You kill the prophets and stone those who have been sent to you . How often I have wanted to gather your children together , in the way that a hen gathers her young under her wings . But you were not willing !
40023038	Behold , your house shall be abandoned to you , having been deserted .
40023039	For I say to you , you shall not see me again , until you say : ‘ Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord . ’ ”
40024001	And Jesus departed from the temple and went away . And his disciples approached him , so as to show him the buildings of the temple .
40024002	But he said to them in response : “ Do you see all these things ? Amen I say to you , there shall not remain here stone upon stone , which is not torn down . ”
40024003	Then , when he was seated at the Mount of Olives , the disciples drew near to him privately , saying : “ Tell us , when will these things be ? And what will be the sign of your advent and of the consummation of the age ? ”
40024004	And answering , Jesus said to them : “ Pay attention , lest someone lead you astray .
40024005	For many will come in my name saying , ‘ I am the Christ . ’ And they will lead many astray .
40024006	For you will hear of battles and rumors of battles . Take care not to be disturbed . For these things must be , but the end is not so soon .
40024007	For nation will rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom . And there will be pestilences , and famines , and earthquakes in places .
40024008	But all these things are just the beginning of the sorrows .
40024009	Then they will hand you over to tribulation , and they will kill you . And you will be hated by all nations for the sake of my name .
40024010	And then many will be led into sin , and will betray one another , and will have hatred for one another .
40024011	And many false prophets will arise , and they will lead many astray .
40024012	And because iniquity has abounded , the charity of many will grow cold .
40024013	But whoever will have persevered until the end , the same shall be saved .
40024014	And this Gospel of the kingdom shall be preached throughout the entire world , as a testimony to all nations . And then the consummation will occur .
40024015	Therefore , when you will have seen the abomination of desolation , which was spoken of by the prophet Daniel , standing in the holy place , may he who reads understand ,
40024016	then those who are in Judea , let them flee to the mountains .
40024017	And whoever is on the roof , let him not descend to take anything from his house .
40024018	And whoever is in the field , let him not turn back to take his tunic .
40024019	So then , woe to those who are pregnant or nursing in those days .
40024020	But pray that your flight may not be in winter , or on the Sabbath .
40024021	For then there will be a great tribulation , such as has not been from the beginning of the world until the present , and such as will not be .
40024022	And unless those days had been shortened , no flesh would be saved . But for the sake of the elect , those days shall be shortened .
40024023	Then if anyone will have said to you , ‘ Behold , here is the Christ , ’ or ‘ he is there , ’ do not be willing to believe it .
40024024	For there will arise false Christs and false prophets . And they will produce great signs and wonders , so much so as to lead into error even the elect ( if this could be ) .
40024025	Behold , I have warned you beforehand .
40024026	Therefore , if they will have said to you , ‘ Behold , he is in the desert , ’ do not choose to go out , or , ‘ Behold , he is in the inner rooms , ’ do not be willing to believe it .
40024027	For just as lightning goes out from the east , and appears even in the west , so shall it be also at the advent of the Son of man .
40024028	Wherever the body shall be , there also will the eagles be gathered together .
40024029	And immediately after the tribulation of those days , the sun will be darkened , and the moon will not give its light , and the stars will fall from heaven , and the powers of the heavens will be shaken .
40024030	And then the sign of the Son of man shall appear in heaven . And then all tribes of the earth shall mourn . And they shall see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven , with great power and majesty .
40024031	And he shall send out his Angels with a trumpet and a great voice . And they shall gather together his elect from the four winds , from the heights of the heavens , even to their furthest limits .
40024032	So , from the fig tree learn a parable . When its branch has now become tender and the leaves have sprung forth , you know that summer is near .
40024033	So also , when you will have seen all these things , know that it is near , even at the threshold .
40024034	Amen I say to you , that this lineage shall not pass away , until all these things have been done .
40024035	Heaven and earth shall pass away , but my words shall not pass away .
40024036	But concerning that day and hour , no one knows , not even the Angels of the heavens , but only the Father .
40024037	And just as in the days of Noah , so also will be the advent of the Son of man .
40024038	For it will be just as it was in the days before the flood : eating and drinking , marrying and being given in marriage , even until that day when Noah entered into the ark .
40024039	And they did not realize it , until the flood came and took them all away . So also will the advent of the Son of man be .
40024040	Then two men will be in a field : one will be taken up , and one will be left behind .
40024041	Two women will be grinding at a millstone : one will be taken up , and one will be left behind .
40024042	Therefore , be vigilant . For you do not know at what hour your Lord will return .
40024043	But know this : if only the father of the family knew at what hour the thief would arrive , he would certainly keep vigil and not permit his house to be broken into .
40024044	For this reason , you also must be prepared , for you do not know at what hour the Son of man will return .
40024045	Consider this : who is a faithful and prudent servant , who has been appointed by his lord over his family , to give them their portion in due time ?
40024046	Blessed is that servant , if , when his lord has arrived , he shall find him doing so .
40024047	Amen I say to you , he shall appoint him over all of his goods .
40024048	But if that evil servant has said in his heart , ‘ My lord has been delayed in returning , ’
40024049	and so , he begins to strike his fellow servants , and he eats and drinks with the inebriated :
40024050	then the lord of that servant will arrive on a day that he does not expect , and at an hour that he does not know .
40024051	And he shall separate him , and he shall place his portion with the hypocrites , where there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth . ”
40025001	“ Then the kingdom of heaven shall be like ten virgins , who , taking their lamps , went out to meet the groom and the bride .
40025002	But five of them were foolish , and five were prudent .
40025003	For the five foolish , having brought their lamps , did not take oil with them .
40025004	Yet truly , the prudent ones brought the oil , in their containers , with the lamps .
40025005	Since the bridegroom was delayed , they all fell asleep , and they were sleeping .
40025006	But in the middle of the night , a cry went out : ‘ Behold , the groom is arriving . Go out to meet him . ’
40025007	Then all those virgins rose up and trimmed their lamps .
40025008	But the foolish ones said to the wise , ‘ Give to us from your oil , for our lamps are being extinguished . ’
40025009	The prudent responded by saying , ‘ Lest perhaps there may not be enough for us and for you , it would be better for you to go to the vendors and buy some for yourselves . ’
40025010	But while they were going to buy it , the groom arrived . And those who were prepared entered with him to the wedding , and the door was closed .
40025011	Yet truly , at the very end , the remaining virgins also arrived , saying , ‘ Lord , Lord , open to us . ’
40025012	But he responded by saying , ‘ Amen I say to you , I do not know you . ’
40025013	And so you must be vigilant , because you do not know the day or the hour .
40025014	For it is like a man setting out on a long journey , who called his servants and delivered to them his goods .
40025015	And to one he gave five talents , and to another two , yet to another he gave one , to each according to his own ability . And promptly , he set out .
40025016	Then he who had received five talents went out , and he made use of these , and he gained another five .
40025017	And similarly , he who had received two gained another two .
40025018	But he who had received one , going out , dug into the earth , and he hid the money of his lord .
40025019	Yet truly , after a long time , the lord of those servants returned and he settled accounts with them .
40025020	And when he who had received five talents approached , he brought another five talents , saying : ‘ Lord , you delivered five talents to me . Behold , I have increased it by another five . ’
40025021	His lord said to him : ‘ Well done , good and faithful servant . Since you have been faithful over a few things , I will appoint you over many things . Enter into the gladness of your lord . ’
40025022	Then he who had received two talents also approached , and he said : ‘ Lord , you delivered two talents to me . Behold , I have gained another two . ’
40025023	His lord said to him : ‘ Well done , good and faithful servant . Since you have been faithful over a few things , I will appoint you over many things . Enter into the gladness of your lord . ’
40025024	Then he who had received one talent , approaching , said : ‘ Lord , I know that you are a hard man . You reap where you have not sown , and gather where you have not scattered .
40025025	And so , being afraid , I went out and hid your talent in the earth . Behold , you have what is yours . ’
40025026	But his lord said to him in response : ‘ You evil and lazy servant ! You knew that I reap where I have not sown , and gather where I have not scattered .
40025027	Therefore , you should have deposited my money with the bankers , and then , at my arrival , at least I would have received what is mine with interest .
40025028	And so , take the talent away from him and give it the one who has ten talents .
40025029	For to everyone who has , more shall be given , and he shall have in abundance . But from him who has not , even what he seems to have , shall be taken away .
40025030	And cast that useless servant into the outer darkness , where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth . ’
40025031	But when the Son of man will have arrived in his majesty , and all the Angels with him , then he will sit upon the seat of his majesty .
40025032	And all the nations shall be gathered together before him . And he shall separate them from one another , just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats .
40025033	And he shall station the sheep , indeed , on his right , but the goats on his left .
40025034	Then the King shall say to those who will be on his right : ‘ Come , you blessed of my Father . Possess the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world .
40025035	For I was hungry , and you gave me to eat ; I was thirsty , and you gave me to drink ; I was a stranger , and you took me in ;
40025036	naked , and you covered me ; sick , and you visited me ; I was in prison , and you came to me . ’
40025037	Then the just will answer him , saying : ‘ Lord , when have we see you hungry , and fed you ; thirsty , and given you drink ?
40025038	And when have we seen you a stranger , and taken you in ? Or naked , and covered you ?
40025039	Or when did we see you sick , or in prison , and visit to you ? ’
40025040	And in response , the King shall say to them , ‘ Amen I say to you , whenever you did this for one of these , the least of my brothers , you did it for me . ’
40025041	Then he shall also say , to those who will be on his left : ‘ Depart from me , you accursed ones , into the eternal fire , which was prepared for the devil and his angels .
40025042	For I was hungry , and you did not give me to eat ; I was thirsty , and you did not give me to drink ;
40025043	I was a stranger and you did not take me in ; naked , and you did not cover me ; sick and in prison , and you did not visit me . ’
40025044	Then they will also answer him , saying : ‘ Lord , when did we see you hungry , or thirsty , or a stranger , or naked , or sick , or in prison , and did not minister to you ? ’
40025045	Then he shall respond to them by saying : ‘ Amen I say to you , whenever you did not do it to one of these least , neither did you do it to me . ’
40025046	And these shall go into eternal punishment , but the just shall go into eternal life . ”
40026001	And it happened that , when Jesus had completed all these words , he said to his disciples ,
40026002	“ You know that after two days the Passover will begin , and the Son of man will be handed over to be crucified . ”
40026003	Then the leaders of the priests and the elders of the people were gathered together in the court of the high priest , who was called Caiaphas .
40026004	And they took counsel so that by deceitfulness they might take hold of Jesus and kill him .
40026005	But they said , “ Not on the feast day , lest perhaps there may be a tumult among the people . ”
40026006	And when Jesus was in Bethania , in the house of Simon the leper ,
40026007	a woman drew near to him , holding an alabaster box of precious ointment , and she poured it over his head while he was reclining at table .
40026008	But the disciples , seeing this , were indignant , saying : “ What is the purpose of this waste ?
40026009	For this could have been sold for a great deal , so as to be given to the poor . ”
40026010	But Jesus , knowing this , said to them : “ Why are you bothering this woman ? For she has done a good deed to me .
40026011	For the poor you will always have with you . But you will not always have me .
40026012	For in pouring this ointment on my body , she has prepared for my burial .
40026013	Amen I say to you , wherever this Gospel will be preached in the whole world , what she has done also shall be told , in memory of her . ”
40026014	Then one of the twelve , who was called Judas Iscariot , went to the leaders of the priests ,
40026015	and he said to them , “ What are you willing to give me , if I hand him over to you ? ” So they appointed thirty pieces of silver for him .
40026016	And from then on , he sought an opportunity to betray him .
40026017	Then , on the first day of Unleavened Bread , the disciples approached Jesus , saying , “ Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover ? ”
40026018	So Jesus said , “ Go into the city , to a certain one , and say to him : ‘ The Teacher said : My time is near . I am observing the Passover with you , along with my disciples . ’ ”
40026019	And the disciples did just as Jesus appointed to them . And they prepared the Passover .
40026020	Then , when evening arrived , he sat at table with his twelve disciples .
40026021	And while they were eating , he said : “ Amen I say to you , that one of you is about to betray me . ”
40026022	And being greatly saddened , each one of them began to say , “ Surely , it is not I , Lord ? ”
40026023	But he responded by saying : “ He who dips his hand with me into the dish , the same will betray me .
40026024	Indeed , the Son of man goes , just as it has been written about him . But woe to that man by whom the Son of man will be betrayed . It would be better for that man if he had not been born . ”
40026025	Then Judas , who betrayed him , responded by saying , “ Surely , it is not I , Master ? ” He said to him , “ You have said it . ”
40026026	Now while they were eating the meal , Jesus took bread , and he blessed and broke and gave it to his disciples , and he said : “ Take and eat . This is my body . ”
40026027	And taking the chalice , he gave thanks . And he gave it to them , saying : “ Drink from this , all of you .
40026028	For this is my blood of the new covenant , which shall be shed for many as a remission of sins .
40026029	But I say to you , I will not drink again from this fruit of the vine , until that day when I will drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father . ”
40026030	And after a hymn was sung , they went out to the Mount of Olives .
40026031	Then Jesus said to them : “ You will all fall away from me in this night . For it has been written : ‘ I will strike the shepherd , and the sheep of the flock will be scattered . ’
40026032	But after I have risen again , I will go before you to Galilee . ”
40026033	Then Peter responded by saying to him , “ Even if everyone else has fallen away from you , I will never fall away . ”
40026034	Jesus said to him , “ Amen I say to you , that in this night , before the rooster crows , you will deny me three times . ”
40026035	Peter said to him , “ Even if it is necessary for me to die with you , I will not deny you . ” And all the disciples spoke similarly .
40026036	Then Jesus went with them to a garden , which is called Gethsemani . And he said to his disciples , “ Sit down here , while I go there and pray . ”
40026037	And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee , he began to be sorrowful and saddened .
40026038	Then he said to them : “ My soul is sorrowful , even unto death . Stay here and keep vigil with me . ”
40026039	And continuing on a little further , he fell prostrate on his face , praying and saying : “ My Father , if it is possible , let this chalice pass away from me . Yet truly , let it not be as I will , but as you will . ”
40026040	And he approached his disciples and found them sleeping . And he said to Peter : “ So , were you not able to keep vigil with me for one hour ?
40026041	Be vigilant and pray , so that you may not enter into temptation . Indeed , the spirit is willing , but the flesh is weak . ”
40026042	Again , a second time , he went and prayed , saying , “ My Father , if this chalice cannot pass away , unless I drink it , let your will be done . ”
40026043	And again , he went and found them sleeping , for their eyes were heavy .
40026044	And leaving them behind , again he went and prayed for the third time , saying the same words .
40026045	Then he approached his disciples and said to them : “ Sleep now and rest . Behold , the hour has drawn near , and the Son of man will be delivered into the hands of sinners .
40026046	Rise up ; let us go . Behold , he who will betray me draws near . ”
40026047	While he was still speaking , behold , Judas , one of the twelve , arrived , and with him was a large crowd with swords and clubs , sent from the leaders of the priests and the elders of the people .
40026048	And he who betrayed him gave them a sign , saying : “ Whomever I will kiss , it is he . Take hold of him . ”
40026049	And quickly drawing close to Jesus , he said , “ Hail , Master . ” And he kissed him .
40026050	And Jesus said to him , “ Friend , for what purpose have you come ? ” Then they approached , and they put their hands on Jesus , and they held him .
40026051	And behold , one of those who were with Jesus , extending his hand , drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest , cutting off his ear .
40026052	Then Jesus said to him : “ Put your sword back in its place . For all who take up the sword shall perish by the sword .
40026053	Or do you think that I cannot ask my Father , so that he would give me , even now , more than twelve legions of Angels ?
40026054	How then would the Scriptures be fulfilled , which say that it must be so ? ”
40026055	In that same hour , Jesus said to the crowds : “ You went out , as if to a robber , with swords and clubs to seize me . Yet I sat daily with you , teaching in the temple , and you did not take hold of me .
40026056	But all this has happened so that the Scriptures of the prophets may be fulfilled . ” Then all the disciples fled , abandoning him .
40026057	But those who were holding Jesus led him to Caiaphas , the high priest , where the scribes and the elders had joined together .
40026058	Then Peter followed him from a distance , as far as the court of the high priest . And going inside , he sat down with the servants , so that he might see the end .
40026059	Then the leaders of the priests and the entire council sought false testimony against Jesus , so that they might deliver him to death .
40026060	And they did not find any , even though many false witnesses had come forward . Then , at the very end , two false witnesses came forward ,
40026061	and they said , “ This man said : ‘ I am able to destroy the temple of God , and , after three days , to rebuild it . ’ ”
40026062	And the high priest , rising up , said to him , “ Have you nothing to respond to what these ones testify against you ? ”
40026063	But Jesus was silent . And the high priest said to him , “ I bind you by an oath to the living God to tell us if you are the Christ , the Son of God . ”
40026064	Jesus said to him : “ You have said it . Yet truly I say to you , hereafter you shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of the power of God , and coming on the clouds of heaven . ”
40026065	Then the high priest tore his garments , saying : “ He has blasphemed . Why do we still need witnesses ? Behold , you have now heard the blasphemy .
40026066	How does it seem to you ? ” So they responded by saying , “ He is guilty unto death . ”
40026067	Then they spit in his face , and they struck him with fists . And others struck his face with the palms of their hands ,
40026068	saying : “ Prophesy for us , O Christ . Who is the one that struck you ? ”
40026069	Yet truly , Peter sat outside in the courtyard . And a maidservant approached him , saying , “ You also were with Jesus the Galilean . ”
40026070	But he denied it in the sight of them all , saying , “ I do not know what you are saying . ”
40026071	Then , as he exited by the gate , another maidservant saw him . And she said to those who were there , “ This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth . ”
40026072	And again , he denied it with an oath , “ For I do not know the man . ”
40026073	And after a little while , those who were standing nearby came and said to Peter : “ Truly , you also are one of them . For even your manner of speaking reveals you . ”
40026074	Then he began to curse and to swear that he had not known the man . And immediately the rooster crowed .
40026075	And Peter remembered the words of Jesus , which he had said : “ Before the rooster crows , you will deny me three times . ” And going outside , he wept bitterly .
40027001	Then , when morning arrived , all the leaders of the priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus , so that they might deliver him to death .
40027002	And they led him , bound , and handed him over to Pontius Pilate , the procurator .
40027003	Then Judas , who betrayed him , seeing that he had been condemned , regretting his conduct , brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the leaders of the priests and the elders ,
40027004	saying , “ I have sinned in betraying just blood . ” But they said to him : “ What is that to us ? See to it yourself . ”
40027005	And throwing down the pieces of silver in the temple , he departed . And going out , he hanged himself with a snare .
40027006	But the leaders of the priests , having taken up the pieces of silver , said , “ It is not lawful to put them into the temple offerings , because it is the price of blood . ”
40027007	Then , having taken counsel , they bought the potter’s field with it , as a burying place for sojourners .
40027008	For this reason , that field is called Haceldama , that is , ‘ The Field of Blood , ’ even to this very day .
40027009	Then what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled , saying , “ And they took the thirty pieces of silver , the price of the one being appraised , whom they appraised before the sons of Israel ,
40027010	and they gave it for the potter’s field , just as the Lord appointed to me . ”
40027011	Now Jesus stood before the procurator , and the procurator questioned him , saying , “ You are the king of the Jews ? ” Jesus said to him , “ You are saying so . ”
40027012	And when he was accused by the leaders of the priests and the elders , he responded nothing .
40027013	Then Pilate said to him , “ Do you not hear how much testimony they speak against you ? ”
40027014	And he did not respond any word to him , so that the procurator wondered greatly .
40027015	Now on the solemn day , the procurator was accustomed to release to the people one prisoner , whomever they wished .
40027016	And at that time , he had a notorious prisoner , who was called Barabbas .
40027017	Therefore , having been gathered together , Pilate said to them , “ Who is it that you want me to release to you : Barabbas , or Jesus , who is called Christ ? ”
40027018	For he knew that it was out of envy they had handed him over .
40027019	But as he was sitting in the place for the tribunal , his wife sent to him , saying : “ It is nothing to you , and he is just . For I have experienced many things today through a vision for his sake . ”
40027020	But the leaders of the priests and the elders persuaded the people , so that they would ask for Barabbas , and so that Jesus would perish .
40027021	Then , in response , the procurator said to them , “ Which of the two do you want to be released to you ? ” But they said to him , “ Barabbas . ”
40027022	Pilate said to them , “ Then what shall I do about Jesus , who is called Christ ? ” They all said , “ Let him be crucified . ”
40027023	The procurator said to them , “ But what evil has he done ? ” But they cried out all the more , saying , “ Let him be crucified . ”
40027024	Then Pilate , seeing that he was able to accomplish nothing , but that a greater tumult was occurring , taking water , washed his hands in the sight of the people , saying : “ I am innocent of the blood of this just man . See to it yourselves . ”
40027025	And the entire people responded by saying , “ May his blood be upon us and upon our children . ”
40027026	Then he released Barabbas to them . But Jesus , having been scourged , he handed over to them , so that he would be crucified .
40027027	Then the soldiers of the procurator , taking Jesus up to the praetorium , gathered the entire cohort around him .
40027028	And stripping him , they put a scarlet cloak around him .
40027029	And plaiting a crown of thorns , they placed it on his head , with a reed in his right hand . And genuflecting before him , they mocked him , saying , “ Hail , King of the Jews . ”
40027030	And spitting on him , they took the reed and struck his head .
40027031	And after they had mocked him , they stripped him of the cloak , and clothed him with his own garments , and they led him away to crucify him .
40027032	But as they were going out , they came upon a man of Cyrene , named Simon , whom they compelled to take up his cross .
40027033	And they arrived at the place which is called Golgotha , which is the place of Calvary .
40027034	And they gave him wine to drink , mixed with gall . And when he had tasted it , he refused to drink it .
40027035	Then , after they had crucified him , they divided his garments , casting lots , in order to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet , saying : “ They divided my garments among them , and over my vestment they cast lots . ”
40027036	And sitting down , they observed him .
40027037	And they set his accusation above his head , written as : THIS IS JESUS , KING OF THE JEWS .
40027038	Then two robbers were crucified with him : one on the right and one on the left .
40027039	But those passing by blasphemed him , shaking their heads ,
40027040	and saying : “ Ah , so you would destroy the temple of God and in three days rebuild it ! Save your own self . If you are the Son of God , descend from the cross . ”
40027041	And similarly , the leaders of the priests , with the scribes and the elders , mocking him , said :
40027042	“ He saved others ; he cannot save himself . If he is the King of Israel , let him descend now from the cross , and we will believe in him .
40027043	He trusted in God ; so now , let God free him , if he wills him . For he said , ‘ I am the Son of God . ’ ”
40027044	Then , the robbers who were crucified with him also reproached him with the very same thing .
40027045	Now from the sixth hour , there was darkness over the entire earth , even until the ninth hour .
40027046	And about the ninth hour , Jesus cried out with a loud voice , saying : “ Eli , Eli , lamma sabacthani ? ” that is , “ My God , My God , why have you forsaken me ? ”
40027047	Then certain ones who were standing and listening there said , “ This man calls upon Elijah . ”
40027048	And one of them , running quickly , took a sponge and filled it with vinegar , and he set it on a reed and he gave it to him to drink .
40027049	Yet truly , the others said , “ Wait . Let us see whether Elijah will come to free him . ”
40027050	Then Jesus , crying out again with a loud voice , gave up his life .
40027051	And behold , the veil of the temple was torn into two parts , from top to bottom . And the earth was shaken , and the rocks were split apart .
40027052	And the tombs were opened . And many bodies of the saints , which had been sleeping , arose .
40027053	And going out from the tombs , after his resurrection , they went into the holy city , and they appeared to many .
40027054	Now the centurion and those who were with him , guarding Jesus , having seen the earthquake and the things that were done , were very fearful , saying : “ Truly , this was the Son of God . ”
40027055	And in that place , there were many women , at a distance , who had followed Jesus from Galilee , ministering to him .
40027056	Among these were Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Joseph , and the mother of the sons of Zebedee .
40027057	Then , when evening had arrived , a certain wealthy man from Arimathea , named Joseph , arrived , who himself was also a disciple of Jesus .
40027058	This man approached Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus . Then Pilate ordered the body to be released .
40027059	And Joseph , taking the body , wrapped it in a clean finely-woven linen cloth ,
40027060	and he placed it in his own new tomb , which he had hewn out of a rock . And he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb , and he went away .
40027061	Now Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there , sitting opposite the sepulcher .
40027062	Then the next day , which is after the Preparation day , the leaders of the priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate together ,
40027063	saying : “ Lord , we have remembered that that this seducer said , while he was still alive , ‘ After three days , I will rise again . ’
40027064	Therefore , order the sepulcher to be guarded until the third day , lest perhaps his disciples may come and steal him , and say to the people , ‘ He has risen from the dead . ’ And this last error would be worse than the first . ”
40027065	Pilate said to them : “ You have a guard . Go , guard it as you know how . ”
40027066	Then , going out , they secured the sepulcher with guards , sealing the stone .
40028001	Now on the morning of the Sabbath , when it began to grow light on the first Sabbath , Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the sepulcher .
40028002	And behold , a great earthquake occurred . For an Angel of the Lord descended from heaven , and as he approached , he rolled back the stone and sat down on it .
40028003	Now his appearance was like lightning , and his vestment was like snow .
40028004	Then , out of fear of him , the guards were terrified , and they became like dead men .
40028005	Then the Angel responded by saying to the women : “ Do not be afraid . For I know that you are seeking Jesus , who was crucified .
40028006	He is not here . For he has risen , just as he said . Come and see the place where the Lord was placed .
40028007	And then , go quickly , and tell his disciples that he has risen . And behold , he will precede you to Galilee . There you shall see him . Lo , I have told you beforehand . ”
40028008	And they went out of the tomb quickly , with fear and in great joy , running to announce it to his disciples .
40028009	And behold , Jesus met them , saying , “ Hail . ” But they drew near and took hold of his feet , and they adored him .
40028010	Then Jesus said to them : “ Do not be afraid . Go , announce it to my brothers , so that they may go to Galilee . There they shall see me . ”
40028011	And when they had departed , behold , some of the guards went into the city , and they reported to the leaders of the priests all that had happened .
40028012	And gathering together with the elders , having taken counsel , they gave an abundant sum of money to the soldiers ,
40028013	saying : “ Say that his disciples arrived at night and stole him away , while we were sleeping .
40028014	And if the procurator hears about this , we will persuade him , and we will protect you . ”
40028015	Then , having accepted the money , they did as they were instructed . And this word has been spread among the Jews , even to this day .
40028016	Now the eleven disciples went on to Galilee , to the mountain where Jesus had appointed them .
40028017	And , seeing him , they worshipped him , but certain ones doubted .
40028018	And Jesus , drawing near , spoke to them , saying : “ All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth .
40028019	Therefore , go forth and teach all nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit ,
40028020	teaching them to observe all that I have ever commanded you . And behold , I am with you always , even to the consummation of the age . ”
41001001	The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ , the Son of God .
41001002	As it has been written by the prophet Isaiah : “ Behold , I send my Angel before your face , who shall prepare your way before you .
41001003	The voice of one crying out in the desert : Prepare the way of the Lord ; make straight his paths . ”
41001004	John was in the desert , baptizing and preaching a baptism of repentance , as a remission of sins .
41001005	And there went out to him all the region of Judea and all those of Jerusalem , and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan , confessing their sins .
41001006	And John was clothed with camel’s hair and with a leather belt around his waist . And he ate locusts and wild honey .
41001007	And he preached , saying : “ One stronger than me comes after me . I am not worthy to reach down and loosen the laces of his shoes .
41001008	I have baptized you with water . Yet truly , he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit . ”
41001009	And it happened that , in those days , Jesus arrived from Nazareth of Galilee . And he was baptized by John in the Jordan .
41001010	And immediately , upon ascending from the water , he saw the heavens opened and the Spirit , like a dove , descending , and remaining with him .
41001011	And there was a voice from heaven : “ You are my beloved Son ; in you I am well pleased . ”
41001012	And immediately the Spirit prompted him into the desert .
41001013	And he was in the desert for forty days and forty nights . And he was tempted by Satan . And he was with the wild animals , and the Angels ministered to him .
41001014	Then , after John was handed over , Jesus went into Galilee , preaching the Gospel of the kingdom of God ,
41001015	and saying : “ For the time has been fulfilled and the kingdom of God has drawn near . Repent and believe in the Gospel . ”
41001016	And passing by the shore of the Sea of Galilee , he saw Simon and his brother Andrew , casting nets into the sea , for they were fishermen .
41001017	And Jesus said to them , “ Come after me , and I will make you fishers of men . ”
41001018	And at once abandoning their nets , they followed him .
41001019	And continuing on a little ways from there , he saw James of Zebedee and his brother John , and they were mending their nets in a boat .
41001020	And immediately he called them . And leaving behind their father Zebedee in the boat with his hired hands , they followed him .
41001021	And they entered into Capernaum . And entering into the synagogue promptly on the Sabbaths , he taught them .
41001022	And they were astonished over his doctrine . For he was teaching them as one who has authority , and not like the scribes .
41001023	And in their synagogue , there was a man with an unclean spirit ; and he cried out ,
41001024	saying : “ What are we to you , Jesus of Nazareth ? Have you come to destroy us ? I know who you are : the Holy One of God . ”
41001025	And Jesus admonished him , saying , “ Be silent , and depart from the man . ”
41001026	And the unclean spirit , convulsing him and crying out with a loud voice , departed from him .
41001027	And they were all so amazed that they inquired among themselves , saying : “ What is this ? And what is this new doctrine ? For with authority he commands even the unclean spirits , and they obey him . ”
41001028	And his fame went out quickly , throughout the entire region of Galilee .
41001029	And soon after departing from the synagogue , they went into the house of Simon and Andrew , with James and John .
41001030	But the mother-in-law of Simon lay ill with a fever . And at once they told him about her .
41001031	And drawing near to her , he raised her up , taking her by the hand . And immediately the fever left her , and she ministered to them .
41001032	Then , when evening arrived , after the sun had set , they brought to him all who had maladies and those who had demons .
41001033	And the entire city was gathered together at the door .
41001034	And he healed many who were troubled with various illnesses . And he cast out many demons , but he would not permit them to speak , because they knew him .
41001035	And rising up very early , departing , he went out to a deserted place , and there he prayed .
41001036	And Simon , and those who were with him , followed after him .
41001037	And when they had found him , they said to him , “ For everyone is seeking you . ”
41001038	And he said to them : “ Let us go into the neighboring towns and cities , so that I may preach there also . Indeed , it was for this reason that I came . ”
41001039	And he was preaching in their synagogues and throughout all of Galilee , and casting out demons .
41001040	And a leper came to him , begging him . And kneeling down , he said to him , “ If you are willing , you are able to cleanse me . ”
41001041	Then Jesus , taking pity on him , reached out his hand . And touching him , he said to him : “ I am willing . Be cleansed . ”
41001042	And after he had spoken , immediately the leprosy departed from him , and he was cleansed .
41001043	And he admonished him , and he promptly sent him away .
41001044	And he said to him : “ See to it that you tell no one . But go and show yourself to the high priest , and offer for your cleansing that which Moses instructed , as a testimony for them . ”
41001045	But having departed , he began to preach and to disseminate the word , so that he was no longer able to openly enter a city , but had to remain outside , in deserted places . And they were gathered to him from every direction .
41002001	And after some days , he again entered into Capernaum .
41002002	And it was heard that he was in the house . And so many gathered that there was no room left , not even at the door . And he spoke the word to them .
41002003	And they came to him , bringing a paralytic , who was being carried by four men .
41002004	And when they were not able to present him to him because of the crowd , they uncovered the roof where he was . And opening it , they lowered down the stretcher on which the paralytic was lying .
41002005	Then , when Jesus had seen their faith , he said to the paralytic , “ Son , your sins are forgiven you . ”
41002006	But some of the scribes were sitting in that place and thinking in their hearts :
41002007	“ Why is this man speaking in this way ? He is blaspheming . Who can forgive sins , but God alone ? ”
41002008	At once , Jesus , realizing in his spirit that they were thinking this within themselves , said to them : “ Why are you thinking these things in your hearts ?
41002009	Which is easier , to say to the paralytic , ‘ Your sins are forgiven you , ’ or to say , ‘ Rise up , take up your stretcher , and walk ? ’
41002010	But so that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins , ” he said to the paralytic :
41002011	“ I say to you : Rise up , take up your stretcher , and go into your house . ”
41002012	And immediately he got up , and lifting up his stretcher , he went away in the sight of them all , so that they all wondered . And they honored God , by saying , “ We have never seen anything like this . ”
41002013	And he departed again to the sea . And the entire crowd came to him , and he taught them .
41002014	And as he was passing by , he saw Levi of Alphaeus , sitting at the customs office . And he said to him , “ Follow me . ” And rising up , he followed him .
41002015	And it happened that , as he sat at table in his house , many tax collectors and sinners sat at table together with Jesus and his disciples . For those who followed him were many .
41002016	And the scribes and the Pharisees , seeing that he ate with tax collectors and sinners , said to his disciples , “ Why does your Teacher eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners ? ”
41002017	Jesus , having heard this , said to them : “ The healthy have no need of a doctor , but those who have maladies do . For I came not to call the just , but sinners . ”
41002018	And the disciples of John , and the Pharisees , were fasting . And they arrived and said to him , “ Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast , but your disciples do not fast ? ”
41002019	And Jesus said to them : “ How can the sons of the wedding fast while the groom is still with them ? During whatever time they have the groom with them , they are not able to fast .
41002020	But the days will arrive when the groom will be taken away from them , and then they shall fast , in those days .
41002021	No one sews a patch of new cloth onto an old garment . Otherwise , the new addition pulls away from the old , and the tear becomes worse .
41002022	And no one puts new wine into old wineskins . Otherwise , the wine will burst the wineskins , and the wine will pour out , and the wineskins will be lost . Instead , new wine must be put into new wineskins . ”
41002023	And again , while the Lord was walking through the ripe grain on the Sabbath , his disciples , as they advanced , began to separate the ears of grains .
41002024	But the Pharisees said to him , “ Behold , why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbaths ? ”
41002025	And he said to them : “ Have you never read what David did , when he had need and was hungry , both he and those who were with him ?
41002026	How he went into the house of God , under the high priest Abiathar , and ate the bread of the Presence , which it was not lawful to eat , except for the priests , and how he gave it to those who were with him ? ”
41002027	And he said to them : “ The Sabbath was made for man , and not man for the Sabbath .
41002028	And so , the Son of man is Lord , even of the Sabbath . ”
41003001	And again , he entered into the synagogue . And there was a man there who had a withered hand .
41003002	And they observed him , to see if he would cure on the Sabbaths , so that they might accuse him .
41003003	And he said to the man who had the withered hand , “ Stand up in the middle . ”
41003004	And he said to them : “ Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbaths , or to do evil , to give health to a life , or to destroy ? ” But they remained silent .
41003005	And looking around at them with anger , being very saddened over the blindness of their hearts , he said to the man , “ Extend your hand . ” And he extended it , and his hand was restored to him .
41003006	Then the Pharisees , going out , immediately took counsel with the Herodians against him , as to how they might destroy him .
41003007	But Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea . And a great crowd followed him from Galilee and Judea ,
41003008	and from Jerusalem , and from Idumea and across the Jordan . And those around Tyre and Sidon , upon hearing what he was doing , came to him in a great multitude .
41003009	And he told his disciples that a small boat would be useful to him , because of the crowd , lest they press upon him .
41003010	For he healed so many , that as many of them as had wounds would rush toward him in order to touch him .
41003011	And the unclean spirits , when they saw him , fell prostrate before him . And they cried out , saying ,
41003012	“ You are the Son of God . ” And he strongly admonished them , lest they make him known .
41003013	And ascending onto a mountain , he called to himself those whom he willed , and they came to him .
41003014	And he acted so that the twelve would be with him , and so that he might send them out to preach .
41003015	And he gave them authority to cure infirmities , and to cast out demons :
41003016	and he imposed on Simon the name Peter ;
41003017	and also he imposed on James of Zebedee , and John the brother of James , the name ‘ Boanerges , ’ that is , ‘ Sons of Thunder ; ’
41003018	and Andrew , and Philip , and Bartholomew , and Matthew , and Thomas , and James of Alphaeus , and Thaddeus , and Simon the Canaanite ,
41003019	and Judas Iscariot , who also betrayed him .
41003020	And they went to a house , and the crowd gathered together again , so much so that they were not even able to eat bread .
41003021	And when his own had heard of it , they went out to take hold of him . For they said : “ Because he has gone mad . ”
41003022	And the scribes who had descended from Jerusalem said , “ Because he has Beelzebub , and because by the prince of demons does he cast out demons . ”
41003023	And having called them together , he spoke to them in parables : “ How can Satan cast out Satan ?
41003024	For if a kingdom is divided against itself , that kingdom is not able to stand .
41003025	And if a house is divided against itself , that house is not able to stand .
41003026	And if Satan has risen up against himself , he would be divided , and he would not be able to stand ; instead he reaches the end .
41003027	No one is able to plunder the goods of a strong man , having entered into the house , unless he first binds the strong man , and then he shall plunder his house .
41003028	Amen I say to you , that all sins will be forgiven the sons of men , and the blasphemies by which they will have blasphemed .
41003029	But he who will have blasphemed against the Holy Spirit shall not have forgiveness in eternity ; instead he shall be guilty of an eternal offense . ”
41003030	For they said : “ He has an unclean spirit . ”
41003031	And his mother and brothers arrived . And standing outside , they sent to him , calling him .
41003032	And the crowd was sitting around him . And they said to him , “ Behold , your mother and your brothers are outside , seeking you . ”
41003033	And responding to them , he said , “ Who is my mother and my brothers ? ”
41003034	And looking around at those who were sitting all around him , he said : “ Behold , my mother and my brothers .
41003035	For whoever has done the will of God , the same is my brother , and my sister and mother . ”
41004001	And again , he began to teach by the sea . And a great crowd was gathered to him , so much so that , climbing into a boat , he was seated on the sea . And the entire crowd was on the land along the sea .
41004002	And he taught them many things in parables , and he said to them , in his doctrine :
41004003	“ Listen . Behold , the sower went out to sow .
41004004	And while he was sowing , some fell along the way , and the birds of the air came and ate it .
41004005	Yet truly , others fell upon stony ground , where it did not have much soil . And it rose up quickly , because it had no depth of soil .
41004006	And when the sun was risen , it was scorched . And because it had no root , it withered away .
41004007	And some fell among thorns . And the thorns grew up and suffocated it , and it did not produce fruit .
41004008	And some fell on good soil . And it brought forth fruit that grew up , and increased , and yielded : some thirty , some sixty , and some one hundred . ”
41004009	And he said , “ Whoever has ears to hear , let him hear . ”
41004010	And when he was alone , the twelve , who were with him , questioned him about the parable .
41004011	And he said to them : “ To you , it has been given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God . But to those who are outside , everything is presented in parables :
41004012	‘ so that , seeing , they may see , and not perceive ; and hearing , they may hear , and not understand ; lest at any time they may be converted , and their sins would be forgiven them . ’ ”
41004013	And he said to them : “ Do you not understand this parable ? And so , how will you understand all the parables ?
41004014	He who sows , sows the word .
41004015	Now there are those who are along the way , where the word is sown . And when they have heard it , Satan quickly comes and takes away the word , which was sown in their hearts .
41004016	And similarly , there are those who were sown upon stony ground . These , when they have heard the word , immediately accept it with gladness .
41004017	But they have no root in themselves , and so they are for a limited time . And when next tribulation and persecution arises because of the word , they quickly fall away .
41004018	And there are others who are sown among thorns . These are those who hear the word ,
41004019	but worldly tasks , and the deception of riches , and desires about other things enter in and suffocate the word , and it is effectively without fruit .
41004020	And there are those who are sown upon good soil , who hear the word and accept it ; and these bear fruit : some thirty , some sixty , and some one hundred . ”
41004021	And he said to them : “ Would someone enter with a lamp in order to place it under a basket or under a bed ? Would it not be placed upon a lampstand ?
41004022	For there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed . Neither was anything done in secret , except that it may be made public .
41004023	If anyone has ears to hear , let him hear . ”
41004024	And he said to them : “ Consider what you hear . With whatever measure you have measured out , it shall be measured back to you , and more shall be added to you .
41004025	For whoever has , to him it shall be given . And whoever has not , from him even what he has shall be taken away . ”
41004026	And he said : “ The kingdom of God is like this : it is as if a man were to cast seed on the land .
41004027	And he sleeps and he arises , night and day . And the seed germinates and grows , though he does not know it .
41004028	For the earth bears fruit readily : first the plant , then the ear , next the full grain in the ear .
41004029	And when the fruit has been produced , immediately he sends out the sickle , because the harvest has arrived . ”
41004030	And he said : “ To what should we compare the kingdom of God ? Or to what parable should we compare it ?
41004031	It is like a grain of mustard seed which , when it has been sown in the earth , is less than all the seeds which are in the earth .
41004032	And when it is sown , it grows up and becomes greater than all the plants , and it produces great branches , so much so that the birds of the air are able to live under its shadow . ”
41004033	And with many such parables he spoke the word to them , as much as they were able to hear .
41004034	But he did not speak to them without a parable . Yet separately , he explained all things to his disciples .
41004035	And on that day , when evening had arrived , he said to them , “ Let us cross over . ”
41004036	And dismissing the crowd , they brought him , so that he was in one boat , and other boats were with him .
41004037	And a great wind storm occurred , and the waves broke over the boat , so that the boat was being filled .
41004038	And he was in the stern of the boat , sleeping on a pillow . And they woke him and said to him , “ Teacher , does it not concern you that we are perishing ? ”
41004039	And rising up , he rebuked the wind , and he said to the sea : “ Silence . Be stilled . ” And the wind ceased . And a great tranquility occurred .
41004040	And he said to them : “ Why are you afraid ? Do you still lack faith ? ”
41004041	And they were struck with a great fear . And they said to one another , “ Who do you think this is , that both wind and sea obey him ? ”
41005001	And they went across the strait of the sea into the region of the Gerasenes .
41005002	And as he was departing from the boat , he was immediately met , from among the tombs , by a man with an unclean spirit ,
41005003	who had his dwelling place with the tombs ; neither had anyone been able to bind him , even with chains .
41005004	For having been bound often with shackles and chains , he had broken the chains and smashed the shackles ; and no one had been able to tame him .
41005005	And he was always , day and night , among the tombs , or in the mountains , crying out and cutting himself with stones .
41005006	And seeing Jesus from afar , he ran and adored him .
41005007	And crying out with a loud voice , he said : “ What am I to you , Jesus , the Son of the Most High God ? I beseech you by God , that you not torment me . ”
41005008	For he said to him , “ Depart from the man , you unclean spirit . ”
41005009	And he questioned him : “ What is your name ? ” And he said to him , “ My name is Legion , for we are many . ”
41005010	And he entreated him greatly , so that he would not expel him from the region .
41005011	And in that place , near the mountain , there was a great herd of swine , feeding .
41005012	And the spirits entreated him , saying : “ Send us into the swine , so that we may enter into them . ”
41005013	And Jesus promptly gave them permission . And the unclean spirits , departing , entered into the swine . And the herd of about two thousand rushed down with great force into the sea , and they were drowned in the sea .
41005014	Then those who pastured them fled , and they reported it in the city and in the countryside . And they all went out to see what was happening .
41005015	And they came to Jesus . And they saw the man who had been troubled by the demon , sitting , clothed and with a sane mind , and they were afraid .
41005016	And those who had seen it explained to them how he had dealt with the man who had the demon , and about the swine .
41005017	And they began to petition him , so that he would withdraw from their borders .
41005018	And as he was climbing into the boat , the man who had been troubled by the demons began to beg him , so that he might be with him .
41005019	And he did not permit him , but he said to him , “ Go to your own people , in your own house , and announce to them how great are the things that Lord has done for you , and how he has taken pity on you . ”
41005020	And he went away and began to preach in the Ten Cities , how great were the things that Jesus had done for him . And everyone wondered .
41005021	And when Jesus had crossed in the boat , over the strait again , a great crowd came together before him . And he was near the sea .
41005022	And one of the rulers of the synagogue , named Jairus , approached . And seeing him , he fell prostrate at his feet .
41005023	And he beseeched him greatly , saying : “ For my daughter is near the end . Come and lay your hand on her , so that she may be healthy and may live . ”
41005024	And he went with him . And a great crowd followed him , and they pressed upon him .
41005025	And there was a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years .
41005026	And she had endured much from several physicians , and she had spent everything she owned with no benefit at all , but instead she became worse .
41005027	Then , when she had heard of Jesus , she approached through the crowd behind him , and she touched his garment .
41005028	For she said : “ Because if I touch even his garment , I will be saved . ”
41005029	And immediately , the source of her bleeding was dried up , and she sensed in her body that she had been healed from the wound .
41005030	And immediately Jesus , realizing within himself that power that had gone out from him , turning to the crowd , said , “ Who touched my garments ? ”
41005031	And his disciples said to him , “ You see that the crowd presses around you , and yet you say , ‘ Who touched me ? ’ ”
41005032	And he looked around to see the woman who had done this .
41005033	Yet truly , the woman , in fear and trembling , knowing what had happened within her , went and fell prostrate before him , and she told him the whole truth .
41005034	And he said to her : “ Daughter , your faith has saved you . Go in peace , and be healed from your wound . ”
41005035	While he was still speaking , they arrived from the ruler of the synagogue , saying : “ Your daughter is dead . Why trouble the Teacher any further ? ”
41005036	But Jesus , having heard the word that was spoken , said to the ruler of the synagogue : “ Do not be afraid . You need only believe . ”
41005037	And he would not permit anyone to follow him , except Peter , and James , and John the brother of James .
41005038	And they went to the house of the ruler of the synagogue . And he saw a tumult , and weeping , and much wailing .
41005039	And entering , he said to them : “ Why are you disturbed and weeping ? The girl is not dead , but is asleep . ”
41005040	And they derided him . Yet truly , having put them all out , he took the father and mother of the girl , and those who were with him , and he entered to where the girl was lying .
41005041	And taking the girl by the hand , he said to her , “ Talitha koumi , ” which means , “ Little girl , ( I say to you ) arise .
41005042	And immediately the young girl rose up and walked . Now she was twelve years old . And they were suddenly struck with a great astonishment .
41005043	And he instructed them sternly , so that no one would know about it . And he told them to give her something to eat .
41006001	And departing from there , he went away to his own country ; and his disciples followed him .
41006002	And when the Sabbath arrived , he began to teach in the synagogue . And many , upon hearing him , were amazed at his doctrine , saying : “ Where did this one get all these things ? ” and , “ What is this wisdom , which has been given to him ? ” and , “ Such powerful deeds , which are wrought by his hands ! ”
41006003	“ Is this not the carpenter , the son of Mary , the brother of James , and Joseph , and Jude , and Simon ? Are not his sisters also here with us ? ” And they took great offense at him .
41006004	And Jesus said to them , “ A prophet is not without honor , except in his own country , and in his own house , and among his own kindred . ”
41006005	And he was not able to perform any miracles there , except that he cured a few of the infirm by laying his hands on them .
41006006	And he wondered , because of their unbelief , and he traveled around in the villages , teaching .
41006007	And he called the twelve . And he began to send them out in twos , and he gave them authority over unclean spirits .
41006008	And he instructed them not to take anything for the journey , except a staff : no traveling bag , no bread , and no money belt ,
41006009	but to wear sandals , and not to wear two tunics .
41006010	And he said to them : “ Whenever you have entered into a house , stay there until you depart from that place .
41006011	And whoever will neither receive you , nor listen to you , as you go away from there , shake off the dust from your feet as a testimony against them . ”
41006012	And going out , they were preaching , so that people would repent .
41006013	And they cast out many demons , and they anointed many of the sick with oil and healed them .
41006014	And king Herod heard of it , ( for his name had become well-known ) and he said : “ John the Baptist has risen again from the dead , and because of this , miracles are at work in him . ”
41006015	But others were saying , “ Because it is Elijah . ” Still others were saying , “ Because he is a prophet , like one of the prophets . ”
41006016	When Herod had heard it , he said , “ John whom I beheaded , the same has risen again from the dead . ”
41006017	For Herod himself had sent to capture John , and had chained him in prison , because of Herodias , the wife of his brother Philip ; for he had married her .
41006018	For John was saying to Herod , “ It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife . ”
41006019	Now Herodias was devising treachery against him ; and she wanted to kill him , but she was unable .
41006020	For Herod was apprehensive of John , knowing him to be a just and holy man , and so he guarded him . And he heard that he was accomplishing many things , and so he listened to him willingly .
41006021	And when an opportune time had arrived , Herod held a feast on his birthday , with the leaders , and the tribunes , and the first rulers of Galilee .
41006022	And when the daughter of the same Herodias had entered , and danced , and pleased Herod , along with those who were at table with him , the king said to the girl , “ Request from me whatever you want , and I will give it to you . ”
41006023	And he swore to her , “ Anything that you request , I will give to you , even up to half my kingdom . ”
41006024	And when she had gone out , she said to her mother , “ What shall I request ? ” But her mother said , “ The head of John the Baptist . ”
41006025	And immediately , when she had entered with haste to the king , she petitioned him , saying : “ I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter . ”
41006026	And the king was greatly saddened . But because of his oath , and because of those who were sitting with him at table , he was not willing to disappoint her .
41006027	So , having sent an executioner , he instructed that his head be brought on a platter .
41006028	And he beheaded him in prison , and he brought his head on a platter . And he gave it to the girl , and the girl gave it her mother .
41006029	When his disciples heard about it , they came and took his body , and they placed it in a tomb .
41006030	And the Apostles , returning to Jesus , reported to him everything that they had done and taught .
41006031	And he said to them , “ Go out alone , into a deserted place , and rest for a little while . ” For there were so many who were coming and going , that they did not even have time to eat .
41006032	And climbing into a boat , they went away to a deserted place alone .
41006033	And they saw them going away , and many knew about it . And together they ran by foot from all the cities , and they arrived before them .
41006034	And Jesus , going out , saw a great multitude . And he took pity on them , because they were like sheep without a shepherd , and he began to teach them many things .
41006035	And when many hours had now passed , his disciples drew near to him , saying : “ This is a deserted place , and the hour is now late .
41006036	Send them away , so that by going out to nearby villages and towns , they might buy provisions for themselves to eat . ”
41006037	And responding , he said to them , “ Give them something to eat yourselves . ” And they said to him , “ Let us go out and buy bread for two hundred denarii , and then we will give them something to eat . ”
41006038	And he said to them : “ How many loaves do you have ? Go and see . ” And when they had found out , they said , “ Five , and two fish . ”
41006039	And he instructed them to make them all sit down in groups on the green grass .
41006040	And they sat down in divisions by hundreds and by fifties .
41006041	And having received the five loaves and the two fish , gazing up to heaven , he blessed and broke the bread , and he gave it to his disciples to set before them . And the two fish he divided among them all .
41006042	And they all ate and were satisfied .
41006043	And they brought together the remainder : twelve baskets full of fragments and of fish .
41006044	Now those who ate were five thousand men .
41006045	And without delay he urged his disciples to climb into the boat , so that they might precede him across the sea to Bethsaida , while he dismissed the people .
41006046	And when he had dismissed them , he went to the mountain to pray .
41006047	And when it was late , the boat was in the midst of the sea , and he was alone on the land .
41006048	And seeing them struggling to row , ( for the wind was against them , ) and about the fourth watch of the night , he came to them , walking upon the sea . And he intended to pass by them .
41006049	But when they saw him walking upon the sea , they thought it was an apparition , and they cried out .
41006050	For they all saw him , and they were very disturbed . And immediately he spoke with them , and he said to them : “ Be strengthened in faith . It is I . Do not be afraid . ”
41006051	And he climbed into the boat with them , and the wind ceased . And they became even more astonished within themselves .
41006052	For they did not understand about the bread . For their heart had been blinded .
41006053	And when they had crossed over , they arrived in the land of Genesaret , and they reached the shore .
41006054	And when they had disembarked from the boat , the people immediately recognized him .
41006055	And running throughout that entire region , they began to carry on beds those who had maladies , to where they heard that he would be .
41006056	And in whichever place he entered , in towns or villages or cities , they placed the infirm in the main streets , and they pleaded with him that they might touch even the hem of his garment . And as many as touched him were made healthy .
41007001	And the Pharisees and some of the scribes , arriving from Jerusalem , gathered together before him .
41007002	And when they had seen certain ones from his disciples eating bread with common hands , that is , with unwashed hands , they disparaged them .
41007003	For the Pharisees , and all the Jews , do not eat without repeatedly washing their hands , holding to the tradition of the elders .
41007004	And when returning from the market , unless they wash , they do not eat . And there are many other things which have been handed down to them to observe : the washings of cups , and pitchers , and bronze containers , and beds .
41007005	And so the Pharisees and the scribes questioned him : “ Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders , but they eat bread with common hands ? ”
41007006	But in response , he said to them : “ So well did Isaiah prophesy about you hypocrites , just as it has been written : ‘ This people honors me with their lips , but their heart is far from me .
41007007	And in vain do they worship me , teaching the doctrines and precepts of men . ’
41007008	For abandoning the commandment of God , you hold to the tradition of men , to the washing of pitchers and cups . And you do many other things similar to these . ”
41007009	And he said to them : “ You effectively nullify the precept of God , so that you may observe your own tradition .
41007010	For Moses said : ‘ Honor your father and your mother , ’ and , ‘ Whoever will have cursed father or mother , let him die a death . ’
41007011	But you say , ‘ If a man will have said to his father or mother : Korban , ( which is a gift ) whatever is from me will be to your benefit , ’
41007012	then you do not release him to do anything for his father or mother ,
41007013	rescinding the word of God through your tradition , which you have handed down . And you do many other similar things in this way . ”
41007014	And again , calling the crowd to him , he said to them : “ Listen to me , all of you , and understand .
41007015	There is nothing from outside a man which , by entering into him , is able to defile him . But the things which procede from a man , these are what pollute a man .
41007016	Whoever has ears to hear , let him hear . ”
41007017	And when he had entered into the house , away from the crowd , his disciples questioned him about the parable .
41007018	And he said to them : “ So , are you also without prudence ? Do you not understand that everything entering to a man from outside is not able to pollute him ?
41007019	For it does not enter into his heart , but into the gut , and it exits into the sewer , purging all foods . ”
41007020	“ But , ” he said “ the things which go out from a man , these pollute a man .
41007021	For from within , from the heart of men , proceed evil thoughts , adulteries , fornications , murders ,
41007022	thefts , avarice , wickedness , deceitfulness , homosexuality , an evil eye , blasphemy , self-exaltation , foolishness .
41007023	All these evils procede from within and pollute a man . ”
41007024	And rising up , he went from there to the area of Tyre and Sidon . And entering into a house , he intended no one to know about it , but he was not able to remain hidden .
41007025	For a woman whose daughter had an unclean spirit , as soon as she heard about him , entered and fell prostrate at his feet .
41007026	For the woman was a Gentile , by birth a Syro-Phoenician . And she petitioned him , so that he would cast the demon from her daughter .
41007027	And he said to her : “ First allow the sons to have their fill . For it is not good to take away the bread of the sons and throw it to the dogs . ”
41007028	But she responded by saying to him : “ Certainly , Lord . Yet the young dogs also eat , under the table , from the crumbs of the children . ”
41007029	And he said to her , “ Because of this saying , go ; the demon has gone out of your daughter . ”
41007030	And when she had gone to her house , she found the girl lying on the bed ; and the demon had gone away .
41007031	And again , departing from the borders of Tyre , he went by way of Sidon to the sea of Galilee , through the midst of the area of the Ten Cities .
41007032	And they brought someone who was deaf and mute to him . And they begged him , so that he would lay his hand upon him .
41007033	And taking him away from the crowd , he put his fingers into his ears ; and spitting , he touched his tongue .
41007034	And gazing up to heaven , he groaned and said to him : “ Ephphatha , ” which is , “ Be opened . ”
41007035	And immediately his ears were opened , and the impediment of his tongue was released , and he spoke correctly .
41007036	And he instructed them not to tell anyone . But as much as he instructed them , so much more did they preach about it .
41007037	And so much more did they wonder , saying : “ He has done all things well . He has caused both the deaf to hear and the mute to speak . ”
41008001	In those days , again , when there was a great crowd , and they did not have anything to eat , calling together his disciples , he said to them :
41008002	“ I have compassion for the multitude , because , behold , they have persevered with me now for three days , and they do not have anything to eat .
41008003	And if I were to send them away fasting to their home , they might faint on the way . ” For some of them came from far away .
41008004	And his disciples answered him , “ From where would anyone be able to obtain enough bread for them in the wilderness ? ”
41008005	And he questioned them , “ How many loaves do you have ? ” And they said , “ Seven . ”
41008006	And he instructed the crowd to sit down to eat on the ground . And taking the seven loaves , giving thanks , he broke and gave it to his disciples in order to place before them . And they placed these before the crowd .
41008007	And they had a few small fish . And he blessed them , and he ordered them to be placed before them .
41008008	And they ate and were satisfied . And they took up what had been leftover from the fragments : seven baskets .
41008009	And those who ate were about four thousand . And he dismissed them .
41008010	And promptly climbing into a boat with his disciples , he went into the parts of Dalmanutha .
41008011	And the Pharisees went out and began to contend with him , seeking from him a sign from heaven , testing him .
41008012	And sighing deeply in spirit , he said : “ Why does this generation seek a sign ? Amen , I say to you , if only a sign will be given to this generation ! ”
41008013	And sending them away , he climbed into the boat again , and he went away across the sea .
41008014	And they forgot to take bread . And they did not have any with them in the boat , except one loaf .
41008015	And he instructed them , saying : “ Consider and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the leaven of Herod . ”
41008016	And they discussed this with one another , saying , “ For we have no bread . ”
41008017	And Jesus , knowing this , said to them : “ Why do you consider that it is because you have no bread ? Do you not yet know or understand ? Do you still have blindness in your heart ?
41008018	Having eyes , do you not see ? And having ears , do you not hear ? Do you not remember ,
41008019	when I broke the five loves among the five thousand , how many baskets full of fragments you took up ? ” They said to him , “ Twelve . ”
41008020	“ And when the seven loaves were among the four thousand , how many baskets of fragments did you take up ? ” And they said to him , “ Seven . ”
41008021	And he said to them , “ How is it that you do not yet understand ? ”
41008022	And they went to Bethsaida . And they brought a blind man to him . And they petitioned him , so that he would touch him .
41008023	And taking the blind man by the hand , he led him beyond the village . And putting spit on his eyes , laying his hands on him , he asked him if he could see anything .
41008024	And looking up , he said , “ I see men but they are like walking trees . ”
41008025	Next he placed his hands again over his eyes , and he began to see . And he was restored , so that he could see everything clearly .
41008026	And he sent him to his house , saying , “ Go into your own house , and if you enter into the town , tell no one . ”
41008027	And Jesus departed with his disciples into the towns of Caesarea Philippi . And on the way , he questioned his disciples , saying to them , “ Who do men say that I am ? ”
41008028	And they answered him by saying : “ John the Baptist , others Elijah , still others perhaps one of the prophets . ”
41008029	Then he said to them , “ Yet truly , who do you say that I am ? ” Peter responded by saying to him , “ You are the Christ . ”
41008030	And he admonished them , not to tell anyone about him .
41008031	And he began to teach them that the Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected by the elders , and by the high priests , and the scribes , and be killed , and after three days rise again .
41008032	And he spoke the word openly . And Peter , taking him aside , began to correct him .
41008033	And turning away and looking at his disciples , he admonished Peter , saying , “ Get behind me , Satan , for you do not prefer the things that are of God , but the things that are of men . ”
41008034	And calling together the crowd with his disciples , he said to them , “ If anyone chooses to follow me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
41008035	For whoever will have chosen to save his life , will lose it . But whoever will have lost his life , for my sake and for the Gospel , shall save it .
41008036	For how does it benefit a man , if he gains the whole world , and yet causes harm to his soul ?
41008037	Or , what will a man give in exchange for his soul ?
41008038	For whoever has been ashamed of me and of my words , among this adulterous and sinful generation , the Son of man also will be ashamed of him , when he will arrive in the glory of his Father , with the holy Angels . ”
41009001	And he said to them , “ Amen I say to you , that there are some among those standing here who shall not taste death until they see the kingdom of God arriving in power . ”
41009002	And after six days , Jesus took with him Peter , and James , and John ; and he led them separately to a lofty mountain alone ; and he was transfigured before them .
41009003	And his vestments became radiant and exceedingly white like snow , with such a brilliance as no fuller on earth is able to achieve .
41009004	And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses ; and they were speaking with Jesus .
41009005	And in response , Peter said to Jesus : “ Master , it is good for us to be here . And so let us make three tabernacles , one for you , and one for Moses , and one for Elijah . ”
41009006	For he did not know what he was saying . For they were overwhelmed by fear .
41009007	And there was a cloud overshadowing them . And a voice came from the cloud , saying : “ This is my most beloved Son . Listen to him . ”
41009008	And immediately , looking around , they no longer saw anyone , except Jesus alone with them .
41009009	And as they were descending from the mountain , he instructed them not to relate to anyone what they had seen , until after the Son of man will have risen again from the dead .
41009010	And they kept the word to themselves , arguing about what “ after he will have risen from the dead ” might mean .
41009011	And they questioned him , saying : “ Then why do the Pharisees and the scribes say that Elijah must arrive first ? ”
41009012	And in response , he said to them : “ Elijah , when he will arrive first , shall restore all things . And in the manner that it has been written about the Son of man , so must he suffer many things and be condemned .
41009013	But I say to you , that Elijah also has arrived , ( and they have done to him whatever they wanted ) just as it has been written about him . ”
41009014	And approaching his disciples , he saw a great crowd surrounding them , and the scribes were arguing with them .
41009015	And soon all the people , seeing Jesus , were astonished and struck with fear , and hurrying to him , they greeted him .
41009016	And he questioned them , “ What are you arguing about among yourselves ? ”
41009017	And one from the crowd responded by saying : “ Teacher , I have brought to you my son , who has a mute spirit .
41009018	And whenever it takes hold of him , it throws him down , and he foams and gnashes with his teeth , and he becomes unconscious . And I asked your disciples to cast him out , and they could not . ”
41009019	And answering them , he said : “ O unbelieving generation , how long must I be with you ? How long shall I endure you ? Bring him to me . ”
41009020	And they brought him . And when he had seen him , immediately the spirit disturbed him . And having been thrown to the ground , he rolled around foaming .
41009021	And he questioned his father , “ How long has this been happening to him ? ” But he said : “ From infancy .
41009022	And often it casts him into fire or into water , in order to destroy him . But if you are able to do anything , help us and take pity on us . ”
41009023	But Jesus said to him , “ If you are able to believe : all things are possible to one who believes . ”
41009024	And immediately the father of the boy , crying out with tears , said : “ I do believe , Lord . Help my unbelief . ”
41009025	And when Jesus saw the crowd rushing together , he admonished the unclean spirit , saying to him , “ Deaf and mute spirit , I command you , leave him ; and do not enter into him anymore . ”
41009026	And crying out , and convulsing him greatly , he departed from him . And he became like one who is dead , so much so that many said , “ He is dead . ”
41009027	But Jesus , taking him by the hand , lifted him up . And he arose .
41009028	And when he had entered into the house , his disciples questioned him privately , “ Why were we unable to cast him out ? ”
41009029	And he said to them , “ This kind is able to be expelled by nothing other than prayer and fasting . ”
41009030	And setting out from there , they passed through Galilee . And he intended that no one know about it .
41009031	Then he taught his disciples , and he said to them , “ For the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men , and they will kill him , and having been killed , on the third day he will rise again . ”
41009032	But they did not understand the word . And they were afraid to question him .
41009033	And they went to Capernaum . And when they were in the house , he questioned them , “ What did you discuss on the way ? ”
41009034	But they were silent . For indeed , on the way , they had disputed among themselves as to which of them was greater .
41009035	And sitting down , he called the twelve , and he said to them , “ If anyone wants to be first , he shall be the last of all and the minister of all . ”
41009036	And taking a child , he set him in their midst . And when he had embraced him , he said to them :
41009037	“ Whoever receives one such child in my name , receives me . And whoever receives me , receives not me , but him who sent me . ”
41009038	John responded to him by saying , “ Teacher , we saw someone casting out demons in your name ; he does not follow us , and so we prohibited him . ”
41009039	But Jesus said : “ Do not prohibit him . For there is no one who can act with virtue in my name and soon speak evil about me .
41009040	For whoever is not against you is for you .
41009041	For whoever , in my name , will give you a cup of water to drink , because you belong to Christ : Amen I say to you , he shall not lose his reward .
41009042	And whoever will have scandalized one of these little ones who believe in me : it would be better for him if a great millstone were placed around his neck and he were thrown into the sea .
41009043	And if your hand causes you to sin , cut it off : it is better for you to enter into life disabled , than having two hands to go into Hell , into the unquenchable fire ,
41009044	where their worm does not die , and the fire is not extinguished .
41009045	But if your foot causes you to sin , chop it off : it is better for you to enter into eternal life lame , than having two feet to be cast into the Hell of unquenchable fire ,
41009046	where their worm does not die , and the fire is not extinguished .
41009047	But if your eye causes you to sin , pluck it out : it is better for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye , than having two eyes to be cast into the Hell of fire ,
41009048	where their worm does not die , and the fire is not extinguished .
41009049	For all shall be salted with fire , and every victim shall be salted with salt .
41009050	Salt is good : but if the salt has become bland , with what will you season it ? Have salt in yourselves , and have peace among yourselves . ”
41010001	And rising up , he went from there into the area of Judea beyond the Jordan . And again , the crowd came together before him . And just as he was accustomed to do , again he taught them .
41010002	And approaching , the Pharisees questioned him , testing him : “ Is it lawful for a man to dismiss his wife ? ”
41010003	But in response , he said to them , “ What did Moses instruct you ? ”
41010004	And they said , “ Moses gave permission to write a bill of divorce and to dismiss her . ”
41010005	But Jesus responded by saying : “ It was due to the hardness of your heart that he wrote that precept for you .
41010006	But from the beginning of creation , God made them male and female .
41010007	Because of this , a man shall leave behind his father and mother , and he shall cling to his wife .
41010008	And these two shall be one in flesh . And so , they are now , not two , but one flesh .
41010009	Therefore , what God has joined together , let no man separate . ”
41010010	And again , in the house , his disciples questioned him about the same thing .
41010011	And he said to them : “ Whoever dismisses his wife , and marries another , commits adultery against her .
41010012	And if a wife dismisses her husband , and is married to another , she commits adultery . ”
41010013	And they brought to him the little children , so that he might touch them . But the disciples admonished those who brought them .
41010014	But when Jesus saw this , he took offense , and he said to them : “ Allow the little ones to come to me , and do not prohibit them . For of such as these is the kingdom of God .
41010015	Amen I say to you , whoever will not accept the kingdom of God like a little child , will not enter into it . ”
41010016	And embracing them , and laying his hands upon them , he blessed them .
41010017	And when he had departed on the way , a certain one , running up and kneeling before him , asked him , “ Good Teacher , what shall I do , so that I may secure eternal life ? ”
41010018	But Jesus said to him , “ Why call me good ? No one is good except the one God .
41010019	You know the precepts : “ Do not commit adultery . Do not kill . Do not steal . Do not speak false testimony . Do not deceive . Honor your father and mother . ”
41010020	But in response , he said to him , “ Teacher , all these I have observed from my youth . ”
41010021	Then Jesus , gazing at him , loved him , and he said to him : “ One thing is lacking to you . Go , sell whatever you have , and give to the poor , and then you will have treasure in heaven . And come , follow me . ”
41010022	But he went away grieving , having been greatly saddened by the word . For he had many possessions .
41010023	And Jesus , looking around , said to his disciples , “ How difficult it is for those who have riches to enter into the kingdom of God ! ”
41010024	And the disciples were astonished at his words . But Jesus , answering again , said to them : “ Little sons , how difficult it is for those who trust in money to enter into the kingdom of God !
41010025	It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle , than for the rich to enter into the kingdom of God . ”
41010026	And they wondered even more , saying among themselves , “ Who , then , can be saved ? ”
41010027	And Jesus , gazing at them , said : “ With men it is impossible ; but not with God . For with God all things are possible . ”
41010028	And Peter began to say to him , “ Behold , we have left all things and have followed you . ”
41010029	In response , Jesus said : “ Amen I say to you , There is no one who has left behind house , or brothers , or sisters , or father , or mother , or children , or land , for my sake and for the Gospel ,
41010030	who will not receive one hundred times as much , now in this time : houses , and brothers , and sisters , and mothers , and children , and land , with persecutions , and in the future age eternal life .
41010031	But many of the first shall be last , and the last shall be first . ”
41010032	Now they were on the way ascending to Jerusalem . And Jesus went ahead of them , and they were astonished . And those following him were afraid . And again , taking aside the twelve , he began to tell them what was about to happen to him .
41010033	“ For behold , we are going up to Jerusalem , and the Son of man will be handed over to the leaders of the priests , and to the scribes , and the elders . And they will condemn him to death , and they will hand him over to the Gentiles .
41010034	And they will mock him , and spit on him , and scourge him , and put him to death . And on the third day , he will rise again . ”
41010035	And James and John , the sons of Zebedee , drew near to him , saying , “ Teacher , we wish that whatever we will ask , you would do for us . ”
41010036	But he said to them , “ What do you want me to do for you ? ”
41010037	And they said , “ Grant to us that we may sit , one at your right and the other at your left , in your glory . ”
41010038	But Jesus said to them : “ You do not know what you are asking . Are you able to drink from the chalice from which I drink , or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am to be baptized ? ”
41010039	But they said to him , “ We can . ” Then Jesus said to them : “ Indeed , you shall drink from the chalice , from which I drink ; and you shall be baptized with the baptism , with which I am to be baptized .
41010040	But to sit at my right , or at my left , is not mine to give to you , but it is for those for whom it has been prepared . ”
41010041	And the ten , upon hearing this , began to be indignant toward James and John .
41010042	But Jesus , calling them , said to them : “ You know that those who seem to be leaders among the Gentiles dominate them , and their leaders exercise authority over them .
41010043	But it is not to be this way among you . Instead , whoever would become greater shall be your minister ;
41010044	and whoever will be first among you shall be the servant of all .
41010045	So , too , the Son of man has not come so that they would minister to him , but so that he would minister and would give his life as a redemption for many . ”
41010046	And they went to Jericho . And as he was setting out from Jericho with his disciples and a very numerous multitude , Bartimaeus , the son of Timaeus , a blind man , sat begging beside the way .
41010047	And when he had heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth , he began to cry out and to say , “ Jesus , Son of David , take pity on me . ”
41010048	And many admonished him to be quiet . But he cried out all the more , “ Son of David , take pity on me . ”
41010049	And Jesus , standing still , instructed him to be called . And they called the blind man , saying to him : “ Be at peace . Arise . He is calling you . ”
41010050	And casting aside his garment , he leapt up and went to him .
41010051	And in response , Jesus said to him , “ What do you want , that I should do for you ? ” And the blind man said to him , “ Master , that I may see . ”
41010052	Then Jesus said to him , “ Go , your faith has made you whole . ” And immediately he saw , and he followed him on the way .
41011001	And as they were approaching Jerusalem and Bethania , toward the mount of Olives , he sent two of his disciples ,
41011002	and he said to them : “ Go into the village that is opposite you , and immediately upon entering there , you will find a colt tied , on which no man has yet sat . Release him and bring him .
41011003	And if anyone will say to you : ‘ What are you doing ? ’ Say that the Lord has need of him . And he will immediately send him here . ”
41011004	And going out , they found the colt tied before the outer gate , at the meeting of two ways . And they untied him .
41011005	And some of those who were standing there said to them , “ What are you doing by releasing the colt ? ”
41011006	And they spoke to them just as Jesus had instructed them . And they permitted them .
41011007	And they led the colt to Jesus . And they placed their garments on it ; and he sat upon it .
41011008	Then many spread their garments along the way ; but others cut down leafy branches from trees and scattered them on the way .
41011009	And those who went ahead , and those who followed , cried out saying : “ Hosanna ! Blessed is he who has arrived in the name of the Lord .
41011010	Blessed is the advent of the kingdom of our father David . Hosanna in the highest ! ”
41011011	And he entered into Jerusalem , into the temple . And having looked around at everything , since it was now the evening hour , he went out to Bethania with the twelve .
41011012	And the next day , as they were departing from Bethania , he was hungry .
41011013	And when he had seen a fig tree with leaves in the distance , he went to it , in case he might find something on it . And when he had gone to it , he found nothing but leaves . For it was not the season for figs .
41011014	And in response , he said to it , “ From now on and forever , may no one eat fruit from you again ! ” And his disciples heard this .
41011015	And they went to Jerusalem . And when he had entered into the temple , he began to cast out the sellers and the buyers in the temple . And he overturned the tables of the moneychangers and the chairs of the vendors of doves .
41011016	And he would not permit anyone to carry goods through the temple .
41011017	And he taught them , saying : “ Is it not written : ‘ For my house shall be called the house of prayer for all nations ? ’ But you have made it into a den of robbers . ”
41011018	And when the leaders of the priests , and the scribes , had heard this , they sought a means by which they might destroy him . For they feared him , because the entire multitude was in admiration over his doctrine .
41011019	And when evening had arrived , he departed from the city .
41011020	And when they passed by in the morning , they saw that the fig tree had dried up from the roots .
41011021	And Peter , remembering , said to him , “ Master , behold , the fig tree that you cursed has withered . ”
41011022	And in response , Jesus said to them : “ Have the faith of God .
41011023	Amen I say to you , that whoever will say to this mountain , ‘ Be taken up and cast into the sea , ’ and who will not have hesitated in his heart , but will have believed : then whatever he has said be done , it shall be done for him .
41011024	For this reason , I say to you , all things whatsoever that you ask for when praying : believe that you will receive them , and they will happen for you .
41011025	And when you stand to pray , if you hold anything against anyone , forgive them , so that your Father , who is in heaven , may also forgive you your sins .
41011026	But if you will not forgive , neither will your Father , who is in heaven , forgive you your sins . ”
41011027	And they went again to Jerusalem . And when he was walking in the temple , the leaders of the priests , and the scribes , and the elders approached him .
41011028	And they said to him : “ By what authority do you do these things ? And who has given you this authority , so that you would do these things ? ”
41011029	But in response , Jesus said to them : “ I also will ask you one word , and if you answer me , I will tell you by what authority I do these things .
41011030	The baptism of John : was it from heaven or from men ? Answer me . ”
41011031	But they discussed it among themselves , saying : “ If we say , ‘ From heaven , ’ he will say , ‘ Then why did you not believe him ? ’
41011032	If we say , ‘ From men , ’ we fear the people . For they all hold that John was a true prophet . ”
41011033	And answering , they said to Jesus , “ We do not know . ” And in response , Jesus said to them , “ Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things . ”
41012001	And he began to speak to them in parables : “ A man dug a vineyard , and surrounded it with a hedge , and dug a pit , and built a tower , and he loaned it out to farmers , and he set out on a long journey .
41012002	And in time , he sent a servant to the farmers , in order to receive some of the fruit of the vineyard from the farmers .
41012003	But they , having apprehended him , beat him and sent him away empty .
41012004	And again , he sent another servant to them . And they wounded him on the head , and they treated him with contempt .
41012005	And again , he sent another , and him they killed , and many others : some they beat , but others they killed .
41012006	Therefore , having still one son , most dear to him , he sent him also to them , at the very end , saying , ‘ For they will reverence my son . ’
41012007	But the settlers said one to another : ‘ This is the heir . Come , let us kill him . And then the inheritance will be ours . ’
41012008	And apprehending him , they killed him . And they cast him out of the vineyard .
41012009	Therefore , what will the lord of the vineyard do ? ” “ He will come and destroy the settlers . And he will give the vineyard to others . ”
41012010	“ And so , have you not read this scripture ? : ‘ The stone which the builders have rejected , the same has been made the head of the corner .
41012011	By the Lord has this been done , and it is wondrous in our eyes . ’ ”
41012012	And they sought to take hold of him , but they feared the crowd . For they knew that he had spoken this parable about them . And leaving him behind , they went away .
41012013	And they sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to him , so that they might trap him with words .
41012014	And these , arriving , said to him : “ Teacher , we know that you are truthful and that you do not favor anyone ; for you do not consider the appearance of men , but you teach the way of God in truth . Is it lawful to give the tribute to Caesar , or should we not give it ? ”
41012015	And knowing their skill in deception , he said to them : “ Why do you test me ? Bring me a denarius , so that I may see it . ”
41012016	And they brought it to him . And he said to them , “ Whose image and inscription is this ? ” They said to him , “ Caesar’s . ”
41012017	So in response , Jesus said to them , “ Then render to Caesar , the things that are of Caesar ; and to God , the things that are of God . ” And they wondered over him .
41012018	And the Sadducees , who say there is no resurrection , approached him . And they questioned him , saying :
41012019	“ Teacher , Moses wrote for us that if any man’s brother will have died and left behind a wife , and not have left behind sons , his brother should take his wife to himself and should raise up offspring for his brother .
41012020	So then , there were seven brothers . And the first took a wife , and he died without leaving behind offspring .
41012021	And the second took her , and he died . And neither did he leave behind offspring . And the third acted similarly .
41012022	And in like manner , each of the seven received her and did not leave behind offspring . Last of all , the woman also died .
41012023	Therefore , in the resurrection , when they will rise again , to which of them will she be a wife ? For each of the seven had her as wife . ”
41012024	And Jesus responded by saying to them : “ But have you not gone astray , by knowing neither the scriptures , nor the power of God ?
41012025	For when they will be resurrected from the dead , they shall neither marry , nor be given in marriage , but they are like the Angels in heaven .
41012026	But concerning the dead who rise again , have you not read in the book of Moses , how God spoke to him from the bush , saying : ‘ I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ? ’
41012027	He is not the God of the dead , but of the living . Therefore , you have gone far astray . ”
41012028	And one of the scribes , who had heard them arguing , drew near to him . And seeing that he had answered them well , he questioned him as to which was the first commandment of all .
41012029	And Jesus answered him : “ For the first commandment of all is this : ‘ Listen , O Israel . The Lord your God is one God .
41012030	And you shall love the Lord your God from your whole heart , and from your whole soul , and from your whole mind , and from your whole strength . This is the first commandment . ’
41012031	But the second is similar to it : ‘ You shall love your neighbor as yourself . ’ There is no other commandment greater than these . ”
41012032	And the scribe said to him : Well said , Teacher . You have spoken the truth that there is one God , and there is no other beside him ;
41012033	and that he should be loved from the whole heart , and from the whole understanding , and from the whole soul , and from the whole strength . And to love one’s neighbor as one’s self is greater than all holocausts and sacrifices . ”
41012034	And Jesus , seeing that he had responded wisely , said to him , “ You are not far from the kingdom of God . ” And after that , no one dared to question him .
41012035	And while teaching in the temple , Jesus said in answer : “ How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David ?
41012036	For David himself said in the Holy Spirit : ‘ The Lord said to my Lord : Sit at my right hand , until I set your enemies as your footstool . ’
41012037	Therefore , David himself calls him Lord , and so how can he be his son ? ” And a great multitude listened to him willingly .
41012038	And he said to them in his doctrine : “ Beware of the scribes , who prefer to walk in long robes and to be greeted in the marketplace ,
41012039	and to sit in the first chairs in the synagogues , and to have the first seats at feasts ,
41012040	who devour the houses of widows under the pretense of long prayers . These shall receive the more extensive judgment . ”
41012041	And Jesus , sitting opposite the offertory box , considered the way in which the crowd cast coins into the offertory , and that many of the wealthy cast in a great deal .
41012042	But when one poor widow had arrived , she put in two small coins , which is a quarter .
41012043	And calling together his disciples , he said to them : “ Amen I say to you , that this poor widow has put in more than all those who contributed to the offertory .
41012044	For they all gave from their abundance , yet truly , she gave from her scarcity , even all that she had , her entire living . ”
41013001	And as he was departing from the temple , one of his disciples said to him , “ Teacher , observe these fine stones and fine structures . ”
41013002	And in response , Jesus said to him : “ Do you see all these great buildings ? There shall not be left stone upon stone , which is not torn down . ”
41013003	And as he sat at the Mount of Olives , opposite the temple , Peter , and James , and John , and Andrew questioned him privately .
41013004	“ Tell us , when will these things be , and what will be the sign when all these things will begin to be fulfilled ? ”
41013005	And Jesus , answering , began to say to them : “ See to it that no one leads you astray .
41013006	For many will come in my name , saying , ‘ For I am he , ’ and they will lead many astray .
41013007	But when you will have heard of wars and rumors of wars , you should not be afraid . For these things must be , but the end is not so soon .
41013008	For nation will rise up against nation , and kingdom over kingdom , and there shall be earthquakes in various places , and famines . These are but the beginning of the sorrows .
41013009	But see to yourselves . For they will hand you over to councils , and in the synagogues you will be beaten , and you shall stand before governors and kings because of me , as a testimony for them .
41013010	And the Gospel must first be preached to all nations .
41013011	And when they have seized you and handed you over , do not consider in advance what to say . But whatever will be given you in that hour , say that . For you will not be speaking , but the Holy Spirit .
41013012	Then brother will betray brother to death , and the father , a son ; and children will rise up against their parents and will bring about their death .
41013013	And you will be hated by all for the sake of my name . But whoever will have persevered unto the end , the same will be saved .
41013014	Then , when you have seen the abomination of desolation , standing where it ought not to be , let the reader understand : then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains .
41013015	And let whoever is on the rooftop not descend to the house , nor enter so as to take anything from the house .
41013016	And let whoever may be in the field not return to take his garment .
41013017	But woe to those who are pregnant or nursing in those days .
41013018	Truly , pray that these things may not happen in winter .
41013019	For those days shall have such tribulations as have not been since the beginning of the creation that God founded , even until now , and shall not be .
41013020	And unless the Lord had shortened the days , no flesh would be saved . But , for the sake of the elect , whom he has chosen , he has shortened the days .
41013021	And then , if anyone will have said to you : ‘ Behold , here is the Christ . Behold , in that place . ’ Do not believe it .
41013022	For false Christs and false prophets will rise up , and they will present signs and wonders , so as to lead astray , if it were possible , even the elect .
41013023	Therefore , you must take heed . Behold , I have foretold all to you .
41013024	But in those days , after that tribulation , the sun will be darkened , and the moon will not give her splendor .
41013025	And the stars of heaven will be falling down , and the powers that are in heaven will be moved .
41013026	And then they shall see the Son of man arriving on the clouds , with great power and glory .
41013027	And then he will send his Angels , and gather together his elect , from the four winds , from the limits of the earth , to the limits of heaven .
41013028	Now from the fig tree discern a parable . When its branch becomes tender and the foliage has been formed , you know that summer is very near .
41013029	So also , when you will have seen these things happen , know that it is very near , even at the doors .
41013030	Amen I say to you , that this lineage shall not pass away , until all these things have happened .
41013031	Heaven and earth shall pass away , but my word shall not pass away .
41013032	But concerning that day or hour , no one knows , neither the Angels in heaven , nor the Son , but only the Father .
41013033	Take heed , be vigilant , and pray . For you do not know when the time may be .
41013034	It is like a man who , setting out on a sojourn , left behind his house , and gave his servants authority over every work , and instructed the doorkeeper to stand watch .
41013035	Therefore , be vigilant , for you do not know when the lord of the house may arrive : in the evening , or in the middle of the night , or at first light , or in the morning .
41013036	Otherwise , when he will have arrived unexpectedly , he may find you sleeping .
41013037	But what I say to you , I say to all : Be vigilant . ”
41014001	Now the feast of Passover and of Unleavened Bread was two days away . And the leaders of the priests , and the scribes , were seeking a means by which they might deceitfully seize him and kill him .
41014002	But they said , “ Not on the feast day , lest perhaps there may be a tumult among the people . ”
41014003	And when he was in Bethania , in the house of Simon the leper , and was reclining to eat , a woman arrived having an alabaster container of ointment , of precious spikenard . And breaking open the alabaster container , she poured it over his head .
41014004	But there were some who became indignant within themselves and who were saying : “ What is the reason for this waste of the ointment ?
41014005	For this ointment could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and been given to the poor . ” And they murmured against her .
41014006	But Jesus said : “ Permit her . What is the reason that you trouble her ? She has done a good deed for me .
41014007	For the poor , you have with you always . And whenever you wish , you are able to do good to them . But you do not have me always .
41014008	But she has done what she could . She has arrived in advance to anoint my body for burial .
41014009	Amen I say to you , wherever this Gospel shall be preached throughout the entire world , the things she has done also shall be told , in memory of her . ”
41014010	And Judas Iscariot , one of the twelve , went away , to the leaders of the priests , in order to betray him to them .
41014011	And they , upon hearing it , were gladdened . And they promised him that they would give him money . And he sought an opportune means by which he might betray him .
41014012	And on the first day of Unleavened Bread , when they immolate the Passover , the disciples said to him , “ Where do you want us to go and prepare for you to eat the Passover ? ”
41014013	And he sent two of his disciples , and he said to them : “ Go into the city . And you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water ; follow him .
41014014	And wherever he will have entered , say to the owner of the house , ‘ The Teacher says : Where is my dining room , where I may eat the Passover with my disciples ? ’
41014015	And he will show you a large cenacle , fully furnished . And there , you shall prepare it for us . ”
41014016	And his disciples departed and went into the city . And they found it just as he had told them . And they prepared the Passover .
41014017	Then , when evening came , he arrived with the twelve .
41014018	And while reclining and eating with them at table , Jesus said , “ Amen I say to you , that one of you , who eats with me , will betray me . ”
41014019	But they began to be sorrowful and to say to him , one at a time : “ Is it I ? ”
41014020	And he said to them : “ It is one of the twelve , who dips his hand with me in the dish .
41014021	And indeed , the Son of man goes , just as it has been written of him . But woe to that man by whom the Son of man will be betrayed . It would be better for that man if he had never been born . ”
41014022	And while eating with them , Jesus took bread . And blessing it , he broke it and gave it to them , and he said : “ Take . This is my body . ”
41014023	And having taken the chalice , giving thanks , he gave it to them . And they all drank from it .
41014024	And he said to them : “ This is my blood of the new covenant , which shall be shed for many .
41014025	Amen I say to you , that I will no longer drink from this fruit of the vine , until that day when I will drink it new in the kingdom of God . ”
41014026	And having sung a hymn , they went out to the Mount of Olives .
41014027	And Jesus said to them : “ You will all fall away from me in this night . For it has been written : ‘ I will strike the shepherd , and the sheep will be scattered . ’
41014028	But after I have risen again , I will go before you to Galilee . ”
41014029	Then Peter said to him , “ Even if all will have fallen away from you , yet I will not . ”
41014030	And Jesus said to him , “ Amen I say to you , that this day , in this night , before the rooster has uttered its voice twice , you will deny me three times . ”
41014031	But he spoke further , “ Even if I must die along with you , I will not deny you . ” And they all spoke similarly also .
41014032	And they went to a country estate , by the name of Gethsemani . And he said to his disciples , “ Sit here , while I pray . ”
41014033	And he took Peter , and James , and John with him . And he began to be afraid and wearied .
41014034	And he said to them : “ My soul is sorrowful , even unto death . Remain here and be vigilant . ”
41014035	And when he had proceeded on a little ways , he fell prostrate on the ground . And he prayed that , if it were possible , the hour might pass away from him .
41014036	And he said : “ Abba , Father , all things are possible to you . Take this chalice from me . But let it be , not as I will , but as you will . ”
41014037	And he went and found them sleeping . And he said to Peter : “ Simon , are you sleeping ? Were you not able to be vigilant for one hour ?
41014038	Watch and pray , so that you may not enter into temptation . The spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak . ”
41014039	And going away again , he prayed , saying the same words .
41014040	And upon returning , he found them sleeping yet again , ( for their eyes were heavy ) and they did not know how to respond to him .
41014041	And he arrived for the third time , and he said to them : “ Sleep now , and take rest . It is enough . The hour has arrived . Behold , the Son of man will be betrayed into the hands of sinners .
41014042	Rise up , let us go . Behold , he who will betray me is near . ”
41014043	And while he was still speaking , Judas Iscariot , one of the twelve , arrived , and with him was a large crowd with swords and clubs , sent from the leaders of the priests , and the scribes , and the elders .
41014044	Now his betrayer had given them a sign , saying : “ He whom I shall kiss , it is he . Take hold of him , and lead him away cautiously . ”
41014045	And when he had arrived , immediately drawing near to him , he said : “ Hail , Master ! ” And he kissed him .
41014046	But they laid hands on him and held him .
41014047	Then a certain one of those standing near , drawing a sword , struck a servant of the high priest and cut off his ear .
41014048	And in response , Jesus said to them : “ Have you set out to apprehend me , just as if to a robber , with swords and clubs ?
41014049	Daily , I was with you in the temple teaching , and you did not take hold of me . But in this way , the scriptures are fulfilled . ”
41014050	Then his disciples , leaving him behind , all fled away .
41014051	Now a certain young man followed him , having nothing but a fine linen cloth over himself . And they took hold of him .
41014052	But he , rejecting the fine linen cloth , escaped from them naked .
41014053	And they led Jesus to the high priest . And all the priests and the scribes and the elders came together .
41014054	But Peter followed him from a distance , even into the court of the high priest . And he sat with the servants at the fire and warmed himself .
41014055	Yet truly , the leaders of the priests and the entire council sought testimony against Jesus , so that they might deliver him to death , and they found none .
41014056	For many spoke false testimony against him , but their testimony did not agree .
41014057	And certain ones , rising up , bore false witness against him , saying :
41014058	“ For we heard him say , ‘ I will destroy this temple , made with hands , and within three days I will build another , not made with hands . ’ ”
41014059	And their testimony did not agree .
41014060	And the high priest , rising up in their midst , questioned Jesus , saying , “ Do you have nothing to say in answer to the things that are brought against you by these ones ? ”
41014061	But he was silent and gave no answer . Again , the high priest questioned him , and he said to him , “ Are you the Christ , the Son of the Blessed God ? ”
41014062	Then Jesus said to him : “ I am . And you shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of the power of God and arriving with the clouds of heaven . ”
41014063	Then the high priest , rending his garments , said : “ Why do we still require witnesses ?
41014064	You have heard the blasphemy . How does it seem to you ? ” And they all condemned him , as guilty unto death .
41014065	And some began to spit on him , and to cover his face and to strike him with fists , and to say to him , “ Prophesy . ” And the servants struck him with the palms their hands .
41014066	And while Peter was in the court below , one of the maidservants of the high priest arrived .
41014067	And when she had seen Peter warming himself , she stared at him , and she said : “ You also were with Jesus of Nazareth . ”
41014068	But he denied it , saying , “ I neither know nor understand what you saying . ” And he went outside , in front of the court ; and a rooster crowed .
41014069	Then again , when a maidservant had seen him , she began to say to the bystanders , “ For this is one of them . ”
41014070	But he denied it again . And after a little while , again those standing near said to Peter : “ In truth , you are one of them . For you , too , are a Galilean . ”
41014071	Then he began to curse and to swear , saying , “ For I do not know this man , about whom you are speaking . ”
41014072	And immediately the rooster crowed again . And Peter remembered the word that Jesus had said to him , “ Before the rooster crows twice , you will deny me three times . ” And he began to weep .
41015001	And immediately in the morning , after the leaders of the priests had taken counsel with the elders and the scribes and the entire council , binding Jesus , they led him away and delivered him to Pilate .
41015002	And Pilate questioned him , “ You are the king of the Jews ? ” But in response , he said to him , “ You are saying it . ”
41015003	And the leaders of the priests accused him in many things .
41015004	Then Pilate again questioned him , saying : “ Do you not have any response ? See how greatly they accuse you . ”
41015005	But Jesus continued to give no response , so that Pilate wondered .
41015006	Now on the feast day , he was accustomed to release to them one of the prisoners , whomever they requested .
41015007	But there was one called Barabbas , who had committed murder in the sedition , who was confined with those of the sedition .
41015008	And when the crowd had ascended , they began to petition him to do as he always did for them .
41015009	But Pilate answered them and said , “ Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews ? ”
41015010	For he knew that it was out of envy that the leaders of the priests had betrayed him .
41015011	Then the chief priests incited the crowd , so that he would release Barabbas to them instead .
41015012	But Pilate , responding again , said to them : “ Then what do you want me to do with the king of the Jews ? ”
41015013	But again they cried out , “ Crucify him . ”
41015014	Yet truly , Pilate said to them : “ Why ? What evil has he done ? ” But they cried out all the more , “ Crucify him . ”
41015015	Then Pilate , wishing to satisfy the people , released Barabbas to them , and he delivered Jesus , having severely scourged him , to be crucified .
41015016	Then the soldiers led him away to the court of the praetorium . And they called together the entire cohort .
41015017	And they clothed him with purple . And platting a crown of thorns , they placed it on him .
41015018	And they began to salute him : “ Hail , king of the Jews . ”
41015019	And they struck his head with a reed , and they spit on him . And kneeling down , they reverenced him .
41015020	And after they had mocked him , they stripped him of the purple , and they clothed him in his own garments . And they led him away , so that they might crucify him .
41015021	And they compelled a certain passerby , Simon the Cyrenian , who was arriving from the countryside , the father of Alexander and Rufus , to take up his cross .
41015022	And they led him through to the place called Golgotha , which means , ‘ the Place of Calvary . ’
41015023	And they gave him wine with myrrh to drink . But he did not accept it .
41015024	And while crucifying him , they divided his garments , casting lots over them , to see who would take what .
41015025	Now it was the third hour . And they crucified him .
41015026	And the title of his case was written as : THE KING OF THE JEWS .
41015027	And with him they crucified two robbers : one at his right , and the other at his left .
41015028	And the scripture was fulfilled , which says : “ And with the iniquitous he was reputed . ”
41015029	And the passersby blasphemed him , shaking their heads and saying , “ Ah , you who would destroy the temple of God , and in three days rebuild it ,
41015030	save yourself by descending from the cross . ”
41015031	And similarly the leaders of the priests , mocking him with the scribes , said to one another : “ He saved others . He is not able to save himself .
41015032	Let the Christ , the king of Israel , descend now from the cross , so that we may see and believe . ” Those who were crucified with him also insulted him .
41015033	And when the sixth hour arrived , a darkness occurred over the entire earth , until the ninth hour .
41015034	And at the ninth hour , Jesus cried out with a loud voice , saying , “ Eloi , Eloi , lamma sabacthani ? ” which means , “ My God , My God , why have you forsaken me ? ”
41015035	And some of those standing near , upon hearing this , said , “ Behold , he is calling Elijah . ”
41015036	Then one of them , running and filling a sponge with vinegar , and placing it around a reed , gave it to him to drink , saying : “ Wait . Let us see if Elijah will come to take him down . ”
41015037	Then Jesus , having emitted a loud cry , expired .
41015038	And the veil of the temple was torn in two , from the top to the bottom .
41015039	Then the centurion who stood opposite him , seeing that he had expired while crying out in this way , said : “ Truly , this man was the Son of God . ”
41015040	Now there were also women watching from a distance , among whom were Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joseph , and Salome ,
41015041	( and while he was in Galilee , they followed him and ministered to him ) and many other women , who had ascended along with him to Jerusalem .
41015042	And when evening had now arrived ( because it was the Preparation Day , which is before the Sabbath )
41015043	there arrived Joseph of Arimathea , a noble council member , who himself was also awaiting the kingdom of God . And he boldly entered to Pilate and petitioned for the body of Jesus .
41015044	But Pilate wondered if he had already died . And summoning a centurion , he questioned him as to whether he was already dead .
41015045	And when he had been informed by the centurion , he gave the body to Joseph .
41015046	Then Joseph , having bought a fine linen cloth , and taking him down , wrapped him in the fine linen and laid him in a sepulcher , which was hewn from a rock . And he rolled a stone to the entrance of the tomb .
41015047	Now Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph observed where he was laid .
41016001	And when the Sabbath had passed , Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James , and Salome bought aromatic spices , so that when they arrived they could anoint Jesus .
41016002	And very early in the morning , on the first of the Sabbaths , they went to the tomb , the sun having now risen .
41016003	And they said to one another , “ Who will roll back the stone for us , away from the entrance of the tomb ? ”
41016004	And looking , they saw that the stone was rolled back . For certainly it was very large .
41016005	And upon entering the tomb , they saw a young man sitting on the right side , covered with a white robe , and they were astonished .
41016006	And he said to them , “ Do not become frightened . You are seeking Jesus of Nazareth , the Crucified One . He has risen . He is not here . Behold , the place where they laid him .
41016007	But go , tell his disciples and Peter that he is going before you into Galilee . There you shall see him , just as he told you . ”
41016008	But they , going out , fled from the tomb . For trembling and fear had overwhelmed them . And they said nothing to anyone . For they were afraid .
41016009	But he , rising early on the first Sabbath , appeared first to Mary Magdalene , from whom he had cast out seven demons .
41016010	She went and announced it to those who had been with him , while they were mourning and weeping .
41016011	And they , upon hearing that he was alive and that he had been seen by her , did not believe it .
41016012	But after these events , he was shown in another likeness to two of them walking , as they were going out to the countryside .
41016013	And they , returning , reported it to the others ; neither did they believe them .
41016014	Finally , he appeared to the eleven , as they sat at table . And he rebuked them for their incredulity and hardness of heart , because they did not believe those who had seen that he had risen again .
41016015	And he said to them : “ Go forth to the whole world and preach the Gospel to every creature .
41016016	Whoever will have believed and been baptized will be saved . Yet truly , whoever will not have believed will be condemned .
41016017	Now these signs will accompany those who believe . In my name , they shall cast out demons . They will speak in new languages .
41016018	They will take up serpents , and , if they drink anything deadly , it will not harm them . They shall lay their hands upon the sick , and they will be well . ”
41016019	And indeed , the Lord Jesus , after he had spoken to them , was taken up into heaven , and he sits at the right hand of God .
41016020	Then they , setting out , preached everywhere , with the Lord cooperating and confirming the word by the accompanying signs .
42001001	Since , indeed , many have attempted to set in order a narrative of the things that have been completed among us ,
42001002	just as they have been handed on to those of us who from the beginning saw the same and were ministers of the word ,
42001003	so it seemed good to me also , having diligently followed everything from the beginning , to write to you , in an orderly manner , most excellent Theophilus ,
42001004	so that you might know the truthfulness of those words by which you have been instructed .
42001005	There was , in the days of Herod , king of Judea , a certain priest named Zechariah , of the section of Abijah , and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron , and her name was Elizabeth .
42001006	Now they were both just before God , progressing in all of the commandments and the justifications of the Lord without blame .
42001007	And they had no child , because Elizabeth was barren , and they both had become advanced in years .
42001008	Then it happened that , when he was exercising the priesthood before God , in the order of his section ,
42001009	according to the custom of the priesthood , the lot fell so that he would offer incense , entering into the temple of the Lord .
42001010	And the entire multitude of the people was praying outside , at the hour of incense .
42001011	Then there appeared to him an Angel of the Lord , standing at the right of the altar of incense .
42001012	And upon seeing him , Zechariah was disturbed , and fear fell over him .
42001013	But the Angel said to him : “ Do not be afraid , Zechariah , for your prayer has been heard , and your wife Elizabeth shall bear a son to you . And you shall call his name John .
42001014	And there will be joy and exultation for you , and many will rejoice in his nativity .
42001015	For he will be great in the sight of the Lord , and he will not drink wine or strong drink , and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit , even from his mother’s womb .
42001016	And he will convert many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God .
42001017	And he will go before him with the spirit and power of Elijah , so that he may turn the hearts of the fathers to the sons , and the incredulous to the prudence of the just , so as to prepare for the Lord a completed people . ”
42001018	And Zechariah said to the Angel : “ How may I know this ? For I am elderly , and my wife is advanced in years . ”
42001019	And in response , the Angel said to him : “ I am Gabriel , who stands before God , and I have been sent to speak to you , and to proclaim these things to you .
42001020	And behold , you will be silent and unable to speak , until the day on which these things shall be , because you have not believed my words , which will be fulfilled in their time . ”
42001021	And the people were waiting for Zechariah . And they wondered why he was being delayed in the temple .
42001022	Then , when he came out , he was unable to speak to them . And they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple . And he was making signs to them , but he remained mute .
42001023	And it happened that , after the days of his office were completed , he went away to his house .
42001024	Then , after those days , his wife Elizabeth conceived , and she hid herself for five months , saying :
42001025	“ For the Lord did this for me , at the time when he decided to take away my reproach among men . ”
42001026	Then , in the sixth month , the Angel Gabriel was sent by God , to a city of Galilee named Nazareth ,
42001027	to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph , of the house of David ; and the name of the virgin was Mary .
42001028	And upon entering , the Angel said to her : “ Hail , full of grace . The Lord is with you . Blessed are you among women . ”
42001029	And when she had heard this , she was disturbed by his words , and she considered what kind of greeting this might be .
42001030	And the Angel said to her : “ Do not be afraid , Mary , for you have found grace with God .
42001031	Behold , you shall conceive in your womb , and you shall bear a son , and you shall call his name : JESUS .
42001032	He will be great , and he will be called the Son of the Most High , and the Lord God will give him the throne of David his father . And he will reign in the house of Jacob for eternity .
42001033	And his kingdom shall have no end . ”
42001034	Then Mary said to the Angel , “ How shall this be done , since I do not know man ? ”
42001035	And in response , the Angel said to her : “ The Holy Spirit will pass over you , and the power of the Most High will overshadow you . And because of this also , the Holy One who will be born of you shall be called the Son of God .
42001036	And behold , your cousin Elizabeth has herself also conceived a son , in her old age . And this is the sixth month for her who is called barren .
42001037	For no word will be impossible with God . ”
42001038	Then Mary said : “ Behold , I am the handmaid of the Lord . Let it be done to me according to your word . ” And the Angel departed from her .
42001039	And in those days , Mary , rising up , traveled quickly into the hill country , to a city of Judah .
42001040	And she entered into the house of Zechariah , and she greeted Elizabeth .
42001041	And it happened that , as Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary , the infant leaped in her womb , and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit .
42001042	And she cried out with a loud voice and said : “ Blessed are you among women , and blessed is the fruit of your womb .
42001043	And how does this concern me , so that the mother of my Lord would come to me ?
42001044	For behold , as the voice of your greeting came to my ears , the infant in my womb leaped for joy .
42001045	And blessed are you who believed , for the things that were spoken to you by the Lord shall be accomplished . ”
42001046	And Mary said : “ My soul magnifies the Lord .
42001047	And my spirit leaps for joy in God my Saviour .
42001048	For he has looked with favor on the humility of his handmaid . For behold , from this time , all generations shall call me blessed .
42001049	For he who is great has done great things for me , and holy is his name .
42001050	And his mercy is from generation to generations for those who fear him .
42001051	He has accomplished powerful deeds with his arm . He has scattered the arrogant in the intentions of their heart .
42001052	He has deposed the powerful from their seat , and he has exalted the humble .
42001053	He has filled the hungry with good things , and the rich he has sent away empty .
42001054	He has taken up his servant Israel , mindful of his mercy ,
42001055	just as he spoke to our fathers : to Abraham and to his offspring forever . ”
42001056	Then Mary stayed with her for about three months . And she returned to her own house .
42001057	Now the time for Elizabeth to give birth arrived , and she brought forth a son .
42001058	And her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy with her , and so they congratulated her .
42001059	And it happened that , on the eighth day , they arrived to circumcise the boy , and they called him by his father’s name , Zechariah .
42001060	And in response , his mother said : “ Not so . Instead , he shall be called John . ”
42001061	And they said to her , “ But there is no one among your relatives who is called by that name . ”
42001062	Then they made signs to his father , as to what he wanted him to be called .
42001063	And requesting a writing tablet , he wrote , saying : “ His name is John . ” And they all wondered .
42001064	Then , at once , his mouth was opened , and his tongue loosened , and he spoke , blessing God .
42001065	And fear fell upon all of their neighbors . And all these words were made known throughout all the hill country of Judea .
42001066	And all those who heard it stored it up in their heart , saying : “ What do you think this boy will be ? ” And indeed , the hand of the Lord was with him .
42001067	And his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit . And he prophesied , saying :
42001068	“ Blessed is the Lord God of Israel . For he has visited and has wrought the redemption of his people .
42001069	And he has raised up a horn of salvation for us , in the house of David his servant ,
42001070	just as he spoke by the mouth of his holy Prophets , who are from ages past :
42001071	salvation from our enemies , and from the hand of all those who hate us ,
42001072	to accomplish mercy with our fathers , and to call to mind his holy testament ,
42001073	the oath , which he swore to Abraham , our father , that he would grant to us ,
42001074	so that , having been freed from the hand of our enemies , we may serve him without fear ,
42001075	in holiness and in justice before him , throughout all our days .
42001076	And you , child , shall be called the prophet of the Most High . For you will go before the face of the Lord : to prepare his ways ,
42001077	to give knowledge of salvation to his people for the remission of their sins ,
42001078	through the heart of the mercy of our God , by which , descending from on high , he has visited us ,
42001079	to illuminate those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death , and to direct our feet in the way of peace . ”
42001080	And the child grew , and he was strengthened in spirit . And he was in the wilderness , until the day of his manifestation to Israel .
42002001	And it happened in those days that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus , so that the whole world would be enrolled .
42002002	This was the first enrollment ; it was made by the ruler of Syria , Quirinius .
42002003	And all went to be declared , each one to his own city .
42002004	Then Joseph also ascended from Galilee , from the city of Nazareth , into Judea , to the city of David , which is called Bethlehem , because he was of the house and family of David ,
42002005	in order to be declared , with Mary his espoused wife , who was with child .
42002006	Then it happened that , while they were there , the days were completed , so that she would give birth .
42002007	And she brought forth her firstborn son . And she wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger , because there was no room for them at the inn .
42002008	And there were shepherds in the same region , being vigilant and keeping watch in the night over their flock .
42002009	And behold , an Angel of the Lord stood near them , and the brightness of God shone around them , and they were struck with a great fear .
42002010	And the Angel said to them : “ Do not be afraid . For , behold , I proclaim to you a great joy , which will be for all the people .
42002011	For today a Saviour has been born for you in the city of David : he is Christ the Lord .
42002012	And this will be a sign for you : you will find the infant wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger . ”
42002013	And suddenly there was with the Angel a multitude of the celestial army , praising God and saying ,
42002014	“ Glory to God in the highest , and on earth peace to men of good will . ”
42002015	And it happened that , when the Angels had departed from them into heaven , the shepherds said to one another , “ Let us cross over to Bethlehem and see this word , which has happened , which the Lord has revealed to us . ”
42002016	And they went quickly . And they found Mary and Joseph ; and the infant was lying in a manger .
42002017	Then , upon seeing this , they understood the word that had been spoken to them about this boy .
42002018	And all who heard it were amazed by this , and by those things which were told to them by the shepherds .
42002019	But Mary kept all these words , pondering them in her heart .
42002020	And the shepherds returned , glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen , just as it was told to them .
42002021	And after eight days were ended , so that the boy would be circumcised , his name was called JESUS , just as he was called by the Angel before he was conceived in the womb .
42002022	And after the days of her purification were fulfilled , according to the law of Moses , they brought him to Jerusalem , in order to present him to the Lord ,
42002023	just as it is written in the law of the Lord , “ For every male opening the womb shall be called holy to the Lord , ”
42002024	and in order to offer a sacrifice , according to what is said in the law of the Lord , “ a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons . ”
42002025	And behold , there was a man in Jerusalem , whose name was Simeon , and this man was just and God-fearing , awaiting the consolation of Israel . And the Holy Spirit was with him .
42002026	And he had received an answer from the Holy Spirit : that he would not see his own death before he had seen the Christ of the Lord .
42002027	And he went with the Spirit to the temple . And when the child Jesus was brought in by his parents , in order to act on his behalf according to the custom of the law ,
42002028	he also took him up , into his arms , and he blessed God and said :
42002029	“ Now you may dismiss your servant in peace , O Lord , according to your word .
42002030	For my eyes have seen your salvation ,
42002031	which you have prepared before the face of all peoples :
42002032	the light of revelation to the nations and the glory of your people Israel . ”
42002033	And his father and mother were wondering over these things , which were spoken about him .
42002034	And Simeon blessed them , and he said to his mother Mary : “ Behold , this one has been set for the ruin and for the resurrection of many in Israel , and as a sign which will be contradicted .
42002035	And a sword will pass through your own soul , so that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed . ”
42002036	And there was a prophetess , Anna , a daughter of Phanuel , from the tribe of Asher . She was very advanced in years , and she had lived with her husband for seven years from her virginity .
42002037	And then she was a widow , even to her eighty-fourth year . And without departing from the temple , she was a servant to fasting and prayer , night and day .
42002038	And entering at the same hour , she confessed to the Lord . And she spoke about him to all who were awaiting the redemption of Israel .
42002039	And after they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord , they returned to Galilee , to their city , Nazareth .
42002040	Now the child grew , and he was strengthened with the fullness of wisdom . And the grace of God was in him .
42002041	And his parents went every year to Jerusalem , at the time of the solemnity of Passover .
42002042	And when he had become twelve years old , they ascended to Jerusalem , according to the custom of the feast day .
42002043	And having completed the days , when they returned , the boy Jesus remained in Jerusalem . And his parents did not realize this .
42002044	But , supposing that he was in the company , they went a day’s journey , seeking him among their relatives and acquaintances .
42002045	And not finding him , they returned to Jerusalem , seeking him .
42002046	And it happened that , after three days , they found him in the temple , sitting in the midst of the doctors , listening to them and questioning them .
42002047	But all who listened to him were astonished over his prudence and his responses .
42002048	And upon seeing him , they wondered . And his mother said to him : “ Son , why have you acted this way toward us ? Behold , your father and I were seeking you in sorrow . ”
42002049	And he said to them : “ How is it that you were seeking me ? For did you not know that it is necessary for me to be in these things which are of my Father ? ”
42002050	And they did not understand the word that he spoke to them .
42002051	And he descended with them and went to Nazareth . And he was subordinate to them . And his mother kept all these words in her heart .
42002052	And Jesus advanced in wisdom , and in age , and in grace , with God and men .
42003001	Then , in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar , Pontius Pilate being procurator of Judea , and Herod tetrarch of Galilee , and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis , and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene ,
42003002	under the high priests Annas and Caiaphas : the word of the Lord came to John , the son of Zechariah , in the wilderness .
42003003	And he went into the entire region of the Jordan , preaching a baptism of repentance for the remission of sins ,
42003004	just as it has been written in the book of the sermons of the prophet Isaiah : “ The voice of one crying out in the wilderness : Prepare the way of the Lord . Make straight his paths .
42003005	Every valley shall be filled , and every mountain and hill shall be brought low . And what is crooked shall be made straight . And the rough paths shall be made into level ways .
42003006	And all flesh shall see the salvation of God . ”
42003007	Therefore , he said to the crowd that went out in order to be baptized by him : “ You progeny of vipers ! Who told you to flee from the approaching wrath ?
42003008	So then , produce fruits worthy of repentance . And do not begin to say , ‘ We have Abraham as our father . ’ For I tell you that God has the power to raise up sons to Abraham from these stones .
42003009	For even now the axe has been placed at the root of the trees . Therefore , every tree that does not produce good fruit shall be cut down and cast into the fire . ”
42003010	And the crowed was questioning him , saying , “ What then should we do ? ”
42003011	But in response , he said to them : “ Whoever has two coats , let him give to those who do not have . And whoever has food , let him act similarly . ”
42003012	Now the tax collectors also came to be baptized , and they said to him , “ Teacher , what should we do ? ”
42003013	But he said to them , “ You should do nothing more than what has been appointed to you . ”
42003014	Then the soldiers also questioned him , saying , “ And what should we do ? ” And he said to them : “ You should strike no one , and you should not make false accusations . And be content with your pay . ”
42003015	Now all were thinking about John in their hearts , and the people were supposing that perhaps he might be the Christ .
42003016	John responded by saying to everyone : “ Indeed , I baptize you with water . But there will arrive one stronger than me , the laces of whose shoes I am not worthy to loosen . He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit , and with fire .
42003017	His winnowing fan is in his hand . And he will purify his threshing floor . And he will gather the wheat into the barn . But the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire . ”
42003018	Indeed , he also proclaimed many other things , exhorting the people .
42003019	But Herod the tetrarch , when he was corrected by him concerning Herodias , his brother’s wife , and concerning all the evils that Herod had done ,
42003020	added this also , above all else : that he confined John to prison .
42003021	Now it happened that , when all the people were being baptized , Jesus was baptized ; and as he was praying , heaven was opened .
42003022	And the Holy Spirit , in a corporal appearance like a dove , descended upon him . And a voice came from heaven : “ You are my beloved Son . In you , I am well pleased . ”
42003023	And Jesus himself was beginning to be about thirty years old , being ( as it was supposed ) the son of Joseph , who was of Heli , who was of Matthat ,
42003024	who was of Levi , who was of Melchi , who was of Jannai , who was of Joseph ,
42003025	who was of Mattathias , who was of Amos , who was of Nahum , who was of Esli , who was of Naggai ,
42003026	who was of Maath , who was of Mattathias , who was of Semein , who was of Josech , who was of Joda ,
42003027	who was of Joanan , who was of Rhesa , who was of Zerubbabel , who was of Shealtiel , who was of Neri ,
42003028	who was of Melchi , who was of Addi , who was of Cosam , who was of Elmadam , who was of Er ,
42003029	who was of Joshua , who was of Eliezer , who was of Jorim , who was of Matthat , who was of Levi ,
42003030	who was of Simeon , who was of Judah , who was of Joseph , who was of Jonam , who was of Eliakim ,
42003031	who was of Melea , who was of Menna , who was of Mattatha , who was of Nathan , who was of David ,
42003032	who was of Jesse , who was of Obed , who was of Boaz , who was of Salmon , who was of Nahshon ,
42003033	who was of Amminadab , who was of Aram , who was of Hezron , who was of Perez , who was of Judah ,
42003034	who was of Jacob , who was of Isaac , who was of Abraham , who was of Terah , who was of Nahor ,
42003035	who was of Serug , who was of Reu , who was of Peleg , who was of Eber , who was of Shelah ,
42003036	who was of Cainan , who was of Arphaxad , who was of Shem , who was Of Noah , who was of Lamech ,
42003037	who was of Methuselah , who was of Enoch , who was of Jared , who was of Mahalalel , who was of Cainan ,
42003038	who was of Enos , who was of Seth , who was of Adam , who was of God .
42004001	And Jesus , filled with the Holy Spirit , returned from the Jordan . And he was urged by the Spirit into the wilderness
42004002	for forty days , and he was tested by the devil . And he ate nothing in those days . And when they were completed , he was hungry .
42004003	Then the devil said to him , “ If you are the Son of God , speak to this stone , so that it may be made into bread . ”
42004004	And Jesus answered him , “ It is written : ‘ Man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word of God . ’ ”
42004005	And the devil led him onto a high mountain , and he showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time ,
42004006	and he said to him : “ To you , I will give all this power , and its glory . For they have been handed over to me , and I give them to whomever I wish .
42004007	Therefore , if you will worship before me , all will be yours . ”
42004008	And in response , Jesus said to him : “ It is written : ‘ You shall worship the Lord your God , and you shall serve him alone . ’ ”
42004009	And he brought him to Jerusalem , and he set him on the parapet of the temple , and he said to him : “ If you are the Son of God , cast yourself down from here .
42004010	For it is written that he has given his Angels charge over you , so that they may guard you ,
42004011	and so that they may take you into their hands , lest perhaps you may hurt your foot against a stone . ”
42004012	And in response , Jesus said to him , “ It is said : ‘ You shall not tempt the Lord your God . ’ ”
42004013	And when all the temptation was completed , the devil withdrew from him , until a time .
42004014	And Jesus returned , in the power of the Spirit , into Galilee . And his fame spread throughout the entire region .
42004015	And he taught in their synagogues , and he was magnified by everyone .
42004016	And he went to Nazareth , where he had been raised . And he entered into the synagogue , according to his custom , on the Sabbath day . And he rose up to read .
42004017	And the book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him . And as he unrolled the book , he found the place where it was written :
42004018	“ The Spirit of the Lord is upon me ; because of this , he has anointed me . He has sent me to evangelize the poor , to heal the contrite of heart ,
42004019	to preach forgiveness to captives and sight to the blind , to release the broken into forgiveness , to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of retribution . ”
42004020	And when he had rolled up the book , he returned it to the minister , and he sat down . And the eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fixed on him .
42004021	Then he began to say to them , “ On this day , this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing . ”
42004022	And everyone gave testimony to him . And they wondered at the words of grace that proceeded from his mouth . And they said , “ Is this not the son of Joseph ? ”
42004023	And he said to them : “ Certainly , you will recite to me this saying , ‘ Physician , heal yourself . ’ The many great things that we have heard were done in Capernaum , do here also in your own country . ”
42004024	Then he said : “ Amen I say to you , that no prophet is accepted in his own country .
42004025	In truth , I say to you , there were many widows in the days of Elijah in Israel , when the heavens were closed for three years and six months , when a great famine had occurred throughout the entire land .
42004026	And to none of these was Elijah sent , except to Zarephath of Sidon , to a woman who was a widow .
42004027	And there were many lepers in Israel under the prophet Elisha . And none of these was cleansed , except Naaman the Syrian . ”
42004028	And all those in the synagogue , upon hearing these things , were filled with anger .
42004029	And they rose up and drove him beyond the city . And they brought him all the way to the edge of the mount , upon which their city had been built , so that they might thrown him down violently .
42004030	But passing through their midst , he went away .
42004031	And he descended to Capernaum , a city of Galilee . And there he taught them on the Sabbaths .
42004032	And they were astonished at his doctrine , for his word was spoken with authority .
42004033	And in the synagogue , there was a man who had an unclean demon , and he cried out with a loud voice ,
42004034	saying : “ Let us alone . What are we to you , Jesus of Nazareth ? Have you come to destroy us ? I know you who you are : the Holy One of God . ”
42004035	And Jesus rebuked him , saying , “ Be silent and depart from him . ” And when the demon had thrown him into their midst , he departed from him , and he no longer harmed him .
42004036	And fear fell over them all . And they discussed this among themselves , saying : “ What is this word ? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits , and they depart . ”
42004037	And his fame spread to every place in the region .
42004038	Then Jesus , rising up from the synagogue , entered into the house of Simon . Now Simon’s mother-in-law was in the grip of a severe fever . And they petitioned him on her behalf .
42004039	And standing over her , he commanded the fever , and it left her . And promptly rising up , she ministered to them .
42004040	Then , when the sun had set , all those who had anyone afflicted with various diseases brought them to him . Then , laying his hands on each one of them , he cured them .
42004041	Now demons departed from many of them , crying out and saying , “ You are the son of God . ” And rebuking them , he would not permit them to speak . For they knew him to be the Christ .
42004042	Then , when it was daytime , going out , he went to a deserted place . And the crowds sought him , and they went all the way to him . And they detained him , so that he would not depart from them .
42004043	And he said to them , “ I must also preach the kingdom of God to other cities , because it was for this reason that I was sent . ”
42004044	And he was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee .
42005001	Now it happened that , when the crowds pressed toward him , so that they might hear the word of God , he was standing beside the lake of Genesaret .
42005002	And he saw two boats standing beside the lake . But the fishermen had climbed down , and they were washing their nets .
42005003	And so , climbing into one of the boats , which belonged to Simon , he asked him to draw back a little from the land . And sitting down , he taught the crowds from the boat .
42005004	Then , when he had ceased speaking , he said to Simon , “ Lead us into deep water , and release your nets for a catch . ”
42005005	And in response , Simon said to him : “ Teacher , working throughout the night , we caught nothing . But on your word , I will release the net . ”
42005006	And when they had done this , they enclosed such a copious multitude of fish that their net was rupturing .
42005007	And they signaled to their associates , who were in the other boat , so that they would come and help them . And they came and filled both boats , so that they were nearly submerged .
42005008	But when Simon Peter had seen this , he fell down at the knees of Jesus , saying , “ Depart from me , Lord , for I am a sinful man . ”
42005009	For astonishment had enveloped him , and all who were with him , at the catch of fish that they had taken .
42005010	Now the same was true of James and John , the sons of Zebedee , who were associates of Simon . And Jesus said to Simon : “ Do not be afraid . From now on , you will be catching men . ”
42005011	And having led their boats to land , leaving behind everything , they followed him .
42005012	And it happened that , while he was in a certain city , behold , there was a man full of leprosy who , upon seeing Jesus and falling to his face , petitioned him , saying : “ Lord , if you are willing , you are able to cleanse me . ”
42005013	And extending his hand , he touched him , saying : “ I am willing . Be cleansed . ” And at once , the leprosy departed from him .
42005014	And he instructed him that he should tell no one , “ But go , show yourself to the priest , and make the offering for your cleansing , just as Moses has commanded , as a testimony for them . ”
42005015	Yet word of him traveled around all the more . And great crowds came together , so that they might listen and be cured by him from their infirmities .
42005016	And he withdrew into the desert and prayed .
42005017	And it happened , on a certain day , that he again sat down , teaching . And there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting nearby , who had come from every town of Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem . And the power of the Lord was present , to heal them .
42005018	And behold , some men were carrying in the bed of a man who was paralyzed . And they sought a way to bring him in , and to place him before him .
42005019	And not finding a way by which they might bring him in , because of the crowd , they climbed up to the roof , and they let him down through the roof tiles with his bed , into their midst , in front of Jesus .
42005020	And when he saw his faith , he said , “ Man , your sins are forgiven you . ”
42005021	And the scribes and Pharisees began to think , saying : “ Who is this , who is speaking blasphemies ? Who is able to forgive sins , except God alone ? ”
42005022	But when Jesus realized their thoughts , responding , he said to them : “ What are you thinking in your hearts ?
42005023	Which is easier to say : ‘ Your sins are forgiven you , ’ or to say , ‘ Rise up and walk ? ’
42005024	But so that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins , ” he said to the paralytic , “ I say to you to : Rise up , take up your bed , and go into your house . ”
42005025	And at once , rising up in their sight , he took up the bed on which he was lying , and he went away to his own house , magnifying God .
42005026	And astonishment took hold of everyone , and they were magnifying God . And they were filled with fear , saying : “ For we have seen miracles today . ”
42005027	And after these things , he went out , and he saw a tax collector named Levi , sitting at the customs office . And he said to him , “ Follow me . ”
42005028	And leaving behind everything , rising up , he followed him .
42005029	And Levi made a great feast for him in his own house . And there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others , who were sitting at table with them .
42005030	But the Pharisees and scribes were murmuring , saying to his disciples , “ Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners ? ”
42005031	And responding , Jesus said to them : “ It is not those who are well who need a doctor , but those who have maladies .
42005032	I have not come to call the just , but sinners to repentance . ”
42005033	But they said to him , “ Why do the disciples of John fast frequently , and make supplications , and those of the Pharisees act similarly , while yours eat and drink ? ”
42005034	And he said to them : “ How can you cause the sons of the groom to fast , while the groom is still with them ?
42005035	But the days will come when the groom will be taken away from them , and then they will fast , in those days . ”
42005036	Then he also made a comparison for them : “ For no one sews a patch from a new garment onto an old garment . Otherwise , he both disrupts the new one , and the patch from the new one does not join together with the old one .
42005037	And no one puts new wine into old wineskins . Otherwise , the new wine ruptures the wineskins , and it will be poured out , and the wineskins will be lost .
42005038	Instead , the new wine is put into new wineskins , and both are preserved .
42005039	And no one who is drinking the old , soon wishes for the new . For he says , ‘ The old is better . ’ ”
42006001	Now it happened that , on the second first Sabbath , as he passed through the grain field , his disciples were separating the ears of grain and eating them , by rubbing them in their hands .
42006002	Then certain Pharisees said to them , “ Why are you doing what is not lawful on the Sabbaths ? ”
42006003	And responding to them , Jesus said : “ Have you not read this , what David did when he was hungry , and those who were with him ?
42006004	How he entered into the house of God , and took the bread of the Presence , and ate it , and gave it to those who were with him , though it is not lawful for anyone to eat it , except the priests alone ? ”
42006005	And he said to them , “ For the Son of man is Lord , even of the Sabbath . ”
42006006	And it happened that , on another Sabbath , he entered into the synagogue , and he taught . And there was a man there , and his right hand was withered .
42006007	And the scribes and Pharisees observed whether he would heal on the Sabbath , so that they might thereby find an accusation against him .
42006008	Yet truly , he knew their thoughts , and so he said to the man who had the withered hand , “ Rise up and stand in the middle . ” And rising up , he stood still .
42006009	Then Jesus said to them : “ I ask you if it is lawful on the Sabbaths to do good , or to do evil ? To give health to a life , or to destroy it ? ”
42006010	And looking around at everyone , he said to the man , “ Extend your hand . ” And he extended it . And his hand was restored .
42006011	Then they were filled with madness , and they discussed with one another , what , in particular , they might do about Jesus .
42006012	And it happened that , in those days , he went out to a mountain to pray . And he was in the prayer of God throughout the night .
42006013	And when daylight had arrived , he called his disciples . And he chose twelve out of them ( whom he also named Apostles ) :
42006014	Simon , whom he surnamed Peter , and Andrew his brother , James and John , Philip and Bartholomew ,
42006015	Matthew and Thomas , James of Alphaeus , and Simon who is called the Zealot ,
42006016	and Jude of James , and Judas Iscariot , who was a traitor .
42006017	And descending with them , he stood in a level place with a multitude of his disciples , and a copious multitude of people from all of Judea and Jerusalem and the seacoast , and Tyre and Sidon ,
42006018	who had come so that they might listen to him and be healed of their diseases . And those who were troubled by unclean spirits were cured .
42006019	And the entire crowd was trying to touch him , because power went out from him and healed all .
42006020	And lifting up his eyes to his disciples , he said : “ Blessed are you poor , for yours is the kingdom of God .
42006021	Blessed are you who are hungry now , for you shall be satisfied . Blessed are you who are weeping now , for you shall laugh .
42006022	Blessed shall you be when men will have hated you , and when they will have separated you and reproached you , and thrown out your name as if evil , because of the Son of man .
42006023	Be glad in that day and exult . For behold , your reward is great in heaven . For these same things their fathers did to the prophets .
42006024	Yet truly , woe to you who are wealthy , for you have your consolation .
42006025	Woe to you who are satisfied , for you will be hungry . Woe to you who laugh now , for you will mourn and weep .
42006026	Woe to you when men will have blessed you . For these same things their fathers did to the false prophets .
42006027	But I say to you who are listening : Love your enemies . Do good to those who hate you .
42006028	Bless those who curse you , and pray for those who slander you .
42006029	And to him who strikes you on the cheek , offer the other also . And from him who takes away your coat , do not withhold even your tunic .
42006030	But distribute to all who ask of you . And do not ask again of him who takes away what is yours .
42006031	And exactly as you would want people to treat you , treat them also the same .
42006032	And if you love those who love you , what credit is due to you ? For even sinners love those who love them .
42006033	And if you will do good to those who do good to you , what credit is due to you ? Indeed , even sinners behave this way .
42006034	And if you will loan to those from whom you hope to receive , what credit is due to you ? For even sinners lend to sinners , in order to receive the same in return .
42006035	So truly , love your enemies . Do good , and lend , hoping for nothing in return . And then your reward will be great , and you will be sons of the Most High , for he himself is kind to the ungrateful and to the wicked .
42006036	Therefore , be merciful , just as your Father is also merciful .
42006037	Do not judge , and you will not be judged . Do not condemn , and you will not be condemned . Forgive , and you will be forgiven .
42006038	Give , and it will be given to you : a good measure , pressed down and shaken together and overflowing , they will place upon your lap . Certainly , the same measure that you use to measure out , will be used to measure back to you again . ”
42006039	Now he told them another comparison : “ How can the blind lead the blind ? Would they not both fall into a pit ?
42006040	The disciple is not above his teacher . But each one will be perfected , if he is like his teacher .
42006041	And why do you see the straw that is in your brother’s eye , while the log that is in your own eye , you do not consider ?
42006042	Or how can you say to your brother , ‘ Brother , allow me to remove the straw from your eye , ’ while you yourself do not see the log in your own eye ? Hypocrite , first remove the log from your own eye , and then will you see clearly , so that you may lead out the straw from your brother’s eye .
42006043	For there is no good tree which produces bad fruit , nor does an evil tree produce good fruit .
42006044	For each and every tree is known by its fruit . For they do not gather figs from thorns , nor do they gather the grape from the bramble bush .
42006045	A good man , from the good storehouse of his heart , offers what is good . And an evil man , from the evil storehouse , offers what is evil . For out of the abundance of the heart , the mouth speaks .
42006046	But why do you call me , ‘ Lord , Lord , ’ and not do what I say ?
42006047	Anyone who comes to me , and listens to my words , and does them : I will reveal to you what he is like .
42006048	He is like a man building a house , who has dug deep and has laid the foundation upon the rock . Then , when the floodwaters came , the river was rushing against that house , and it was not able to move it . For it was founded upon the rock .
42006049	But whoever hears and does not do : he is like a man building his house upon the soil , without a foundation . The river rushed against it , and it soon fell down , and the ruin of that house was great . ”
42007001	And when he had completed all his words in the hearing of the people , he entered Capernaum .
42007002	Now the servant of a certain centurion was dying , due to an illness . And he was very dear to him .
42007003	And when he had heard about Jesus , he sent elders of the Jews to him , petitioning him , so that he would come and heal his servant .
42007004	And when they had come to Jesus , they petitioned him anxiously , saying to him : “ He is worthy that you should provide this to him .
42007005	For he loves our nation , and he has built a synagogue for us . ”
42007006	Then Jesus went with them . And when he was now not far from the house , the centurion sent friends to him , saying : “ Lord , do not trouble yourself . For I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof .
42007007	Because of this , I also did not consider myself worthy to come to you . But say the word , and my servant shall be healed .
42007008	For I also am a man placed under authority , having soldiers under me . And I say to one , ‘ Go , ’ and he goes ; and to another , ‘ Come , ’ and he comes ; and to my servant , ‘ Do this , ’ and he does it . ”
42007009	And upon hearing this , Jesus was amazed . And turning to the multitude following him , he said , “ Amen I say to you , not even in Israel have I found such great faith . ”
42007010	And those who had been sent , upon returning to the house , found that the servant , who had been sick , was now healthy .
42007011	And it happened afterwards that he went to a city , which is called Nain . And his disciples , and an abundant crowd , went with him .
42007012	Then , when he had drawn near to the gate of the city , behold , a deceased person was being carried out , the only son of his mother , and she was a widow . And a large crowd from the city was with her .
42007013	And when the Lord had seen her , being moved by mercy over her , he said to her , “ Do not weep . ”
42007014	And he drew near and touched the coffin . Then those who carried it stood still . And he said , “ Young man , I say to you , arise . ”
42007015	And the dead youth sat up and began to speak . And he gave him to his mother .
42007016	Then fear fell over all of them . And they magnified God , saying : “ For a great prophet has risen up among us , ” and , “ For God has visited his people . ”
42007017	And this word about him went out to all of Judea and to the entire surrounding region .
42007018	And the disciples of John reported to him concerning all these things .
42007019	And John called two of his disciples , and he sent them to Jesus , saying , “ Are you he who is to come , or should we wait for another ? ”
42007020	But when the men had come to him , they said : “ John the Baptist has sent us to you , saying : ‘ Are you he who is to come , or should we wait for another ? ’ ”
42007021	Now in that same hour , he cured many of their diseases and wounds and evil spirits ; and to many of the blind , he gave sight .
42007022	And responding , he said to them : “ Go and report to John what you have heard and seen : that the blind see , the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed , the deaf hear , the dead rise again , the poor are evangelized .
42007023	And blessed is anyone who has not taken offense at me . ”
42007024	And when the messengers of John had withdrawn , he began to speak about John to the crowds . “ What did you go out to the desert to see ? A reed shaken by the wind ?
42007025	Then what did you go out to see ? A man clothed in soft garments ? Behold , those who are in costly apparel and finery are in the houses of kings .
42007026	Then what did you go out to see ? A prophet ? Certainly , I tell you , and more than a prophet .
42007027	This is he of whom it is written : “ Behold , I send my Angel before your face , who shall prepare your way before you . ”
42007028	For I say to you , among those born of women , no one is greater than the prophet John the Baptist . But he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he . ”
42007029	And upon hearing this , all the people and the tax collectors justified God , by being baptized with the baptism of John .
42007030	But the Pharisees and the experts in the law despised the counsel of God concerning themselves , by not being baptized by him .
42007031	Then the Lord said : “ Therefore , to what shall I compare the men of this generation ? And to what are they similar ?
42007032	They are like children sitting in the marketplace , talking with one another , and saying : ‘ We sang to you , and you did not dance . We lamented , and you did not weep . ’
42007033	For John the Baptist came , neither eating bread nor drinking wine , and you say , ‘ He has a demon . ’
42007034	The Son of man came , eating and drinking , and you say , ‘ Behold , a voracious man and a drinker of wine , a friend of tax collectors and of sinners . ’
42007035	But wisdom is justified by all her children . ”
42007036	Then certain Pharisees petitioned him , so that they might eat with him . And he went into the house of the Pharisee , and he reclined at table .
42007037	And behold , a woman who was in the city , a sinner , found out that he was reclining at table in the house of the Pharisee , so she brought an alabaster container of ointment .
42007038	And standing behind him , beside his feet , she began to wash his feet with tears , and she wiped them with the hair of her head , and she kissed his feet , and she anointed them with ointment .
42007039	Then the Pharisee , who had invited him , upon seeing this , spoke within himself , saying , “ This man , if he were a prophet , would certainly know who and what kind of woman is this , who is touching him : that she is a sinner . ”
42007040	And in response , Jesus said to him , “ Simon , I have something to say to you . ” So he said , “ Speak , Teacher . ”
42007041	“ A certain creditor had two debtors : one owed five hundred denarii , and the other fifty .
42007042	And since they did not have the ability to repay him , he forgave them both . So then , which of them loves him more ? ”
42007043	In response , Simon said , “ I suppose that it is he to whom he forgave the most . ” And he said to him , “ You have judged correctly . ”
42007044	And turning to the woman , he said to Simon : “ Do you see this woman ? I entered into your house . You gave me no water for my feet . But she has washed my feet with tears , and has wiped them with her hair .
42007045	You gave no kiss to me . But she , from the time that she entered , has not ceased to kiss my feet .
42007046	You did not anoint my head with oil . But she has anointed my feet with ointment .
42007047	Because of this , I tell you : many sins are forgiven her , because she has loved much . But he who is forgiven less , loves less . ”
42007048	Then he said to her , “ Your sins are forgiven you . ”
42007049	And those who sat at table with him began to say within themselves , “ Who is this , who even forgives sins ? ”
42007050	Then he said to the woman : “ Your faith has brought you salvation . Go in peace . ”
42008001	And it happened afterwards that he was making a journey through the cities and towns , preaching and evangelizing the kingdom of God . And the twelve were with him ,
42008002	along with certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities : Mary , who is called Magdalene , from whom seven demons had departed ,
42008003	and Joanna , the wife of Chuza , Herod’s steward , and Susanna , and many other women , who were ministering to him from their resources .
42008004	Then , when a very numerous crowd was gathering together and hurrying from the cities to him , he spoke using a comparison :
42008005	“ The sower went out to sow his seed . And as he sowed , some fell beside the way ; and it was trampled and the birds of the air devoured it .
42008006	And some fell upon rock ; and having sprung up , it withered away , because it had no moisture .
42008007	And some fell among thorns ; and the thorns , rising up with it , suffocated it .
42008008	And some fell upon good soil ; and having sprung up , it produced fruit one hundredfold . ” As he said these things , he cried out , “ Whoever has ears to hear , let him hear . ”
42008009	Then his disciples questioned him as to what this parable might mean .
42008010	And he said to them : “ To you it has been given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God . But to the rest , it is in parables , so that : seeing , they may not perceive , and hearing , they may not understand .
42008011	Now the parable is this : The seed is the word of God .
42008012	And those beside the way are those who hear it , but then the devil comes and takes the word from their heart , lest by believing it they may be saved .
42008013	Now those upon rock are those who , when they hear it , accept the word with joy , but these have no roots . So they believe for a time , but in a time of testing , they fall away .
42008014	And those which fell among thorns are those who have heard it , but as they go along , they are suffocated by the concerns and riches and pleasures of this life , and so they do not yield fruit .
42008015	But those which were on good soil are those who , upon hearing the word with a good and noble heart , retain it , and they bring forth fruit in patience .
42008016	Now no one , lighting a candle , covers it with a container , or sets it under a bed . Instead , he places it on a lampstand , so that those who enter may see the light .
42008017	For there is nothing secret , which will not be made clear , nor is there anything hidden , which will not be known and be brought into plain sight .
42008018	Therefore , take care how you listen . For whoever has , it will be given to him ; and whoever does not have , even what he thinks he has will be taken away from him . ”
42008019	Then his mother and brothers came to him ; but they were not able to go to him because of the crowd .
42008020	And it was reported to him , “ Your mother and your brothers are standing outside , wanting to see you . ”
42008021	And in response , he said to them , “ My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it . ”
42008022	Now it happened , on a certain day , that he climbed into a little boat with his disciples . And he said to them , “ Let us make a crossing over the lake . ” And they embarked .
42008023	And as they were sailing , he slept . And a windstorm descended over the lake . And they were taking on water and were in danger .
42008024	Then , drawing near , they awakened him , saying , “ Teacher , we are perishing . ” But as he rose up , he rebuked the wind and the raging water , and they ceased . And a tranquility occurred .
42008025	Then he said to them , “ Where is your faith ? ” And they , being afraid , were amazed , saying to one another , “ Who do you think this is , so that he commands both wind and sea , and they obey him ? ”
42008026	And they sailed to the region of the Gerasenes , which is opposite Galilee .
42008027	And when he had gone out to the land , a certain man met him , who had now had a demon for a long time . And he did not wear clothes , nor did he stay in a house , but among the sepulchers .
42008028	And when he saw Jesus , he fell down before him . And crying out in a loud voice , he said : “ What is there between me and you , Jesus , Son of the Most High God ? I beg you not to torture me . ”
42008029	For he was ordering the unclean spirit to depart from the man . For on many occasions , it would seize him , and he was bound with chains and held by fetters . But breaking the chains , he was driven by the demon into deserted places .
42008030	Then Jesus questioned him , saying , “ What is your name ? ” And he said , “ Legion , ” because many demons had entered into him .
42008031	And they petitioned him not to order them to go into the abyss .
42008032	And in that place , there was a herd of many swine , pasturing on the mountain . And they petitioned him to permit them to enter into them . And he permitted them .
42008033	Therefore , the demons departed from the man , and they entered into the swine . And the herd rushed violently down a precipice into the lake , and they were drowned .
42008034	And when those who were pasturing them had seen this , they fled and reported it in the city and the villages .
42008035	Then they went out to see what was happening , and they came to Jesus . And they found the man , from whom the demons had departed , sitting at his feet , clothed as well as in a sane mind , and they were afraid .
42008036	Then those who had seen this also reported to them how he had been healed from the legion .
42008037	And the entire multitude from the region of the Gerasenes pleaded with him to depart from them . For they were seized by a great fear . Then , climbing into the boat , he went back again .
42008038	And the man from whom the demons had departed pleaded with him , so that he might be with him . But Jesus sent him away , saying ,
42008039	“ Return to your house and explain to them what great things God has done for you . ” And he traveled through the entire city , preaching about the great things that Jesus had done for him .
42008040	Now it happened that , when Jesus had returned , the crowd received him . For they were all waiting for him .
42008041	And behold , a man came , whose name was Jairus , and he was a leader of the synagogue . And he fell down at the feet of Jesus , asking him to enter into his house .
42008042	For he had an only daughter , nearly twelve years old , and she was dying . And it happened that , as he was going there , he was hemmed in by the crowd .
42008043	And there was a certain woman , with a flow of blood for twelve years , who had paid out all her substance on physicians , and she was unable to be cured by any of them .
42008044	She approached him from behind , and she touched the hem of his garment . And at once the flow of her blood stopped .
42008045	And Jesus said , “ Who is it that touched me ? ” But as everyone was denying it , Peter , and those who were with him , said : “ Teacher , the crowd hems you in and presses upon you , and yet you say , ‘ Who touched me ? ’ ”
42008046	And Jesus said : “ Someone has touched me . For I know that power has gone out from me . ”
42008047	Then the woman , upon seeing that she was not hidden , came forward , trembling , and she fell down before his feet . And she declared before all the people the reason that she had touched him , and how she had been immediately healed .
42008048	But he said to her : “ Daughter , your faith has saved you . Go in peace . ”
42008049	While he was still speaking , someone came to the ruler of the synagogue , saying to him : “ Your daughter is dead . Do not trouble him . ”
42008050	Then Jesus , upon hearing this word , replied to the father of the girl : “ Do not be afraid . Only believe , and she will be saved . ”
42008051	And when he had arrived at the house , he would not permit anyone to enter with him , except Peter and James and John , and the father and mother of the girl .
42008052	Now all were weeping and mourning for her . But he said : “ Do not weep . The girl is not dead , but only sleeping . ”
42008053	And they derided him , knowing that she had died .
42008054	But he , taking her by the hand , cried out , saying , “ Little girl , arise . ”
42008055	And her spirit returned , and she immediately rose up . And he ordered them to give her something to eat .
42008056	And her parents were stupefied . And he instructed them not to tell anyone what had happened .
42009001	Then calling together the twelve Apostles , he gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases .
42009002	And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the infirm .
42009003	And he said to them : “ You should take nothing for the journey , neither staff , nor traveling bag , nor bread , nor money ; and you should not have two tunics .
42009004	And into whatever house you shall enter , lodge there , and do not move away from there .
42009005	And whoever will not have received you , upon departing from that city , shake off even the dust on your feet , as a testimony against them . ”
42009006	And going forth , they traveled around , through the towns , evangelizing and curing everywhere .
42009007	Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all the things that were being done by him , but he doubted , because it was said
42009008	by some , “ For John has risen from the dead , ” yet truly , by others , “ For Elijah has appeared , ” and by still others , “ For one of the prophets from of old has risen again . ”
42009009	And Herod said : “ I beheaded John . So then , who is this , about whom I hear such things ? ” And he sought to see him .
42009010	And when the Apostles returned , they explained to him all the things that they had done . And taking them with him , he withdrew to a deserted place apart , which belongs to Bethsaida .
42009011	But when the crowd had realized this , they followed him . And he received them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God . And those who were in need of cures , he healed .
42009012	Then the day began to decline . And drawing near , the twelve said to him : “ Dismiss the crowds , so that , by going into the surrounding towns and villages , they may separate and find food . For we are here in a deserted place . ”
42009013	But he said to them , “ You give them something to eat . ” And they said , “ There is with us no more than five loaves and two fish , unless perhaps we are to go and buy food for this entire multitude . ”
42009014	Now there were about five thousand men . So he said to his disciples , “ Have them recline to eat in groups of fifty . ”
42009015	And they did so . And they caused them all to recline to eat .
42009016	Then , taking the five loaves and the two fish , he gazed up to heaven , and he blessed and broke and distributed them to his disciples , in order to set them before the crowd .
42009017	And they all ate and were satisfied . And twelve baskets of fragments were taken up , which were left over from them .
42009018	And it happened that , when he was praying alone , his disciples also were with him , and he questioned them , saying : “ Who do the multitudes say that I am ? ”
42009019	But they answered by saying : “ John the Baptist . But some say Elijah . Yet truly , others say that one of the prophets from before has risen again . ”
42009020	Then he said to them , “ But who do you say that I am ? ” In response , Simon Peter said , “ The Christ of God . ”
42009021	But speaking sharply to them , he instructed them not to tell this to anyone ,
42009022	saying , “ For the Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected by the elders and the leaders of the priests and the scribes , and be killed , and on the third day rise again . ”
42009023	Then he said to everyone : “ If anyone is willing to come after me : let him deny himself , and take up his cross every day , and follow me .
42009024	For whoever will have saved his life , will lose it . Yet whoever will have lost his life for my sake , will save it .
42009025	For how does it benefit a man , if he were to gain the whole world , yet lose himself , or cause himself harm ?
42009026	For whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words : of him the Son of man will be ashamed , when he will have arrived in his majesty and that of his Father and of the holy Angels .
42009027	And yet , I tell you a truth : There are some standing here who shall not taste death , until they see the kingdom of God . ”
42009028	And it happened that , about eight days after these words , he took Peter and James and John , and he ascended onto a mountain , so that he might pray .
42009029	And while he was praying , the appearance of his countenance was altered , and his vestment became white and shining .
42009030	And behold , two men were talking with him . And these were Moses and Elijah , appearing in majesty .
42009031	And they spoke of his departure , which he would accomplish at Jerusalem .
42009032	Yet truly , Peter and those who were with him were weighed down by sleep . And becoming alert , they saw his majesty and the two men who were standing with him .
42009033	And it happened that , as these were departing from him , Peter said to Jesus : “ Teacher , it is good for us to be here . And so , let us make three tabernacles : one for you , and one for Moses , and one for Elijah . ” For he did not know what he was saying .
42009034	Then , as he was saying these things , a cloud came and overshadowed them . And as these were entering into the cloud , they were afraid .
42009035	And a voice came from the cloud , saying : “ This is my beloved son . Listen to him . ”
42009036	And while the voice was being uttered , Jesus was found to be alone . And they were silent and told no one , in those days , any of these things , which they had seen .
42009037	But it happened on the following day that , as they were descending from the mountain , a great crowd met him .
42009038	And behold , a man from the crowd cried out , saying , “ Teacher , I beg you , look kindly on my son , for he is my only son .
42009039	And behold , a spirit takes hold of him , and he suddenly cries out , and it throws him down and convulses him , so that he foams . And though it tears him apart , it leaves him only with difficulty .
42009040	And I asked your disciples to cast him out , and they were unable . ”
42009041	And in response , Jesus said : “ O unfaithful and perverse generation ! How long will I be with you and endure you ? Bring your son here . ”
42009042	And as he was approaching him , the demon threw him down and convulsed him .
42009043	And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and he healed the boy , and he restored him to his father .
42009044	And all were astonished at the greatness of God . And as everyone was wondering over all that he was doing , he said to his disciples : “ You must set these words in your hearts . For it shall be that the Son of man will be delivered into the hands of men . ”
42009045	But they did not understood this word , and it was concealed from them , so that they did not perceive it . And they were afraid to question him about this word .
42009046	Now an idea entered into them , as to which of them was greater .
42009047	But Jesus , perceiving the thoughts of their hearts , took a child and stood him beside him .
42009048	And he said to them : “ Whoever will receive this child in my name , receives me ; and whoever receives me , receives him who sent me . For whoever is the lesser among you all , the same is greater . ”
42009049	And responding , John said : “ Teacher , we saw a certain one casting out demons in your name . And we prohibited him , for he does not follow with us . ”
42009050	And Jesus said to him : “ Do not prohibit him . For whoever is not against you , is for you . ”
42009051	Now it happened that , while the days of his dissipation were being completed , he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem .
42009052	And he sent messengers before his face . And going on , they entered into a city of the Samaritans , to prepare for him .
42009053	And they would not receive him , because his face was going toward Jerusalem .
42009054	And when his disciples , James and John , had seen this , they said , “ Lord , do you want us to call for fire to descend from heaven and consume them ? ”
42009055	And turning , he rebuked them , saying : “ Do you not know of whose spirit you are ?
42009056	The Son of man came , not to destroy lives , but to save them . ” And they went into another town .
42009057	And it happened that , as they were walking along the way , someone said to him , “ I will follow you , wherever you will go . ”
42009058	Jesus said to him : “ Foxes have dens , and the birds of the air have nests . But the Son of man has nowhere to lay his head . ”
42009059	Then he said to another , “ Follow me . ” But he said , “ Lord , permit me first to go and bury my father . ”
42009060	And Jesus said to him : “ Let the dead bury their dead . But you go and announce the kingdom of God . ”
42009061	And another said : “ I will follow you , Lord . But permit me first to explain this to those of my house . ”
42009062	Jesus said to him , “ No one who puts his hand to the plow , and then looks back , is fit for the kingdom of God . ”
42010001	Then , after these things , the Lord also designated another seventy-two . And he sent them in pairs before his face , into every city and place where he was to arrive .
42010002	And he said to them : “ Certainly the harvest is great , but the workers are few . Therefore , ask the Lord of the harvest to send workers into his harvest .
42010003	Go forth . Behold , I send you out like lambs among wolves .
42010004	Do not choose to carry a purse , nor provisions , nor shoes ; and you shall greet no one along the way .
42010005	Into whatever house you will have entered , first say , ‘ Peace to this house . ’
42010006	And if a son of peace is there , your peace will rest upon him . But if not , it will return to you .
42010007	And remain in the same house , eating and drinking the things that are with them . For the worker is worthy of his pay . Do not choose to pass from house to house .
42010008	And into whatever city you have entered and they have received you , eat what they set before you .
42010009	And cure the sick who are in that place , and proclaim to them , ‘ The kingdom of God has drawn near to you . ’
42010010	But into whatever city you have entered and they have not received you , going out into its main streets , say :
42010011	‘ Even the dust which clings to us from your city , we wipe away against you . Yet know this : the kingdom of God has drawn near . ’
42010012	I say to you , that in that day , Sodom will be forgiven more than that city will be .
42010013	Woe to you , Chorazin ! Woe to you , Bethsaida ! For if the miracles that have been wrought in you , had been wrought in Tyre and Sidon , they would have repented long ago , sitting in haircloth and ashes .
42010014	Yet truly , Tyre and Sidon will be forgiven more in the judgment than you will be .
42010015	And as for you , Capernaum , who would be exalted even up to Heaven : you shall be submerged into Hell .
42010016	Whoever hears you , hears me . And whoever despises you , despises me . And whoever despises me , despises him who sent me . ”
42010017	Then the seventy-two returned with gladness , saying , “ Lord , even the demons are subject to us , in your name . ”
42010018	And he said to them : “ I was watching as Satan fell like lightning from heaven .
42010019	Behold , I have given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions , and upon all the powers of the enemy , and nothing shall hurt you .
42010020	Yet truly , do not choose to rejoice in this , that the spirits are subject to you ; but rejoice that your names are written in heaven . ”
42010021	In the same hour , he exulted in the Holy Spirit , and he said : “ I confess to you , Father , Lord of heaven and earth , because you have hidden these things from the wise and the prudent , and have revealed them to little ones . It is so , Father , because this way was pleasing before you .
42010022	All things have been delivered to me by my Father . And no one knows who the Son is , except the Father , and who the Father is , except the Son , and those to whom the Son has chosen to reveal him . ”
42010023	And turning to his disciples , he said : “ Blessed are the eyes that see what you see .
42010024	For I say to you , that many prophets and kings wanted to see the things that you see , and they did not see them , and to hear the things that you hear , and they did not hear them . ”
42010025	And behold , a certain expert in the law rose up , testing him and saying , “ Teacher , what must I do to possess eternal life ? ”
42010026	But he said to him : “ What is written in the law ? How do you read it ? ”
42010027	In response , he said : “ You shall love the Lord your God from your whole heart , and from your whole soul , and from all your strength , and from all your mind , and your neighbor as yourself . ”
42010028	And he said to him : “ You have answered correctly . Do this , and you will live . ”
42010029	But since he wanted to justify himself , he said to Jesus , “ And who is my neighbor ? ”
42010030	Then Jesus , taking this up , said : “ A certain man descended from Jerusalem to Jericho , and he happened upon robbers , who now also plundered him . And inflicting him with wounds , they went away , leaving him behind , half-alive .
42010031	And it happened that a certain priest was descending along the same way . And seeing him , he passed by .
42010032	And similarly a Levite , when he was near the place , also saw him , and he passed by .
42010033	But a certain Samaritan , being on a journey , came near him . And seeing him , he was moved by mercy .
42010034	And approaching him , he bound up his wounds , pouring oil and wine on them . And setting him on his pack animal , he brought him to an inn , and he took care of him .
42010035	And the next day , he took out two denarii , and he gave them to the proprietor , and he said : ‘ Take care of him . And whatever extra you will have spent , I will repay to you at my return . ’
42010036	Which of these three , does it seem to you , was a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers ? ”
42010037	Then he said , “ The one who acted with mercy toward him . ” And Jesus said to him , “ Go , and act similarly . ”
42010038	Now it happened that , while they were traveling , he entered into a certain town . And a certain woman , named Martha , received him into her home .
42010039	And she had a sister , named Mary , who , while sitting beside the Lord’s feet , was listening to his word .
42010040	Now Martha was continually busying herself with serving . And she stood still and said : “ Lord , is it not a concern to you that my sister has left me to serve alone ? Therefore , speak to her , so that she may help me . ”
42010041	And the Lord responded by saying to her : “ Martha , Martha , you are anxious and troubled over many things .
42010042	And yet only one thing is necessary . Mary has chosen the best portion , and it shall not be taken away from her . ”
42011001	And it happened that , while he was in a certain place praying , when he ceased , one of his disciples said to him , “ Lord , teach us to pray , as John also taught his disciples . ”
42011002	And he said to them : “ When you are praying , say : Father , may your name be kept holy . May your kingdom come .
42011003	Give us this day our daily bread .
42011004	And forgive us our sins , since we also forgive all who are indebted to us . And lead us not into temptation . ”
42011005	And he said to them : “ Which of you will have a friend and will go to him in the middle of the night , and will say to him : ‘ Friend , lend me three loaves ,
42011006	because a friend of mine has arrived from a journey to me , and I do not have anything to set before him . ’
42011007	And from within , he would answer by saying : ‘ Do not disturb me . The door is closed now , and my children and I are in bed . I cannot get up and give it to you . ’
42011008	Yet if he will persevere in knocking , I tell you that , even though he would not get up and give it to him because he is a friend , yet due to his continued insistence , he will get up and give him whatever he needs .
42011009	And so I say to you : Ask , and it shall be given to you . Seek , and you shall find . Knock , and it shall be opened to you .
42011010	For everyone who asks , receives . And whoever seeks , finds . And whoever knocks , it shall be opened to him .
42011011	So then , who among you , if he asks his father for bread , he would give him a stone ? Or if he asks for a fish , he would give him a serpent , instead of a fish ?
42011012	Or if he will ask for an egg , he would offer to him a scorpion ?
42011013	Therefore , if you , being evil , know how to give good things to your sons , how much more will your Father give , from heaven , a spirit of goodness to those who ask him ? ”
42011014	And he was casting out a demon , and the man was mute . But when he had cast out the demon , the mute man spoke , and so the crowds were amazed .
42011015	But some of them said , “ It is by Beelzebub , the leader of demons , that he casts out demons . ”
42011016	And others , testing him , required a sign from heaven of him .
42011017	But when he perceived their thoughts , he said to them : “ Every kingdom divided against itself will become desolate , and house will fall upon house .
42011018	So then , if Satan is also divided against himself , how will his kingdom stand ? For you say that it is by Beelzebub that I cast out demons .
42011019	But if I cast out demons by Beelzebub , by whom do your own sons cast them out ? Therefore , they shall be your judges .
42011020	Moreover , if it is by the finger of God that I cast out demons , then certainly the kingdom of God has overtaken you .
42011021	When a strong armed man guards his entrance , the things that he possesses are at peace .
42011022	But if a stronger one , overwhelming him , has defeated him , he will take away all his weapons , in which he trusted , and he will distribute his spoils .
42011023	Whoever is not with me , is against me . And whoever does not gather with me , scatters .
42011024	When an unclean spirit has departed from a man , he walks through waterless places , seeking rest . And not finding any , he says : ‘ I will return to my house , from which I departed . ’
42011025	And when he has arrived , he finds it swept clean and decorated .
42011026	Then he goes , and he takes in seven other spirits with him , more wicked than himself , and they enter and live there . And so , the end of that man is made worse the beginning . ”
42011027	And it happened that , when he was saying these things , a certain woman from the crowd , lifting up her voice , said to him , “ Blessed is the womb that bore you and the breasts that nursed you . ”
42011028	Then he said , “ Yes , but moreover : blessed are those who hear the word of God and keep it . ”
42011029	Then , as the crowds were quickly gathering , he began to say : “ This generation is a wicked generation : it seeks a sign . But no sign will be given to it , except the sign of the prophet Jonah .
42011030	For just as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites , so also will the Son of man be to this generation .
42011031	The queen of the South will rise up , at the judgment , with the men of this generation , and she will condemn them . For she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon . And behold , more than Solomon is here .
42011032	The men of Nineveh will rise up , at the judgment , with this generation , and they will condemn it . For at the preaching of Jonah , they repented . And behold , more than Jonah is here .
42011033	No one lights a candle and places it in hiding , nor under a bushel basket , but upon a lampstand , so that those who enter may see the light .
42011034	Your eye is the light of your body . If your eye is wholesome , your entire body will be filled with light . But if it is wicked , then even your body will be darkened .
42011035	Therefore , take care , lest the light that is within you become darkness .
42011036	So then , if your entire body becomes filled with light , not having any part in darkness , then it will be entirely light , and , like a shining lamp , it will illuminate you . ”
42011037	And as he was speaking , a certain Pharisee asked him to eat with him . And going inside , he sat down to eat .
42011038	But the Pharisee began to say , thinking within himself : “ Why might it be that he has not washed before eating ? ”
42011039	And the Lord said to him : “ You Pharisees today clean what is outside the cup and the plate , but what is inside of you is full of plunder and iniquity .
42011040	Fools ! Did not he who made what is outside , indeed also make what is inside ?
42011041	Yet truly , give what is above as alms , and behold , all things are clean for you .
42011042	But woe to you , Pharisees ! For you tithe mint and rue and every herb , but you ignore judgment and the charity of God . But these things you ought to have done , without omitting the others .
42011043	Woe to you , Pharisees ! For you love the first seats in the synagogues , and greetings in the marketplace .
42011044	Woe to you ! For you are like graves that are not noticeable , so that men walk over them without realizing it . ”
42011045	Then one of the experts in the law , in response , said to him , “ Teacher , in saying these things , you bring an insult against us as well . ”
42011046	So he said : “ And woe to you experts in the law ! For you weigh men down with burdens which they are not able to bear , but you yourselves do not touch the weight with even one of your fingers .
42011047	Woe to you , who build the tombs of the prophets , while it is your fathers who killed them !
42011048	Clearly , you are testifying that you consent to the actions of your fathers , because even though they killed them , you build their sepulchers .
42011049	Because of this also , the wisdom of God said : I will send to them Prophets and Apostles , and some of these they will kill or persecute ,
42011050	so that the blood of all the Prophets , which has been shed since the foundation of the world , may be charged against this generation :
42011051	from the blood of Abel , even to the blood of Zachariah , who perished between the altar and the sanctuary . So I say to you : it will be required of this generation !
42011052	Woe to you , experts in the law ! For you have taken away the key of knowledge . You yourselves do not enter , and those who were entering , you would have prohibited . ”
42011053	Then , while he was saying these things to them , the Pharisees and the experts in the law began to insist strongly that he restrain his mouth about many things .
42011054	And waiting to ambush him , they sought something from his mouth that they might seize upon , in order to accuse him .
42012001	Then , as great crowds were standing so close that they were stepping on one another , he began to say to his disciples : “ Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees , which is hypocrisy .
42012002	For there is nothing covered , which will not be revealed , nor anything hidden , which will not be known .
42012003	For the things that you have spoken in darkness will be declared in the light . And what you have said in the ear in bedrooms will be proclaimed from the housetops .
42012004	So I say to you , my friends : Do not be fearful of those who kill the body , and afterwards have no more that they can do .
42012005	But I will reveal to you whom you should fear . Fear him who , after he will have killed , has the power to cast into Hell . So I say to you : Fear him .
42012006	Are not five sparrows sold for two small coins ? And yet not one of these is forgotten in the sight of God .
42012007	But even the very hairs of your head have all been numbered . Therefore , do not be afraid . You are worth more than many sparrows .
42012008	But I say to you : Everyone who will have confessed me before men , the Son of man will also confess him before the Angels of God .
42012009	But everyone who will have denied me before men , he will be denied before the Angels of God .
42012010	And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of man , it will be forgiven of him . But of him who will have blasphemed against the Holy Spirit , it will not be forgiven .
42012011	And when they will lead you to the synagogues , and to magistrates and authorities , do not choose to be worried about how or what you will answer , or about what you might say .
42012012	For the Holy Spirit will teach you , in the same hour , what you must say . ”
42012013	And someone from the crowd said to him , “ Teacher , tell my brother to share the inheritance with me . ”
42012014	But he said to him , “ Man , who has appointed me as judge or arbitrator over you ? ”
42012015	So he said to them : “ Be cautious and wary of all avarice . For a person’s life is not found in the abundance of the things that he possesses . ”
42012016	Then he spoke to them using a comparison , saying : “ The fertile land of a certain wealthy man produced crops .
42012017	And he thought within himself , saying : ‘ What should I do ? For I have nowhere to gather together my crops . ’
42012018	And he said : ‘ This is what I will do . I will tear down my barns and build larger ones . And into these , I will gather all the things that have been grown for me , as well as my goods .
42012019	And I will say to my soul : Soul , you have many goods , stored up for many years . Relax , eat , drink , and be cheerful . ’
42012020	But God said to him : ‘ Foolish one , this very night they require your soul of you . To whom , then , will those things belong , which you have prepared ? ’
42012021	So it is with him who stores up for himself , and is not wealthy with God . ”
42012022	And he said to his disciples : “ And so I say to you : Do not choose to be anxious about your life , as to what you may eat , nor about your body , as to what you will wear .
42012023	Life is more than food , and the body is more than clothing .
42012024	Consider the ravens . For they neither sow nor reap ; there is no storehouse or barn for them . And yet God pastures them . How much more are you , compared to them ?
42012025	But which of you , by thinking , is able to add one cubit to his stature ?
42012026	Therefore , if you are not capable , in what is so little , why be anxious about the rest ?
42012027	Consider the lilies , how they grow . They neither work nor weave . But I say to you , not even Solomon , in all his glory , was clothed like one of these .
42012028	Therefore , if God so clothes the grass , which is in the field today and thrown into the furnace tomorrow , how much more you , O little in faith ?
42012029	And so , do not choose to inquire as to what you will eat , or what you will drink . And do not choose to be lifted up on high .
42012030	For all these things are sought by the Gentiles of the world . And your Father knows that you have need of these things .
42012031	Yet truly , seek first the kingdom of God , and his justice , and all these things shall be added to you .
42012032	Do not be afraid , little flock ; for it has pleased your Father to give you the kingdom .
42012033	Sell what you possess , and give alms . Make for yourselves purses that will not wear out , a treasure that will not fall short , in heaven , where no thief approaches , and no moth corrupts .
42012034	For where your treasure is , there will your heart be also .
42012035	Let your waists be girded , and let lamps be burning in your hands .
42012036	And let you yourselves be like men awaiting their lord , when he will return from the wedding ; so that , when he arrives and knocks , they may open to him promptly .
42012037	Blessed are those servants whom the Lord , when he returns , will find being vigilant . Amen I say to you , that he will gird himself and have them sit down to eat , while he , continuing on , will minister to them .
42012038	And if he will return in the second watch , or if in the third watch , and if he will find them to be so : then blessed are those servants .
42012039	But know this : that if the father of the family knew at what hour the thief would arrive , he would certainly stand watch , and he would not permit his house to be broken into .
42012040	You also must be prepared . For the Son of man will return at an hour that you will not realize . ”
42012041	Then Peter said to him , “ Lord , are you telling this parable to us , or also to everyone ? ”
42012042	So the Lord said : “ Who do you think is the faithful and prudent steward , whom his Lord has appointed over his family , in order to give them their measure of wheat in due time ?
42012043	Blessed is that servant if , when his Lord will return , he will find him acting in this manner .
42012044	Truly I say to you , that he will appoint him over all that he possesses .
42012045	But if that servant will have said in his heart , ‘ My Lord has made a delay in his return , ’ and if he has begun to strike the men and women servants , and to eat and drink , and to be inebriated ,
42012046	then the Lord of that servant will return on a day which he hoped not , and at an hour which he knew not . And he will separate him , and he will place his portion with that of the unfaithful .
42012047	And that servant , who knew the will of his Lord , and who did not prepare and did not act according to his will , will be beaten many times over .
42012048	Yet he who did not know , and who acted in a way that deserves a beating , will be beaten fewer times . So then , of all to whom much has been given , much will be required . And of those to whom much has been entrusted , even more will be asked .
42012049	I have come to cast a fire upon the earth . And what should I desire , except that it may be kindled ?
42012050	And I have a baptism , with which I am to be baptized . And how I am constrained , even until it may be accomplished !
42012051	Do you think that I have come to give peace to the earth ? No , I tell you , but division .
42012052	For from this time on , there will be five in one house : divided as three against two , and as two against three .
42012053	A father will be divided against a son , and a son against his father ; a mother against a daughter and a daughter against a mother ; a mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law , and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law . ”
42012054	And he also said to the crowds : “ When you see a cloud rising from the setting of the sun , immediately you say , ‘ A rain cloud is coming . ’ And so it does .
42012055	And when a south wind is blowing , you say , ‘ It will be hot . ’ And so it is .
42012056	You hypocrites ! You discern the face of the heavens , and of the earth , yet how is it that you do not discern this time ?
42012057	And why do you not , even among yourselves , judge what is just ?
42012058	So , when you are going with your adversary to the ruler , while you are on the way , make an effort to be freed from him , lest perhaps he may lead you to the judge , and the judge may deliver you to the officer , and the officer may cast you into prison .
42012059	I tell you , you will not depart from there , until you have paid the very last coin . ”
42013001	And there were present , at that very time , some who were reporting about the Galileans , whose blood Pilate mixed with their sacrifices .
42013002	And responding , he said to them : “ Do you think that these Galileans must have sinned more than all other Galileans , because they suffered so much ?
42013003	No , I tell you . But unless you repent , you will all perish similarly .
42013004	And those eighteen upon whom the tower of Siloam fell and killed them , do you think that they also were greater transgressors than all the men living in Jerusalem ?
42013005	No , I tell you . But if you do not repent , you will all perish similarly . ”
42013006	And he also told this parable : “ A certain man had a fig tree , which was planted in his vineyard . And he came seeking fruit on it , but found none .
42013007	Then he said to the cultivator of the vineyard : ‘ Behold , for these three years I came seeking fruit on this fig tree , and I have found none . Therefore , cut it down . For why should it even occupy the land ? ’
42013008	But in response , he said to him : ‘ Lord , let it be for this year also , during which time I will dig around it and add fertilizer .
42013009	And , indeed , it should bear fruit . But if not , in the future , you shall cut it down . ’ ”
42013010	Now he was teaching in their synagogue on the Sabbaths .
42013011	And behold , there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity for eighteen years . And she was bent over ; and she was unable to look upwards at all .
42013012	And when Jesus saw her , he called her to himself , and he said to her , “ Woman , you are released from your infirmity . ”
42013013	And he laid his hands upon her , and immediately she was straightened , and she glorified God .
42013014	Then , as a result , the ruler of the synagogue became angry that Jesus had cured on the Sabbath , and he said to the crowd : “ There are six days on which you ought to work . Therefore , come and be cured on those , and not on the day of the Sabbath . ”
42013015	Then the Lord said to him in response : “ You hypocrites ! Does not each one of you , on the Sabbath , release his ox or donkey from the stall , and lead it to water ?
42013016	So then , should not this daughter of Abraham , whom Satan has bound for lo these eighteen years , be released from this restraint on the day of the Sabbath ? ”
42013017	And as he was saying these things , all his adversaries were ashamed . And all the people rejoiced in everything that was being done gloriously by him .
42013018	And so he said : “ To what is the kingdom of God similar , and to what figure shall I compare it ?
42013019	It is like a grain of mustard seed , which a man took and cast into his garden . And it grew , and it became a great tree , and the birds of the air rested in its branches . ”
42013020	And again , he said : “ To what figure shall I compare the kingdom of God ?
42013021	It is like leaven , which a woman took and hid in three measures of fine wheat flour , until it was entirely leavened . ”
42013022	And he was traveling through the cities and towns , teaching and making his way to Jerusalem .
42013023	And someone said to him , “ Lord , are they few who are saved ? ” But he said to them :
42013024	“ Strive to enter through the narrow gate . For many , I tell you , will seek to enter and not be able .
42013025	Then , when the father of the family will have entered and shut the door , you will begin to stand outside and to knock at the door , saying , ‘ Lord , open to us . ’ And in response , he will say to you , ‘ I do not know where you are from . ’
42013026	Then you will begin to say , ‘ We ate and drank in your presence , and you taught in our streets . ’
42013027	And he will say to you : ‘ I do not know where you are from . Depart from me , all you workers of iniquity ! ’
42013028	In that place , there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth , when you see Abraham , and Isaac , and Jacob , and all the prophets , in the kingdom of God , yet you yourselves are expelled outside .
42013029	And they will arrive from the East , and the West , and the North , and the South ; and they will recline at table in the kingdom of God .
42013030	And behold , those who are last will be first , and those who are first will be last . ”
42013031	On the same day , some of the Pharisees approached , saying to him : “ Depart , and go away from here . For Herod wishes to kill you . ”
42013032	And he said to them : “ Go and tell that fox : ‘ Behold , I cast out demons and accomplish healings , today and tomorrow . And on the third day I reach the end . ’
42013033	Yet truly , it is necessary for me to walk today and tomorrow and the following day . For it does not fall to a prophet to perish beyond Jerusalem .
42013034	Jerusalem , Jerusalem ! You kill the prophets , and you stone those who are sent to you . Daily , I wanted to gather together your children , in the manner of a bird with her nest under her wings , but you were not willing !
42013035	Behold , your house will be left desolate for you . But I say to you , that you shall not see me , until it happens that you say : ‘ Blessed is he who has arrived in the name of the Lord . ’ ”
42014001	And it happened that , when Jesus entered the house of a certain leader of the Pharisees on the Sabbath to eat bread , they were observing him .
42014002	And behold , a certain man before him was afflicted with edema .
42014003	And responding , Jesus spoke to the experts in the law and to the Pharisees , saying , “ Is it lawful to cure on the Sabbath ? ”
42014004	But they kept silent . Yet truly , taking hold of him , he healed him and sent him away .
42014005	And responding to them , he said , “ Which of you will have a donkey or an ox fall into a pit , and will not promptly pull him out , on the day of the Sabbath ? ”
42014006	And they were unable to respond to him about these things .
42014007	Then he also told a parable , to those who were invited , noticing how they chose the first seats at the table , saying to them :
42014008	“ When you are invited to a wedding , do not sit down in the first place , lest perhaps someone more honored than yourself may have been invited by him .
42014009	And then he who called both you and him , approaching , may say to you , ‘ Give this place to him . ’ And then you would begin , with shame , to take the last place .
42014010	But when you are invited , go , sit down in the lowest place , so that , when he who invited you arrives , he may say to you , ‘ Friend , go up higher . ’ Then you will have glory in the sight of those who sit at table together with you .
42014011	For everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled , and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted . ”
42014012	Then he also said to the one who had invited him : “ When you prepare a lunch or dinner , do not choose to call your friends , or your brothers , or your relatives , or your wealthy neighbors , lest perhaps they might then invite you in return and repayment would made to you .
42014013	But when you prepare a feast , call the poor , the disabled , the lame , and the blind .
42014014	And you will be blessed because they do not have a way to repay you . So then , your recompense will be in the resurrection of the just . ”
42014015	When someone sitting at table with him had heard these things , he said to him , “ Blessed is he who will eat bread in the kingdom of God . ”
42014016	So he said to him : “ A certain man prepared a great feast , and he invited many .
42014017	And he sent his servant , at the hour of the feast , to tell the invited to come ; for now everything was ready .
42014018	And at once they all began to make excuses . The first said to him : ‘ I bought a farm , and I need to go out and see it . I ask you to excuse me . ’
42014019	And another said : ‘ I bought five yoke of oxen , and I am going to examine them . I ask you to excuse me . ’
42014020	And another said , ‘ I have taken a wife , and therefore I am not able to go . ’
42014021	And returning , the servant reported these things to his lord . Then the father of the family , becoming angry , said to his servant : ‘ Go out quickly into the streets and neighborhoods of the city . And lead here the poor , and the disabled , and the blind , and the lame . ’
42014022	And the servant said : ‘ It has been done , just as you ordered , lord , and there is still room . ’
42014023	And the lord said to the servant : ‘ Go out to the highways and hedges , and compel them to enter , so that my house may be filled .
42014024	For I tell you , that none of those men who were invited will taste of my feast . ’ ”
42014025	Now great crowds traveled with him . And turning around , he said to them :
42014026	“ If anyone comes to me , and does not hate his father , and mother , and wife , and children , and brothers , and sisters , and yes , even his own life , he is not able to be my disciple .
42014027	And whoever does not bear his cross and come after me , is not able to be my disciple .
42014028	For who among you , wanting to build a tower , would not first sit down and determine the costs that are required , to see if he has the means to complete it ?
42014029	Otherwise , after he will have laid the foundation and not been able to finish it , everyone who sees it may begin to mock him ,
42014030	saying : ‘ This man began to build what he was not able to finish . ’
42014031	Or , what king , advancing to engage in war against another king , would not first sit down and consider whether he may be able , with ten thousand , to meet one who comes against him with twenty thousand ?
42014032	If not , then while the other is still far away , sending a delegation , he would ask him for terms of peace .
42014033	Therefore , everyone of you who does not renounce all that he possesses is not able to be my disciple .
42014034	Salt is good . But if the salt has lost its flavor , with what will it be seasoned ?
42014035	It is useful neither in soil , nor in manure , so instead , it shall be thrown away . Whoever has ears to hear , let him hear . ”
42015001	Now tax collectors and sinners were drawing near to him , so that they might listen to him .
42015002	And the Pharisees and the scribes murmured , saying , “ This one accepts sinners and eats with them . ”
42015003	And he told this parable to them , saying :
42015004	“ What man among you , who has one hundred sheep , and if he will have lost one of them , would not leave the ninety-nine in the desert and go after the one whom he had lost , until he finds it ?
42015005	And when he has found it , he places it on his shoulders , rejoicing .
42015006	And returning home , he calls together his friends and neighbors , saying to them : ‘ Congratulate me ! For I have found my sheep , which had been lost . ’
42015007	I say to you , that there will be so much more joy in heaven over one sinner repenting , than over the ninety-nine just , who do not need to repent .
42015008	Or what woman , having ten drachmas , if she will have lost one drachma , would not light a candle , and sweep the house , and diligently search until she finds it ?
42015009	And when she has found it , she calls together her friends and neighbors , saying : ‘ Rejoice with me ! For I have found the drachma , which I had lost . ’
42015010	So I say to you , there will be joy before the Angels of God over even one sinner who is repentant . ”
42015011	And he said : “ A certain man had two sons .
42015012	And the younger of them said to the father , ‘ Father , give me the portion of your estate which would go to me . ’ And he divided the estate between them .
42015013	And after not many days , the younger son , gathering it all together , set out on a long journey to a distant region . And there , he dissipated his substance , living in luxury .
42015014	And after he had consumed it all , a great famine occurred in that region , and he began to be in need .
42015015	And he went and attached himself to one of the citizens of that region . And he sent him to his farm , in order to feed the swine .
42015016	And he wanted to fill his belly with the scraps that the swine ate . But no one would give it to him .
42015017	And returning to his senses , he said : ‘ How many hired hands in my father’s house have abundant bread , while I perish here in famine !
42015018	I shall rise up and go to my father , and I will say to him : Father , I have sinned against heaven and before you .
42015019	I am not worthy to be called your son . Make me one of your hired hands . ’
42015020	And rising up , he went to his father . But while he was still at a distance , his father saw him , and he was moved with compassion , and running to him , he fell upon his neck and kissed him .
42015021	And the son said to him : ‘ Father , I have sinned against heaven and before you . Now I am not worthy to be called your son . ’
42015022	But the father said to his servants : ‘ Quickly ! Bring out the best robe , and clothe him with it . And put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet .
42015023	And bring the fatted calf here , and kill it . And let us eat and hold a feast .
42015024	For this son of mine was dead , and has revived ; he was lost , and is found . ’ And they began to feast .
42015025	But his elder son was in the field . And when he returned and drew near to the house , he heard music and dancing .
42015026	And he called one of the servants , and he questioned him as to what these things meant .
42015027	And he said to him : ‘ Your brother has returned , and your father has killed the fatted calf , because he has received him safely . ’
42015028	Then he became indignant , and he was unwilling to enter . Therefore , his father , going out , began to plead with him .
42015029	And in response , he said to his father : ‘ Behold , I have been serving you for so many years . And I have never transgressed your commandment . And yet , you have never given me even a young goat , so that I might feast with my friends .
42015030	Yet after this son of yours returned , who has devoured his substance with loose women , you have killed the fatted calf for him . ’
42015031	But he said to him : ‘ Son , you are with me always , and all that I have is yours .
42015032	But it was necessary to feast and to rejoice . For this brother of yours was dead , and has revived ; he was lost , and is found . ’ ”
42016001	And he also said to his disciples : “ A certain man was wealthy , and he had a steward of his estate . And this man was accused to him of having dissipated his goods .
42016002	And he called him and said to him : ‘ What is this that I hear about you ? Give an account of your stewardship . For you can no longer be my steward . ’
42016003	And the steward said within himself : ‘ What shall I do ? For my lord is taking the stewardship away from me . I am not strong enough to dig . I am too ashamed to beg .
42016004	I know what I will do so that , when I have been removed from the stewardship , they may receive me into their houses . ’
42016005	And so , calling together each one of his lord’s debtors , he said to the first , ‘ How much do you owe my lord ? ’
42016006	So he said , ‘ One hundred jars of oil . ’ And he said to him , ‘ Take your invoice , and quickly , sit down and write fifty . ’
42016007	Next , he said to another , ‘ In truth , how much do you owe ? ’ And he said , ‘ One hundred measures of wheat . ’ He said to him , ‘ Take your record books , and write eighty . ’
42016008	And the lord praised the iniquitous steward , in that he had acted prudently . For the sons of this age are more prudent with their generation than are the sons of light .
42016009	And so I say to you , make friends for yourself using iniquitous mammon , so that , when you will have passed away , they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles .
42016010	Whoever is faithful in what is least , is also faithful in what is greater . And whoever is unjust in what is small , is also unjust in what is greater .
42016011	So then , if you have not been faithful with iniquitous mammon , who will trust you with what is true ?
42016012	And if you have not been faithful with what belongs to another , who will give you what is yours ?
42016013	No servant is able to serve two lords . For either he will hate the one and love the other , or he will cling to the one and despise the other . You cannot serve God and mammon . ”
42016014	But the Pharisees , who were greedy , were listening to all these things . And they ridiculed him .
42016015	And he said to them : “ You are the ones who justify yourselves in the sight of men . But God knows your hearts . For what is lifted up by men is an abomination in the sight of God .
42016016	The law and the prophets were until John . Since then , the kingdom of God is being evangelized , and everyone acts with violence toward it .
42016017	But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away , than for one dot of the law to fall away .
42016018	Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery . And whoever marries her who has been divorced by her husband commits adultery .
42016019	A certain man was wealthy , and he was clothed in purple and in fine linen . And he feasted splendidly every day .
42016020	And there was a certain beggar , named Lazarus , who lay at his gate , covered with sores ,
42016021	wanting to be filled with the crumbs which were falling from the wealthy man’s table . But no one gave it to him . And even the dogs came and licked his sores .
42016022	Then it happened that the beggar died , and he was carried by the Angels into the bosom of Abraham . Now the wealthy man also died , and he was entombed in Hell .
42016023	Then lifting up his eyes , while he was in torments , he saw Abraham far away , and Lazarus in his bosom .
42016024	And crying out , he said : ‘ Father Abraham , take pity on me and send Lazarus , so that he may dip the tip of his finger in water to refresh my tongue . For I am tortured in this fire . ’
42016025	And Abraham said to him : ‘ Son , recall that you received good things in your life , and in comparison , Lazarus received bad things . But now he is consoled , and truly you are tormented .
42016026	And besides all this , between us and you a great chaos has been established , so that those who might want to cross from here to you are not able , nor can someone cross from there to here . ’
42016027	And he said : ‘ Then , father , I beg you to send him to my father’s house , for I have five brothers ,
42016028	so that he may testify to them , lest they also come into this place of torments . ’
42016029	And Abraham said to him : ‘ They have Moses and the prophets . Let them listen to them . ’
42016030	So he said : ‘ No , father Abraham . But if someone were to go to them from the dead , they would repent . ’
42016031	But he said to him : ‘ If they will not listen to Moses and the prophets , neither will they believe even if someone has resurrected from the dead . ’ ”
42017001	And he said to his disciples : “ It is impossible for scandals not to occur . But woe to him through whom they come !
42017002	It would be better for him if a millstone were placed around his neck and he were thrown into the sea , than to lead astray one of these little ones .
42017003	Be attentive to yourselves . If your brother has sinned against you , correct him . And if he has repented , forgive him .
42017004	And if he has sinned against you seven times a day , and seven times a day has turned back to you , saying , ‘ I am sorry , ’ then forgive him . ”
42017005	And the Apostles said to the Lord , “ Increase our faith . ”
42017006	But the Lord said : “ If you have faith like a grain of mustard seed , you may say to this mulberry tree , ‘ Be uprooted , and be transplanted into the sea . ’ And it would obey you .
42017007	But which of you , having a servant plowing or feeding cattle , would say to him , as he was returning from the field , ‘ Come in immediately ; sit down to eat , ’
42017008	and would not say to him : ‘ Prepare my dinner ; gird yourself and minister to me , while I eat and drink ; and after these things , you shall eat and drink ? ’
42017009	Would he be grateful to that servant , for doing what he commanded him to do ?
42017010	I think not . So too , when you have done all these things that have been taught to you , you should say : ‘ We are useless servants . We have done what we should have done . ’ ”
42017011	And it happened that , while he was traveling to Jerusalem , he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee .
42017012	And as he was entering a certain town , ten leprous men met him , and they stood at a distance .
42017013	And they lifted up their voice , saying , “ Jesus , Teacher , take pity on us . ”
42017014	And when he saw them , he said , “ Go , show yourselves to the priests . ” And it happened that , as they were going , they were cleansed .
42017015	And one of them , when he saw that he was cleansed , returned , magnifying God with a loud voice .
42017016	And he fell face down before his feet , giving thanks . And this one was a Samaritan .
42017017	And in response , Jesus said : “ Were not ten made clean ? And so where are the nine ?
42017018	Was no one found who would return and give glory to God , except this foreigner ? ”
42017019	And he said to him : “ Rise up , go forth . For your faith has saved you . ”
42017020	Then he was questioned by the Pharisees : “ When does the kingdom of God arrive ? ” And in response , he said to them : “ The kingdom of God arrives unobserved .
42017021	And so , they will not say , ‘ Behold , it is here , ’ or ‘ Behold , it is there . ’ For behold , the kingdom of God is within you . ”
42017022	And he said to his disciples : “ The time will come when you will desire to see one day of the Son of man , and you will not see it .
42017023	And they will say to you , ‘ Behold , he is here , ’ and ‘ Behold , he is there . ’ Do not choose to go out , and do not follow them .
42017024	For just as lightning flashes from under heaven and shines to whatever is under heaven , so also will the Son of man be in his day .
42017025	But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation .
42017026	And just as it happened in the days of Noah , so also will it be in the days of the Son of man .
42017027	They were eating and drinking ; they were taking wives and being given in marriage , even until the day that Noah entered the ark . And the flood came and destroyed them all .
42017028	It shall be similar to what happened in the days of Lot . They were eating and drinking ; they were buying and selling ; they were planting and building .
42017029	Then , on the day that Lot departed from Sodom , it rained fire and brimstone from heaven , and it destroyed them all .
42017030	According to these things , so shall it be in the day when the Son of man will be revealed .
42017031	In that hour , whoever will be on the rooftop , with his goods in the house , let him not descend to take them . And whoever will be in the field , similarly , let him not turn back .
42017032	Remember Lot’s wife .
42017033	Whoever has sought to save his life , will lose it ; and whoever has lost it , will bring it back to life .
42017034	I say to you , in that night , there will be two in one bed . One will be taken up , and the other will be left behind .
42017035	Two will be at the grindstone together . One will be taken up , and the other will be left behind . Two will be in the field . One will be taken up , and the other will be left behind . ”
42017036	Responding , they said to him , “ Where , Lord ? ”
42017037	And he said to them , “ Wherever the body will be , in that place also , the eagles shall be gathered together . ”
42018001	Now he also told them a parable , that we should continually pray and not cease ,
42018002	saying : “ There was a certain judge in a certain city , who did not fear God and did not respect man .
42018003	But there was a certain widow in that city , and she went to him , saying , ‘ Vindicate me from my adversary . ’
42018004	And he refused to do so for a long time . But afterwards , he said within himself : ‘ Even though I do not fear God , nor respect man ,
42018005	yet because this widow is pestering me , I will vindicate her , lest by returning , she may , in the end , wear me out . ’ ”
42018006	Then the Lord said : “ Listen to what the unjust judge said .
42018007	So then , will not God grant the vindication of his elect , who cry out to him day and night ? Or will he continue to endure them ?
42018008	I tell you that he will quickly bring vindication to them . Yet truly , when the Son of man returns , do you think that he will find faith on earth ? ”
42018009	Now about certain persons who consider themselves to be just , while disdaining others , he told also this parable :
42018010	“ Two men ascended to the temple , in order to pray . One was a Pharisee , and the other was a tax collector .
42018011	Standing , the Pharisee prayed within himself in this way : ‘ O God , I give thanks to you that I am not like the rest of men : robbers , unjust , adulterers , even as this tax collector chooses to be .
42018012	I fast twice between Sabbaths . I give tithes from all that I possess . ’
42018013	And the tax collector , standing at a distance , was not willing to even lift up his eyes to heaven . But he struck his chest , saying : ‘ O God , be merciful to me , a sinner . ’
42018014	I say to you , this one descended to his house justified , but not the other . For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled ; and whoever humbles himself will be exalted . ”
42018015	And they were bringing little children to him , so that he might touch them . And when the disciples saw this , they rebuked them .
42018016	But Jesus , calling them together , said : “ Allow the children to come to me , and do not be an obstacle to them . For of such is the kingdom of God .
42018017	Amen , I say to you , whoever will not accept the kingdom of God like a child , will not enter into it . ”
42018018	And a certain leader questioned him , saying : “ Good teacher , what should I do to possess eternal life ? ”
42018019	Then Jesus said to him : “ Why do you call me good ? No one is good except God alone .
42018020	You know the commandments : You shall not kill . You shall not commit adultery . You shall not steal . You shall not give false testimony . Honor your father and mother . ”
42018021	And he said , “ I have kept all these things from my youth . ”
42018022	And when Jesus heard this , he said to him : “ One thing is still lacking for you . Sell all the things that you have , and give to the poor . And then you will have treasure in heaven . And come , follow me . ”
42018023	When he heard this , he became very sorrowful . For he was very rich .
42018024	Then Jesus , seeing him brought to sorrow , said : “ How difficult it is for those who have money to enter into the kingdom of God !
42018025	For it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle , than for a wealthy man to enter into the kingdom of God . ”
42018026	And those who were listening to this said , “ Then who is able to be saved ? ”
42018027	He said to them , “ Things that are impossible with men are possible with God . ”
42018028	And Peter said , “ Behold , we have left everything , and we have followed you . ”
42018029	And he said to them : “ Amen , I say to you , there is no one who has left behind home , or parents , or brothers , or a wife , or children , for the sake of the kingdom of God ,
42018030	who will not receive much more in this time , and in the age to come eternal life . ”
42018031	Then Jesus took the twelve aside , and he said to them : “ Behold , we are ascending to Jerusalem , and everything shall be completed which was written by the prophets about the Son of man .
42018032	For he will be handed over to the Gentiles , and he will be mocked and scourged and spit upon .
42018033	And after they have scourged him , they will kill him . And on the third day , he will rise again . ”
42018034	But they understood none of these things . For this word was concealed from them , and they did not understand the things that were said .
42018035	Now it happened that , as he was approaching Jericho , a certain blind man was sitting beside the way , begging .
42018036	And when he heard the multitude passing by , he asked what this was .
42018037	And they told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by .
42018038	And he cried out , saying , “ Jesus , Son of David , take pity on me ! ”
42018039	And those who were passing by rebuked him , so that he would be silent . Yet truly , he cried out all the more , “ Son of David , take pity on me ! ”
42018040	Then Jesus , standing still , ordered him to be brought to him . And when he had drawn near , he questioned him ,
42018041	saying , “ What do you want , that I might do for you ? ” So he said , “ Lord , that I may see . ”
42018042	And Jesus said to him : “ Look around . Your faith has saved you . ”
42018043	And immediately he saw . And he followed him , magnifying God . And all the people , when they saw this , gave praise to God .
42019001	And having entered , he walked through Jericho .
42019002	And behold , there was a man named Zacchaeus . And he was the leader of the tax collectors , and he was wealthy .
42019003	And he sought to see Jesus , to see who he was . But he was unable to do so , because of the crowd , for he was small in stature .
42019004	And running ahead , he climbed up a sycamore tree , so that he might see him . For he was to pass near there .
42019005	And when he had arrived at the place , Jesus looked up and saw him , and he said to him : “ Zacchaeus , hurry down . For today , I should lodge in your house . ”
42019006	And hurrying , he came down , and he received him joyfully .
42019007	And when they all saw this , they murmured , saying that he had turned aside to a sinful man .
42019008	But Zacchaeus , standing still , said to the Lord : “ Behold , Lord , one half of my goods I give to the poor . And if I have cheated anyone in any matter , I will repay him fourfold . ”
42019009	Jesus said to him : “ Today , salvation has come to this house ; because of this , he too is a son of Abraham .
42019010	For the Son of man has come to seek and to save what had been lost . ”
42019011	As they were listening to these things , continuing on , he spoke a parable , because he was nearing Jerusalem , and because they guessed that the kingdom of God might be manifested without delay .
42019012	Therefore , he said : “ A certain man of nobility traveled to a far away region , to receive for himself a kingdom , and to return .
42019013	And calling his ten servants , he gave them ten pounds , and he said to them : ‘ Do business until I return . ’
42019014	But his citizens hated him . And so they sent a delegation after him , saying , ‘ We do not want this one to reign over us . ’
42019015	And it happened that he returned , having received the kingdom . And he ordered the servants , to whom he had given the money , to be called so that he would know how much each one had earned by doing business .
42019016	Now the first approached , saying : ‘ Lord , your one pound has earned ten pounds . ’
42019017	And he said to him : ‘ Well done , good servant . Since you have been faithful in a small matter , you will hold authority over ten cities . ’
42019018	And the second came , saying : ‘ Lord , your one pound has earned five pounds . ’
42019019	And he said to him , ‘ And so , you shall be over five cities . ’
42019020	And another approached , saying : ‘ Lord , behold your one pound , which I kept stored in a cloth .
42019021	For I feared you , because you are an austere man . You take up what you did not lay down , and you reap what you did not sow . ’
42019022	He said to him : ‘ By your own mouth , do I judge you , O wicked servant . You knew that I am an austere man , taking up what I did not lay down , and reaping what I did not sow .
42019023	And so , why did you not give my money to the bank , so that , upon my return , I might have withdrawn it with interest ? ’
42019024	And he said to the bystanders , ‘ Take the pound away from him , and give it to him who has ten pounds . ’
42019025	And they said to him , ‘ Lord , he has ten pounds . ’
42019026	So then , I say to you , that to all who have , it shall be given , and he will have in abundance . And from him who does not have , even what he has will be taken from him .
42019027	‘ Yet truly , as for those enemies of mine , who did not want me to reign over them , bring them here , and put them to death before me . ’ ”
42019028	And having said these things , he went ahead , ascending to Jerusalem .
42019029	And it happened that , when he had drawn near to Bethphage and Bethania , to the mount which is called Olivet , he sent two of his disciples ,
42019030	saying : “ Go into the town which is opposite you . Upon entering it , you will find the colt of a donkey , tied , on which no man has ever sat . Untie it , and lead it here .
42019031	And if anyone will ask you , ‘ Why are you untying it ? ’ you shall say this to him : ‘ Because the Lord has requested its service . ’ ”
42019032	And those who were sent went out , and they found the colt standing , just as he told them .
42019033	Then , as they were untying the colt , its owners said to them , “ Why are you untying the colt ? ”
42019034	So they said , “ Because the Lord has need of it . ”
42019035	And they led it to Jesus . And casting their garments on the colt , they helped Jesus onto it .
42019036	Then , as he was traveling , they were laying down their garments along the way .
42019037	And when he was now drawing near to the descent of Mount Olivet , the entire crowd of his disciples began to praise God joyfully , with a loud voice , over all the powerful works which they had seen ,
42019038	saying : “ Blessed is the king who has arrived in the name of the Lord ! Peace in heaven and glory on high ! ”
42019039	And certain Pharisees within the crowd said to him , “ Teacher , rebuke your disciples . ”
42019040	And he said to them , “ I tell you , that if these will keep silent , the stones themselves will cry out . ”
42019041	And when he drew near , seeing the city , he wept over it , saying :
42019042	“ If only you had known , indeed even in this your day , which things are for your peace . But now they are hidden from your eyes .
42019043	For the days will overtake you . And your enemies will encircle you with a valley . And they will surround you and hem you in on every side .
42019044	And they will knock you down to the ground , with your sons who are in you . And they will not leave stone upon stone within you , because you did not recognize the time of your visitation . ”
42019045	And entering into the temple , he began to cast out those who sold in it , and those who bought ,
42019046	saying to them : “ It is written : ‘ My house is a house of prayer . ’ But you have made it into a den of robbers . ”
42019047	And he was teaching in the temple daily . And the leaders of the priests , and the scribes , and the leaders of the people were seeking to destroy him .
42019048	But they could not find what to do to him . For all the people were listening to him attentively .
42020001	And it happened that , on one of the days when he was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the Gospel , the leaders of the priests , and the scribes , gathered together with the elders ,
42020002	and they spoke to him , saying : “ Tell us , by what authority do you do these things ? Or , who is it that has given you this authority ? ”
42020003	And in response , Jesus said to them : “ I will also question you about one word . Respond to me :
42020004	The baptism of John , was it from heaven , or of men ? ”
42020005	So they discussed it among themselves , saying : “ If we say , ‘ From heaven , ’ he will say , ‘ Then why did you not believe him ? ’
42020006	But if we say , ‘ Of men , ’ the whole people will stone us . For they are certain that John was a prophet . ”
42020007	And so they responded that they did not know where it was from .
42020008	And Jesus said to them , “ Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things . ”
42020009	Then he began to tell the people this parable : “ A man planted a vineyard , and he loaned it to settlers , and he was on a sojourn for a long time .
42020010	And in due time , he sent a servant to the farmers , so that they would give to him from the fruit of the vineyard . And they beat him and drove him away , empty-handed .
42020011	And he continued to send another servant . But beating him and treating him with contempt , they likewise sent him away , empty-handed .
42020012	And he continued to send a third . And wounding him also , they drove him away .
42020013	Then the lord of the vineyard said : ‘ What shall I do ? I will send my beloved son . Perhaps when they have seen him , they will respect him . ’
42020014	And when the settlers had seen him , they discussed it among themselves , saying : ‘ This one is the heir . Let us kill him , so that the inheritance will be ours . ’
42020015	And forcing him outside of the vineyard , they killed him . What , then , will the lord of the vineyard do to them ? ”
42020016	“ He will come and destroy those settlers , and he will give the vineyard to others . ” And upon hearing this , they said to him , “ Let it not be . ”
42020017	Then , gazing at them , he said : “ Then what does this mean , which is written : ‘ The stone which the builders have rejected , the same has become the head of the corner ? ’
42020018	Everyone who falls on that stone will be shattered . And anyone upon whom it falls will be crushed . ”
42020019	And the leaders of the priests , and the scribes , were seeking to lay hands on him in that same hour , but they feared the people . For they realized that he had spoken this parable about them .
42020020	And being attentive , they sent traitors , who would pretend that they were just , so that they might catch him in his words and then hand him over to the power and authority of the procurator .
42020021	And they questioned him , saying : “ Teacher , we know that you speak and teach correctly , and that you do not consider anyone’s status , but you teach the way of God in truth .
42020022	Is it lawful for us to pay the tribute to Caesar , or not ? ”
42020023	But realizing their deceitfulness , he said to them : “ Why do you test me ?
42020024	Show me a denarius . Whose image and inscription does it have ? ” In response , they said to him , “ Caesar’s . ”
42020025	And so , he said to them : “ Then repay the things that are Caesar’s , to Caesar , and the things that are God’s , to God . ”
42020026	And they were not able to contradict his word before the people . And being amazed at his answer , they were silent .
42020027	Now some of the Sadducees , who deny that there is a resurrection , approached him . And they questioned him ,
42020028	saying : “ Teacher , Moses wrote for us : If any man’s brother will have died , having a wife , and if he does not have any children , then his brother should take her as his wife , and he should raise up offspring for his brother .
42020029	And so there were seven brothers . And the first took a wife , and he died without sons .
42020030	And the next one married her , and he also died without a son .
42020031	And the third married her , and similarly all seven , and none of them left behind any offspring , and they each died .
42020032	Last of all , the woman also died .
42020033	In the resurrection , then , whose wife will she be ? For certainly all seven had her as a wife . ”
42020034	And so , Jesus said to them : “ The children of this age marry and are given in marriage .
42020035	Yet truly , those who shall be held worthy of that age , and of the resurrection from the dead , will neither be married , nor take wives .
42020036	For they can no longer die . For they are equal to the Angels , and they are children of God , since they are children of the resurrection .
42020037	For in truth , the dead do rise again , as Moses also showed beside the bush , when he called the Lord : ‘ The God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . ’
42020038	And so he is not the God of the dead , but of the living . For all are alive to him . ”
42020039	Then some of the scribes , in response , said to him , “ Teacher , you have spoken well . ”
42020040	And they no longer dared to question him about anything .
42020041	But he said to them : “ How can they say that the Christ is the son of David ?
42020042	Even David himself says , in the book of Psalms : ‘ The Lord said to my Lord , sit at my right hand ,
42020043	until I set your enemies as your footstool . ’
42020044	Therefore , David calls him Lord . So how can he be his son ? ”
42020045	Now in the hearing of all the people , he said to his disciples :
42020046	“ Be cautious of the scribes , who choose to walk in long robes , and who love greetings in the marketplace , and the first chairs in the synagogues , and the first places at table during feasts ,
42020047	who devour the houses of widows , feigning long prayers . These will receive the greater damnation . ”
42021001	And looking around , he saw the wealthy putting their donations into the offertory .
42021002	Then he also saw a certain widow , a pauper , putting in two small brass coins .
42021003	And he said : “ Truly , I say to you , that this poor widow has put in more than all the others .
42021004	For all these , out of their abundance , have added to the gifts for God . But she , out of what she needed , has put in all that she had to live on . ”
42021005	And when some of them were saying , about the temple , that it was adorned with excellent stones and gifts , he said ,
42021006	“ These things that you see , the days will arrive when there will not be left behind stone upon stone , which is not thrown down . ”
42021007	Then they questioned him , saying : “ Teacher , when will these things be ? And what will be the sign when these things will happen ? ”
42021008	And he said : “ Be cautious , lest you be seduced . For many will come in my name , saying : ‘ For I am he , ’ and , ‘ The time has drawn near . ’ And so , do not choose to go after them .
42021009	And when you will have heard of battles and seditions , do not be terrified . These things must happen first . But the end is not so soon . ”
42021010	Then he said to them : “ People will rise up against people , and kingdom against kingdom .
42021011	And there will be great earthquakes in various places , and pestilences , and famines , and terrors from heaven ; and there will be great signs .
42021012	But before all these things , they will lay their hands on you and persecute you , handing you over to synagogues and into custody , dragging you before kings and governors , because of my name .
42021013	And this will be an opportunity for you to give testimony .
42021014	Therefore , set this in your hearts : that you should not consider in advance how you might respond .
42021015	For I will give to you a mouth and wisdom , which all your adversaries will not be able to resist or contradict .
42021016	And you will be handed over by your parents , and brothers , and relatives , and friends . And they will bring about the death of some of you .
42021017	And you will be hated by all because of my name .
42021018	And yet , not a hair of your head will perish .
42021019	By your patience , you shall possess your souls .
42021020	Then , when you will have seen Jerusalem encircled by an army , know then that its desolation has drawn near .
42021021	Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains , and those who are in its midst withdraw , and those who are in the countryside not enter into it .
42021022	For these are the days of retribution , so that all things may be fulfilled , which have been written .
42021023	Then woe to those who are pregnant or nursing in those days . For there will be great distress upon the land and great wrath upon this people .
42021024	And they will fall by the edge of the sword . And they will be led away as captives into all nations . And Jerusalem will be trampled by the Gentiles , until the times of the nations are fulfilled .
42021025	And there will be signs in the sun and the moon and the stars . And there will be , on earth , distress among the Gentiles , out of confusion at the roaring of the sea and of the waves :
42021026	men withering away out of fear and out of apprehension over the things that will overwhelm the whole world . For the powers of the heavens will be moved .
42021027	And then they will see the Son of man coming on a cloud , with great power and majesty .
42021028	But when these things begin to happen , lift up your heads and look around you , because your redemption draws near . ”
42021029	And he told them a comparison : “ Take notice of the fig tree and of all the trees .
42021030	When presently they produce fruit from themselves , you know that summer is near .
42021031	So you also , when you will have seen these things happen , know that the kingdom of God is near .
42021032	Amen I say to you , this lineage shall not pass away , until all these things happen .
42021033	Heaven and earth shall pass away . But my words shall not pass away .
42021034	But be attentive to yourselves , lest perhaps your hearts may be weighed down by self-indulgence and inebriation and the cares of this life . And then that day may overwhelm you suddenly .
42021035	For like a snare it will overwhelm all those who sit upon the face of the entire earth .
42021036	And so , be vigilant , praying at all times , so that you may be held worthy to escape from all these things , which are in the future , and to stand before the Son of man . ”
42021037	Now in the daytime , he was teaching in the temple . But truly , departing in the evening , he lodged on the mount that is called Olivet .
42021038	And all the people arrived in the morning to listen to him in the temple .
42022001	Now the days of the Feast of Unleavened Bread , which is called Passover , were approaching .
42022002	And the leaders of the priests , and the scribes , were seeking a way to execute Jesus . Yet truly , they were afraid of the people .
42022003	Then Satan entered into Judas , who was surnamed Iscariot , one of the twelve .
42022004	And he went out and was speaking with the leaders of the priests , and the magistrates , as to how he might hand him over to them .
42022005	And they were glad , and so they made an agreement to give him money .
42022006	And he made a promise . And he was seeking an opportunity to hand him over , apart from the crowds .
42022007	Then the day of Unleavened Bread arrived , on which it was necessary to kill the Pascal lamb .
42022008	And he sent Peter and John , saying , “ Go out , and prepare the Passover for us , so that we may eat . ”
42022009	But they said , “ Where do you want us to prepare it ? ”
42022010	And he said to them : “ Behold , as you are entering into the city , a certain man will meet you , carrying a pitcher of water . Follow him to the house into which he enters .
42022011	And you shall say to the father of the household : ‘ The Teacher says to you : Where is the guestroom , where I may eat the Passover with my disciples ? ’
42022012	And he will show you a large cenacle , fully furnished . And so , prepare it there . ”
42022013	And going out , they found it to be just as he had told them . And they prepared the Passover .
42022014	And when the hour had arrived , he sat down at table , and the twelve Apostles with him .
42022015	And he said to them : “ With longing have I desired to eat this Passover with you , before I suffer .
42022016	For I say to you , that from this time , I will not eat it , until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God . ”
42022017	And having taken the chalice , he gave thanks , and he said : “ Take this and share it among yourselves .
42022018	For I say to you , that I will not drink from the fruit of the vine , until the kingdom of God arrives . ”
42022019	And taking bread , he gave thanks and broke it and gave it to them , saying : “ This is my body , which is given for you . Do this as a commemoration of me . ”
42022020	Similarly also , he took the chalice , after he had eaten the meal , saying : “ This chalice is the new covenant in my blood , which will be shed for you .
42022021	But in truth , behold , the hand of my betrayer is with me at table .
42022022	And indeed , the Son of man goes according to what has been determined . And yet , woe to that man by whom he will be betrayed . ”
42022023	And they began to inquire among themselves , as to which of them might do this .
42022024	Now there was also a contention among them , as to which of them seemed to be the greater .
42022025	And he said to them : “ The kings of the Gentiles dominate them ; and those who hold authority over them are called beneficent .
42022026	But it must not be so with you . Instead , whoever is greater among you , let him become the lesser . And whoever is the leader , let him become the server .
42022027	For who is greater : he who sits at table , or he who serves ? Is not he who sits at table ? Yet I am in your midst as one who serves .
42022028	But you are those who have remained with me during my trials .
42022029	And I dispose to you , just as my Father has disposed to me , a kingdom ,
42022030	so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom , and so that you may sit upon thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel . ”
42022031	And the Lord said : “ Simon , Simon ! Behold , Satan has asked for you , so that he may sift you like wheat .
42022032	But I have prayed for you , so that your faith may not fail , and so that you , once converted , may confirm your brothers . ”
42022033	And he said to him , “ Lord , I am prepared to go with you , even to prison and to death . ”
42022034	And he said , “ I say to you , Peter , the rooster will not crow this day , until you have three times denied that you know me . ” And he said to them ,
42022035	“ When I sent you without money or provisions or shoes , did you lack anything ? ”
42022036	And they said , “ Nothing . ” Then he said to them : “ But now , let whoever has money take it , and likewise with provisions . And whoever does not have these , let him sell his coat and buy a sword .
42022037	For I say to you , that what has been written must still be fulfilled in me : ‘ And he was esteemed with the wicked . ’ Yet even these things about me have an end . ”
42022038	So they said , “ Lord , behold , there are two swords here . ” But he said to them , “ It is sufficient . ”
42022039	And departing , he went out , according to his custom , to the Mount of Olives . And his disciples also followed him .
42022040	And when he had arrived at the place , he said to them : “ Pray , lest you enter into temptation . ”
42022041	And he was separated from them by about a stone’s throw . And kneeling down , he prayed ,
42022042	saying : “ Father , if you are willing , take this chalice away from me . Yet truly , let not my will , but yours , be done . ”
42022043	Then an Angel appeared to him from heaven , strengthening him . And being in agony , he prayed more intensely ;
42022044	and so his sweat became like drops of blood , running down to the ground .
42022045	And when he had risen up from prayer and had gone to his disciples , he found them sleeping out of sorrow .
42022046	And he said to them : “ Why are you sleeping ? Rise up , pray , lest you enter into temptation . ”
42022047	While he was still speaking , behold , a crowd arrived . And he who is called Judas , one of the twelve , went ahead of them and approached Jesus , in order to kiss him .
42022048	And Jesus said to him , “ Judas , do you betray the Son of man with a kiss ? ”
42022049	Then those who were around him , realizing what was about to happen , said to him : “ Lord , shall we strike with the sword ? ”
42022050	And one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear .
42022051	But in response , Jesus said , “ Permit even this . ” And when he had touched his ear , he healed him .
42022052	Then Jesus said to the leaders of the priests , and the magistrates of the temple , and the elders , who had come to him : “ Have you gone out , as if against a thief , with swords and clubs ?
42022053	When I was with you each day in the temple , you did not extend your hands against me . But this is your hour and that of the power of darkness . ”
42022054	And apprehending him , they led him to the house of the high priest . Yet truly , Peter followed at a distance .
42022055	Now as they were sitting around a fire , which had been kindled in the middle of the atrium , Peter was in their midst .
42022056	And when a certain woman servant had seen him sitting in its light , and had looked at him intently , she said , “ This one was also with him . ”
42022057	But he denied him by saying , “ Woman , I do not know him . ”
42022058	And after a little while , another one , seeing him , said , “ You also are one of them . ” Yet Peter said , “ O man , I am not . ”
42022059	And after the interval of about one hour had passed , someone else affirmed it , saying : “ Truly , this one also was with him . For he is also a Galilean . ”
42022060	And Peter said : “ Man , I do not know what you are saying . ” And at once , while he was still speaking , the rooster crowed .
42022061	And the Lord turned around and looked at Peter . And Peter remembered the word of the Lord that he had said : “ For before the rooster crows , you will deny me three times . ”
42022062	And going out , Peter wept bitterly .
42022063	And the men who were holding him ridiculed him and beat him .
42022064	And they blindfolded him and repeatedly struck his face . And they questioned him , saying : “ Prophesy ! Who is it that struck you ? ”
42022065	And blaspheming in many other ways , they spoke against him .
42022066	And when it was daytime , the elders of the people , and the leaders of the priests , and the scribes convened . And they led him into their council , saying , “ If you are the Christ , tell us . ”
42022067	And he said to them : “ If I tell you , you will not believe me .
42022068	And if I also question you , you will not answer me . Neither will you release me .
42022069	But from this time , the Son of man will be sitting at the right hand of the power of God . ”
42022070	Then they all said , “ So you are the Son of God ? ” And he said . “ You are saying that I am . ”
42022071	And they said : “ Why do we still require testimony ? For we have heard it ourselves , from his own mouth . ”
42023001	And the entire multitude of them , rising up , led him to Pilate .
42023002	Then they began to accuse him , saying , “ We found this one subverting our nation , and prohibiting giving tribute to Caesar , and saying that he is Christ the king . ”
42023003	And Pilate questioned him , saying : “ You are the king of the Jews ? ” But in response , he said : “ You are saying it . ”
42023004	Then Pilate said to the leaders of the priests and to the crowds , “ I find no case against this man . ”
42023005	But they continued more intensely , saying : “ He has stirred up the people , teaching throughout all of Judea , beginning from Galilee , even to this place . ”
42023006	But Pilate , upon hearing Galilee , asked if the man were of Galilee .
42023007	And when he realized that he was under Herod’s jurisdiction , he sent him away to Herod , who was himself also at Jerusalem in those days .
42023008	Then Herod , upon seeing Jesus , was very glad . For he had been wanting to see him for a long time , because he had heard so many things about him , and he was hoping to see some kind of sign wrought by him .
42023009	Then he questioned him with many words . But he gave him no response at all .
42023010	And the leaders of the priests , and the scribes , stood firm in persistently accusing him .
42023011	Then Herod , with his soldiers , scorned him . And he ridiculed him , clothing him in a white garment . And he sent him back to Pilate .
42023012	And Herod and Pilate became friends on that day . For previously they were enemies to one another .
42023013	And Pilate , calling together the leaders of the priests , and the magistrates , and the people ,
42023014	said to them : “ You have brought before me this man , as one who disturbs the people . And behold , having questioned him before you , I find no case against this man , in those things about which you accuse him .
42023015	And neither did Herod . For I sent you all to him , and behold , nothing deserving of death was recorded about him .
42023016	Therefore , I will chastise him and release him . ”
42023017	Now he was required to release one person for them on the feast day .
42023018	But the entire crowd exclaimed together , saying : “ Take this one , and release to us Barabbas ! ”
42023019	Now he had been cast into prison because of a certain sedition that occurred in the city and for murder .
42023020	Then Pilate spoke to them again , wanting to release Jesus .
42023021	But they shouted in response , saying : “ Crucify him ! Crucify him ! ”
42023022	Then he said to them a third time : “ Why ? What evil has he done ? I find no case against him for death . Therefore , I will chastise him and release him . ”
42023023	But they persisted , with loud voices , in demanding that he be crucified . And their voices increased in intensity .
42023024	And so Pilate issued a judgment granting their petition .
42023025	Then he released for them the one who had been cast into prison for murder and sedition , whom they were requesting . Yet truly , Jesus he handed over to their will .
42023026	And as they were leading him away , they apprehended a certain one , Simon of Cyrene , as he was returning from the countryside . And they imposed the cross on him to carry after Jesus .
42023027	Then a great crowd of people followed him , with women who were mourning and lamenting him .
42023028	But Jesus , turning to them , said : “ Daughters of Jerusalem , do not weep over me . Instead , weep over yourselves and over your children .
42023029	For behold , the days will arrive in which they will say , ‘ Blessed are the barren , and the wombs that have not borne , and the breasts that have not nursed . ’
42023030	Then they will begin to say to the mountains , ‘ Fall over us , ’ and to the hills , ‘ Cover us . ’
42023031	For if they do these things with green wood , what will be done with the dry ? ”
42023032	Now they also led out two other criminals with him , in order to execute them .
42023033	And when they arrived at the place that is called Calvary , they crucified him there , with the robbers , one to the right and the other to the left .
42023034	Then Jesus said , “ Father , forgive them . For they know not what they do . ” And truly , dividing his garments , they cast lots .
42023035	And people were standing near , watching . And the leaders among them derided him , saying : “ He saved others . Let him save himself , if this one is the Christ , the elect of God . ”
42023036	And the soldiers also ridiculed him , approaching him and offering him vinegar ,
42023037	and saying , “ If you are the king of the Jews , save yourself . ”
42023038	Now there was also an inscription written over him in letters of Greek , and Latin , and Hebrew : THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS .
42023039	And one of those robbers who were hanging blasphemed him , saying , “ If you are the Christ , save yourself and us . ”
42023040	But the other responded by rebuking him , saying : “ Do you have no fear of God , since you are under the same condemnation ?
42023041	And indeed , it is just for us . For we are receiving what our deeds deserve . But truly , this one has done nothing wrong . ”
42023042	And he said to Jesus , “ Lord , remember me when you come into your kingdom . ”
42023043	And Jesus said to him , “ Amen I say to you , this day you shall be with me in Paradise . ”
42023044	Now it was nearly the sixth hour , and a darkness occurred over the entire earth , until the ninth hour .
42023045	And the sun was obscured . And the veil of the temple was torn down the middle .
42023046	And Jesus , crying out with a loud voice , said : “ Father , into your hands I commend my spirit . ” And upon saying this , he expired .
42023047	Now , the centurion , seeing what had happened , glorified God , saying , “ Truly , this man was the Just One . ”
42023048	And the entire crowd of those who came together to see this spectacle also saw what had happened , and they returned , striking their breasts .
42023049	Now all those who knew him , and the women who had followed him from Galilee , were standing at a distance , watching these things .
42023050	And behold , there was a man named Joseph , who was a councilman , a good and just man ,
42023051	( for he had not consented to their decision or their actions ) . He was from Arimathea , a city of Judea . And he was himself also anticipating the kingdom of God .
42023052	This man approached Pilate and petitioned for the body of Jesus .
42023053	And taking him down , he wrapped him in a fine linen cloth , and he placed him in a tomb hewn from rock , in which no one had ever been placed .
42023054	And it was the day of Preparation , and the Sabbath was drawing near .
42023055	Now the women who had come with him from Galilee , by following , saw the tomb and the manner in which his body was placed .
42023056	And upon returning , they prepared aromatic spices and ointments . But on the Sabbath , indeed , they rested , according to the commandment .
42024001	Then , on the first Sabbath , at very first light , they went to the tomb , carrying the aromatic spices that they had prepared .
42024002	And they found the stone rolled back from the tomb .
42024003	And upon entering , they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus .
42024004	And it happened that , while their minds were still confused about this , behold , two men stood beside them , in shining apparel .
42024005	Then , since they were afraid and were turning their faces toward the ground , these two said to them : “ Why do you seek the living with the dead ?
42024006	He is not here , for he has risen . Recall how he spoke to you , when he was still in Galilee ,
42024007	saying : ‘ For the Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men , and be crucified , and on the third day rise again . ’ ”
42024008	And they called to mind his words .
42024009	And returning from the tomb , they reported all these things to the eleven , and to all the others .
42024010	Now it was Mary Magdalene , and Joanna , and Mary of James , and the other women who were with them , who told these things to the Apostles .
42024011	But these words seemed to them a delusion . And so they did not believe them .
42024012	But Peter , rising up , ran to the tomb . And stooping down , he saw the linen cloths positioned alone , and he went away wondering to himself about what had happened .
42024013	And behold , two of them went out , on the same day , to a town named Emmaus , which was the distance of sixty stadia from Jerusalem .
42024014	And they spoke to one another about all of these things that had occurred .
42024015	And it happened that , while they were speculating and questioning within themselves , Jesus himself , drawing near , traveled with them .
42024016	But their eyes were restrained , so that they would not recognize him .
42024017	And he said to them , “ What are these words , which you are discussing with one another , as you walk and are sad ? ”
42024018	And one of them , whose name was Cleopas , responded by saying to him , “ Are you the only one visiting Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days ? ”
42024019	And he said to them , “ What things ? ” And they said , “ About Jesus of Nazareth , who was a noble prophet , powerful in works and in words , before God and all the people .
42024020	And how our high priests and leaders handed him over to be condemned to death . And they crucified him .
42024021	But we were hoping that he would be the Redeemer of Israel . And now , on top of all this , today is the third day since these things have happened .
42024022	Then , too , certain women from among us terrified us . For before daytime , they were at the tomb ,
42024023	and , having not found his body , they returned , saying that they had even seen a vision of Angels , who said that he is alive .
42024024	And some of us went out to the tomb . And they found it just as the women had said . But truly , they did not find him . ”
42024025	And he said to them : “ How foolish and reluctant in heart you are , to believe everything that has been spoken by the Prophets !
42024026	Was not the Christ required to suffer these things , and so enter into his glory ? ”
42024027	And beginning from Moses and all the Prophets , he interpreted for them , in all the Scriptures , the things that were about him .
42024028	And they drew near to the town where they were going . And he conducted himself so as to go on further .
42024029	But they were insistent with him , saying , “ Remain with us , because it is toward evening and now daylight is declining . ” And so he entered with them .
42024030	And it happened that , while he was at table with them , he took bread , and he blessed and broke it , and he extended it to them .
42024031	And their eyes were opened , and they recognized him . And he vanished from their eyes .
42024032	And they said to one another , “ Was not our heart burning within us , while he was speaking on the way , and when he opened the Scriptures to us ? ”
42024033	And rising up at that same hour , they returned to Jerusalem . And they found the eleven gathered together , and those who were with them ,
42024034	saying : “ In truth , the Lord has risen , and he has appeared to Simon . ”
42024035	And they explained the things that were done on the way , and how they had recognized him at the breaking of the bread .
42024036	Then , while they were talking about these things , Jesus stood in their midst , And he said to them : “ Peace be with you . It is I . Do not be afraid . ”
42024037	Yet truly , they were very disturbed and terrified , supposing that they saw a spirit .
42024038	And he said to them : “ Why are you disturbed , and why do these thoughts rise up in your hearts ?
42024039	See my hands and feet , that it is I myself . Look and touch . For a spirit does not have flesh and bones , as you see that I have . ”
42024040	And when he had said this , he showed them his hands and feet .
42024041	Then , while they were still in disbelief and in wonder out of joy , he said , “ Do you have anything here to eat ? ”
42024042	And they offered him a piece of roasted fish and a honeycomb .
42024043	And when he had eaten these in their sight , taking up what was left , he gave it to them .
42024044	And he said to them : “ These are the words that I spoke to you when I was still with you , because all things must be fulfilled which are written in the law of Moses , and in the Prophets , and in the Psalms about me . ”
42024045	Then he opened their mind , so that they might understand the Scriptures .
42024046	And he said to them : “ For so it is written , and so it was necessary , for the Christ to suffer and to rise up from the dead on the third day ,
42024047	and , in his name , for repentance and the remission of sins to be preached , among all the nations , beginning at Jerusalem .
42024048	And you are witnesses of these things .
42024049	And I am sending the Promise of my Father upon you . But you must stay in the city , until such time as you are clothed with power from on high . ”
42024050	Then he led them out as far as Bethania . And lifting up his hands , he blessed them .
42024051	And it happened that , while he was blessing them , he withdrew from them , and he was carried up into heaven .
42024052	And worshiping , they returned to Jerusalem with great joy .
42024053	And they were always in the temple , praising and blessing God . Amen .
43001001	In the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and God was the Word .
43001002	He was with God in the beginning .
43001003	All things were made through Him , and nothing that was made was made without Him .
43001004	Life was in Him , and Life was the light of men .
43001005	And the light shines in the darkness , and the darkness did not comprehend it .
43001006	There was a man sent by God , whose name was John .
43001007	He arrived as a witness to offer testimony about the Light , so that all would believe through him .
43001008	He was not the Light , but he was to offer testimony about the Light .
43001009	The true Light , which illuminates every man , was coming into this world .
43001010	He was in the world , and the world was made through him , and the world did not recognize him .
43001011	He went to his own , and his own did not accept him .
43001012	Yet whoever did accept him , those who believed in his name , he gave them the power to become the sons of God .
43001013	These are born , not of blood , nor of the will of flesh , nor of the will of man , but of God .
43001014	And the Word became flesh , and he lived among us , and we saw his glory , glory like that of an only-begotten son from the Father , full of grace and truth .
43001015	John offers testimony about him , and he cries out , saying : “ This is the one about whom I said : ‘ He who is to come after me , has been placed ahead of me , because he existed before me . ’ ”
43001016	And from his fullness , we all have received , even grace for grace .
43001017	For the law was given though Moses , but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ .
43001018	No one ever saw God ; the only-begotten Son , who is in the bosom of the Father , he himself has described him .
43001019	And this is the testimony of John , when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to him , so that they might ask him , “ Who are you ? ”
43001020	And he confessed it and did not deny it ; and what he confessed was : “ I am not the Christ . ”
43001021	And they questioned him : “ Then what are you ? Are you Elijah ? ” And he said , “ I am not . ” “ Are you the Prophet ? ” And he answered , “ No . ”
43001022	Therefore , they said to him : “ Who are you , so that we may give an answer to those who sent us ? What do you say about yourself ? ”
43001023	He said , “ I am a voice crying out in the desert , ‘ Make straight the way of the Lord , ’ just as the prophet Isaiah said . ”
43001024	And some of those who had been sent were from among the Pharisees .
43001025	And they questioned him and said to him , “ Then why do you baptize , if you are not the Christ , and not Elijah , and not the Prophet ? ”
43001026	John answered them by saying : “ I baptize with water . But in your midst stands one , whom you do not know .
43001027	The same is he who is to come after me , who has been placed ahead of me , the laces of whose shoes I am not worthy to loosen . ”
43001028	These things happened in Bethania , across the Jordan , where John was baptizing .
43001029	On the next day , John saw Jesus coming toward him , and so he said : “ Behold , the Lamb of God . Behold , he who takes away the sin of the world .
43001030	This is the one about whom I said , ‘ After me arrives a man , who has been placed ahead of me , because he existed before me . ’
43001031	And I did not know him . Yet it is for this reason that I come baptizing with water : so that he may be made manifest in Israel . ”
43001032	And John offered testimony , saying : “ For I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove ; and he remained upon him .
43001033	And I did not know him . But he who sent me to baptize with water said to me : ‘ He over whom you will see the Spirit descending and remaining upon him , this is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit . ’
43001034	And I saw , and I gave testimony : that this one is the Son of God . ”
43001035	The next day again , John was standing with two of his disciples .
43001036	And catching sight of Jesus walking , he said , “ Behold , the Lamb of God . ”
43001037	And two disciples were listening to him speaking . And they followed Jesus .
43001038	Then Jesus , turning around and seeing them following him , said to them , “ What are you seeking ? ” And they said to him , “ Rabbi ( which means in translation , Teacher ) , where do you live ? ”
43001039	He said to them , “ Come and see . ” They went and saw where he was staying , and they stayed with him that day . Now it was about the tenth hour .
43001040	And Andrew , the brother of Simon Peter , was one of the two who had heard about him from John and had followed him .
43001041	First , he found his brother Simon , and he said to him , “ We have found the Messiah , ” ( which is translated as the Christ ) .
43001042	And he led him to Jesus . And Jesus , gazing at him , said : “ You are Simon , son of Jonah . You shall be called Cephas , ” ( which is translated as Peter ) .
43001043	On the next day , he wanted to go into Galilee , and he found Philip . And Jesus said to him , “ Follow me . ”
43001044	Now Philip was from Bethsaida , the city of Andrew and Peter .
43001045	Philip found Nathanael , and he said to him , “ We have found the one about whom Moses wrote in the Law and the Prophets : Jesus , the son of Joseph , from Nazareth . ”
43001046	And Nathanael said to him , “ Can anything good be from Nazareth ? ” Philip said to him , “ Come and see . ”
43001047	Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him , and he said about him , “ Behold , an Israelite in whom truly there is no deceit . ”
43001048	Nathanael said to him , “ From where do you know me ? ” Jesus responded and said to him , “ Before Philip called you , when you were under the fig tree , I saw you . ”
43001049	Nathanael answered him and said : “ Rabbi , you are the Son of God . You are the King of Israel . ”
43001050	Jesus responded and said to him : “ Because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree , you believe . Greater things than these , you will see . ”
43001051	And he said to him , “ Amen , amen , I say to you , you will see heaven opened , and the Angels of God ascending and descending over the Son of man . ”
43002001	And on the third day , a wedding was held in Cana of Galilee , and the mother of Jesus was there .
43002002	Now Jesus was also invited to the wedding , with his disciples .
43002003	And when the wine was failing , the mother of Jesus said to him , “ They have no wine . ”
43002004	And Jesus said to her : “ What is that to me and to you , woman ? My hour has not yet arrived . ”
43002005	His mother said to the servants , “ Do whatever he tells you . ”
43002006	Now in that place , there were six stone water jars , for the purification ritual of the Jews , containing two or three measures each .
43002007	Jesus said to them , “ Fill the water jars with water . ” And they filled them to the very top .
43002008	And Jesus said to them , “ Now draw from it , and carry it to the chief steward of the feast . ” And they took it to him .
43002009	Then , when the chief steward had tasted the water made into wine , since he did not know where it was from , for only the servants who had drawn the water knew , the chief steward called the groom ,
43002010	and he said to him : “ Every man offers the good wine first , and then , when they have become inebriated , he offers what is worse . But you have kept the good wine until now . ”
43002011	This was the beginning of the signs that Jesus accomplished in Cana of Galilee , and it manifested his glory , and his disciples believed in him .
43002012	After this , he descended to Capernaum , with his mother and his brothers and his disciples , but they did not remain there for many days .
43002013	And the Passover of the Jews was near , and so Jesus ascended to Jerusalem .
43002014	And he found , sitting in the temple , sellers of oxen and sheep and doves , and the moneychangers .
43002015	And when he had made something like a whip out of little cords , he drove them all out of the temple , including the sheep and the oxen . And he poured out the brass coins of the moneychangers , and he overturned their tables .
43002016	And to those who were selling doves , he said : “ Take these things out of here , and do not make my Father’s house into a house of commerce . ”
43002017	And truly , his disciples were reminded that it is written : “ Zeal for your house consumes me . ”
43002018	Then the Jews responded and said to him , “ What sign can you show to us , that you may do these things ? ”
43002019	Jesus responded and said to them , “ Destroy this temple , and in three days I will raise it up . ”
43002020	Then the Jews said , “ This temple has been built up over forty-six years , and you will raise it up in three days ? ”
43002021	Yet he was speaking about the Temple of his body .
43002022	Therefore , when he had resurrected from the dead , his disciples were reminded that he had said this , and they believed in the Scriptures and in the word that Jesus had spoken .
43002023	Now while he was at Jerusalem during the Passover , on the day of the feast , many trusted in his name , seeing his signs that he was accomplishing .
43002024	But Jesus did not trust himself to them , because he himself had knowledge of all persons ,
43002025	and because he had no need of anyone to offer testimony about a man . For he knew what was within a man .
43003001	Now there was a man among the Pharisees , named Nicodemus , a leader of the Jews .
43003002	He went to Jesus at night , and he said to him : “ Rabbi , we know that you have arrived as a teacher from God . For no one would be able to accomplish these signs , which you accomplish , unless God were with him . ”
43003003	Jesus responded and said to him , “ Amen , amen , I say to you , unless one has been reborn anew , he is not able to see the kingdom of God . ”
43003004	Nicodemus said to him : “ How could a man be born when he is old ? Surely , he cannot enter a second time into his mother’s womb to be reborn ? ”
43003005	Jesus responded : “ Amen , amen , I say to you , unless one has been reborn by water and the Holy Spirit , he is not able to enter into the kingdom of God .
43003006	What is born of the flesh is flesh , and what is born of the Spirit is spirit .
43003007	You should not be amazed that I said to you : You must be born anew .
43003008	The Spirit inspires where he wills . And you hear his voice , but you do not know where he comes from , or where he is going . So it is with all who are born of the Spirit . ”
43003009	Nicodemus responded and said to him , “ How are these things able to be accomplished ? ”
43003010	Jesus responded and said to him : “ You are a teacher in Israel , and you are ignorant of these things ?
43003011	Amen , amen , I say to you , that we speak about what we know , and we testify about what we have seen . But you do not accept our testimony .
43003012	If I have spoken to you about earthly things , and you have not believed , then how will you believe , if I will speak to you about heavenly things ?
43003013	And no one has ascended to heaven , except the one who descended from heaven : the Son of man who is in heaven .
43003014	And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert , so also must the Son of man be lifted up ,
43003015	so that whoever believes in him may not perish , but may have eternal life .
43003016	For God so loved the world that he gave his only-begotten Son , so that all who believe in him may not perish , but may have eternal life .
43003017	For God did not send his Son into the world , in order to judge the world , but in order that the world may be saved through him .
43003018	Whoever believes in him is not judged . But whoever does not believe is already judged , because he does not believe in the name of the only-begotten Son of God .
43003019	And this is the judgment : that the Light has come into the world , and men loved darkness more than light . For their works were evil .
43003020	For everyone who does evil hates the Light and does not go toward the Light , so that his works may not be corrected .
43003021	But whoever acts in truth goes toward the Light , so that his works may be manifested , because they have been accomplished in God . ”
43003022	After these things , Jesus and his disciples went into the land of Judea . And he was living there with them and baptizing .
43003023	Now John was also baptizing , at Aenon near Salim , because there was much water in that place . And they were arriving and being baptized .
43003024	For John had not yet been cast into prison .
43003025	Then a dispute occurred between the disciples of John and the Jews , about purification .
43003026	And they went to John and said to him : “ Rabbi , the one who was with you across the Jordan , about whom you offered testimony : behold , he is baptizing and everyone is going to him . ”
43003027	John responded and said : “ A man is not able to receive anything , unless it has been given to him from heaven .
43003028	You yourselves offer testimony for me that I said , ‘ I am not the Christ , ’ but that I have been sent before him .
43003029	He who holds the bride is the groom . But the friend of the groom , who stands and listens to Him , rejoices joyfully at the voice of the groom . And so , this , my joy , has been fulfilled .
43003030	He must increase , while I must decrease .
43003031	He who comes from above , is above everything . He who is from below , is of the earth , and he speaks about the earth . He who comes from heaven is above everything .
43003032	And what he has seen and heard , about this he testifies . And no one accepts his testimony .
43003033	Whoever has accepted his testimony has certified that God is truthful .
43003034	For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God . For God does not give the Spirit by measure .
43003035	The Father loves the Son , and he has given everything into his hand .
43003036	Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life . But whoever is unbelieving toward the Son shall not see life ; instead the wrath of God remains upon him . ”
43004001	And so , when Jesus realized that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made more disciples and baptized more than John ,
43004002	( though Jesus himself was not baptizing , but only his disciples )
43004003	he left behind Judea , and he traveled again to Galilee .
43004004	Now he needed to cross through Samaria .
43004005	Therefore , he went into a city of Samaria which is called Sychar , near the estate which Jacob gave to his son Joseph .
43004006	And Jacob’s well was there . And so Jesus , being tired from the journey , was sitting in a certain way on the well . It was about the sixth hour .
43004007	A woman of Samaria arrived to draw water . Jesus said to her , “ Give me to drink . ”
43004008	For his disciples had gone into the city in order to buy food .
43004009	And so , that Samaritan woman said to him , “ How is it that you , being a Jew , are requesting a drink from me , though I am a Samaritan woman ? ” For the Jews do not associate with the Samaritans .
43004010	Jesus responded and said to her : “ If you knew the gift of God , and who it is who is saying to you , ‘ Give me to drink , ’ perhaps you would have made a request of him , and he would have given you living water . ”
43004011	The woman said to him : “ Lord , you do not have anything with which to draw water , and the well is deep . From where , then , do you have living water ?
43004012	Surely , you are not greater than our father Jacob , who gave us the well and who drank from it , with his sons and his cattle ? ”
43004013	Jesus responded and said to her : “ All who drink from this water will thirst again . But whoever shall drink from the water that I will give to him will not thirst for eternity .
43004014	Instead , the water that I will give to him will become in him a fountain of water , springing up into eternal life . ”
43004015	The woman said to him , “ Lord , give me this water , so that I may not thirst and may not come here to draw water . ”
43004016	Jesus said to her , “ Go , call your husband , and return here . ”
43004017	The woman responded and said , “ I have no husband . ” Jesus said to her : “ You have spoken well , in saying , ‘ I have no husband . ’
43004018	For you have had five husbands , but he whom you have now is not your husband . You have spoken this in truth . ”
43004019	The woman said to him : “ Lord , I see that you are a Prophet .
43004020	Our fathers worshipped on this mountain , but you say that Jerusalem is the place where one ought to worship . ”
43004021	Jesus said to her : “ Woman , believe me , the hour is coming when you shall worship the Father , neither on this mountain , nor in Jerusalem .
43004022	You worship what you do not know ; we worship what we do know . For salvation is from the Jews .
43004023	But the hour is coming , and it is now , when true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth . For the Father also seeks such persons who may worship him .
43004024	God is Spirit . And so , those who worship him must worship in spirit and in truth . ”
43004025	The woman said to him : “ I know that the Messiah is coming ( who is called the Christ ) . And then , when he will have arrived , he will announce everything to us . ”
43004026	Jesus said to her : “ I am he , the one who is speaking with you . ”
43004027	And then his disciples arrived . And they wondered that he was speaking with the woman . Yet no one said : “ What are you seeking ? ” or , “ Why are you talking with her ? ”
43004028	And so the woman left behind her water jar and went into the city . And she said to the men there :
43004029	“ Come and see a man who has told me all the things that I have done . Is he not the Christ ? ”
43004030	Therefore , they went out of the city and came to him .
43004031	Meanwhile , the disciples petitioned him , saying , “ Rabbi , eat . ”
43004032	But he said to them , “ I have food to eat which you do not know . ”
43004033	Therefore , the disciples said to one another , “ Could someone have brought him something to eat ? ”
43004034	Jesus said to them : “ My food is to do the will of the One who sent me , so that I may perfect his work .
43004035	Do you not say , ‘ There are still four months , and then the harvest arrives ? ’ Behold , I say to you : Lift up your eyes and look at the countryside ; for it is already ripe for the harvest .
43004036	For he who reaps , receives wages and gathers fruit unto eternal life , so that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together .
43004037	For in this the word is true : that it is one who sows , and it is another who reaps .
43004038	I have sent you to reap that for which you did not labor . Others have labored , and you have entered into their labors . ”
43004039	Now many of the Samaritans from that city believed in him , because of the word of the woman who was offering testimony : “ For he told me all the things that I have done . ”
43004040	Therefore , when the Samaritans had come to him , they petitioned him to lodge there . And he lodged there for two days .
43004041	And many more believed in him , because of his own word .
43004042	And they said to the woman : “ Now we believe , not because of your speech , but because we ourselves have heard him , and so we know that he is truly the Savior of the world . ”
43004043	Then , after two days , he departed from there , and he traveled into Galilee .
43004044	For Jesus himself offered testimony that a Prophet has no honor in his own country .
43004045	And so , when he had arrived in Galilee , the Galileans received him , because they had seen all that he had done at Jerusalem , in the day of the feast . For they also went to the feast day .
43004046	Then he went again into Cana of Galilee , where he made water into wine . And there was a certain ruler , whose son was sick at Capernaum .
43004047	Since he had heard that Jesus came to Galilee from Judea , he sent to him and begged him to come down and heal his son . For he was beginning to die .
43004048	Therefore , Jesus said to him , “ Unless you have seen signs and wonders , you do not believe . ”
43004049	The ruler said to him , “ Lord , come down before my son dies . ”
43004050	Jesus said to him , “ Go , your son lives . ” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him , and so he went away .
43004051	Then , as he was going down , his servants met him . And they reported to him , saying that his son was alive .
43004052	Therefore , he asked them at which hour he had become better . And they said to him , “ Yesterday , at the seventh hour , the fever left him . ”
43004053	Then the father realized that it was at the same hour that Jesus said to him , “ Your son lives . ” And both he and his entire household believed .
43004054	This next sign was the second that Jesus accomplished , after he had arrived in Galilee from Judea .
43005001	After these things , there was a feast day of the Jews , and so Jesus ascended to Jerusalem .
43005002	Now at Jerusalem is the Pool of Evidence , which in Hebrew is known as the Place of Mercy ; it has five porticos .
43005003	Along these lay a great multitude of the sick , the blind , the lame , and the withered , waiting for the movement of the water .
43005004	Now at times an Angel of the Lord would descend into the pool , and so the water was moved . And whoever descended first into the pool , after the motion of the water , he was healed of whatever infirmity held him .
43005005	And there was a certain man in that place , having been in his infirmity for thirty-eight years .
43005006	Then , when Jesus had seen him reclining , and when he realized that he had been afflicted for a long time , he said to him , “ Do you want to be healed ? ”
43005007	The invalid answered him : “ Lord , I do not have any man to put me in the pool , when the water has been stirred . For as I am going , another descends ahead of me . ”
43005008	Jesus said to him , “ Rise , take up your stretcher , and walk . ”
43005009	And immediately the man was healed . And he took up his stretcher and walked . Now this day was the Sabbath .
43005010	Therefore , the Jews said to the one who had been healed : “ It is the Sabbath . It is not lawful for you to take up your stretcher . ”
43005011	He answered them , “ The one who healed me , he said to me , ‘ Take up your stretcher and walk . ’ ”
43005012	Therefore , they questioned him , “ Who is that man , who said to you , ‘ Take up your bed and walk ? ’ ”
43005013	But the one who had been given health did not know who it was . For Jesus had turned aside from the crowd gathered in that place .
43005014	Afterwards , Jesus found him in the temple , and he said to him : “ Behold , you have been healed . Do not choose to sin further , otherwise something worse may happen to you . ”
43005015	This man went away , and he reported to the Jews that it was Jesus who had given him health .
43005016	Because of this , the Jews were persecuting Jesus , for he was doing these things on the Sabbath .
43005017	But Jesus answered them , “ Even now , my Father is working , and I am working . ”
43005018	And so , because of this , the Jews were seeking to kill him even more so . For not only did he break the Sabbath , but he even said that God was his Father , making himself equal to God .
43005019	Then Jesus responded and said to them : “ Amen , amen , I say to you , the Son is not able to do anything of himself , but only what he has seen the Father doing . For whatever he does , even this does the Son do , similarly .
43005020	For the Father loves the Son , and he shows him all that he himself does . And greater works than these will he show him , so much so that you shall wonder .
43005021	For just as the Father raises the dead and gives life , so also does the Son give life to whomever he wills .
43005022	For the Father does not judge anyone . But he has given all judgment to the Son ,
43005023	so that all may honor the Son , just as they honor the Father . Whoever does not honor the Son , does not honor the Father who sent him .
43005024	Amen , amen , I say to you , that whoever hears my word , and believes in him who sent me , has eternal life , and he does not go into judgment , but instead he crosses from death into life .
43005025	Amen , amen , I say to you , that the hour is coming , and it is now , when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God ; and those who hear it shall live .
43005026	For just as the Father has life in himself , so also has he granted to the Son to have life in himself .
43005027	And he has given him the authority to accomplish judgment . For he is the Son of man .
43005028	Do not be amazed at this . For the hour is coming in which all who are in the grave shall hear the voice of the Son of God .
43005029	And those who have done good shall go forth to the resurrection of life . Yet truly , those who have done evil shall go to the resurrection of judgment .
43005030	I am not able to do anything of myself . As I hear , so do I judge . And my judgment is just . For I do not seek my own will , but the will of him who sent me .
43005031	If I offer testimony about myself , my testimony is not true .
43005032	There is another who offers testimony about me , and I know that the testimony which he offers about me is true .
43005033	You sent to John , and he offered testimony to the truth .
43005034	But I do not accept testimony from man . Instead , I say these things , so that you may be saved .
43005035	He was a burning and shining light . So you were willing , at the time , to exult in his light .
43005036	But I hold a greater testimony than that of John . For the works which the Father has given to me , so that I may complete them , these works themselves that I do , offer testimony about me : that the Father has sent me .
43005037	And the Father who has sent me has himself offered testimony about me . And you have never heard his voice , nor have you beheld his appearance .
43005038	And you do not have his word abiding in you . For the one whom he sent , the same you would not believe .
43005039	Study the Scriptures . For you think that in them you have eternal life . And yet they also offer testimony about me .
43005040	And you are not willing to come to me , so that you may have life .
43005041	I do not accept glory from men .
43005042	But I know you , that you do not have the love of God within you .
43005043	I have come in the name of my Father , and you do not accept me . If another will arrive in his own name , him you will accept .
43005044	How are you able to believe , you who accept glory from one another and yet do not seek the glory that is from God alone ?
43005045	Do not consider that I might accuse you with the Father . There is one who accuses you , Moses , in whom you hope .
43005046	For if you were believing in Moses , perhaps you would believe in me also . For he wrote about me .
43005047	But if you do not believe by his writings , how will you believe by my words ? ”
43006001	After these things , Jesus traveled across the sea of Galilee , which is the Sea of Tiberias .
43006002	And a great multitude was following him , for they saw the signs that he was accomplishing toward those who were infirm .
43006003	Therefore , Jesus went onto a mountain , and he sat down there with his disciples .
43006004	Now the Passover , the feast day of the Jews , was near .
43006005	And so , when Jesus had lifted up his eyes and had seen that a very great multitude came to him , he said to Philip , “ From where should we buy bread , so that these may eat ? ”
43006006	But he said this to test him . For he himself knew what he would do .
43006007	Philip answered him , “ Two hundred denarii of bread would not be sufficient for each of them to receive even a little . ”
43006008	One of his disciples , Andrew , the brother of Simon Peter , said to him :
43006009	“ There is a certain boy here , who has five barley loaves and two fish . But what are these among so many ? ”
43006010	Then Jesus said , “ Have the men sit down to eat . ” Now , there was much grass in that place . And so the men , in number about five thousand , sat down to eat .
43006011	Therefore , Jesus took the bread , and when he had given thanks , he distributed it to those who were sitting down to eat ; similarly also , from the fish , as much as they wanted .
43006012	Then , when they were filled , he said to his disciples , “ Gather the fragments that are left over , lest they be lost . ”
43006013	And so they gathered , and they filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves , which were left over from those who had eaten .
43006014	Therefore , those men , when they had seen that Jesus had accomplished a sign , they said , “ Truly , this one is the Prophet who is to come into the world . ”
43006015	And so , when he realized that they were going to come and take him away and make him king , Jesus fled back to the mountain , by himself alone .
43006016	Then , when evening arrived , his disciples descended to the sea .
43006017	And when they had climbed into a boat , they went across the sea to Capernaum . And darkness had now arrived , and Jesus had not returned to them .
43006018	Then the sea was stirred up by a great wind that was blowing .
43006019	And so , when they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia , they saw Jesus walking on the sea , and drawing near to the boat , and they were afraid .
43006020	But he said to them : “ It is I . Do not be afraid . ”
43006021	Therefore , they were willing to receive him into the boat . But immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going .
43006022	On the next day , the crowd which was standing across the sea saw that there were no other small boats in that place , except one , and that Jesus had not entered into the boat with his disciples , but that his disciples had departed alone .
43006023	Yet truly , other boats came over from Tiberias , next to the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord gave thanks .
43006024	Therefore , when the crowd had seen that Jesus was not there , nor his disciples , they climbed into the small boats , and they went to Capernaum , seeking Jesus .
43006025	And when they had found him across the sea , they said to him , “ Rabbi , when did you come here ? ”
43006026	Jesus answered them and said : “ Amen , amen , I say to you , you seek me , not because you have seen signs , but because you have eaten from the bread and were satisfied .
43006027	Do not work for food that perishes , but for that which endures to eternal life , which the Son of man will give to you . For God the Father has sealed him . ”
43006028	Therefore , they said to him , “ What should we do , so that we may labor in the works of God ? ”
43006029	Jesus responded and said to them , “ This is the work of God , that you believe in him whom he sent . ”
43006030	And so they said to him : “ Then what sign will you do , so that we may see it and believe in you ? What will you work ?
43006031	Our fathers ate manna in the desert , just as it has been written , ‘ He gave them bread from heaven to eat . ’ ”
43006032	Therefore , Jesus said to them : “ Amen , amen , I say to you , Moses did not give you bread from heaven , but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven .
43006033	For the bread of God is he who descends from heaven and gives life to the world . ”
43006034	And so they said to him , “ Lord , give us this bread always . ”
43006035	Then Jesus said to them : “ I am the bread of life . Whoever comes to me shall not hunger , and whoever believes in me shall never thirst .
43006036	But I say to you , that even though you have seen me , you do not believe .
43006037	All that the Father gives to me shall come to me . And whoever comes to me , I will not cast out .
43006038	For I descended from heaven , not to do my own will , but the will of him who sent me .
43006039	Yet this is the will of the Father who sent me : that I should lose nothing out of all that he has given to me , but that I should raise them up on the last day .
43006040	So then , this is the will of my Father who sent me : that everyone who sees the Son and believes in him may have eternal life , and I will raise him up on the last day . ”
43006041	Therefore , the Jews murmured about him , because he had said : “ I am the living bread , who descended from heaven . ”
43006042	And they said : “ Is this not Jesus , the son of Joseph , whose father and mother we know ? Then how can he say : ‘ For I descended from heaven ? ’ ”
43006043	And so Jesus responded and said to them : “ Do not choose to murmur among yourselves .
43006044	No one is able to come to me , unless the Father , who has sent me , has drawn him . And I will raise him up on the last day .
43006045	It has been written in the Prophets : ‘ And they shall all be taught by God . ’ Everyone who has listened and learned from the Father comes to me .
43006046	Not that anyone has seen the Father , except he who is from God ; this one has seen the Father .
43006047	Amen , amen , I say to you , whoever believes in me has eternal life .
43006048	I am the bread of life .
43006049	Your fathers ate manna in the desert , and they died .
43006050	This is the bread which descends from heaven , so that if anyone will eat from it , he may not die .
43006051	I am the living bread , who descended from heaven . If anyone eats from this bread , he shall live in eternity . And the bread that I will give is my flesh , for the life of the world . ”
43006052	Therefore , the Jews debated among themselves , saying , “ How can this man give us his flesh to eat ? ”
43006053	And so , Jesus said to them : “ Amen , amen , I say to you , unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood , you will not have life in you .
43006054	Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life , and I will raise him up on the last day .
43006055	For my flesh is true food , and my blood is true drink .
43006056	Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me , and I in him .
43006057	Just as the living Father has sent me and I live because of the Father , so also whoever eats me , the same shall live because of me .
43006058	This is the bread that descends from heaven . It is not like the manna that your fathers ate , for they died . Whoever eats this bread shall live forever . ”
43006059	He said these things when he was teaching in the synagogue at Capernaum .
43006060	Therefore , many of his disciples , upon hearing this , said : “ This saying is difficult , ” and , “ Who is able to listen to it ? ”
43006061	But Jesus , knowing within himself that his disciples were murmuring about this , said to them : “ Does this offend you ?
43006062	Then what if you were to see the Son of man ascending to where he was before ?
43006063	It is the Spirit who gives life . The flesh does not offer anything of benefit . The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life .
43006064	the beginning who were unbelieving and which one would betray him .
43006065	And so he said , “ For this reason , I said to you that no one is able to come to me , unless it has been given to him by my Father . ”
43006066	After this , many of his disciples went back , and they no longer walked with him .
43006067	Therefore , Jesus said to the twelve , “ Do you also want to go away ? ”
43006068	Then Simon Peter answered him : “ Lord , to whom would we go ? You have the words of eternal life .
43006069	And we have believed , and we recognize that you are the Christ , the Son of God . ”
43006070	Jesus answered them : “ Have I not chosen you twelve ? And yet one among you is a devil . ”
43006071	Now he was speaking about Judas Iscariot , the son of Simon . For this one , even though he was one of the twelve , was about to betray him .
43007001	Then , after these things , Jesus was walking in Galilee . For he was not willing to walk in Judea , because the Jews were seeking to kill him .
43007002	Now the feast day of the Jews , the Feast of Tabernacles , was near .
43007003	And his brothers said to him : “ Move away from here and go into Judea , so that your disciples there may also see your works that you do .
43007004	Of course , no one does anything in secret , but he himself seeks to be in the public view . Since you do these things , manifest yourself to the world . ”
43007005	For neither did his brothers believe in him .
43007006	Therefore , Jesus said to them : “ My time has not yet come ; but your time is always at hand .
43007007	The world cannot hate you . But it hates me , because I offer testimony about it , that its works are evil .
43007008	You may go up to this feast day . But I am not going up to this feast day , because my time has not yet been fulfilled . ”
43007009	When he had said these things , he himself remained in Galilee .
43007010	But after his brothers went up , then he also went up to the feast day , not openly , but as if in secret .
43007011	Therefore , the Jews were seeking him on the feast day , and they were saying , “ Where is he ? ”
43007012	And there was much murmuring in the crowd concerning him . For certain ones were saying , “ He is good . ” But others were saying , “ No , for he seduces the crowds . ”
43007013	Yet no one was speaking openly about him , out of fear of the Jews .
43007014	Then , about the middle of the feast , Jesus ascended into the temple , and he was teaching .
43007015	And the Jews wondered , saying : “ How does this one know letters , though he has not been taught ? ”
43007016	Jesus responded to them and said : “ My doctrine is not of me , but of him who sent me .
43007017	If anyone has chosen to do his will , then he will realize , about the doctrine , whether it is from God , or whether I am speaking from myself .
43007018	Whoever speaks from himself seeks his own glory . But whoever seeks the glory of him who sent him , this one is true , and injustice is not in him .
43007019	Did not Moses give you the law ? And yet not one among you keeps the law !
43007020	Why are you seeking to kill me ? ” The crowd responded and said : “ You must have a demon . Who is seeking to kill you ? ”
43007021	Jesus responded and said to them : “ One work have I done , and you all wonder .
43007022	For Moses gave you circumcision , ( not that it is of Moses , but of the fathers ) and on the Sabbath you circumcise a man .
43007023	If a man can receive circumcision on the Sabbath , so that the law of Moses may not be broken , why are you indignant toward me , because I have made a man whole on the Sabbath ?
43007024	Do not judge according to appearances , but instead judge a just judgment . ”
43007025	Therefore , some of those from Jerusalem said : “ Is he not the one whom they are seeking to kill ?
43007026	And behold , he is speaking openly , and they say nothing to him . Could the leaders have decided that it is true this one is the Christ ?
43007027	But we know him and where he is from . And when the Christ has arrived , no one will know where he is from . ”
43007028	Therefore , Jesus cried out in the temple , teaching and saying : “ You know me , and you also know where I am from . And I have not arrived of myself , but he who sent me is true , and him you do not know .
43007029	I know him . For I am from him , and he has sent me . ”
43007030	Therefore , they were seeking to apprehend him , and yet no one laid hands on him , because his hour had not yet come .
43007031	But many among the crowd believed in him , and they were saying , “ When the Christ arrives , will he perform more signs than this man does ? ”
43007032	The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about him . And the leaders and the Pharisees sent attendants to apprehend him .
43007033	Therefore , Jesus said to them : “ For a brief time , I am still with you , and then I am going to him who sent me .
43007034	You shall seek me , and you will not find me . And where I am , you are not able to go . ”
43007035	And so the Jews said among themselves : “ Where is this place to which he will go , such that we will not find him ? Will he go to those dispersed among the Gentiles and teach the Gentiles ?
43007036	What is this word that he spoke , ‘ You will seek me and you will not find me ; and where I am , you are not able to go ? ’ ”
43007037	Then , on the last great day of the feast , Jesus was standing and crying out , saying : “ If anyone thirsts , let him come to me and drink :
43007038	whoever believes in me , just as Scripture says , ‘ From his chest shall flow rivers of living water . ’ ”
43007039	Now he said this about the Spirit , which those who believe in him would soon be receiving . For the Spirit had not yet been given , because Jesus had not yet been glorified .
43007040	Therefore , some from that crowd , when they had heard these words of his , were saying , “ This one truly is the Prophet . ”
43007041	Others were saying , “ He is the Christ . ” Yet certain ones were saying : “ Does the Christ come from Galilee ?
43007042	Does Scripture not say that the Christ comes from the offspring of David and from Bethlehem , the town where David was ? ”
43007043	And so there arose a dissension among the multitude because of him .
43007044	Now certain ones among them wanted to apprehended him , but no one laid hands upon him .
43007045	Therefore , the attendants went to the high priests and the Pharisees . And they said to them , “ Why have you not brought him ? ”
43007046	The attendants responded , “ Never has a man spoken like this man . ”
43007047	And so the Pharisees answered them : “ Have you also been seduced ?
43007048	Have any of the leaders believed in him , or any of the Pharisees ?
43007049	But this crowd , which does not know the law , they are accursed . ”
43007050	Nicodemus , the one who came to him by night and who was one of them , said to them ,
43007051	“ Does our law judge a man , unless it has first heard him and has known what he has done ? ”
43007052	They responded and said to him : “ Are you also a Galilean ? Study the Scriptures , and see that a prophet does not arise from Galilee . ”
43007053	And each one returned to his own house .
43008001	But Jesus continued on to the Mount of Olives .
43008002	And early in the morning , he went again to the temple ; and all the people came to him . And sitting down , he taught them .
43008003	Now the scribes and Pharisees brought forward a woman caught in adultery , and they stood her in front of them .
43008004	And they said to him : “ Teacher , this woman was just now caught in adultery .
43008005	And in the law , Moses commanded us to stone such a one . Therefore , what do you say ? ”
43008006	But they were saying this to test him , so that they might be able to accuse him . Then Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the earth .
43008007	And then , when they persevered in questioning him , he stood upright and said to them , “ Let whoever is without sin among you be the first to cast a stone at her . ”
43008008	And bending down again , he wrote on the earth .
43008009	But upon hearing this , they went away , one by one , beginning with the eldest . And Jesus alone remained , with the woman standing in front of him .
43008010	Then Jesus , raising himself up , said to her : “ Woman , where are those who accused you ? Has no one condemned you ? ”
43008011	And she said , “ No one , Lord . ” Then Jesus said : “ Neither will I condemn you . Go , and now do not choose to sin anymore . ”
43008012	Then Jesus spoke to them again , saying : “ I am the light of the world . Whoever follows me does not walk in darkness , but shall have the light of life . ”
43008013	And so the Pharisees said to him , “ You offer testimony about yourself ; your testimony is not true . ”
43008014	Jesus responded and said to them : “ Even though I offer testimony about myself , my testimony is true , for I know where I came from and where I am going .
43008015	You judge according to the flesh . I do not judge anyone .
43008016	And when I do judge , my judgment is true . For I am not alone , but it is I and he who sent me : the Father .
43008017	And it is written in your law that the testimony of two men is true .
43008018	I am one who offers testimony about myself , and the Father who sent me offers testimony about me . ”
43008019	Therefore , they said to him , “ Where is your Father ? ” Jesus answered : “ You know neither me , nor my Father . If you did know me , perhaps you would know my Father also . ”
43008020	Jesus spoke these words at the treasury , while teaching in the temple . And no one apprehended him , because his hour had not yet come .
43008021	Therefore , Jesus again spoke to them : “ I am going , and you shall seek me . And you will die in your sin . Where I am going , you are not able to go . ”
43008022	And so the Jews said , “ Is he going to kill himself , for he said : ‘ Where I am going , you are not able to go ? ’ ”
43008023	And he said to them : “ You are from below . I am from above . You are of this world . I am not of this world .
43008024	Therefore , I said to you , that you will die in your sins . For if you will not believe that I am , you will die in your sin . ”
43008025	And so they said to him , “ Who are you ? ” Jesus said to them : “ The Beginning , who is also speaking to you .
43008026	I have much to say about you and to judge . But he who sent me is true . And what I have heard from him , this I speak within the world . ”
43008027	And they did not realize that he was calling God his Father .
43008028	And so Jesus said to them : “ When you will have lifted up the Son of man , then you shall realize that I am , and that I do nothing of myself , but just as the Father has taught me , so do I speak .
43008029	And he who sent me is with me , and he has not abandoned me alone . For I always do what is pleasing to him . ”
43008030	As he was speaking these things , many believed in him .
43008031	Therefore , Jesus said to those Jews who believed in him : “ If you will abide in my word , you will truly be my disciples .
43008032	And you shall know the truth , and the truth shall set you free . ”
43008033	They answered him : “ We are the offspring of Abraham , and we have never been a slave to anyone . How can you say , ‘ You shall be set free ? ’ ”
43008034	Jesus answered them : “ Amen , amen , I say to you , that everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin .
43008035	Now the slave does not abide in the house for eternity . Yet the Son does abide in eternity .
43008036	Therefore , if the Son has set you free , then you will truly be free .
43008037	I know that you are sons of Abraham . But you are seeking to kill me , because my word has not taken hold in you .
43008038	I speak what I have seen with my Father . And you do what you have seen with your father . ”
43008039	They responded and said to him , “ Abraham is our father . ” Jesus said to them : “ If you are the sons of Abraham , then do the works of Abraham .
43008040	But now you are seeking to kill me , a man who has spoken the truth to you , which I have heard from God . This is not what Abraham did .
43008041	You do the works of your father . ” Therefore , they said to him : “ We were not born out of fornication . We have one father : God . ”
43008042	Then Jesus said to them : “ If God were your father , certainly you would love me . For I proceeded and came from God . For I did not come from myself , but he sent me .
43008043	Why do you not recognize my speech ? It is because you are not able to hear my word .
43008044	You are of your father , the devil . And you will carry out the desires of your father . He was a murderer from the beginning . And he did not stand in the truth , because the truth is not in him . When he speaks a lie , he speaks it from his own self . For he is a liar , and the father of lies .
43008045	But if I speak the truth , you do not believe me .
43008046	Which of you can convict me of sin ? If I speak the truth to you , why do you not believe me ?
43008047	Whoever is of God , hears the words of God . For this reason , you do not hear them : because you are not of God . ”
43008048	Therefore , the Jews responded and said to him , “ Are we not correct in saying that you are a Samaritan , and that you have a demon ? ”
43008049	Jesus responded : “ I do not have a demon . But I honor my Father , and you have dishonored me .
43008050	But I am not seeking my own glory . There is One who seeks and judges .
43008051	Amen , amen , I say to you , if anyone will have kept my word , he will not see death for eternity . ”
43008052	Therefore , the Jews said : “ Now we know that you have a demon . Abraham is dead , and the Prophets ; and yet you say , ‘ If anyone will have kept my word , he shall not taste death for eternity . ’
43008053	Are you greater than our father Abraham , who is dead ? And the prophets are dead . So who do you make yourself to be ? ”
43008054	Jesus responded : “ If I glorify myself , my glory is nothing . It is my Father who glorifies me . And you say about him that he is your God .
43008055	And yet you have not known him . But I know him . And if I were to say that I do not know him , then I would be like you , a liar . But I know him , and I keep his word .
43008056	Abraham , your father , rejoiced that he might see my day ; he saw it and was glad . ”
43008057	And so the Jews said to him , “ You have not yet reached fifty years , and you have seen Abraham ? ”
43008058	Jesus said to them , “ Amen , amen , I say to you , before Abraham was made , I am . ”
43008059	Therefore , they took up stones to cast at him . But Jesus hid himself , and he departed from the temple .
43009001	And Jesus , while passing by , saw a man blind from birth .
43009002	And his disciples asked him , “ Rabbi , who sinned , this man or his parents , that he would be born blind ? ”
43009003	Jesus responded : “ Neither this man nor his parents sinned , but it was so that the works of God would be made manifest in him .
43009004	I must work the works of him who sent me , while it is day : the night is coming , when no one is able to work .
43009005	As long as I am in the world , I am the light of the world . ”
43009006	When he had said these things , he spat on the ground , and he made clay from the spittle , and he smeared the clay over his eyes .
43009007	And he said to him : “ Go , wash in the pool of Siloam ” ( which is translated as : one who has been sent ) . Therefore , he went away and washed , and he returned , seeing .
43009008	And so the bystanders and those who had seen him before , when he was a beggar , said , “ Is this not the one who was sitting and begging ? ” Some said , “ This is he . ”
43009009	But others said , “ Certainly not , but he is similar to him . ” Yet truly , he himself said , “ I am he . ”
43009010	Therefore , they said to him , “ How were your eyes opened ? ”
43009011	He responded : “ That man who is called Jesus made clay , and he anointed my eyes and said to me , ‘ Go to the pool of Siloam and wash . ’ And I went , and I washed , and I see . ”
43009012	And they said to him , “ Where is he ? ” He said , “ I do not know . ”
43009013	They brought the one who had been blind to the Pharisees .
43009014	Now it was the Sabbath , when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes .
43009015	Therefore , again the Pharisees questioned him as to how he had seen . And he said to them , “ He placed clay over my eyes , and I washed , and I see . ”
43009016	And so certain Pharisees said : “ This man , who does not keep the Sabbath , is not from God . ” But others said , “ How could a sinful man accomplish these signs ? ” And there was a schism among them .
43009017	Therefore , they spoke again to the blind man , “ What do you say about him who opened your eyes ? ” Then he said , “ He is a Prophet . ”
43009018	Therefore , the Jews did not believe , about him , that he had been blind and had seen , until they called the parents of him who had seen .
43009019	And they questioned them , saying : “ Is this your son , whom you say was born blind ? Then how is it that he now sees ? ”
43009020	His parents responded to them and said : “ We know that this is our son and that he was born blind .
43009021	But how it is that he now sees , we do not know . And who opened his eyes , we do not know . Ask him . He is old enough . Let him speak for himself . ”
43009022	His parents said these things because they were afraid of the Jews . For the Jews had already conspired , so that if anyone were to confess him to be the Christ , he would be expelled from the synagogue .
43009023	It was for this reason that his parents said : “ He is old enough . Ask him . ”
43009024	Therefore , they again called the man who had been blind , and they said to him : “ Give glory to God . We know that this man is a sinner . ”
43009025	And so he said to them : “ If he is a sinner , I do not know it . One thing I do know , that although I was blind , now I see . ”
43009026	Then they said to him : “ What did he do to you ? How did he open your eyes ? ”
43009027	He answered them : “ I have already told you , and you heard it . Why do you want to hear it again ? Do you also want to become his disciples ? ”
43009028	Therefore , they cursed him and said : “ You be his disciple . But we are disciples of Moses .
43009029	We know that God spoke to Moses . But this man , we do not know where he is from . ”
43009030	The man responded and said to them : “ Now in this is a wonder : that you do not know where he is from , and yet he has opened my eyes .
43009031	And we know that God does not hear sinners . But if anyone is a worshipper of God and does his will , then he heeds him .
43009032	From ancient times , it has not been heard that anyone has opened the eyes of someone born blind .
43009033	Unless this man were of God , he would not be able to do any such thing . ”
43009034	They responded and said to him , “ You were born entirely in sins , and you would teach us ? ” And they cast him out .
43009035	Jesus heard that they had cast him out . And when he had found him , he said to him , “ Do you believe in the Son of God ? ”
43009036	He responded and said , “ Who is he , Lord , so that I may believe in him ? ”
43009037	And Jesus said to him , “ You have both seen him , and he is the one who is speaking with you . ”
43009038	And he said , “ I believe , Lord . ” And falling prostrate , he worshipped him .
43009039	And Jesus said , “ I came into this world in judgment , so that those who do not see , may see ; and so that those who see , may become blind . ”
43009040	And certain Pharisees , who were with him , heard this , and they said to him , “ Are we also blind ? ”
43009041	Jesus said to them : “ If you were blind , you would not have sin . Yet now you say , ‘ We see . ’ So your sin persists . ”
43010001	“ Amen , amen , I say to you , he who does not enter through the door into the fold of the sheep , but climbs up by another way , he is a thief and a robber .
43010002	But he who enters through the door is the shepherd of the sheep .
43010003	To him the doorkeeper opens , and the sheep hear his voice , and he calls his own sheep by name , and he leads them out .
43010004	And when he has sent out his sheep , he goes before them , and the sheep follow him , because they know his voice .
43010005	But they do not follow a stranger ; instead they flee from him , because they do not know the voice of strangers . ”
43010006	Jesus spoke this proverb to them . But they did not understand what he was saying to them .
43010007	Therefore , Jesus spoke to them again : “ Amen , amen , I say to you , that I am the door of the sheep .
43010008	All others , as many as have come , are thieves and robbers , and the sheep did not listen to them .
43010009	I am the door . If anyone has entered through me , he will be saved . And he shall go in and go out , and he shall find pastures .
43010010	The thief does not come , except so that he may steal and slaughter and destroy . I have come so that they may have life , and have it more abundantly .
43010011	I am the good Shepherd . The good Shepherd gives his life for his sheep .
43010012	But the hired hand , and whoever is not a shepherd , to whom the sheep do not belong , he sees the wolf approaching , and he departs from the sheep and flees . And the wolf ravages and scatters the sheep .
43010013	And the hired hand flees , because he is a hired hand and there is no concern for the sheep within him .
43010014	I am the good Shepherd , and I know my own , and my own know me ,
43010015	just as the Father knows me , and I know the Father . And I lay down my life for my sheep .
43010016	And I have other sheep that are not of this fold , and I must lead them . They shall hear my voice , and there shall be one sheepfold and one shepherd .
43010017	For this reason , the Father loves me : because I lay down my life , so that I may take it up again .
43010018	No one takes it away from me . Instead , I lay it down of my own accord . And I have the power to lay it down . And I have the power to take it up again . This is the commandment that I have received from my Father . ”
43010019	A dissension occurred again among the Jews because of these words .
43010020	Then many of them were saying : “ He has a demon or he is insane . Why do you listen him ? ”
43010021	Others were saying : “ These are not the words of someone who has a demon . How would a demon be able to open the eyes of the blind ? ”
43010022	Now it was the Feast of the Dedication at Jerusalem , and it was winter .
43010023	And Jesus was walking in the temple , in the portico of Solomon .
43010024	And so the Jews surrounded him and said to him : “ How long will you hold our souls in suspense ? If you are the Christ , tell us plainly . ”
43010025	Jesus answered them : “ I speak to you , and you do not believe . The works that I do in the name of my Father , these offer testimony about me .
43010026	But you do not believe , because you are not of my sheep .
43010027	My sheep hear my voice . And I know them , and they follow me .
43010028	And I give them eternal life , and they shall not perish , for eternity . And no one shall seize them from my hand .
43010029	What my Father gave to me is greater than all , and no one is able to seize from the hand of my Father .
43010030	I and the Father are one . ”
43010031	Therefore , the Jews took up stones , in order to stone him .
43010032	Jesus answered them : “ I have shown you many good works from my Father . For which of those works do you stone me ? ”
43010033	The Jews answered him : “ We do not stone you for a good work , but for blasphemy and because , though you are a man , you make yourself God . ”
43010034	Jesus responded to them : “ Is it not written in your law , ‘ I said : you are gods ? ’
43010035	If he called those to whom the word of God was given gods , and Scripture cannot be broken ,
43010036	why do you say , about him whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world , ‘ You have blasphemed , ’ because I said , ‘ I am the Son of God ? ’
43010037	If I do not do the works of my Father , do not believe in me .
43010038	But if I do them , even if you are not willing to believe in me , believe the works , so that you may know and believe that the Father is in me , and I am in the Father . ”
43010039	Therefore , they sought to apprehend him , but he escaped from their hands .
43010040	And he went again across the Jordan , to that place where John first was baptizing . And he lodged there .
43010041	And many went out to him . And they were saying : “ Indeed , John accomplished no signs .
43010042	But all things whatsoever that John said about this man were true . ” And many believed in him .
43011001	Now there was a certain sick man , Lazarus of Bethania , from the town of Mary and her sister Martha .
43011002	And Mary was the one who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair ; her brother Lazarus was sick .
43011003	Therefore , his sisters sent to him , saying : “ Lord , behold , he whom you love is sick . ”
43011004	Then , upon hearing this , Jesus said to them : “ This sickness is not unto death , but for the glory of God , so that the Son of God may be glorified by it . ”
43011005	Now Jesus loved Martha , and her sister Mary , and Lazarus .
43011006	Even so , after he heard that he was sick , he then still remained in the same place for two days .
43011007	Then , after these things , he said to his disciples , “ Let us go into Judea again . ”
43011008	The disciples said to him : “ Rabbi , the Jews are even now seeking to stone you . And would you go there again ? ”
43011009	Jesus responded : “ Are there not twelve hours in the day ? If anyone walks in the daylight , he does not stumble , because he sees the light of this world .
43011010	But if he walks in the nighttime , he stumbles , because the light is not in him . ”
43011011	He said these things , and after this , he said to them : “ Lazarus our friend is sleeping . But I am going , so that I may awaken him from sleep . ”
43011012	And so his disciples said , “ Lord , if he is sleeping , he shall be healthy . ”
43011013	But Jesus had spoken about his death . Yet they thought that he spoke about the repose of sleep .
43011014	Therefore , Jesus then said to them plainly , “ Lazarus has died .
43011015	And I am glad for your sake that I was not there , so that you may believe . But let us go to him . ”
43011016	And then Thomas , who is called the Twin , said to his fellow disciples , “ Let us go , too , so that we may die with him . ”
43011017	And so Jesus went . And he found that he had already been in the tomb for four days .
43011018	( Now Bethania was near Jerusalem , about fifteen stadia . )
43011019	And many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary , so as to console them over their brother .
43011020	Therefore , Martha , when she heard that Jesus was arriving , went out to meet him . But Mary was sitting at home .
43011021	And then Martha said to Jesus : “ Lord , if you had been here , my brother would not have died .
43011022	But even now , I know that whatever you will request from God , God will give to you . ”
43011023	Jesus said to her , “ Your brother shall rise again . ”
43011024	Martha said to him , “ I know that he shall rise again , at the resurrection on the last day . ”
43011025	Jesus said to her : “ I am the Resurrection and the Life . Whoever believes in me , even though he has died , he shall live .
43011026	And everyone who lives and believes in me shall not die for eternity . Do you believe this ? ”
43011027	She said to him : “ Certainly , Lord . I have believed that you are the Christ , the Son of the living God , who has come into this world . ”
43011028	And when she had said these things , she went and called her sister Mary quietly , saying , “ The Teacher is here , and he is calling you . ”
43011029	When she heard this , she rose up quickly and went to him .
43011030	For Jesus had not yet arrived in the town . But he was still at that place where Martha had met him .
43011031	Therefore , the Jews who were with her in the house and who were consoling her , when they had seen that Mary rose up quickly and went out , they followed her , saying , “ She is going to the tomb , so that she may weep there . ”
43011032	Therefore , when Mary had arrived to where Jesus was , seeing him , she fell down at his feet , and she said to him . “ Lord , if you had been here , my brother would not have died . ”
43011033	And then , when Jesus saw her weeping , and the Jews who had arrived with her weeping , he groaned in spirit and became troubled .
43011034	And he said , “ Where have you laid him ? ” They said to him , “ Lord , come and see . ”
43011035	And Jesus wept .
43011036	Therefore , the Jews said , “ See how much he loved him ! ”
43011037	But some of them said , “ Would not he who opened the eyes of one born blind have been able to cause this man not to die ? ”
43011038	Therefore , Jesus , again groaning from within himself , went to the tomb . Now it was a cave , and a stone had been placed over it .
43011039	Jesus said , “ Take away the stone . ” Martha , the sister of him who had died , said to him , “ Lord , by now it will smell , for this is the fourth day . ”
43011040	Jesus said to her , “ Did I not say to you that if you believe , you shall see the glory of God ? ”
43011041	Therefore , they took away the stone . Then , lifting up his eyes , Jesus said : “ Father , I give thanks to you because you have heard me .
43011042	And I know that you always hear me , but I have said this for the sake of the people who are standing nearby , so that they may believe that you have sent me . ”
43011043	When he had said these things , he cried in a loud voice , “ Lazarus , come out . ”
43011044	And immediately , he who had been dead went forth , bound at the feet and hands with winding bands . And his face was bound with a separate cloth . Jesus said to them , “ Release him and let him go . ”
43011045	Therefore , many of the Jews , who had come to Mary and Martha , and who had seen the things that Jesus did , believed in him .
43011046	But certain ones among them went to the Pharisees and told them the things that Jesus had done .
43011047	And so , the high priests and the Pharisees gathered a council , and they were saying : “ What can we do ? For this man accomplishes many signs .
43011048	If we leave him alone , in this way all will believe in him . And then the Romans will come and take away our place and our nation . ”
43011049	Then one of them , named Caiaphas , since he was the high priest that year , said to them : “ You do not understand anything .
43011050	Nor do you realize that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people , and that the entire nation should not perish . ”
43011051	Yet he did not say this from himself , but since he was the high priest that year , he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation .
43011052	And not only for the nation , but in order to gather together as one the children of God who have been dispersed .
43011053	Therefore , from that day , they planned to put him to death .
43011054	And so , Jesus no longer walked in public with the Jews . But he went into a region near the desert , to a city which is called Ephraim . And he lodged there with his disciples .
43011055	Now the Passover of the Jews was near . And many from the countryside ascended to Jerusalem before the Passover , so that they might sanctify themselves .
43011056	Therefore , they were seeking Jesus . And they conferred with one another , while standing in the temple : “ What do you think ? Will he come to the feast day ? ”
43011057	And the high priests and Pharisees had given an order , so that if anyone would know where he may be , he should reveal it , so that they might apprehend him .
43012001	Then six days before the Passover , Jesus went to Bethania , where Lazarus had died , whom Jesus raised up .
43012002	And they made a dinner for him there . And Martha was ministering . And truly , Lazarus was one of those who were sitting at table with him .
43012003	And then Mary took twelve ounces of pure spikenard ointment , very precious , and she anointed the feet of Jesus , and she wiped his feet with her hair . And the house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment .
43012004	Then one of his disciples , Judas Iscariot , who was soon to betray him , said ,
43012005	“ Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the needy ? ”
43012006	Now he said this , not out of concern for the needy , but because he was a thief and , since he held the purse , he used to carry what was put into it .
43012007	But Jesus said : “ Permit her , so that she may keep it against the day of my burial .
43012008	For the poor , you have with you always . But me , you do always not have . ”
43012009	Now a great multitude of the Jews knew that he was in that place , and so they came , not so much because of Jesus , but so that they might see Lazarus , whom he had raised from the dead .
43012010	And the leaders of the priests planned to put Lazarus to death also .
43012011	For many of the Jews , because of him , were going away and were believing in Jesus .
43012012	Then , on the next day , the great crowd that had come to the feast day , when they had heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem ,
43012013	took branches of palm trees , and they went ahead to meet him . And they were crying out : “ Hosanna ! Blessed is he who arrives in the name of the Lord , the king of Israel ! ”
43012014	And Jesus found a small donkey , and he sat upon it , just as it is written :
43012015	“ Do not be afraid , daughter of Zion . Behold , your king arrives , sitting on the colt of a donkey . ”
43012016	At first , his disciples did not realize these things . But when Jesus was glorified , then they remembered that these things were written about him , and that these things happened to him .
43012017	And so the crowd that had been with him , when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead , offered testimony .
43012018	Because of this , too , the crowd went out to meet him . For they heard that he had accomplished this sign .
43012019	Therefore , the Pharisees said among themselves : “ Do you see that we are accomplishing nothing ? Behold , the entire world has gone after him . ”
43012020	Now there were certain Gentiles among those who went up so that they might worship on the feast day .
43012021	Therefore , these approached Philip , who was from Bethsaida of Galilee , and they petitioned him , saying : “ Sir , we want to see Jesus . ”
43012022	Philip went and told Andrew . Next , Andrew and Philip told Jesus .
43012023	But Jesus answered them by saying : “ The hour arrives when the Son of man shall be glorified .
43012024	Amen , amen , I say to you , unless the grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies ,
43012025	it remains alone . But if it dies , it yields much fruit . Whoever loves his life , will lose it . And whoever hates his life in this world , preserves it unto eternal life .
43012026	If anyone serves me , let him follow me . And where I am , there too my minister shall be . If anyone has served me , my Father will honor him .
43012027	Now my soul is troubled . And what should I say ? Father , save me from this hour ? But it is for this reason that I came to this hour .
43012028	Father , glorify your name ! ” And then a voice came from heaven , “ I have glorified it , and I will glorify it again . ”
43012029	Therefore , the crowd , which was standing near and had heard it , said that it was like thunder . Others were saying , “ An Angel was speaking with him . ”
43012030	Jesus responded and said : “ This voice came , not for my sake , but for your sakes .
43012031	Now is the judgment of the world . Now will the prince of this world be cast out .
43012032	And when I have been lifted up from the earth , I will draw all things to myself . ”
43012033	( Now he said this , signifying what kind of death he would die . )
43012034	The crowd answered him : “ We have heard , from the law , that the Christ remains forever . And so how can you say , ‘ The Son of man must be lifted up ? ’ Who is this Son of man ? ”
43012035	Therefore , Jesus said to them : “ For a brief time , the Light is among you . Walk while you have the Light , so that the darkness may not overtake you . But whoever walks in darkness does not know where is he going .
43012036	While you have the Light , believe in the Light , so that you may be sons of the Light . ” Jesus spoke these things , and then he went away and hid himself from them .
43012037	And although he had done such great signs in their presence , they did not believe in him ,
43012038	so that the word of the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled , which says : “ Lord , who has believed in our hearing ? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed ? ”
43012039	Because of this , they were not able to believe , for Isaiah said again :
43012040	“ He has blinded their eyes , and hardened their heart , so that they may not see with their eyes , and understand with their heart , and be converted : and then I would heal them . ”
43012041	These things Isaiah said , when he saw his glory and was speaking about him .
43012042	Yet truly , many of the leaders also believed in him . But because of the Pharisees , they did not confess him , so that they would not be cast out of the synagogue .
43012043	For they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God .
43012044	But Jesus cried out and said : “ Whoever believes in me , does not believe in me , but in him who sent me .
43012045	And whoever sees me , sees him who sent me .
43012046	I have arrived as a light to the world , so that all who believe in me might not remain in darkness .
43012047	And if anyone has heard my words and not kept them , I do not judge him . For I did not come so that I may judge the world , but so that I may save the world .
43012048	Whoever despises me and does not accept my words has one who judges him . The word that I have spoken , the same shall judge him on the last day .
43012049	For I am not speaking from myself , but from the Father who sent me . He gave a commandment to me as to what I should say and how I should speak .
43012050	And I know that his commandment is eternal life . Therefore , the things that I speak , just as the Father has said to me , so also do I speak . ”
43013001	Before the feast day of the Passover , Jesus knew that the hour was approaching when he would pass from this world to the Father . And since he had always loved his own who were in the world , he loved them unto the end .
43013002	And when the meal had taken place , when the devil had now put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot , the son of Simon , to betray him ,
43013003	knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands and that he came from God and was going to God ,
43013004	he rose up from the meal , and he set aside his vestments , and when he had received a towel , he wrapped it around himself .
43013005	Next he put water into a shallow bowl , and he began to wash the feet of the disciples and to wipe them with the towel with which he was wrapped .
43013006	And then he came to Simon Peter . And Peter said to him , “ Lord , would you wash my feet ? ”
43013007	Jesus responded and said to him : “ What I am doing , you do not now understand . But you shall understand it afterward . ”
43013008	Peter said to him , “ You shall never wash my feet ! ” Jesus answered him , “ If I do not wash you , you will have no place with me . ”
43013009	Simon Peter said to him , “ Then Lord , not only my feet , but also my hands and my head ! ”
43013010	Jesus said to him : “ He who is washed need only wash his feet , and then he will be entirely clean . And you are clean , but not all . ”
43013011	For he knew which one would betray him . For this reason , he said , “ You are not all clean . ”
43013012	And so , after he washed their feet and received his vestments , when he had sat down at table again , he said to them : “ Do you know what I have done for you ?
43013013	You call me Teacher and Lord , and you speak well : for so I am .
43013014	Therefore , if I , your Lord and Teacher , have washed your feet , you also ought to wash the feet of one another .
43013015	For I have given you an example , so that just as I have done for you , so also should you do .
43013016	Amen , amen , I say to you , the servant is not greater than his Lord , and the apostle is not greater than he who sent him .
43013017	If you understand this , you shall be blessed if you will do it .
43013018	I am not speaking about all of you . I know those whom I have chosen . But this is so that the Scripture may be fulfilled , ‘ He who eats bread with me shall lift up his heel against me . ’
43013019	And I tell you this now , before it happens , so that when it has happened , you may believe that I am .
43013020	Amen , amen , I say to you , whoever receives anyone whom I send , receives me . And whoever receives me , receives him who sent me . ”
43013021	When Jesus had said these things , he was troubled in spirit . And he bore witness by saying : “ Amen , amen , I say to you , that one among you shall betray me . ”
43013022	Therefore , the disciples looked around at one another , uncertain about whom he spoke .
43013023	And leaning against the bosom of Jesus was one of his disciples , the one whom Jesus loved .
43013024	Therefore , Simon Peter motioned to this one and said to him , “ Who is it that he is speaking about ? ”
43013025	And so , leaning against the chest of Jesus , he said to him , “ Lord , who is it ? ”
43013026	Jesus responded , “ It is he to whom I shall extend the dipped bread . ” And when he had dipped the bread , he gave it to Judas Iscariot , son of Simon .
43013027	And after the morsel , Satan entered into him . And Jesus said to him , “ What you are going to do , do quickly . ”
43013028	Now none of those sitting at table knew why he had said this to him .
43013029	For some were thinking that , because Judas held the purse , that Jesus had told him , “ Buy those things which are needed by us for the feast day , ” or that he might give something to the needy .
43013030	Therefore , having accepted the morsel , he went out immediately . And it was night .
43013031	Then , when he had gone out , Jesus said : “ Now the Son of man has been glorified , and God has been glorified in him .
43013032	If God has been glorified in him , then God will also glorify him in himself , and he will glorify him without delay .
43013033	Little sons , for a brief while , I am with you . You shall seek me , and just as I said to the Jews , ‘ Where I am going , you are not able to go , ’ so also I say to you now .
43013034	I give you a new commandment : Love one another . Just as I have loved you , so also must you love one another .
43013035	By this , all shall recognize that you are my disciples : if you will have love for one another . ”
43013036	Simon Peter said to him , “ Lord , where are you going ? ” Jesus responded : “ Where I am going , you are not able to follow me now . But you shall follow afterward . ”
43013037	Peter said to him : “ Why am I unable to follow you now ? I will lay down my life for you ! ”
43013038	Jesus answered him : “ You will lay down your life for me ? Amen , amen , I say to you , the rooster will not crow , until you deny me three times . ”
43014001	“ Do not let your heart be troubled . You believe in God . Believe in me also .
43014002	In my Father’s house , there are many dwelling places . If there were not , I would have told you . For I go to prepare a place for you .
43014003	And if I go and prepare a place for you , I will return again , and then I will take you to myself , so that where I am , you also may be .
43014004	And you know where I am going . And you know the way . ”
43014005	Thomas said to him , “ Lord , we do not know where you are going , so how can we know the way ? ”
43014006	Jesus said to him : “ I am the Way , and the Truth , and the Life . No one comes to the Father , except through me .
43014007	If you had known me , certainly you would also have known my Father . And from now on , you shall know him , and you have seen him . ”
43014008	Philip said to him , “ Lord , reveal the Father to us , and it is enough for us . ”
43014009	Jesus said to him : “ Have I been with you for so long , and you have not known me ? Philip , whoever sees me , also sees the Father . How can you say , ‘ Reveal the Father to us ? ’
43014010	Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me ? The words that I am speaking to you , I do not speak from myself . But the Father abiding in me , he does these works .
43014011	Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me ?
43014012	Or else , believe because of these same works . Amen , amen , I say to you , whoever believes in me shall also do the works that I do . And greater things than these shall he do , for I go to the Father .
43014013	And whatever you shall ask the Father in my name , that I will do , so that the Father may be glorified in the Son .
43014014	If you shall ask anything of me in my name , that I will do .
43014015	If you love me , keep my commandments .
43014016	And I will ask the Father , and he will give another Advocate to you , so that he may abide with you for eternity :
43014017	the Spirit of Truth , whom the world is not able to accept , because it neither perceives him nor knows him . But you shall know him . For he will remain with you , and he will be in you .
43014018	I will not leave you orphans . I will return to you .
43014019	Yet a little while and the world will not see me any longer . But you will see me . For I live , and you shall live .
43014020	In that day , you shall know that I am in my Father , and you are in me , and I am in you .
43014021	Whoever holds to my commandments and keeps them : it is he who loves me . And whoever loves me shall be loved by my Father . And I will love him , and I will manifest myself to him . ”
43014022	Judas , not the Iscariot , said to him : “ Lord , how does it happen that you will manifest yourself to us and not to the world ? ”
43014023	Jesus responded and said to him : “ If anyone loves me , he shall keep my word . And my Father will love him , and we will come to him , and we will make our dwelling place with him .
43014024	Whoever does not love me , does not keep not my words . And the word that you have heard is not of me , but it is of the Father who sent me .
43014025	These things I have spoken to you , while abiding with you .
43014026	But the Advocate , the Holy Spirit , whom the Father will send in my name , will teach you all things and will suggest to you everything whatsoever that I have said to you .
43014027	Peace I leave for you ; my Peace I give to you . Not in the way that the world gives , do I give to you . Do not let your heart be troubled , and let it not fear .
43014028	You have heard that I said to you : I am going away , and I am returning to you . If you loved me , certainly you would be gladdened , because I am going to the Father . For the Father is greater than I .
43014029	And now I have told you this , before it happens , so that , when it will happen , you may believe .
43014030	I will not now speak at length with you . For the prince of this world is coming , but he does not have anything in me .
43014031	Yet this is so that the world may know that I love the Father , and that I am acting according to the commandment that the Father has given to me . Rise up , let us go from here . ”
43015001	“ I am the true vine , and my Father is the vinedresser .
43015002	Every branch in me that does not bear fruit , he will take away . And each one that does bear fruit , he will cleanse , so that it may bring forth more fruit .
43015003	You are clean now , because of the word that I have spoken to you .
43015004	Abide in me , and I in you . Just as the branch is not able to bear fruit of itself , unless it abides in the vine , so also are you unable , unless you abide in me .
43015005	I am the vine ; you are the branches . Whoever abides in me , and I in him , bears much fruit . For without me , you are able to do nothing .
43015006	If anyone does not abide in me , he will be cast away , like a branch , and he will wither , and they will gather him and cast him into the fire , and he burns .
43015007	If you abide in me , and my words abide in you , then you may ask for whatever you will , and it shall be done for you .
43015008	In this , my Father is glorified : that you should bring forth very much fruit and become my disciples .
43015009	As the Father has loved me , so I have loved you . Abide in my love .
43015010	If you keep my precepts , you shall abide in my love , just as I also have kept my Father’s precepts and I abide in his love .
43015011	These things I have spoken to you , so that my joy may be in you , and your joy may be fulfilled .
43015012	This is my precept : that you love one another , just as I have loved you .
43015013	No one has a greater love than this : that he lay down his life for his friends .
43015014	You are my friends , if you do what I instruct you .
43015015	I will no longer call you servants , for the servant does not know what his Lord is doing . But I have called you friends , because everything whatsoever that I have heard from my Father , I have made known to you .
43015016	You have not chosen me , but I have chosen you . And I have appointed you , so that you may go forth and bear fruit , and so that your fruit may last . Then whatever you have asked of the Father in my name , he shall give to you .
43015017	This I command you : that you love one another .
43015018	If the world hates you , know that it has hated me before you .
43015019	If you had been of the world , the world would love what is its own . Yet truly , you are not of the world , but I have chosen you out of the world ; because of this , the world hates you .
43015020	Remember my saying that I told you : The servant is not greater than his Lord . If they have persecuted me , they will persecute you also . If they have kept my word , they will keep yours also .
43015021	But all these things they will do to you because of my name , for they do not know him who sent me .
43015022	If I had not come and had not spoken to them , they would not have sin . But now they have no excuse for their sin .
43015023	Whoever hates me , hates my Father also .
43015024	If I had not accomplished among them works that no other person has accomplished , they would not have sin . But now they have both seen me , and they have hated me and my Father .
43015025	But this is so that the word may be fulfilled which was written in their law : ‘ For they hated me without cause . ’
43015026	But when the Advocate has arrived , whom I will send to you from the Father , the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father , he will offer testimony about me .
43015027	And you shall offer testimony , because you are with me from the beginning . ”
43016001	“ These things I have spoken to you , so that you would not stumble .
43016002	They will put you out of the synagogues . But the hour is coming when everyone who puts you to death will consider that he is offering an excellent service to God .
43016003	And they will do these things to you because they have not known the Father , nor me .
43016004	But these things I have spoken to you , so that , when the hour for these things will have arrived , you may remember that I told you .
43016005	But I did not tell you these things from the beginning , because I was with you . And now I am going to him who sent me . And no one among you has asked me , ‘ Where are you going ? ’
43016006	But because I have spoken these things to you , sorrow has filled your heart .
43016007	But I tell you the truth : it is expedient for you that I am going . For if I do not go , the Advocate will not come to you . But when I will have gone away , I will send him to you .
43016008	And when he has arrived , he will argue against the world , about sin and about justice and about judgment :
43016009	about sin , indeed , because they have not believed in me ;
43016010	about justice , truly , because I am going to the Father , and you will not see me any longer ;
43016011	about judgment , then , because the prince of this world has already been judged .
43016012	I still have many things to say to you , but you are not able to bear them now .
43016013	But when the Spirit of truth has arrived , he will teach the whole truth to you . For he will not be speaking from himself . Instead , whatever he will hear , he will speak . And he will announce to you the things that are to come .
43016014	He shall glorify me . For he will receive from what is mine , and he will announce it to you .
43016015	All things whatsoever that the Father has are mine . For this reason , I said that he will receive from what is mine and that he will announce it to you .
43016016	A little while , and then you will not see me . And again a little while , and you will see me . For I am going to the Father . ”
43016017	Then some of his disciples said to one another : “ What is this , that he is saying to us : ‘ A little while , and you will not see me , ’ and ‘ Again a little while , and you will see me , ’ and , ‘ For I am going to the Father ? ’ ”
43016018	And they said : “ What is this , that he is saying , ‘ A little while ? ’ We do not understand what he is saying . ”
43016019	But Jesus realized that they wanted to question him , and so he said to them : “ Are you inquiring among yourselves about this , that I said : ‘ A little while , and you will not see me , and again a little while , and you will see me ? ’
43016020	Amen , amen , I say to you , that you shall mourn and weep , but the world will rejoice . And you shall be greatly saddened , yet your sorrow shall be turned into joy .
43016021	A woman , when she is giving birth , has sorrow , because her hour has arrived . But when she has given birth to the child , then she no longer remembers the difficulties , because of the joy : for a man has been born into the world .
43016022	Therefore , you also , indeed , have sorrow now . But I will see you again , and your heart shall rejoice . And no one will take away your joy from you .
43016023	And , in that day , you will not petition me for anything . Amen , amen , I say to you , if you ask the Father for anything in my name , he will give it to you .
43016024	Until now , you have not requested anything in my name . Ask , and you shall receive , so that your joy may be full .
43016025	I have spoken these things to you in proverbs . The hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in proverbs ; instead , I will announce to you plainly from the Father .
43016026	In that day , you shall ask in my name , and I do not say to you that I will ask the Father for you .
43016027	For the Father himself loves you , because you have loved me , and because you have believed that I went forth from God .
43016028	I went forth from the Father , and I have come into the world . Next I am leaving the world , and I am going to the Father . ”
43016029	His disciples said to him : “ Behold , now you are speaking plainly and not reciting a proverb .
43016030	Now we know that you know all things , and that you have no need for anyone to question you . By this , we believe that you went forth from God . ”
43016031	Jesus answered them : “ Do you believe now ?
43016032	Behold , the hour is coming , and it has now arrived , when you will be scattered , each one on his own , and you will leave me behind , alone . And yet I am not alone , for the Father is with me .
43016033	These things I have spoken to you , so that you may have peace in me . In the world , you will have difficulties . But have confidence : I have overcome the world . ”
43017001	Jesus said these things , and then , lifting up his eyes toward heaven , he said : “ Father , the hour has arrived : glorify your Son , so that your Son may glorify you ,
43017002	just as you have given authority over all flesh to him , so that he may give eternal life to all those whom you have given to him .
43017003	And this is eternal life : that they may know you , the only true God , and Jesus Christ , whom you have sent .
43017004	I have glorified you on earth . I have completed the work that you gave me to accomplish .
43017005	And now Father , glorify me within yourself , with the glory that I had with you before the world ever was .
43017006	I have manifested your name to the men whom you have given to me from the world . They were yours , and you gave them to me . And they have kept your word .
43017007	Now they realize that all the things that you have given me are from you .
43017008	For I have given them the words that you gave to me . And they have accepted these words , and they have truly understood that I went forth from you , and they have believed that you sent me .
43017009	I pray for them . I do not pray for the world , but for those whom you have given to me . For they are yours .
43017010	And all that is mine is yours , and all that is yours is mine , and I am glorified in this .
43017011	And though I am not in the world , these are in the world , and I am coming to you . Father most holy , preserve them in your name , those whom you have given to me , so that they may be one , even as we are one .
43017012	While I was with them , I preserved them in your name . I have guarded those whom you have given to me , and not one of them is lost , except the son of perdition , so that the Scripture may be fulfilled .
43017013	And now I am coming to you . But I am speaking these things in the world , so that they may have the fullness of my joy within themselves .
43017014	I have given them your word , and the world has hated them . For they are not of the world , just as I , too , am not of the world .
43017015	I am not praying that you would take them out of the world , but that you would preserve them from evil .
43017016	They are not of the world , just as I also am not of the world .
43017017	Sanctify them in truth . Your word is truth .
43017018	Just as you have sent me into the world , I also have sent them into the world .
43017019	And it is for them that I sanctify myself , so that they , too , may be sanctified in truth .
43017020	But I am not praying for them only , but also for those who through their word shall believe in me .
43017021	So may they all be one . Just as you , Father , are in me , and I am in you , so also may they be one in us : so that the world may believe that you have sent me .
43017022	And the glory that you have given to me , I have given to them , so that they may be one , just as we also are one .
43017023	I am in them , and you are in me . So may they be perfected as one . And may the world know that you have sent me and that you have loved them , just as you have also loved me .
43017024	Father , I will that where I am , those whom you have given to me may also be with me , so that they may see my glory which you have given to me . For you loved me before the founding of the world .
43017025	Father most just , the world has not known you . But I have known you . And these have known that you sent me .
43017026	And I have made known your name to them , and I will make it known , so that the love in which you have loved me may be in them , and so that I may be in them . ”
43018001	When Jesus had said these things , he departed with his disciples across the Torrent of Kidron , where there was a garden , into which he entered with his disciples .
43018002	But Judas , who betrayed him , also knew the place , for Jesus had frequently met with his disciples there .
43018003	Then Judas , when he had received a cohort from both the high priests and the attendants of the Pharisees , approached the place with lanterns and torches and weapons .
43018004	And so Jesus , knowing all that was about to happen to him , advanced and said to them , “ Who are you seeking ? ”
43018005	They answered him , “ Jesus the Nazarene . ” Jesus said to them , “ I am he . ” Now Judas , who betrayed him , was also standing with them .
43018006	Then , when he said to them , “ I am he , ” they moved back and fell to the ground .
43018007	Then again he questioned them : “ Who are you seeking ? ” And they said , “ Jesus the Nazarene . ”
43018008	Jesus responded : “ I told you that I am he . Therefore , if you are seeking me , permit these others to go away . ”
43018009	This was so that the word might be fulfilled , which he said , “ Of those whom you have given to me , I have not lost any of them . ”
43018010	Then Simon Peter , having a sword , drew it , and he struck the servant of the high priest , and he cut off his right ear . Now the name of the servant was Malchus .
43018011	Therefore , Jesus said to Peter : “ Set your sword into the scabbard . Should I not drink the chalice which my Father has given to me ? ”
43018012	Then the cohort , and the tribune , and the attendants of the Jews apprehended Jesus and bound him .
43018013	And they led him away , first to Annas , for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas , who was the high priest that year .
43018014	Now Caiaphas was the one who had given counsel to the Jews that it was expedient for one man to die for the people .
43018015	And Simon Peter was following Jesus with another disciple . And that disciple was known to the high priest , and so he entered with Jesus into the court of the high priest .
43018016	But Peter was standing outside at the entrance . Therefore , the other disciple , who was known to the high priest , went out and spoke to the woman who was the doorkeeper , and he led in Peter .
43018017	Therefore , the woman servant keeping the door said to Peter , “ Are you not also among the disciples of this man ? ” He said , “ I am not . ”
43018018	Now the servants and attendants were standing before burning coals , for it was cold , and they were warming themselves . And Peter was standing with them also , warming himself .
43018019	Then the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his doctrine .
43018020	Jesus responded to him : “ I have spoken openly to the world . I have always taught in the synagogue and in the temple , where all the Jews meet . And I have said nothing in secret .
43018021	Why do you question me ? Question those who heard what I said to them . Behold , they know these things that I have said . ”
43018022	Then , when he had said this , one the attendants standing nearby struck Jesus , saying : “ Is this the way you answer the high priest ? ”
43018023	Jesus answered him : “ If I have spoken wrongly , offer testimony about the wrong . But if I have spoken correctly , then why do you strike me ? ”
43018024	And Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas , the high priest .
43018025	Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself . Then they said to him , “ Are you not also one of his disciples ? ” He denied it and said , “ I am not . ”
43018026	One of the servants of the high priest ( a relative of him whose ear Peter had cut off ) said to him , “ Did I not see you in the garden with him ? ”
43018027	Therefore , again , Peter denied it . And immediately the rooster crowed .
43018028	Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas into the praetorium . Now it was morning , and so they did not enter into the praetorium , so that they would not be defiled , but might eat the Passover .
43018029	Therefore , Pilate went outside to them , and he said , “ What accusation are you bringing against this man ? ”
43018030	They responded and said to him , “ If he were not an evil-doer , we would not have handed him over you . ”
43018031	Therefore , Pilate said to them , “ Take him yourselves and judge him according to your own law . ” Then the Jews said to him , “ It is not lawful for us to execute anyone . ”
43018032	This was so that the word of Jesus would be fulfilled , which he spoke signifying what kind of death he would die .
43018033	Then Pilate entered the praetorium again , and he called Jesus and said to him , “ You are the king of the Jews ? ”
43018034	Jesus responded , “ Are you saying this of yourself , or have others spoken to you about me ? ”
43018035	Pilate responded : “ Am I a Jew ? Your own nation and the high priests have handed you over to me . What have you done ? ”
43018036	Jesus responded : “ My kingdom is not of this world . If my kingdom were of this world , my ministers would certainly strive so that I would not be handed over to the Jews . But my kingdom is not now from here . ”
43018037	And so Pilate said to him , “ You are a king , then ? ” Jesus answered , “ You are saying that I am a king . For this I was born , and for this I came into the world : so that I may offer testimony to the truth . Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice . ”
43018038	Pilate said to him , “ What is truth ? ” And when he had said this , he went out again to the Jews , and he said to them , “ I find no case against him .
43018039	But you have a custom , that I should release someone to you at the Passover . Therefore , do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews ? ”
43018040	Then they all cried out repeatedly , saying : “ Not this one , but Barabbas . ” Now Barabbas was a robber .
43019001	Therefore , Pilate then took Jesus into custody and scourged him .
43019002	And the soldiers , plaiting a crown of thorns , imposed it on his head . And they put a purple garment around him .
43019003	And they were approaching him and saying , “ Hail , king of the Jews ! ” And they struck him repeatedly .
43019004	Then Pilate went outside again , and he said to them : “ Behold , I am bringing him out to you , so that you may realize that I find no case against him . ”
43019005	( Then Jesus went out , bearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment . ) And he said to them , “ Behold the man . ”
43019006	Therefore , when the high priests and the attendants had seen him , they cried out , saying : “ Crucify him ! Crucify him ! ” Pilate said to them : “ Take him yourselves and crucify him . For I find no case against him . ”
43019007	The Jews answered him , “ We have a law , and according to the law , he ought to die , for he has made himself the Son of God . ”
43019008	Therefore , when Pilate had heard this word , he was more fearful .
43019009	And he entered into the praetorium again . And he said to Jesus . “ Where are you from ? ” But Jesus gave him no response .
43019010	Therefore , Pilate said to him : “ Will you not speak to me ? Do you not know that I have authority to crucify you , and I have authority to release you ? ”
43019011	Jesus responded , “ You would not have any authority over me , unless it were given to you from above . For this reason , he who has handed me over to you has the greater sin . ”
43019012	And from then on , Pilate was seeking to release him . But the Jews were crying out , saying : “ If you release this man , you are no friend of Caesar . For anyone who makes himself a king contradicts Caesar . ”
43019013	Now when Pilate had heard these words , he brought Jesus outside , and he sat down in the seat of judgment , in a place which is called the Pavement , but in Hebrew , it is called the Elevation .
43019014	Now it was the preparation day of the Passover , about the sixth hour . And he said to the Jews , “ Behold your king . ”
43019015	But they were crying out : “ Take him away ! Take him away ! Crucify him ! ” Pilate said to them , “ Shall I crucify your king ? ” The high priests responded , “ We have no king except Caesar . ”
43019016	Therefore , he then handed him over to them to be crucified . And they took Jesus and led him away .
43019017	And carrying his own cross , he went forth to the place which is called Calvary , but in Hebrew it is called the Place of the Skull .
43019018	There they crucified him , and with him two others , one on each side , with Jesus in the middle .
43019019	Then Pilate also wrote a title , and he set it above the cross . And it was written : JESUS THE NAZARENE , KING OF THE JEWS .
43019020	Therefore , many of the Jews read this title , for the place where Jesus was crucified was close to the city . And it was written in Hebrew , in Greek , and in Latin .
43019021	Then the high priests of the Jews said to Pilate : Do not write , ‘ King of the Jews , ’ but that he said , ‘ I am King of the Jews . ’
43019022	Pilate responded , “ What I have written , I have written . ”
43019023	Then the soldiers , when they had crucified him , took his garments , and they made four parts , one part to each soldier , and the tunic . But the tunic was seamless , woven from above throughout the whole .
43019024	Then they said to one another , “ Let us not cut it , but instead let us cast lots over it , to see whose it will be . ” This was so that the Scripture would be fulfilled , saying : “ They have distributed my garments among themselves , and for my vesture they have cast lots . ” And indeed , the soldiers did these things .
43019025	And standing beside the cross of Jesus were his mother , and his mother’s sister , and Mary of Cleophas , and Mary Magdalene .
43019026	Therefore , when Jesus had seen his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing near , he said to his mother , “ Woman , behold your son . ”
43019027	Next , he said to the disciple , “ Behold your mother . ” And from that hour , the disciple accepted her as his own .
43019028	After this , Jesus knew that all had been accomplished , so in order that the Scripture might be completed , he said , “ I thirst . ”
43019029	And there was a container placed there , full of vinegar . Then , placing a sponge full of vinegar around hyssop , they brought it to his mouth .
43019030	Then Jesus , when he had received the vinegar , said : “ It is consummated . ” And bowing down his head , he surrendered his spirit .
43019031	Then the Jews , because it was the preparation day , so that the bodies would not remain upon the cross on the Sabbath ( for that Sabbath was a great day ) , they petitioned Pilate in order that their legs might be broken , and they might be taken away .
43019032	Therefore , the soldiers approached , and , indeed , they broke the legs of the first one , and of the other who was crucified with him .
43019033	But after they had approached Jesus , when they saw that he was already dead , they did not break his legs .
43019034	Instead , one of the soldiers opened his side with a lance , and immediately there went out blood and water .
43019035	And he who saw this has offered testimony , and his testimony is true . And he knows that he speaks the truth , so that you also may believe .
43019036	For these things happened so that the Scripture would be fulfilled : “ You shall not break a bone of him . ”
43019037	And again , another Scripture says : “ They shall look upon him , whom they have pierced . ”
43019038	Then , after these things , Joseph from Arimathea , ( because he was a disciple of Jesus , but a secret one for fear of the Jews ) petitioned Pilate so that he might take away the body of Jesus . And Pilate gave permission . Therefore , he went and took away the body of Jesus .
43019039	Now Nicodemus also arrived , ( who had gone to Jesus at first by night ) bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloe , weighing about seventy pounds .
43019040	Therefore , they took the body of Jesus , and they bound it with linen cloths and the aromatic spices , just as it is the manner of the Jews to bury .
43019041	Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden , and in the garden there was a new tomb , in which no one had yet been laid .
43019042	Therefore , because of the preparation day of the Jews , since the tomb was nearby , they placed Jesus there .
43020001	Then on the first Sabbath , Mary Magdalene went to the tomb early , while it was still dark , and she saw that the stone had been rolled away from the tomb .
43020002	Therefore , she ran and went to Simon Peter , and to the other disciple , whom Jesus loved , and she said to them , “ They have taken the Lord away from the tomb , and we do not know where they have laid him . ”
43020003	Therefore , Peter departed with the other disciple , and they went to the tomb .
43020004	Now they both ran together , but the other disciple ran more quickly , ahead of Peter , and so he arrived at the tomb first .
43020005	And when he bowed down , he saw the linen cloths lying there , but he did not yet enter .
43020006	Then Simon Peter arrived , following him , and he entered the tomb , and he saw the linen cloths lying there ,
43020007	and the separate cloth which had been over his head , not placed with the linen cloths , but in a separate place , wrapped up by itself .
43020008	Then the other disciple , who had arrived first at the tomb , also entered . And he saw and believed .
43020009	For as yet they did not understand the Scripture , that it was necessary for him to rise again from the dead .
43020010	Then the disciples went away again , each by himself .
43020011	But Mary was standing outside the tomb , weeping . Then , while she was weeping , she bowed down and gazed into the tomb .
43020012	And she saw two Angels in white , sitting where the body of Jesus had been placed , one at the head , and one at the feet .
43020013	They say to her , “ Woman , why are you weeping ? ” She said to them , “ Because they have taken away my Lord , and I do not know where they have placed him . ”
43020014	When she had said this , she turned around and saw Jesus standing there , but she did not know that it was Jesus .
43020015	Jesus said to her : “ Woman , why are you weeping ? Who are you seeking ? ” Considering that it was the gardener , she said to him , “ Sir , if you have moved him , tell me where you have placed him , and I will take him away . ”
43020016	Jesus said to her , “ Mary ! ” And turning , she said to him , “ Rabboni ! ” ( which means , Teacher ) .
43020017	Jesus said to her : “ Do not touch me . For I have not yet ascended to my Father . But go to my brothers and tell them : ‘ I am ascending to my Father and to your Father , to my God and to your God . ’ ”
43020018	Mary Magdalene went , announcing to the disciples , “ I have seen the Lord , and these are the things that he said to me . ”
43020019	Then , when it was late on the same day , on the first of the Sabbaths , and the doors were closed where the disciples were gathered , for fear of the Jews , Jesus came and stood in their midst , and he said to them : “ Peace to you . ”
43020020	And when he had said this , he showed them his hands and side . And the disciples were gladdened when they saw the Lord .
43020021	Therefore , he said to them again : “ Peace to you . As the Father has sent me , so I send you . ”
43020022	When he had said this , he breathed on them . And he said to them : “ Receive the Holy Spirit .
43020023	Those whose sins you shall forgive , they are forgiven them , and those whose sins you shall retain , they are retained . ”
43020024	Now Thomas , one of the twelve , who is called the Twin , was not with them when Jesus arrived .
43020025	Therefore , the other disciples said to him , “ We have seen the Lord . ” But he said to them , “ Unless I will see in his hands the mark of the nails and place my finger into the place of the nails , and place my hand into his side , I will not believe . ”
43020026	And after eight days , again his disciples were within , and Thomas was with them . Jesus arrived , though the doors had been closed , and he stood in their midst and said , “ Peace to you . ”
43020027	Next , he said to Thomas : “ Look at my hands , and place your finger here ; and bring your hand close , and place it at my side . And do not choose to be unbelieving , but faithful . ”
43020028	Thomas responded and said to him , “ My Lord and my God . ”
43020029	Jesus said to him : “ You have seen me , Thomas , so you have believed . Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed . ”
43020030	Jesus also accomplished many other signs in the sight of his disciples . These have not been written in this book .
43020031	But these things have been written , so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ , the Son of God , and so that , in believing , you may have life in his name .
43021001	After this , Jesus manifested himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias . And he manifested himself in this way .
43021002	These were together : Simon Peter and Thomas , who is called the Twin , and Nathanael , who was from Cana of Galilee , and the sons of Zebedee , and two others of his disciples .
43021003	Simon Peter said to them , “ I am going fishing . ” They said to him , “ And we are going with you . ” And they went and climbed into the ship . And in that night , they caught nothing .
43021004	But when morning arrived , Jesus stood on the shore . Yet the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus .
43021005	Then Jesus said to them , “ Children , do you have any food ? ” They answered him , “ No . ”
43021006	He said to them , “ Cast the net to the right side of the ship , and you will find some . ” Therefore , they cast it out , and then they were not able to draw it in , because of the multitude of fish .
43021007	Therefore , the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter , “ It is the Lord . ” Simon Peter , when he had heard that it was the Lord , wrapped his tunic around himself , ( for he was naked ) and he cast himself into the sea .
43021008	Then the other disciples arrived in a boat , ( for they were not far from the land , only about two hundred cubits ) dragging the net with the fish .
43021009	Then , when they climbed down to the land they saw burning coals prepared , and fish already placed above them , and bread .
43021010	Jesus said to them , “ Bring some of the fish that you have just now caught . ”
43021011	Simon Peter climbed up and drew in the net to land : full of large fish , one hundred and fifty-three of them . And although there were so many , the net was not torn .
43021012	Jesus said to them , “ Approach and dine . ” And not one of them sitting down to eat dared to ask him , “ Who are you ? ” For they knew that it was the Lord .
43021013	And Jesus approached , and he took bread , and he gave it to them , and similarly with the fish .
43021014	This was now the third time that Jesus was manifested to his disciples , after he had resurrected from the dead .
43021015	Then , when they had dined , Jesus said to Simon Peter , “ Simon , son of John , do you love me more than these ? ” He said to him , “ Yes , Lord , you know that I love you . ” He said to him , “ Feed my lambs . ”
43021016	He said to him again : “ Simon , son of John , do you love me ? ” He said to him , “ Yes , Lord , you know that I love you . ” He said to him , “ Feed my lambs . ”
43021017	He said to him a third time , “ Simon , son of John , do you love me ? ” Peter was very grieved that he had asked him a third time , “ Do you love me ? ” And so he said to him : “ Lord , you know all things . You know that I love you . ” He said to him , “ Feed my sheep .
43021018	Amen , amen , I say to you , when you were younger , you girded yourself and walked wherever you wanted . But when you are older , you will extend your hands , and another shall gird you and lead you where you do not want to go . ”
43021019	Now he said this to signify by what kind of death he would glorify God . And when he had said this , he said to him , “ Follow me . ”
43021020	Peter , turning around , saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following , the one who also had leaned on his chest at supper and said , “ Lord , who is it who shall betray you ? ”
43021021	Therefore , when Peter had seen him , he said to Jesus , “ Lord , but what about this one ? ”
43021022	Jesus said to him : “ If I want him to remain until I return , what is that to you ? You follow me . ”
43021023	Therefore , the saying went out among the brothers that this disciple would not die . But Jesus did not say to him that he would not die , but only , “ If I want him to remain until I return , what is that to you ? ”
43021024	This is the same disciple who offers testimony about these things , and who has written these things . And we know that his testimony is true .
43021025	Now there are also many other things that Jesus did , which , if each of these were written down , the world itself , I suppose , would not be able to contain the books that would be written .
44001001	Certainly , O Theophilus , I composed the first discourse about everything that Jesus began to do and to teach ,
44001002	instructing the Apostles , whom he had chosen through the Holy Spirit , even until the day on which he was taken up .
44001003	He also presented himself alive to them , after his Passion , appearing to them throughout forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God with many elucidations .
44001004	And dining with them , he instructed them that they should not depart from Jerusalem , but that they should wait for the Promise of the Father , “ about which you have heard , ” he said , “ from my own mouth .
44001005	For John , indeed , baptized with water , but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit , not many days from now . ”
44001006	Therefore , those who had assembled together questioned him , saying , “ Lord , is this the time when you will restore the kingdom of Israel ? ”
44001007	But he said to them : “ It is not yours to know the times or the moments , which the Father has set by his own authority .
44001008	But you shall receive the power of the Holy Spirit , passing over you , and you shall be witnesses for me in Jerusalem , and in all Judea and Samaria , and even to the ends of the earth . ”
44001009	And when he had said these things , while they were watching , he was lifted up , and a cloud took him from their sight .
44001010	And while they were watching him going up to heaven , behold , two men stood near them in white vestments .
44001011	And they said : “ Men of Galilee , why do you stand here looking up toward heaven ? This Jesus , who has been taken up from you into heaven , shall return in just the same way that you have seen him going up to heaven . ”
44001012	Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain , which is called Olivet , which is next to Jerusalem , within a Sabbath day’s journey .
44001013	And when they had entered into the cenacle , they ascended to the place where Peter and John , James and Andrew , Philip and Thomas , Bartholomew and Matthew , James of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot , and Jude of James , were staying .
44001014	All these were persevering with one accord in prayer with the women , and with Mary , the mother of Jesus , and with his brothers .
44001015	In those days , Peter , rising up in the midst of the brothers , said ( now the crowd of men altogether was about one hundred and twenty ) :
44001016	“ Noble brothers , the Scripture must be fulfilled , which the Holy Spirit predicted by the mouth of David about Judas , who was the leader of those who apprehended Jesus .
44001017	He had been numbered among us , and he was chosen by lot for this ministry .
44001018	And this man certainly possessed an estate from the wages of iniquity , and so , having been hanged , he burst open in the middle and all his internal organs poured out .
44001019	And this became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem , so that this field was called in their language , Akeldama , that is , ‘ Field of Blood . ’
44001020	For it has been written in the book of Psalms : ‘ Let their dwelling place be desolate and may there be no one who dwells within it , ’ and ‘ Let another take his episcopate . ’
44001021	Therefore , it is necessary that , out of these men who have been assembling with us throughout the entire time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us ,
44001022	beginning from the baptism of John , until the day when he was taken up from us , one of these be made a witness with us of his Resurrection . ”
44001023	And they appointed two : Joseph , who was called Barsabbas , who was surnamed Justus , and Matthias .
44001024	And praying , they said : “ May you , O Lord , who knows the heart of everyone , reveal which one of these two you have chosen ,
44001025	to take a place in this ministry and apostleship , from which Judas prevaricated , so that he might go to his own place . ”
44001026	And they cast lots concerning them , and the lot fell upon Matthias . And he was numbered with the eleven Apostles .
44002001	And when the days of Pentecost were completed , they were all together in the same place .
44002002	And suddenly , there came a sound from heaven , like that of a wind approaching violently , and it filled the entire house where they were sitting .
44002003	And there appeared to them separate tongues , as if of fire , which settled upon each one of them .
44002004	And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit . And they began to speak in various languages , just as the Holy Spirit bestowed eloquence to them .
44002005	Now there were Jews staying in Jerusalem , pious men from every nation that is under heaven .
44002006	And when this sound occurred , the multitude came together and was confused in mind , because each one was listening to them speaking in his own language .
44002007	Then all were astonished , and they wondered , saying : “ Behold , are not all of these who are speaking Galileans ?
44002008	And how is it that we have each heard them in our own language , into which we were born ?
44002009	Parthians and Medes and Elamites , and those who inhabit Mesopotamia , Judea and Cappadocia , Pontus and Asia ,
44002010	Phrygia and Pamphylia , Egypt and the parts of Libya which are around Cyrene , and new arrivals of the Romans ,
44002011	likewise Jews and new converts , Cretans and Arabs : we have heard them speaking in our own languages the mighty deeds of God . ”
44002012	And they were all astonished , and they wondered , saying to one another : “ But what does this mean ? ”
44002013	But others mockingly said , “ These men are full of new wine . ”
44002014	But Peter , standing up with the eleven , lifted up his voice , and he spoke to them : “ Men of Judea , and all those who are staying in Jerusalem , let this be known to you , and incline your ears to my words .
44002015	For these men are not inebriated , as you suppose , for it is the third hour of the day .
44002016	But this is what was spoken of by the prophet Joel :
44002017	‘ And this shall be : in the last days , says the Lord , I will pour out , from my Spirit , upon all flesh . And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy . And your youths shall see visions , and your elders shall dream dreams .
44002018	And certainly , upon my men and women servants in those days , I will pour out from my Spirit , and they shall prophesy .
44002019	And I will bestow wonders in heaven above , and signs on earth below : blood and fire and the vapor of smoke .
44002020	The sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood , before the great and manifest day of the Lord arrives .
44002021	And this shall be : whoever shall invoke the name of the Lord will be saved . ’
44002022	Men of Israel , hear these words : Jesus the Nazarene is a man confirmed by God among you through the miracles and wonders and signs that God accomplished through him in your midst , just as you also know .
44002023	This man , under the definitive plan and foreknowledge of God , was delivered by the hands of the unjust , afflicted , and put to death .
44002024	And he whom God has raised up has broken the sorrows of Hell , for certainly it was impossible for him to be held by it .
44002025	For David said about him : ‘ I foresaw the Lord always in my sight , for he is at my right hand , so that I may not be moved .
44002026	Because of this , my heart has rejoiced , and my tongue has exulted . Moreover , my flesh shall also rest in hope .
44002027	For you will not abandon my soul to Hell , nor will you allow your Holy One to see corruption .
44002028	You have made known to me the ways of life . You will completely fill me with happiness by your presence . ’
44002029	Noble brothers , permit me to speak freely to you about the Patriarch David : for he passed away and was buried , and his sepulcher is with us , even to this very day .
44002030	Therefore , he was a prophet , for he knew that God had sworn an oath to him about the fruit of his loins , about the One who would sit upon his throne .
44002031	Foreseeing this , he was speaking about the Resurrection of the Christ . For he was neither left behind in Hell , nor did his flesh see corruption .
44002032	This Jesus , God raised up again , and of this we are all witnesses .
44002033	Therefore , being exalted to the right hand of God , and having received from the Father the Promise of the Holy Spirit , he poured this out , just as you now see and hear .
44002034	For David did not ascend into heaven . But he himself said : ‘ The Lord said to my Lord : Sit at my right hand ,
44002035	until I make your enemies your footstool . ’
44002036	Therefore , may the entire house of Israel know most certainly that God has made this same Jesus , whom you crucified , both Lord and Christ . ”
44002037	Now when they had heard these things , they were contrite in heart , and they said to Peter and to the other Apostles : “ What should we do , noble brothers ? ”
44002038	Yet truly , Peter said to them : “ Do penance ; and be baptized , each one of you , in the name of Jesus Christ , for the remission of your sins . And you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit .
44002039	For the Promise is for you and for your sons , and for all who are far away : for whomever the Lord our God will have called . ”
44002040	And then , with very many other words , he testified and he exhorted them , saying , “ Save yourselves from this depraved generation . ”
44002041	Therefore , those who accepted his discourse were baptized . And about three thousand souls were added on that day .
44002042	Now they were persevering in the doctrine of the Apostles , and in the communion of the breaking of the bread , and in the prayers .
44002043	And fear developed in every soul . Also , many miracles and signs were accomplished by the Apostles in Jerusalem . And there was a great awe in everyone .
44002044	And then all who believed were together , and they held all things in common .
44002045	They were selling their possessions and belongings , and dividing them to all , just as any of them had need .
44002046	Also , they continued , daily , to be of one accord in the temple and to break bread among the houses ; and they took their meals with exultation and simplicity of heart ,
44002047	praising God greatly , and holding favor with all the people . And every day , the Lord increased those who were being saved among them .
44003001	Now Peter and John went up to the temple at the ninth hour of prayer .
44003002	And a certain man , who was lame from his mother’s womb , was being carried in . They would lay him every day at the gate of the temple , which is called the Beautiful , so that he might request alms from those entering into the temple .
44003003	And this man , when he had seen Peter and John beginning to enter the temple , was begging , so that he might receive alms .
44003004	Then Peter and John , gazing at him , said , “ Look at us . ”
44003005	And he looked intently at them , hoping that he might receive something from them .
44003006	But Peter said : “ Silver and gold is not mine . But what I have , I give to you . In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene , rise up and walk . ”
44003007	And taking him by the right hand , he lifted him up . And immediately his legs and feet were strengthened .
44003008	And leaping up , he stood and walked around . And he entered with them into the temple , walking and leaping and praising God .
44003009	And all the people saw him walking and praising God .
44003010	And they recognized him , that he was the same one who was sitting for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple . And they were filled with awe and amazement at what had happened to him .
44003011	Then , as he held on to Peter and John , all the people ran to them at the portico , which is called Solomon’s , in astonishment .
44003012	But Peter , seeing this , responded to the people : “ Men of Israel , why do you wonder at this ? Or why do you stare at us , as if it were by our own strength or power that we caused this man to walk ?
44003013	The God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob , the God of our fathers , has glorified his Son Jesus , whom you , indeed , handed over and denied before the face of Pilate , when he was giving judgment to release him .
44003014	Then you denied the Holy and Just One , and petitioned for a murderous man to be given to you .
44003015	Truly , it was the Author of Life whom you put to death , whom God raised from the dead , to whom we are witnesses .
44003016	And by faith in his name , this man , whom you have seen and known , has confirmed his name . And faith through him has given this man complete health in the sight of you all .
44003017	And now , brothers , I know that you did this through ignorance , just as your leaders also did .
44003018	But in this way God has fulfilled the things that he announced beforehand through the mouth of all the Prophets : that his Christ would suffer .
44003019	Therefore , repent and be converted , so that your sins may be wiped away .
44003020	And then , when the time of consolation will have arrived from the presence of the Lord , he will send the One who was foretold to you , Jesus Christ ,
44003021	whom heaven certainly must take up , until the time of the restoration of all things , which God has spoken of by the mouth of his holy prophets , from ages past .
44003022	Indeed , Moses said : ‘ For the Lord your God shall raise up a Prophet for you from your brothers , one like me ; the same shall you listen to according to everything whatsoever that he shall speak to you .
44003023	And this shall be : every soul who will not listen to that Prophet shall be exterminated from the people . ’
44003024	And all the prophets who have spoken , from Samuel and thereafter , have announced these days .
44003025	You are sons of the prophets and of the testament which God has appointed for our fathers , saying to Abraham : ‘ And by your offspring all the families of the earth shall be blessed . ’
44003026	God raised up his Son and sent him first to you , to bless you , so that each one may turn himself away from his wickedness . ”
44004001	But while they were speaking to the people , the priests and the magistrate of the temple and the Sadducees overwhelmed them ,
44004002	being grieved that they were teaching the people and announcing in Jesus the resurrection from the dead .
44004003	And they laid hands on them , and they placed them under guard until the next day . For it was now evening .
44004004	But many of those who had heard the word believed . And the number of men became five thousand .
44004005	And it happened on the next day that their leaders and elders and scribes gathered together in Jerusalem ,
44004006	including Annas , the high priest , and Caiaphas , and John and Alexander , and as many as were of the priestly family .
44004007	And stationing them in the middle , they questioned them : “ By what power , or in whose name , have you done this ? ”
44004008	Then Peter , filled with the Holy Spirit , said to them : “ Leaders of the people and elders , listen .
44004009	If we today are judged by a good deed done to an infirm man , by which he has been made whole ,
44004010	let it be known to all of you and to all of the people of Israel , that in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ the Nazarene , whom you crucified , whom God has raised from the dead , by him , this man stands before you , healthy .
44004011	He is the stone , which was rejected by you , the builders , which has become the head of the corner .
44004012	And there is no salvation in any other . For there is no other name under heaven given to men , by which it is necessary for us to be saved . ”
44004013	Then , seeing the constancy of Peter and John , having verified that they were men without letters or learning , they wondered . And they recognized that they had been with Jesus .
44004014	Also , seeing the man who had been cured standing with them , they were unable to say anything to contradict them .
44004015	But they ordered them to withdraw outside , away from the council , and they conferred among themselves ,
44004016	saying : “ What shall we do to these men ? For certainly a public sign has been done through them , before all the inhabitants of Jerusalem . It is manifest , and we cannot deny it .
44004017	But lest it spread further among the people , let us threaten them not to speak anymore in this name to any man . ”
44004018	And calling them in , they warned them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus .
44004019	Yet truly , Peter and John said in response to them : “ Judge whether it is just in the sight of God to listen to you , rather than to God .
44004020	For we are unable to refrain from speaking the things that we have seen and heard . ”
44004021	But they , threatening them , sent them away , having not found a way that they might punish them because of the people . For all were glorifying the things that had been done in these events .
44004022	For the man in whom this sign of a cure had been accomplished was more than forty years old .
44004023	Then , having been released , they went to their own , and they reported in full what the leaders of the priests and the elders had said to them .
44004024	And when they had heard it , with one accord , they lifted up their voice to God , and they said : “ Lord , you are the One who made heaven and earth , the sea and all that is in them ,
44004025	who , by the Holy Spirit , through the mouth of our father David , your servant , said : ‘ Why have the Gentiles been seething , and why have the people been pondering nonsense ?
44004026	The kings of the earth have stood up , and the leaders have joined together as one , against the Lord and against his Christ . ’
44004027	For truly Herod and Pontius Pilate , with the Gentiles and the people of Israel , joined together in this city against your holy servant Jesus , whom you anointed
44004028	to do what your hand and your counsel had decreed would be done .
44004029	And now , O Lord , look upon their threats , and grant to your servants that they may speak your word with all confidence ,
44004030	by extending your hand in cures and signs and miracles , to be done through the name of your holy Son , Jesus . ”
44004031	And when they had prayed , the place in which they were gathered was moved . And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit . And they were speaking the Word of God with confidence .
44004032	Then the multitude of believers were of one heart and one soul . Neither did anyone say that any of the things that he possessed were his own , but all things were common to them .
44004033	And with great power , the Apostles were rendering testimony to the Resurrection of Jesus Christ our Lord . And great grace was in them all .
44004034	And neither was anyone among them in need . For as many as were owners of fields or houses , selling these , were bringing the proceeds of the things that they were selling ,
44004035	and were placing it before the feet of the Apostles . Then it was divided to each one , just as he had need .
44004036	Now Joseph , who the Apostles surnamed Barnabas ( which is translated as ‘ son of consolation ’ ) , who was a Levite of Cyprian descent ,
44004037	since he had land , he sold it , and he brought the proceeds and placed these at the feet of the Apostles .
44005001	But a certain man named Ananias , with his wife Sapphira , sold a field ,
44005002	and he was deceitful about the price of the field , with his wife’s consent . And bringing only part of it , he placed it at the feet of the Apostles .
44005003	But Peter said : “ Ananias , why has Satan tempted your heart , so that you would lie to the Holy Spirit and be deceitful about the price of the land ?
44005004	Did it not belong to you while you retained it ? And having sold it , was it not in your power ? Why have you set this thing in your heart ? You have not lied to men , but to God ! ”
44005005	Then Ananias , upon hearing these words , fell down and expired . And a great fear overwhelmed all who heard of it .
44005006	And the young men rose up and removed him ; and carrying him out , they buried him .
44005007	Then about the space of three hours passed , and his wife entered , not knowing what had happened .
44005008	And Peter said to her , “ Tell me , woman , if you sold the field for this amount ? ” And she said , “ Yes , for that amount . ”
44005009	And Peter said to her : “ Why have you agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord ? Behold , the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door , and they shall carry you out ! ”
44005010	Immediately , she fell down before his feet and expired . Then the young men entered and found her dead . And they carried her out and buried her next to her husband .
44005011	And a great fear came over the entire Church and over all who heard these things .
44005012	And through the hands of the Apostles many signs and wonders were accomplished among the people . And they all met with one accord at Solomon’s portico .
44005013	And among the others , no one dared to join himself to them . But the people magnified them .
44005014	Now the multitude of men and women who believed in the Lord was ever increasing ,
44005015	so much so that they laid the infirm in the streets , placing them on beds and stretchers , so that , as Peter arrived , at least his shadow might fall upon any one of them , and they would be freed from their infirmities .
44005016	But a multitude also hurried to Jerusalem from the neighboring cities , carrying the sick and those troubled by unclean spirits , who were all healed .
44005017	Then the high priest and all those who were with him , that is , the heretical sect of the Sadducees , rose up and were filled with jealousy .
44005018	And they laid hands on the Apostles , and they placed them in the common prison .
44005019	But in the night , an Angel of the Lord opened the doors of the prison and led them out , saying ,
44005020	“ Go and stand in the temple , speaking to the people all these words of life . ”
44005021	And when they had heard this , they entered the temple at first light , and they were teaching . Then the high priest , and those who were with him , approached , and they called together the council and all the elders of the sons of Israel . And they sent to the prison to have them brought .
44005022	But when the attendants had arrived , and , upon opening the prison , had not found them , they returned and reported to them ,
44005023	saying : “ We found the prison certainly locked up with all diligence , and the guards standing before the door . But upon opening it , we found no one within . ”
44005024	Then , when the magistrate of the temple and the chief priests heard these words , they were uncertain about them , as to what should happen .
44005025	But someone arrived and reported to them , “ Behold , the men whom you placed in prison are in the temple , standing and teaching the people . ”
44005026	Then the magistrate , with the attendants , went and brought them without force . For they were afraid of the people , lest they be stoned .
44005027	And when they had brought them , they stood them before the council . And the high priest questioned them ,
44005028	and said : “ We strongly order you not to teach in this name . For behold , you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine , and you wish to bring the blood of this man upon us . ”
44005029	But Peter and the Apostles responded by saying : “ It is necessary to obey God , more so than men .
44005030	The God of our fathers has raised up Jesus , whom you put to death by hanging him on a tree .
44005031	It is he whom God has exalted at his right hand as Ruler and Savior , so as to offer repentance and the remission of sins to Israel .
44005032	And we are witnesses of these things , with the Holy Spirit , whom God has given to all who are obedient to him . ”
44005033	When they had heard these things , they were deeply wounded , and they were planning to put them to death .
44005034	But someone in the council , a Pharisee named Gamaliel , a teacher of the law honored by all the people , rose up and ordered the men to be put outside briefly .
44005035	And he said to them : “ Men of Israel , you should be careful in your intentions about these men .
44005036	For before these days , Theudas stepped forward , asserting himself to be someone , and a number of men , about four hundred , joined with him . But he was killed , and all who believed in him were scattered , and they were reduced to nothing .
44005037	After this one , Judas the Galilean stepped forward , in the days of the enrollment , and he turned the people toward himself . But he also perished , and all of them , as many as had joined with him , were dispersed .
44005038	And now therefore , I say to you , withdraw from these men and leave them alone . For if this counsel or work is of men , it will be broken .
44005039	Yet truly , if it is of God , you will not be able to break it , and perhaps you might be found to have fought against God . ” And they agreed with him .
44005040	And calling in the Apostles , having beaten them , they warned them not to speak at all in the name of Jesus . And they dismissed them .
44005041	And indeed , they went forth from the presence of the council , rejoicing that they were considered worthy to suffer insult on behalf of the name of Jesus .
44005042	And every day , in the temple and among the houses , they did not cease to teach and to evangelize Christ Jesus .
44006001	In those days , as the number of disciples was increasing , there occurred a murmuring of the Greeks against the Hebrews , because their widows were treated with disdain in the daily ministration .
44006002	And so the twelve , calling together the multitude of the disciples , said : “ It is not fair for us to leave behind the Word of God to serve at tables also .
44006003	Therefore , brothers , search among yourselves for seven men of good testimony , filled with the Holy Spirit and with wisdom , whom we may appoint over this work .
44006004	Yet truly , we will be continually in prayer and in the ministry of the Word . ”
44006005	And the plan pleased the entire multitude . And they chose Stephen , a man filled with faith and with the Holy Spirit , and Philip and Prochorus and Nicanor and Timon and Parmenas and Nicolas , a new arrival from Antioch .
44006006	These they set before the sight of the Apostles , and while praying , they imposed hands on them .
44006007	And the Word of the Lord was increasing , and the number of disciples in Jerusalem was multiplied exceedingly . And even a large group of the priests were obedient to the faith .
44006008	Then Stephen , filled with grace and fortitude , wrought great signs and miracles among the people .
44006009	But certain ones , from the synagogue of the so-called Libertines , and of the Cyrenians , and of the Alexandrians , and of those who were from Cilicia and Asia rose up and were disputing with Stephen .
44006010	But they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit with which he was speaking .
44006011	Then they suborned men who were to claim that they had heard him speaking words of blasphemy against Moses and against God .
44006012	And thus did they stir up the people and the elders and the scribes . And hurrying together , they seized him and brought him to the council .
44006013	And they set up false witnesses , who said : “ This man does not cease to speak words against the holy place and the law .
44006014	For we have heard him saying that this Jesus the Nazarene will destroy this place and will change the traditions , which Moses handed down to us . ”
44006015	And all those who were sitting in the council , gazing at him , saw his face , as if it had become the face of an Angel .
44007001	Then the high priest said , “ Are these things so ? ”
44007002	And Stephen said : “ Noble brothers and fathers , listen . The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham , when he was in Mesopotamia , before he stayed in Haran .
44007003	And God said to him , ‘ Depart from your country and from your kindred , and go into the land that I will show to you . ’
44007004	Then he went away from the land of the Chaldeans , and he lived at Haran . And later , after his father was dead , God brought him into this land , in which you now dwell .
44007005	And he gave him no inheritance in it , not even the space of one step . But he promised to give it to him as a possession , and to his offspring after him , though he did not have a son .
44007006	Then God told him that his offspring would be a settler in a foreign land , and that they would subjugate them , and treat them badly , for four hundred years .
44007007	‘ And the nation whom they will serve , I will judge , ’ said the Lord . ‘ And after these things , they shall depart and shall serve me in this place . ’
44007008	And he gave him the covenant of circumcision . And so he conceived Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day . And Isaac conceived Jacob , and Jacob , the twelve Patriarchs .
44007009	And the Patriarchs , being jealous , sold Joseph into Egypt . But God was with him .
44007010	And he rescued him from all his tribulations . And he gave him grace and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh , the king of Egypt . And he appointed him as governor over Egypt and over all his house .
44007011	Then a famine occurred in all of Egypt and Canaan , and a great tribulation . And our fathers did not find food .
44007012	But when Jacob had heard that there was grain in Egypt , he sent our fathers first .
44007013	And on the second occasion , Joseph was recognized by his brothers , and his ancestry was made manifest to Pharaoh .
44007014	Then Joseph sent for and brought his father Jacob , with all his kindred , seventy-five souls .
44007015	And Jacob descended into Egypt , and he passed away , and so did our fathers .
44007016	And they crossed over into Shechem , and they were placed in the sepulcher which Abraham bought for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor , the son of Shechem .
44007017	And when the time of the Promise that God had revealed to Abraham drew near , the people increased and were multiplied in Egypt ,
44007018	even until another king , who did not know Joseph , rose up in Egypt .
44007019	This one , encompassing our kindred , afflicted our fathers , so that they would expose their infants , lest they be kept alive .
44007020	In the same time , Moses was born . And he was in the grace of God , and he was nourished for three months in the house of his father .
44007021	Then , having been abandoned , the daughter of Pharaoh took him in , and she raised him as her own son .
44007022	And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians . And he was mighty in his words and in his deeds .
44007023	But when forty years of age were completed in him , it rose up in his heart that he should visit his brothers , the sons of Israel .
44007024	And when he had seen a certain one suffering injury , he defended him . And striking the Egyptian , he wrought a retribution for him who was enduring the injury .
44007025	Now he supposed that his brothers would understand that God would grant them salvation through his hand . But they did not understand it .
44007026	So truly , on the following day , he appeared before those who were arguing , and he would have reconciled them in peace , saying , ‘ Men , you are brothers . So why would you harm one another ? ’
44007027	But he who was causing the injury to his neighbor rejected him , saying : ‘ Who has appointed you as leader and judge over us ?
44007028	Could it be that you want to kill me , in the same way that you killed the Egyptian yesterday ? ’
44007029	Then , at this word , Moses fled . And he became a foreigner in the land of Midian , where he produced two sons .
44007030	And when forty years were completed , there appeared to him , in the desert of Mount Sinai , an Angel , in a flame of fire in a bush .
44007031	And upon seeing this , Moses was amazed at the sight . And as he drew near in order to gaze at it , the voice of the Lord came to him , saying :
44007032	‘ I am the God of your fathers : the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . ’ And Moses , being made to tremble , did not dare to look .
44007033	But the Lord said to him : ‘ Loosen the shoes from your feet . For the place in which you stand is holy ground .
44007034	Certainly , I have seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt , and I have heard their groaning . And so , I am coming down to free them . And now , go forth and I will send you into Egypt . ’
44007035	This Moses , whom they rejected by saying , ‘ Who has appointed you as leader and judge ? ’ is the one God sent to be leader and redeemer , by the hand of the Angel who appeared to him in the bush .
44007036	This man led them out , accomplishing signs and wonders in the land of Egypt , and at the Red Sea , and in the desert , for forty years .
44007037	This is Moses , who said to the sons of Israel : ‘ God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your own brothers . You shall listen to him . ’
44007038	This is he who was in the Church in the wilderness , with the Angel who was speaking to him on Mount Sinai , and with our fathers . It is he who received the words of life to give to us .
44007039	It is he whom our fathers were not willing to obey . Instead , they rejected him , and in their hearts they turned away toward Egypt ,
44007040	saying to Aaron : ‘ Make gods for us , which may go before us . For this Moses , who led us away from the land of Egypt , we do not know what has happened to him . ’
44007041	And so they fashioned a calf in those days , and they offered sacrifices to an idol , and they rejoiced in the works of their own hands .
44007042	Then God turned , and he handed them over , to subservience to the armies of heaven , just as it was written in the Book of the Prophets : ‘ Did you not offer victims and sacrifices to me for forty years in the desert , O house of Israel ?
44007043	And yet you took up for yourselves the tabernacle of Moloch and the star of your god Rephan , figures which you yourselves formed in order to adore them . And so I will carry you away , beyond Babylon . ’
44007044	The tabernacle of the testimony was with our fathers in the desert , just as God ordained for them , speaking to Moses , so that he would make it according to the form that he had seen .
44007045	But our fathers , receiving it , also brought it , with Joshua , into the land of the Gentiles , whom God expelled before the face of our fathers , even until the days of David ,
44007046	who found grace before God and who asked that he might obtain a tabernacle for the God of Jacob .
44007047	But it was Solomon who built a house for him .
44007048	Yet the Most High does not live in houses built by hands , just as he said through the prophet :
44007049	‘ Heaven is my throne , and the earth is my footstool . What kind of house would you build for me ? says the Lord . And which is my resting place ?
44007050	Has not my hand made all these things ? ’
44007051	Stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears , you ever resist the Holy Spirit . Just as your fathers did , so also do you do .
44007052	Which of the Prophets have your fathers not persecuted ? And they killed those who foretold the advent of the Just One . And you have now become the betrayers and murderers of him .
44007053	You received the law by the actions of Angels , and yet you have not kept it . ”
44007054	Then , upon hearing these things , they were deeply wounded in their hearts , and they gnashed their teeth at him .
44007055	But he , being filled with the Holy Spirit , and gazing intently toward heaven , saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God .
44007056	And he said , “ Behold , I see the heavens opened , and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God . ”
44007057	Then they , crying out with a loud voice , blocked their ears and , with one accord , rushed violently toward him .
44007058	And driving him out , beyond the city , they stoned him . And witnesses placed their garments beside the feet of a youth , who was called Saul .
44007059	And as they were stoning Stephen , he called out and said , “ Lord Jesus , receive my spirit . ”
44007060	Then , having been brought to his knees , he cried out with a loud voice , saying , “ Lord , do not hold this sin against them . ” And when he had said this , he fell asleep in the Lord . And Saul was consenting to his murder .
44008001	Now in those days , there occurred a great persecution against the Church at Jerusalem . And they were all dispersed throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria , except the Apostles .
44008002	But God-fearing men arranged for Stephen’s funeral , and they made a great mourning over him .
44008003	Then Saul was laying waste to the Church by entering throughout the houses , and dragging away men and women , and committing them to prison .
44008004	Therefore , those who had been dispersed were traveling around , evangelizing the Word of God .
44008005	Now Philip , descending to a city of Samaria , was preaching Christ to them .
44008006	And the crowd was listening intently and with one accord to those things which were being said by Philip , and they were watching the signs which he was accomplishing .
44008007	For many of them had unclean spirits , and , crying out with a loud voice , these departed from them .
44008008	And many of the paralytics and the lame were cured .
44008009	Therefore , there was great gladness in that city . Now there was a certain man named Simon , who formerly had been a magician in that city , seducing the people of Samaria , claiming himself to be someone great .
44008010	And to all those who would listen , from the least even to the greatest , he was saying : “ Here is the power of God , which is called great . ”
44008011	And they were attentive to him because , for a long time , he had deluded them with his magic .
44008012	Yet truly , once they had believed Philip , who was evangelizing the kingdom of God , both men and women were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ .
44008013	Then Simon himself also believed and , when he had been baptized , he adhered to Philip . And now , seeing also the greatest signs and miracles being wrought , he was amazed and stupefied .
44008014	Now when the Apostles who were in Jerusalem had heard that Samaria had received the Word of God , they sent Peter and John to them .
44008015	And when they had arrived , they prayed for them , so that they might receive the Holy Spirit .
44008016	For he had not yet come to any among them , since they were only baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus .
44008017	Then they laid their hands on them , and they received the Holy Spirit .
44008018	But when Simon had seen that , by the imposition of the hands of the Apostles , the Holy Spirit was given , he offered them money ,
44008019	saying , “ Give this power to me also , so that on whomever I will lay my hands , he may receive the Holy Spirit . ” But Peter said to him :
44008020	“ Let your money be with you in perdition , for you have supposed that a gift of God might be possessed by money .
44008021	There is no part or place for you in this matter . For your heart is not upright in the sight of God .
44008022	And so , repent from this , your wickedness , and beg God , so that perhaps this plan of your heart might be forgiven you .
44008023	For I perceive you to be in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity . ”
44008024	Then Simon responded by saying , “ Pray for me to the Lord , so that nothing of what you have said may happen to me . ”
44008025	And indeed , after testifying and speaking the Word of the Lord , they returned to Jerusalem , and they evangelized the many regions of the Samaritans .
44008026	Now an Angel of the Lord spoke to Philip , saying , “ Rise up and go toward the south , to the way which descends from Jerusalem into Gaza , where there is a desert . ”
44008027	And rising up , he went . And behold , an Ethiopian man , a eunuch , powerful under Candace , the queen of the Ethiopians , who was over all her treasures , had arrived in Jerusalem to worship .
44008028	And while returning , he was sitting upon his chariot and reading from the prophet Isaiah .
44008029	Then the Spirit said to Philip , “ Draw near and join yourself to this chariot . ”
44008030	And Philip , hurrying , heard him reading from the prophet Isaiah , and he said , “ Do you think that you understand what you are reading ? ”
44008031	And he said , “ But how can I , unless someone will have revealed it to me ? ” And he asked Philip to climb up and sit with him .
44008032	Now the place in Scripture that he was reading was this : “ Like a sheep he was led to the slaughter . And like a lamb silent before his shearer , so he opened not his mouth .
44008033	He endured his judgment with humility . Who of his generation shall describe how his life was taken away from the earth ? ”
44008034	Then the eunuch responded to Philip , saying : “ I beg you , about whom is the prophet saying this ? About himself , or about someone else ? ”
44008035	Then Philip , opening his mouth and beginning from this Scripture , evangelized Jesus to him .
44008036	And while they were going along the way , they arrived at a certain water source . And the eunuch said : “ There is water . What would prevent me from being baptized ? ”
44008037	Then Philip said , “ If you believe from your whole heart , it is permitted . ” And he responded by saying , “ I believe the Son of God to be Jesus the Christ . ”
44008038	And he ordered the chariot to stand still . And both Philip and the eunuch descended into the water . And he baptized him .
44008039	And when they had ascended from the water , the Spirit of the Lord took Philip away , and the eunuch did not see him anymore . Then he went on his way , rejoicing .
44008040	Now Philip was found in Azotus . And continuing on , he evangelized all the cities , until he arrived in Caesarea .
44009001	Now Saul , still breathing threats and beatings against the disciples of the Lord , went to the high priest ,
44009002	and he petitioned him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus , so that , if he found any men or women belonging to this Way , he could lead them as prisoners to Jerusalem .
44009003	And as he made the journey , it happened that he was approaching Damascus . And suddenly , a light from heaven shone around him .
44009004	And falling to the ground , he heard a voice saying to him , “ Saul , Saul , why are you persecuting me ? ”
44009005	And he said , “ Who are you , Lord ? ” And he : “ I am Jesus , whom you are persecuting . It is hard for you to kick against the goad . ”
44009006	And he , trembling and astonished , said , “ Lord , what do you want me to do ? ”
44009007	And the Lord said to him , “ Rise up and go into the city , and there you will be told what you ought to do . ” Now the men who were accompanying him were standing stupefied , hearing indeed a voice , but seeing no one .
44009008	Then Saul rose up from the ground . And upon opening his eyes , he saw nothing . So leading him by the hand , they brought him into Damascus .
44009009	And in that place , he was without sight for three days , and he neither ate nor drank .
44009010	Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus , named Ananias . And the Lord said to him in a vision , “ Ananias ! ” And he said , “ Here I am , Lord . ”
44009011	And the Lord said to him : “ Rise up and go into the street that is called Straight , and seek , in the house of Judas , the one named Saul of Tarsus . For behold , he is praying . ”
44009012	( And Paul saw a man named Ananias entering and imposing hands upon him , so that he might receive his sight . )
44009013	But Ananias responded : “ Lord , I have heard from many about this man , how much harm he has done to your saints in Jerusalem .
44009014	And he has authority here from the leaders of the priests to bind all who invoke your name . ”
44009015	Then the Lord said to him : “ Go , for this one is an instrument chosen by me to convey my name before nations and kings and the sons of Israel .
44009016	For I will reveal to him how much he must suffer on behalf of my name . ”
44009017	And Ananias departed . And he entered the house . And laying his hands upon him , he said : “ Brother Saul , the Lord Jesus , he who appeared to you on the way by which you arrived , sent me so that you would receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit . ”
44009018	And immediately , it was as if scales had fallen from his eyes , and he received his sight . And rising up , he was baptized .
44009019	And when he had taken a meal , he was strengthened . Now he was with the disciples who were at Damascus for some days .
44009020	And he was continuously preaching Jesus in the synagogues : that he is the Son of God .
44009021	And all who heard him were astonished , and they said , “ Is this not the one who , in Jerusalem , was fighting against those invoking this name , and who came here for this : so that he might lead them away to the leaders of the priests ? ”
44009022	But Saul was increasing to a greater extent in ability , and so he was confounding the Jews who lived at Damascus , by affirming that he is the Christ .
44009023	And when many days were completed , the Jews took counsel as one , so that they might put him to death .
44009024	But their treachery became known to Saul . Now they were also watching the gates , day and night , so that they might put him to death .
44009025	But the disciples , taking him away by night , sent him over the wall by letting him down in a basket .
44009026	And when he had arrived in Jerusalem , he attempted to join himself to the disciples . And they were all afraid of him , not believing that he was a disciple .
44009027	But Barnabas took him aside and led him to the Apostles . And he explained to them how he had seen the Lord , and that he had spoken to him , and how , in Damascus , he had acted faithfully in the name of Jesus .
44009028	And he was with them , entering and departing Jerusalem , and acting faithfully in the name of the Lord .
44009029	He also was speaking with the Gentiles and disputing with the Greeks . But they were seeking to kill him .
44009030	And when the brothers had realized this , they brought him to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus .
44009031	Certainly , the Church had peace throughout all of Judea and Galilee and Samaria , and it was being built up , while walking in the fear of the Lord , and it was being filled with the consolation of the Holy Spirit .
44009032	Then it happened that Peter , as he traveled around everywhere , came to the saints who were living at Lydda .
44009033	But he found there a certain man , named Aeneas , who was a paralytic , who had lain in bed for eight years .
44009034	And Peter said to him : “ Aeneas , the Lord Jesus Christ heals you . Rise up and arrange your bed . ” And immediately he rose up .
44009035	And all who were living in Lydda and Sharon saw him , and they were converted to the Lord .
44009036	Now in Joppa there was a certain disciple named Tabitha , which in translation is called Dorcas . She was filled with the good works and almsgiving that she was accomplishing .
44009037	And it happened that , in those days , she became ill and died . And when they had washed her , they laid her in an upper room .
44009038	Now since Lydda was close to Joppa , the disciples , upon hearing that Peter was there , sent two men to him , asking him : “ Do not be slow in coming to us . ”
44009039	Then Peter , rising up , went with them . And when he had arrived , they led him to an upper room . And all the widows were standing around him , weeping and showing him the tunics and garments that Dorcas had made for them .
44009040	And when they had all been sent outside , Peter , kneeling down , prayed . And turning to the body , he said : “ Tabitha , arise . ” And she opened her eyes and , upon seeing Peter , sat up again .
44009041	And offering her his hand , he lifted her up . And when he had called in the saints and the widows , he presented her alive .
44009042	Now this became known throughout all of Joppa . And many believed in the Lord .
44009043	And it happened that he resided for many days in Joppa , with a certain Simon , a tanner .
44010001	Now there was a certain man in Caesarea , named Cornelius , a centurion of the cohort which is called Italian ,
44010002	a devout man , fearing God with all his house , giving many alms to the people , and praying to God continually .
44010003	This man saw in a vision clearly , at about the ninth hour of the day , the Angel of God entering to him and saying to him : “ Cornelius ! ”
44010004	And he , gazing at him , was seized by fear , and he said , “ What is it , lord ? ” And he said to him : “ Your prayers and your almsgiving have ascended as a memorial in the sight of God .
44010005	And now , send men to Joppa and summon a certain Simon , who is surnamed Peter .
44010006	This man is a guest with a certain Simon , a tanner , whose house is beside the sea . He will tell you what you must do . ”
44010007	And when the Angel who was speaking to him had departed , he called , out of those who were subject to him , two of his household servants and a soldier who feared the Lord .
44010008	And when he had explained everything to them , he sent them to Joppa .
44010009	Then , on the following day , while they were making the journey and approaching the city , Peter ascended to the upper rooms , so that he might pray , at about the sixth hour .
44010010	And since he was hungry , he wanted to enjoy some food . Then , as they were preparing it , an ecstasy of mind fell over him .
44010011	And he saw heaven opened , and a certain container descending , as if a great linen sheet were let down , by its four corners , from heaven to earth ,
44010012	on which were all four-footed beasts , and the crawling things of the earth and the flying things of the air .
44010013	And a voice came to him : “ Rise up , Peter ! Kill and eat . ”
44010014	But Peter said : “ Far be it from me , lord . For I have never eaten anything common or unclean . ”
44010015	And the voice , again a second time to him : “ What God has purified , you shall not call common . ”
44010016	Now this was done three times . And immediately the container was taken up to heaven .
44010017	Now while Peter was still hesitant within himself as to what the vision , which he had seen , might mean , behold , the men who had been sent from Cornelius stood at the gate , inquiring about Simon’s house .
44010018	And when they had called out , they asked if Simon , who is surnamed Peter , was a guest in that place .
44010019	Then , as Peter was thinking about the vision , the Spirit said to him , “ Behold , three men seek you .
44010020	And so , rise up , descend , and go with them , doubting nothing . For I have sent them . ”
44010021	Then Peter , descending to the men , said : “ Behold , I am the one whom you seek . What is the reason for which you have arrived ? ”
44010022	And they said : “ Cornelius , a centurion , a just and God-fearing man , who has good testimony from the entire nation of the Jews , received a message from a holy Angel to summon you to his house and to listen to words from you . ”
44010023	Therefore , leading them in , he received them as guests . Then , on following the day , rising up , he set out with them . And some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him .
44010024	And on the next day , he entered Caesarea . And truly , Cornelius was waiting for them , having called together his family and closest friends .
44010025	And it happened that , when Peter had entered , Cornelius went to meet him . And falling before his feet , he reverenced .
44010026	Yet truly , Peter , lifting him up , said : “ Rise up , for I also am only a man . ”
44010027	And speaking with him , he entered , and he found many who had gathered together .
44010028	And he said to them : “ You know how abominable it would be for a Jewish man to be joined with , or to be added to , a foreign people . But God has revealed to me to call no man common or unclean .
44010029	Because of this and without doubt , I came when summoned . Therefore , I ask you , for what reason have you summoned me ? ”
44010030	And Cornelius said : “ It is now the fourth day , to this very hour , since I was praying in my house at the ninth hour , and behold , a man stood before me in a white vestment , and he said :
44010031	‘ Cornelius , your prayer has been heard and your almsgiving has been remembered in the sight of God .
44010032	Therefore , send to Joppa and summon Simon , who is surnamed Peter . This man is a guest in the house of Simon , a tanner , near the sea . ’
44010033	And so , I promptly sent for you . And you have done well in coming here . Therefore , all of us are now present in your sight to hear all the things that were taught to you by the Lord . ”
44010034	Then , Peter , opening his mouth , said : “ I have concluded in truth that God is not a respecter of persons .
44010035	But within every nation , whoever fears him and works justice is acceptable to him .
44010036	God sent the Word to the sons of Israel , announcing the peace through Jesus Christ , for he is the Lord of all .
44010037	You know that the Word has been made known throughout all Judea . For beginning from Galilee , after the baptism which John preached ,
44010038	Jesus of Nazareth , whom God anointed with the Holy Spirit and with power , traveled around doing good and healing all those oppressed by the devil . For God was with him .
44010039	And we are witnesses of all that he did in the region of Judea and in Jerusalem , he whom they killed by hanging him on a tree .
44010040	God raised him up on the third day and permitted him to be made manifest ,
44010041	not to all the people , but to the witnesses preordained by God , to those of us who ate and drank with him after he rose again from the dead .
44010042	And he instructed us to preach to the people , and to testify that he is the One who was appointed by God to be the judge of the living and of the dead .
44010043	To him all the Prophets offer testimony that through his name all who believe in him receive the remission of sins . ”
44010044	While Peter was still speaking these words , the Holy Spirit fell over all of those who were listening to the Word .
44010045	And the faithful of the circumcision , who had arrived with Peter , were astonished that the grace of the Holy Spirit was also poured out upon the Gentiles .
44010046	For they heard them speaking in tongues and magnifying God .
44010047	Then Peter responded , “ How could anyone prohibit water , so that those who have received the Holy Spirit would not be baptized , just as we also have been ? ”
44010048	And he ordered them to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ . Then they begged him to remain with them for some days .
44011001	Now the Apostles and brothers who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also received the Word of God .
44011002	Then , when Peter had gone up to Jerusalem , those who were of the circumcision argued against him ,
44011003	saying , “ Why did you enter to uncircumcised men , and why did you eat with them ? ”
44011004	And Peter began to explain to them , in an orderly manner , saying :
44011005	“ I was in the city of Joppa praying , and I saw , in an ecstasy of mind , a vision : a certain container descending , like a great linen sheet being let down from heaven by its four corners . And it drew near to me .
44011006	And looking into it , I considered and saw the four-footed beasts of the earth , and the wild beasts , and the reptiles , and the flying things of the air .
44011007	Then I also heard a voice saying to me : ‘ Rise up , Peter . Kill and eat . ’
44011008	But I said : ‘ Never , lord ! For what is common or unclean has never entered into my mouth . ’
44011009	Then the voice responded a second time from heaven , ‘ What God has cleansed , you shall not call common . ’
44011010	Now this was done three times . And then everything was taken up again into heaven .
44011011	And behold , immediately there were three men standing near the house where I was , having been sent to me from Caesarea .
44011012	Then the Spirit told me that I should go with them , doubting nothing . And these six brothers went with me also . And we entered into the house of the man .
44011013	And he described for us how he had seen an Angel in his house , standing and saying to him : ‘ Send to Joppa and summon Simon , who is surnamed Peter .
44011014	And he shall speak to you words , by which you shall be saved with your whole house . ’
44011015	And when I had begun to speak , the Holy Spirit fell upon them , just as upon us also , in the beginning .
44011016	Then I remembered the words of the Lord , just as he himself said : ‘ John , indeed , baptized with water , but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit . ’
44011017	Therefore , if God gave them the same grace , as also to us , who have believed in the Lord Jesus Christ , who was I , that I would be able to prohibit God ? ”
44011018	Having heard these things , they were silent . And they glorified God , saying : “ So has God also given to the Gentiles repentance unto life . ”
44011019	And some of them , having been dispersed by the persecution that had occurred under Stephen , traveled around , even to Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch , speaking the Word to no one , except to Jews only .
44011020	But some of these men from Cyprus and Cyrene , when they had entered into Antioch , were speaking also to the Greeks , announcing the Lord Jesus .
44011021	And the hand of the Lord was with them . And a great number believed and were converted to the Lord .
44011022	Now the news came to the ears of the Church at Jerusalem about these things , and they sent Barnabas as far as Antioch .
44011023	And when he had arrived there and had seen the grace of God , he was gladdened . And he exhorted them all to continue in the Lord with a resolute heart .
44011024	For he was a good man , and he was filled with the Holy Spirit and with faith . And a great multitude was added to the Lord .
44011025	Then Barnabas set out for Tarsus , so that he might seek Saul . And when he had found him , he brought him to Antioch .
44011026	And they were conversing there in the Church for an entire year . And they taught such a great multitude , that it was at Antioch that the disciples were first known by the name of Christian .
44011027	Now in these days , prophets from Jerusalem went over to Antioch .
44011028	And one of them , named Agabus , rising up , signified through the Spirit that there was going to be a great famine over the entire world , which did happen under Claudius .
44011029	Then the disciples declared , according to what each one possessed , what they would offer to be sent to the brothers living in Judea .
44011030	And so they did , sending it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul .
44012001	Now at the same time , king Herod extended his hand , in order to afflict some from the Church .
44012002	Then he killed James , the brother of John , with the sword .
44012003	And seeing that it pleased the Jews , he set out next to apprehend Peter also . Now it was the days of Unleavened Bread .
44012004	So when he had apprehended him , he sent him into prison , handing him over into the custody of four groups of four soldiers , intending to produce him to the people after the Passover .
44012005	And so Peter was detained in prison . But prayers were being made without ceasing , by the Church , to God on his behalf .
44012006	And when Herod was ready to produce him , in that same night , Peter was sleeping between two soldiers , and was bound with two chains . And there were guards in front of the door , guarding the prison .
44012007	And behold , an Angel of the Lord stood near , and a light shined forth in the cell . And tapping Peter on the side , he awakened him , saying , “ Rise up , quickly . ” And the chains fell from his hands .
44012008	Then the Angel said to him : “ Dress yourself , and put on your boots . ” And he did so . And he said to him , “ Wrap your garment around yourself and follow me . ”
44012009	And going out , he followed him . And he did not know this truth : that this was being done by an Angel . For he thought that he was seeing a vision .
44012010	And passing by the first and second guards , they came to the iron gate which leads into the city ; and it opened for them by itself . And departing , they continued on along a certain side street . And suddenly the Angel withdrew from him .
44012011	And Peter , returning to himself , said : “ Now I know , truly , that the Lord sent his Angel , and that he rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the people of the Jews were anticipating . ”
44012012	And as he was considering this , he arrived at the house of Mary , the mother of John , who was surnamed Mark , where many were gathered and were praying .
44012013	Then , as he knocked at the door of the gate , a girl went out to answer , whose name was Rhoda .
44012014	And when she recognized the voice of Peter , out of joy , she did not open the gate , but instead , running in , she reported that Peter stood before the gate .
44012015	But they said to her , “ You are crazy . ” But she reaffirmed that this was so . Then they were saying , “ It is his angel . ”
44012016	But Peter was persevering in knocking . And when they had opened , they saw him and were astonished .
44012017	But motioning to them with his hand to be silent , he explained how the Lord had led him away from prison . And he said , “ Inform James and those brothers . ” And going out , he went away to another place .
44012018	Then , when daylight came , there was no small commotion among the soldiers , as to what had happened concerning Peter .
44012019	And when Herod had requested him and did not obtain him , having had the guards interrogated , he ordered them led away . And descending from Judea into Caesarea , he lodged there .
44012020	Now he was angry with those of Tyre and Sidon . But they came to him with one accord , and , having persuaded Blastus , who was over the bedchamber of the king , they petitioned for peace , because their regions were supplied with food by him .
44012021	Then , on the appointed day , Herod was clothed in kingly apparel , and he sat in the judgment seat , and he gave a speech to them .
44012022	Then the people were crying out , “ The voice of a god , and not of a man ! ”
44012023	And immediately , an Angel of the Lord struck him down , because he had not given honor to God . And having been consumed by worms , he expired .
44012024	But the word of the Lord was increasing and multiplying .
44012025	Then Barnabas and Saul , having completed the ministry , returned from Jerusalem , bringing with them John , who was surnamed Mark .
44013001	Now there were , in the Church at Antioch , prophets and teachers , among whom were Barnabas , and Simon , who was called the Black , and Lucius of Cyrene , and Manahen , who was the foster brother of Herod the tetrarch , and Saul .
44013002	Now as they were ministering for the Lord and fasting , the Holy Spirit said to them : “ Separate Saul and Barnabas for me , for the work for which I have selected them . ”
44013003	Then , fasting and praying and imposing their hands upon them , they sent them away .
44013004	And having been sent by the Holy Spirit , they went to Seleucia . And from there they sailed to Cyprus .
44013005	And when they had arrived at Salamis , they were preaching the Word of God in the synagogues of the Jews . And they also had John in the ministry .
44013006	And when they had traveled throughout the entire island , even to Paphos , they found a certain man , a magician , a false prophet , a Jew , whose name was Bar-Jesu .
44013007	And he was with the proconsul , Sergius Paulus , a prudent man . This man , summoning Barnabas and Saul , wanted to hear the Word of God .
44013008	But Elymas the magician ( for so his name is translated ) stood against them , seeking to turn the proconsul away from the Faith .
44013009	Then Saul , who is also called Paul , having been filled with the Holy Spirit , looked intently at him ,
44013010	and he said : “ So full of every deceit and of all falsehoods , son of the devil , enemy of all justice , you never cease to subvert the righteous ways of the Lord !
44013011	And now , behold , the hand of the Lord is upon you . And you will be blinded , not seeing the sun for a length of time . ” And immediately a fog and a darkness fell over him . And wandering around , he was seeking someone who might lead him by the hand .
44013012	Then the proconsul , when he had seen what was done , believed , being in wonder over the doctrine of the Lord .
44013013	And when Paul and those who were with him had sailed from Paphos , they arrived at Perga in Pamphylia . Then John departed from them and returned to Jerusalem .
44013014	Yet truly , they , traveling on from Perga , arrived at Antioch in Pisidia . And upon entering the synagogue on the Sabbath day , they sat down .
44013015	Then , after the reading from the Law and the Prophets , the leaders of the synagogue sent to them , saying : “ Noble brothers , if there is in you any word of exhortation to the people , speak . ”
44013016	Then Paul , rising up and motioning for silence with his hand , said : “ Men of Israel and you who fear God , listen closely .
44013017	The God of the people of Israel chose our fathers , and exalted the people , when they were settlers in the land of Egypt . And with an exalted arm , he led them away from there .
44013018	And throughout a time of forty years , he endured their behavior in the desert .
44013019	And by destroying seven nations in the land of Canaan , he divided their land among them by lot ,
44013020	after about four hundred and fifty years . And after these things , he gave them judges , even until the prophet Samuel .
44013021	And later on , they petitioned for a king . And God gave them Saul , the son of Kish , a man from the tribe of Benjamin , for forty years .
44013022	And having removed him , he raised up for them king David . And offering testimony about him , he said , ‘ I have found David , the son of Jesse , to be a man according to my own heart , who will accomplish all that I will . ’
44013023	From his offspring , according to the Promise , God has brought Jesus the Savior to Israel .
44013024	John was preaching , before the face of his advent , a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel .
44013025	Then , when John completed his course , he was saying : ‘ I am not the one you consider me to be . For behold , one arrives after me , the shoes of whose feet I am not worthy to loosen . ’
44013026	Noble brothers , sons of the stock of Abraham , and those among you who fear God , it is to you the Word of this salvation has been sent .
44013027	For those who were living in Jerusalem , and its rulers , heeding neither him , nor the voices of the Prophets that are read on every Sabbath , fulfilled these by judging him .
44013028	And although they found no case for death against him , they petitioned Pilate , so that they might put him to death .
44013029	And when they had fulfilled everything that had been written about him , taking him down from the tree , they placed him in a tomb .
44013030	Yet truly , God raised him up from the dead on the third day .
44013031	And he was seen for many days by those who went up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem , who even now are his witnesses to the people .
44013032	And we are announcing to you that the Promise , which was made to our fathers ,
44013033	has been fulfilled by God for our children by raising up Jesus , just as it has been written in the second Psalm also : ‘ You are my Son . This day I have begotten you . ’
44013034	Now , since he raised him from the dead , so as to no longer return to corruption , he has said this : ‘ I will give to you the holy things of David , the faithful one . ’
44013035	And also then , in another place , he says : ‘ You will not allow your Holy One to see corruption . ’
44013036	For David , when he had ministered to his generation in accordance with the will of God , fell asleep , and he was placed next to his fathers , and he saw corruption .
44013037	Yet truly , he whom God has raised from the dead has not seen corruption .
44013038	Therefore , let it be known to you , noble brothers , that through him is announced to you remission from sins and from everything by which you were not able to be justified in the law of Moses .
44013039	In him , all who believe are justified .
44013040	Therefore , be careful , lest what was said by the Prophets may overwhelm you :
44013041	‘ You despisers ! Look , and wonder , and be scattered ! For I am working a deed in your days , a deed which you would not believe , even if someone were to explain it to you . ’ ”
44013042	Then , as they were departing , they asked them if , on the following Sabbath , they might speak these words to them .
44013043	And when the synagogue had been dismissed , many among the Jews and the new worshipers were following Paul and Barnabas . And they , speaking to them , persuaded them to continue in the grace of God .
44013044	Yet truly , on the following Sabbath , nearly the entire city came together to hear the Word of God .
44013045	Then the Jews , seeing the crowds , were filled with envy , and they , blaspheming , contradicted the things that were being said by Paul .
44013046	Then Paul and Barnabas said firmly : “ It was necessary to speak the Word of God first to you . But because you reject it , and so judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life , behold , we turn to the Gentiles .
44013047	For so has the Lord instructed us : ‘ I have set you as a light to the Gentiles , so that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth . ’ ”
44013048	Then the Gentiles , upon hearing this , were gladdened , and they were glorifying the Word of the Lord . And as many as believed were preordained to eternal life .
44013049	Now the word of the Lord was disseminated throughout the entire region .
44013050	But the Jews incited some devout and honest women , and the leaders of the city . And they stirred up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas . And they drove them away from their parts .
44013051	But they , shaking the dust from their feet against them , went on to Iconium .
44013052	The disciples were likewise filled with gladness and with the Holy Spirit .
44014001	Now it happened in Iconium that they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews , and they spoke in such a way that a copious multitude of both Jews and Greeks believed .
44014002	Yet truly , the Jews who were unbelieving had incited and enflamed the souls of the Gentiles against the brothers .
44014003	And so , they remained for a long time , acting faithfully in the Lord , offering testimony to the Word of his grace , providing signs and wonders done by their hands .
44014004	Then the multitude of the city was divided . And certainly , some were with the Jews , yet truly others were with the Apostles .
44014005	Now when an assault had been planned by the Gentiles and the Jews with their leaders , so that they might treat them with contempt and stone them ,
44014006	they , realizing this , fled together to Lystra and Derbe , cities of Lycaonia , and to the entire surrounding region .
44014007	And they were evangelizing in that place .
44014008	And a certain man was sitting at Lystra , disabled in his feet , lame from his mother’s womb , who had never walked .
44014009	This man heard Paul speaking . And Paul , gazing at him intently , and perceiving that he had faith , so that he might be healed ,
44014010	said with a loud voice , “ Stand upright upon your feet ! ” And he leaped up and walked around .
44014011	But when the crowds had seen what Paul had done , they lifted up their voice in the Lycaonian language , saying , “ The gods , having taken the likenesses of men , have descended to us ! ”
44014012	And they called Barnabas , ‘ Jupiter , ’ yet truly they called Paul , ‘ Mercury , ’ because he was the lead speaker .
44014013	Also , the priest of Jupiter , who was outside the city , in front of the gate , bringing in oxen and garlands , was willing to offer sacrifice with the people .
44014014	And as soon as the Apostles , Barnabas and Paul , had heard this , tearing their tunics , they leapt into the crowd , crying out
44014015	and saying : “ Men , why would you do this ? We also are mortals , men like yourselves , preaching to you to be converted , from these vain things , to the living God , who made heaven and earth and the sea and all that is in them .
44014016	In previous generations , he permitted all nations to walk in their own ways .
44014017	But certainly , he did not leave himself without testimony , doing good from heaven , giving rains and fruitful seasons , filling their hearts with food and gladness . ”
44014018	And by saying these things , they were barely able to restrain the crowds from immolating to them .
44014019	Now certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium arrived there . And having persuaded the crowd , they stoned Paul and dragged him outside of the city , thinking him to be dead .
44014020	But as the disciples were standing around him , he got up and entered the city . And the next day , he set out with Barnabas for Derbe .
44014021	And when they had evangelized that city , and had taught many , they returned again to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch ,
44014022	strengthening the souls of the disciples , and exhorting them that they should remain always in the faith , and that it is necessary for us to enter into the kingdom of God through many tribulations .
44014023	And when they had established priests for them in each church , and had prayed with fasting , they commended them to the Lord , in whom they believed .
44014024	And traveling by way of Pisidia , they arrived in Pamphylia .
44014025	And having spoken the word of the Lord in Perga , they went down into Attalia .
44014026	And from there , they sailed to Antioch , where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work which they had now accomplished .
44014027	And when they had arrived and had gathered together the church , they related what great things God had done with them , and how he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles .
44014028	And they remained for no small amount of time with the disciples .
44015001	And certain ones , descending from Judea , were teaching the brothers , “ Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses , you cannot be saved . ”
44015002	Therefore , when Paul and Barnabas made no small uprising against them , they decided that Paul and Barnabas , and some from the opposing side , should go up to the Apostles and priests in Jerusalem concerning this question .
44015003	Therefore , being led by the church , they traveled through Phoenicia and Samaria , describing the conversion of the Gentiles . And they caused great joy among all the brothers .
44015004	And when they had arrived in Jerusalem , they were received by the church and the Apostles and the elders , reporting what great things God had done with them .
44015005	But some from the sect of the Pharisees , those who were believers , rose up saying , “ It is necessary for them to be circumcised and to be instructed to keep the Law of Moses . ”
44015006	And the Apostles and elders came together to take care of this matter .
44015007	And after a great contention had taken place , Peter rose up and said to them : “ Noble brothers , you know that , in recent days , God has chosen from among us , by my mouth , Gentiles to hear the word of the Gospel and to believe .
44015008	And God , who knows hearts , offered testimony , by giving the Holy Spirit to them , just as to us .
44015009	And he distinguished nothing between us and them , purifying their hearts by faith .
44015010	Now therefore , why do you tempt God to impose a yoke upon the necks of the disciples , which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear ?
44015011	But by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ , we believe in order to be saved , in the same manner also as them . ”
44015012	Then the entire multitude was silent . And they were listening to Barnabas and Paul , describing what great signs and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles through them .
44015013	And after they had been silent , James responded by saying : “ Noble brothers , listen to me .
44015014	Simon has explained in what manner God first visited , so as to take from the Gentiles a people to his name .
44015015	And the words of the Prophets are in agreement with this , just as it was written :
44015016	‘ After these things , I will return , and I will rebuild the tabernacle of David , which has fallen down . And I will rebuild its ruins , and I will raise it up ,
44015017	so that the rest of men may seek the Lord , along with all the nations over whom my name has been invoked , says the Lord , who does these things . ’
44015018	To the Lord , his own work has been known from eternity .
44015019	Because of this , I judge that those who were converted to God from among the Gentiles are not to be disturbed ,
44015020	but instead that we write to them , that they should keep themselves from the defilement of idols , and from fornication , and from whatever has been suffocated , and from blood .
44015021	For Moses , from ancient times , has had in each city those who preach him in the synagogues , where he is read on every Sabbath . ”
44015022	Then it pleased the Apostles and elders , with the whole Church , to choose men from among them , and to send to Antioch , with Paul and Barnabas , and Judas , who was surnamed Barsabbas , and Silas , preeminent men among the brothers ,
44015023	what was written by their own hands : “ The Apostles and elders , brothers , to those who are at Antioch and Syria and Cilicia , brothers from the Gentiles , greetings .
44015024	Since we have heard that some , going out from among us , have troubled you with words , subverting your souls , to whom we gave no commandment ,
44015025	it pleased us , being assembled as one , to choose men and to send them to you , with our most beloved Barnabas and Paul :
44015026	men who have handed over their lives on behalf of the name of our Lord Jesus Christ .
44015027	Therefore , we have sent Judas and Silas , who themselves also will , with the spoken word , reaffirm to you the same things .
44015028	For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to impose no further burden upon you , other than these necessary things :
44015029	that you abstain from things immolated to idols , and from blood , and from what has been suffocated , and from fornication . You will do well to keep yourselves from these things . Farewell . ”
44015030	And so , having been dismissed , they went down to Antioch . And gathering the multitude together , they delivered the epistle .
44015031	And when they had read it , they were gladdened by this consolation .
44015032	But Judas and Silas , being also prophets themselves , consoled the brothers with many words , and they were strengthened .
44015033	Then , after spending some more time there , they were dismissed with peace , by the brothers , to those who had sent them .
44015034	But it seemed good to Silas to remain there . So Judas alone departed to Jerusalem .
44015035	And Paul and Barnabas remained at Antioch , with many others , teaching and evangelizing the Word of the Lord .
44015036	Then , after some days , Paul said to Barnabas , “ Let us return to visit the brothers throughout all the cities in which we have preached the Word of the Lord , to see how they are . ”
44015037	And Barnabas wanted to take John , who was surnamed Mark , with them also .
44015038	But Paul was saying that he ought not to be received , since he withdrew from them at Pamphylia , and he had not gone with them in the work .
44015039	And there occurred a dissension , to such an extent that they departed from one another . And Barnabas , indeed taking Mark , sailed to Cyprus .
44015040	Yet truly , Paul , choosing Silas , set out , being delivered by the brothers to the grace of God .
44015041	And he traveled through Syria and Cilicia , confirming the Churches , instructing them to keep the precepts of the Apostles and the elders .
44016001	Then he arrived at Derbe and Lystra . And behold , a certain disciple named Timothy was there , the son of a faithful Jewish woman , his father a Gentile .
44016002	The brothers who were at Lystra and Iconium rendered good testimony to him .
44016003	Paul wanted this man to travel with him , and taking him , he circumcised him , because of the Jews who were in those places . For they all knew that his father was a Gentile .
44016004	And as they were traveling through the cities , they delivered to them the dogmas to be kept , which were decreed by the Apostles and elders who were at Jerusalem .
44016005	And certainly , the Churches were being strengthened in faith and were increasing in number every day .
44016006	Then , while crossing through Phrygia and the region of Galatia , they were prevented by the Holy Spirit from speaking the Word in Asia .
44016007	But when they had arrived in Mysia , they attempted to go into Bithynia , but the Spirit of Jesus would not permit them .
44016008	Then , when they had crossed through Mysia , they descended to Troas .
44016009	And a vision in the night was revealed to Paul of a certain man of Macedonia , standing and pleading with him , and saying : “ Cross into Macedonia and help us ! ”
44016010	Then , after he saw the vision , immediately we sought to set out for Macedonia , having been assured that God had called us to evangelize to them .
44016011	And sailing from Troas , taking a direct path , we arrived at Samothrace , and on the following day , at Neapolis ,
44016012	and from there to Philippi , which is the preeminent city in the area of Macedonia , a colony . Now we were in this city some days , conferring together .
44016013	Then , on the Sabbath day , we were walking outside the gate , beside a river , where there seemed to be a prayer gathering . And sitting down , we were speaking with the women who had assembled .
44016014	And a certain woman , named Lydia , a seller of purple in the city of Thyatira , a worshiper of God , listened . And the Lord opened her heart to be receptive to what Paul was saying .
44016015	And when she had been baptized , with her household , she pleaded with us , saying : “ If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord , enter into my house and lodge there . ” And she convinced us .
44016016	Then it happened that , as we were going out to prayer , a certain girl , having a spirit of divination , met with us . She was a source of great profit to her masters , through her divining .
44016017	This girl , following Paul and us , was crying out , saying : “ These men are servants of the Most High God ! They are announcing to you the way of salvation ! ”
44016018	Now she behaved in this way for many days . But Paul , being grieved , turned and said to the spirit , “ I command you , in the name of Jesus Christ , to go out from her . ” And it went away in that same hour .
44016019	But her masters , seeing that the hope of their profit went away , apprehended Paul and Silas , and they brought them to the rulers at the courthouse .
44016020	And presenting them to the magistrates , they said : “ These men are disturbing our city , since they are Jews .
44016021	And they are announcing a way which is not lawful for us to accept or to observe , since we are Romans . ”
44016022	And the people rushed together against them . And the magistrates , tearing their tunics , ordered them to be beaten with staffs .
44016023	And when they had inflicted many scourges on them , they cast them into prison , instructing the guard to watch them diligently .
44016024	And since he had received this kind of order , he cast them into the interior prison cell , and he restricted their feet with stocks .
44016025	Then , in the middle of the night , Paul and Silas were praying and praising God . And those who were also in custody were listening to them .
44016026	Yet truly , there was a sudden earthquake , so great that the foundations of the prison were moved . And immediately all the doors were opened , and the bindings of everyone were released .
44016027	Then the prison guard , having been jarred awake , and seeing the doors of the prison open , drew his sword and intended to kill himself , supposing that the prisoners had fled .
44016028	But Paul cried out with a loud voice , saying : “ Do no harm to yourself , for we are all here ! ”
44016029	Then calling for a light , he entered . And trembling , he fell before the feet of Paul and Silas .
44016030	And bringing them outside , he said , “ Sirs , what must I do , so that I may be saved ? ”
44016031	So they said , “ Believe in the Lord Jesus , and then you will be saved , with your household . ”
44016032	And they spoke the Word of the Lord to him , along with all those who were in his house .
44016033	And he , taking them in the same hour of the night , washed their scourges . And he was baptized , and next his entire household .
44016034	And when he had brought them into his own house , he set a table for them . And he was joyous , with his entire household , believing in God .
44016035	And when daylight had arrived , the magistrates sent the attendants , saying , “ Release those men . ”
44016036	But the prison guard reported these words to Paul : “ The magistrates have sent to have you released . Now therefore , depart . Go in peace . ”
44016037	But Paul said to them : “ They have beaten us publicly , though we were not condemned . They have cast men who are Romans into prison . And now they would drive us away secretly ? Not so . Instead , let them come forward ,
44016038	and let us drive them away . ” Then the attendants reported these words to the magistrates . And upon hearing that they were Romans , they were afraid .
44016039	And arriving , they pleaded with them , and leading them out , they begged them to depart from the city .
44016040	And they went away from the prison and entered into the house of Lydia . And having seen the brothers , they consoled them , and then they set out .
44017001	Now when they had walked through Amphipolis and Apollonia , they arrived at Thessalonica , where there was a synagogue of the Jews .
44017002	Then Paul , according to custom , entered to them . And for three Sabbaths he disputed with them about the Scriptures ,
44017003	interpreting and concluding that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise again from the dead , and that “ this is the Jesus Christ , whom I am announcing to you . ”
44017004	And some of them believed and were joined to Paul and Silas , and a great number of these were from the worshipers and the Gentiles , and not a few were noble women .
44017005	But the Jews , being jealous , and joining with certain evildoers among the common men , caused a disturbance , and they stirred up the city . And taking up a position near the house of Jason , they sought to lead them out to the people .
44017006	And when they had not found them , they dragged Jason and certain brothers to the rulers of the city , crying out : “ For these are the ones who have stirred up the city . And they came here ,
44017007	and Jason has received them . And all these men act contrary to the decrees of Caesar , saying that there is another king , Jesus . ”
44017008	And they incited the people . And the rulers of the city , upon hearing these things ,
44017009	and having received an explanation from Jason and the others , released them .
44017010	Yet truly , the brothers promptly sent Paul and Silas away by night to Beroea . And when they had arrived , they entered the synagogue of the Jews .
44017011	But these were more noble than those who were at Thessalonica . They received the Word with all enthusiasm , daily examining the Scriptures to see if these things were so .
44017012	And indeed , many believed among them , as well as not a few among the honorable Gentile men and women .
44017013	Then , when the Jews of Thessalonica had realized that the Word of God was also preached by Paul at Beroea , they went there also , stirring up and disturbing the multitude .
44017014	And then the brothers quickly sent Paul away , so that he might travel by sea . But Silas and Timothy remained there .
44017015	Then those who were leading Paul brought him as far as Athens . And having received an order from him to Silas and Timothy , that they should come to him quickly , they set out .
44017016	Now while Paul waited for them at Athens , his spirit was stirred up within him , seeing the city given over to idolatry .
44017017	And so , he was disputing with the Jews in the synagogue , and with the worshipers , and in public places , throughout each day , with whomever was there .
44017018	Now certain Epicurean and Stoic philosophers were arguing with him . And some were saying , “ What does this sower of the Word want to say ? ” Yet others were saying , “ He seems to be an announcer for new demons . ” For he was announcing to them Jesus and the Resurrection .
44017019	And apprehending him , they brought him to the Areopagus , saying : “ Are we able to know what this new doctrine is , about which you speak ?
44017020	For you bring certain new ideas to our ears . And so we would like to know what these things mean . ”
44017021	( Now all the Athenians , and arriving visitors , were occupying themselves with nothing other than speaking or hearing various new ideas . )
44017022	But Paul , standing in the middle of the Areopagus , said : “ Men of Athens , I perceive that in all things you are rather superstitious .
44017023	For as I was passing by and noticing your idols , I also found an altar , on which was written : TO THE UNKNOWN GOD . Therefore , what you worship in ignorance , this is what I am preaching to you :
44017024	the God who made the world and all that is in it , the One who is the Lord of heaven and earth , who does not live in temples made with hands .
44017025	Neither is he served by the hands of men , as if in need of anything , since it is he who gives to all things life and breath and all else .
44017026	And he has made , out of one , every family of man : to live upon the face of the entire earth , determining the appointed seasons and the limits of their habitation ,
44017027	so as to seek God , if perhaps they may consider him or find him , though he is not far from each one of us .
44017028	‘ For in him we live , and move , and exist . ’ Just as some of your own poets have said . ‘ For we are also of his family . ’
44017029	Therefore , since we are of the family of God , we must not consider gold or silver or precious stones , or the engravings of art and of the imagination of man , to be a representation of what is Divine .
44017030	And indeed , God , having looked down to see the ignorance of these times , has now announced to men that everyone everywhere should do penance .
44017031	For he has appointed a day on which he will judge the world in equity , through the man whom he has appointed , offering faith to all , by raising him from the dead . ”
44017032	And when they had heard about the Resurrection of the dead , indeed , some were derisive , while others said , “ We will listen to you about this again . ”
44017033	So Paul departed from their midst .
44017034	Yet truly , certain men , adhering to him , did believe . Among these were also Dionysius the Areopagite , and a woman named Damaris , and others with them .
44018001	After these things , having departed from Athens , he arrived at Corinth .
44018002	And upon finding a certain Jew named Aquila , born in Pontus , who had recently arrived from Italy with Priscilla his wife , ( because Claudius had ordered all Jews to depart from Rome , ) he met with them .
44018003	And because he was of the same trade , he lodged with them and was working . ( Now they were tentmakers by trade . )
44018004	And he was arguing in the synagogue on every Sabbath , introducing the name of the Lord Jesus . And he was persuading Jews and Greeks .
44018005	And when Silas and Timothy had arrived from Macedonia , Paul stood firm in the Word , testifying to the Jews that Jesus is the Christ .
44018006	But since they were contradicting him and blaspheming , he shook out his garments and said to them : “ Your blood is on your own heads . I am clean . From now on , I will go to the Gentiles . ”
44018007	And moving from that place , he entered into the house of a certain man , named Titus the Just , a worshiper of God , whose house was adjoined to the synagogue .
44018008	Now Crispus , a leader of the synagogue , believed in the Lord , with his entire house . And many of the Corinthians , upon hearing , believed and were baptized .
44018009	Then the Lord said to Paul , through a vision in the night : “ Do not be afraid . Instead , speak out and do not be silent .
44018010	For I am with you . And no one will take hold of you , so as to do you harm . For many of the people in this city are with me . ”
44018011	Then he settled there for a year and six months , teaching the Word of God among them .
44018012	But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia , the Jews rose up with one accord against Paul . And they brought him to the tribunal ,
44018013	saying , “ He persuades men to worship God contrary to the law . ”
44018014	Then , when Paul was beginning to open his mouth , Gallio said to the Jews : “ If this were some matter of injustice , or a wicked deed , O noble Jews , I would support you , as is proper .
44018015	Yet if truly these are questions about a word and names and your law , you should see to it yourselves . I will not be the judge of such things . ”
44018016	And he ordered them from the tribunal .
44018017	But they , apprehending Sosthenes , a leader of the synagogue , beat him in front of the tribunal . And Gallio showed no concern for these things .
44018018	Yet truly , Paul , after he had remained for many more days , having said goodbye to the brothers , sailed into Syria , and with him were Priscilla and Aquila . Now he had shaved his head in Cenchreae , for he had made a vow .
44018019	And he arrived at Ephesus , and he left them behind there . Yet truly , he himself , entering into the synagogue , was disputing with the Jews .
44018020	Then , although they were asking him to remain for a longer time , he would not agree .
44018021	Instead , saying goodbye and telling them , “ I will return to you again , God willing , ” he set out from Ephesus .
44018022	And after going down to Caesarea , he went up to Jerusalem , and he greeted the Church there , and then he descended to Antioch .
44018023	And having spent some length of time there , he set out , and he walked in order through the region of Galatia and Phrygia , strengthening all the disciples .
44018024	Now a certain Jew named Apollo , born at Alexandria , an eloquent man who was powerful with the Scriptures , arrived at Ephesus .
44018025	He was learned in the Way of the Lord . And being fervent in spirit , he was speaking and teaching the things that are of Jesus , but knowing only the baptism of John .
44018026	And so , he began to act faithfully in the synagogue . And when Priscilla and Aquila had heard him , they took him aside and expounded the Way of the Lord to him more thoroughly .
44018027	Then , since he wanted to go to Achaia , the brothers wrote an exhortation to the disciples , so that they might accept him . And when he had arrived , he held many discussions with those who had believed .
44018028	For he was vehemently and publicly reproving the Jews , by revealing through the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ .
44019001	Now it happened that , while Apollo was at Corinth , Paul , after he had journeyed through the upper regions , arrived at Ephesus . And he met with certain disciples .
44019002	And he said to them , “ After believing , have you received the Holy Spirit ? ” But they said to him , “ We have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit . ”
44019003	Yet truly , he said , “ Then with what have you been baptized ? ” And they said , “ With the baptism of John . ”
44019004	Then Paul said : “ John baptized the people with the baptism of repentance , saying that they should believe in the One who is to come after him , that is , in Jesus . ”
44019005	Upon hearing these things , they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus .
44019006	And when Paul had imposed his hands on them , the Holy Spirit came over them . And they were speaking in tongues and prophesying .
44019007	Now the men were about twelve in all .
44019008	Then , upon entering the synagogue , he was speaking faithfully for three months , disputing and persuading them about the kingdom of God .
44019009	But when certain ones became hardened and would not believe , cursing the Way of the Lord in the presence of the multitude , Paul , withdrawing from them , separated the disciples , disputing daily in a certain school of Tyrannus .
44019010	Now this was done throughout two years , so that all who were living in Asia listened to the Word of the Lord , both Jews and Gentiles .
44019011	And God was accomplishing powerful and uncommon miracles by the hand of Paul ,
44019012	so much so that even when small cloths and wrappings were brought from his body to the sick , the illnesses withdrew from them and the wicked spirits departed .
44019013	Then , even some of the traveling Jewish exorcists had attempted to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits , saying , “ I bind you by oath through Jesus , whom Paul preaches . ”
44019014	And there were certain Jews , the seven sons of Sceva , leaders among the priests , who were acting in this way .
44019015	But a wicked spirit responded by saying to them : “ Jesus I know , and Paul I know . But who are you ? ”
44019016	And the man , in whom there was a wicked spirit , leaping at them and getting the better of them both , prevailed against them , so that they fled from that house , naked and wounded .
44019017	And so , this became known to all the Jews and Gentiles who were living at Ephesus . And a fear fell over them all . And the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified .
44019018	And many believers were arriving , confessing , and announcing their deeds .
44019019	Then many of those who had followed odd sects brought together their books , and they burned them in the sight of all . And after determining the value of these , they found the price to be fifty thousand denarii .
44019020	In this way , the Word of God was increasing strongly and was being confirmed .
44019021	Then , when these things were completed , Paul decided in the Spirit , after crossing through Macedonia and Achaia , to go to Jerusalem , saying , “ Then , after I have been there , it is necessary for me to see Rome also . ”
44019022	But sending two of those who were ministering to him , Timothy and Erastus , into Macedonia , he himself remained for a time in Asia .
44019023	Now at that time , there occurred no small disturbance concerning the Way of the Lord .
44019024	For a certain man named Demetrius , a silversmith making silver shrines for Diana , was providing no small profit to craftsmen .
44019025	And calling them together , with those who were employed in the same way , he said : “ Men , you know that our income is from this craft .
44019026	And you are seeing and hearing that this man Paul , by persuasion , has turned away a great multitude , not only from Ephesus , but from nearly all of Asia , saying , ‘ These things are not gods which have been made by hands . ’
44019027	Thus , not only is this , our occupation , in danger of being brought into repudiation , but also the temple of the great Diana will be reputed as nothing ! Then even her majesty , whom all of Asia and the world worships , will begin to be destroyed . ”
44019028	Upon hearing this , they were filled with anger , and they cried out , saying , “ Great is Diana of the Ephesians ! ”
44019029	And the city was filled with confusion . And having seized Gaius and Aristarchus of Macedonia , companions of Paul , they rushed violently , with one accord , into the amphitheatre .
44019030	Then , when Paul wanted to enter to the people , the disciples would not permit him .
44019031	And some of the leaders from Asia , who were his friends , also sent to him , requesting that he not present himself in the amphitheatre .
44019032	But others were crying out various things . For the assembly was in confusion , and most did not know the reason they had been called together .
44019033	So they dragged Alexander from the crowd , while the Jews were propelling him forward . And Alexander , gesturing with his hand for silence , wanted to give the people an explanation .
44019034	But as soon as they realized him to be a Jew , all with one voice , for about two hours , were crying out , “ Great is Diana of the Ephesians ! ”
44019035	And when the scribe had calmed the crowds , he said : “ Men of Ephesus , now what man is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is in the service of the great Diana and of the offspring of Jupiter ?
44019036	Therefore , since these things are not able to be contradicted , it is necessary for you to be calm and to do nothing rash .
44019037	For you have brought forward these men , who are neither sacrilegious nor blasphemers against your goddess .
44019038	But if Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a case against anyone , they can convene in the courts , and there are proconsuls . Let them accuse one another .
44019039	But if you would inquire about other things , this can be decided in a lawful assembly .
44019040	For now we are in peril of being convicted of sedition over today’s events , since there is no one guilty ( against whom we are able to provide evidence ) in this gathering . ”
44019041	And when he had said this , he dismissed the assembly .
44020001	Then , after the tumult ceased , Paul , calling the disciples to himself and exhorting them , said farewell . And he set out , so that he might go into Macedonia .
44020002	And when he had walked through those areas and had exhorted them with many sermons , he went into Greece .
44020003	After he had spent three months there , treacheries were planned against him by the Jews , just as he was about to sail into Syria . And having been advised of this , he return through Macedonia .
44020004	Now those accompanying him were Sopater , the son of Pyrrhus from Beroea ; and also the Thessalonians , Aristarchus and Secundus ; and Gaius of Derbe , and Timothy ; and also Tychicus and Trophimus from Asia .
44020005	These , after they had gone ahead , waited for us at Troas .
44020006	Yet truly , we sailed from Philippi , after the days of Unleavened Bread , and in five days we went to them at Troas , where we stayed for seven days .
44020007	Then , on the first Sabbath , when we had assembled together to break bread , Paul discoursed with them , intending to set out the next day . But he prolonged his sermon into the middle of the night .
44020008	Now there were plenty of lamps in the upper room , where we were gathered .
44020009	And a certain adolescent named Eutychus , sitting on the window sill , was being weighed down by a heavy drowsiness ( for Paul was preaching at length ) . Then , as he went to sleep , he fell from the third floor room downward . And when he was lifted up , he was dead .
44020010	When Paul had gone down to him , he laid himself over him and , embracing him , said , “ Do not worry , for his soul is still within him . ”
44020011	And so , going up , and breaking bread , and eating , and having spoken well on until daylight , he then set out .
44020012	Now they had brought the boy in alive , and they were more than a little consoled .
44020013	Then we climbed aboard the ship and sailed to Assos , where we were to take in Paul . For so he himself had decided , since he was making the journey by land .
44020014	And when he had joined us at Assos , we took him in , and we went to Mitylene .
44020015	And sailing from there , on the following day , we arrived opposite Chios . And next we landed at Samos . And on the following day we went to Miletus .
44020016	For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus , so that he would not be delayed in Asia . For he was hurrying so that , if it were possible for him , he might observe the day of Pentecost at Jerusalem .
44020017	Then , sending from Miletus to Ephesus , he called those greater by birth in the church .
44020018	And when they had come to him and were together , he said to them : “ You know that from the first day when I entered into Asia , I have been with you , for the entire time , in this manner :
44020019	serving the Lord , with all humility and despite the tears and trials which befell me from the treacheries of the Jews ,
44020020	how I held back nothing that was of value , how well I have preached to you , and that I have taught you publicly and throughout the houses ,
44020021	testifying both to Jews and to Gentiles about repentance in God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ .
44020022	And now , behold , being obliged in spirit , I am going to Jerusalem , not knowing what will happen to me there ,
44020023	except that the Holy Spirit , throughout every city , has cautioned me , saying that chains and tribulations await me at Jerusalem .
44020024	But I dread none of these things . Neither do I consider my life to be more precious because it is my own , provided that in some way I may complete my own course and that of the ministry of the Word , which I received from the Lord Jesus , to testify to the Gospel of the grace of God .
44020025	And now , behold , I know that you will no longer see my face , all of you among whom I have traveled , preaching the kingdom of God .
44020026	For this reason , I call you as witnesses on this very day : that I am clean from the blood of all .
44020027	For I have not turned aside in the least from announcing every counsel of God to you .
44020028	Take care of yourselves and of the entire flock , over which the Holy Spirit has stationed you as Bishops to rule the Church of God , which he has purchased by his own blood .
44020029	I know that after my departure ravenous wolves will enter among you , not sparing the flock .
44020030	And from among yourselves , men will rise up , speaking perverse things in order to entice disciples after them .
44020031	Because of this , be vigilant , retaining in memory that throughout three years I did not cease , night and day , with tears , to admonish each and every one of you .
44020032	And now , I commend you to God and to the Word of his grace . He has the power to build up , and to give an inheritance to all who are sanctified .
44020033	I have coveted neither silver and gold , nor apparel ,
44020034	as you yourselves know . For that which was needed by me and by those who are with me , these hands have provided .
44020035	I have revealed all things to you , because by laboring in this way , it is necessary to support the weak and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus , how he said , ‘ It is more blessed to give than to receive . ’ ”
44020036	And when he had said these things , kneeling down , he prayed with all of them .
44020037	Then a great weeping occurred among them all . And , falling upon the neck of Paul , they kissed him ,
44020038	being grieved most of all over the word which he had said , that they would never see his face again . And they brought him to the ship .
44021001	And after these things had happened , having reluctantly parted from them , we sailed a direct course , arriving at Cos , and on following the day at Rhodes , and from there to Patara .
44021002	And when we had found a ship sailing across to Phoenicia , climbing aboard , we set sail .
44021003	Then , after we had caught sight of Cyprus , keeping it to the left , we sailed on to Syria , and we arrived at Tyre . For the ship was going to unload its cargo there .
44021004	Then , having found the disciples , we lodged there for seven days . And they were saying to Paul , through the Spirit , that he should not go up to Jerusalem .
44021005	And when the days were completed , setting out , we went on ; and they all accompanied us with their wives and children , until we were outside of the city . And we kneeled down at the shore and prayed .
44021006	And when we had said farewell to one another , we climbed aboard the ship . And they returned to their own .
44021007	Yet truly , having completed our journey by boat from Tyre , we descended to Ptolemais . And greeting the brothers , we lodged with them for one day .
44021008	Then , after setting out the next day , we arrived at Caesarea . And upon entering into the house of Philip the evangelist , who was one of the seven , we stayed with him .
44021009	Now this man had four daughters , virgins , who were prophesying .
44021010	And while we were delayed for some days , a certain prophet from Judea , named Agabus , arrived .
44021011	And he , when he had come to us , took Paul’s belt , and binding his own feet and hands , he said : “ Thus says the Holy Spirit : The man whose belt this is , the Jews will bind in this way at Jerusalem . And they will deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles . ”
44021012	And when we had heard this , both we and those who were from that place begged him not to go up to Jerusalem .
44021013	Then Paul responded by saying : “ What do you accomplish by weeping and afflicting my heart ? For I am prepared , not only to be bound , but also to die in Jerusalem , for the name of the Lord Jesus . ”
44021014	And since we were not able to persuade him , we quieted , saying : “ May the will of the Lord be done . ”
44021015	Then , after those days , having made preparations , we ascended to Jerusalem .
44021016	Now some of the disciples from Caesarea also went with us , bringing with them a certain Cypriot named Mnason , a very old disciple , whose guests we would be .
44021017	And when we had arrived at Jerusalem , the brothers received us willingly .
44021018	Then , on the following day , Paul entered with us to James . And all the elders were assembled .
44021019	And when he had greeted them , he explained each thing that God had accomplished among the Gentiles through his ministry .
44021020	And they , upon hearing it , magnified God and said to him : “ You understand , brother , how many thousands there are among the Jews who have believed , and they are all zealous for the law .
44021021	Now they have heard about you , that you are teaching those Jews who are among the Gentiles to withdraw from Moses , telling them that they should not circumcise their sons , nor act according to custom .
44021022	What is next ? The multitude ought to be convened . For they will hear that you have arrived .
44021023	Therefore , do this thing that we ask of you : We have four men , who are under a vow .
44021024	Take these and sanctify yourself with them , and require them to shave their heads . And then everyone will know that the things that they have heard about you are false , but that you yourself walk in keeping with the law .
44021025	But , about those Gentiles who have believed , we have written a judgment that they should keep themselves from what has been immolated to idols , and from blood , and from what has been suffocated , and from fornication . ”
44021026	Then Paul , taking the men on the next day , was purified with them , and he entered the temple , announcing the process of the days of purification , until an oblation would be offered on behalf of each one of them .
44021027	But when the seven days were reaching completion , those Jews who were from Asia , when they had seen him in the temple , incited all the people , and they laid hands on him , crying out :
44021028	“ Men of Israel , help ! This is the man who is teaching , everyone , everywhere , against the people and the law and this place . Furthermore , he has even brought Gentiles into the temple , and he has violated this holy place . ”
44021029	( For they had seen Trophimus , an Ephesian , in the city with him , and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple . )
44021030	And the entire city was stirred up . And it happened that the people ran together . And apprehending Paul , they dragged him outside of the temple . And immediately the doors were closed .
44021031	Then , as they were seeking to kill him , it was reported to the tribune of the cohort : “ All Jerusalem is in confusion . ”
44021032	And so , immediately taking soldiers and centurions , he rushed down to them . And when they had seen the tribune and the soldiers , they ceased to strike Paul .
44021033	Then the tribune , drawing near , apprehended him and ordered that he be bound with two chains . And he was asking who he was and what he had done .
44021034	Then they were crying out various things within the crowd . And since he could not understand anything clearly because of the noise , he ordered him to be brought into the fortress .
44021035	And when he had arrived at the stairs , it happened that he was carried up by the soldiers , because of the threat of violence from the people .
44021036	For the multitude of the people were following and crying out , “ Take him away ! ”
44021037	And as Paul was beginning to be brought into the fortress , he said to the tribune , “ Is it permissible for me to say something to you ? ” And he said , “ You know Greek ?
44021038	So then , are you not that Egyptian who before these days incited a rebellion and led out into the desert four thousand murderous men ? ”
44021039	But Paul said to him : “ I am a man , indeed a Jew , from Tarsus in Cilicia , a citizen of a well-known city . So I petition you , permit me to speak to the people . ”
44021040	And when he had given him permission , Paul , standing on the stairs , motioned with his hand to the people . And when a great silence occurred , he spoke to them in the Hebrew language , saying :
44022001	“ Noble brothers and fathers , listen to the explanation that I now give to you . ”
44022002	And when they heard him speaking to them in the Hebrew language , they offered a greater silence .
44022003	And he said : “ I am a Jewish man , born at Tarsus in Cilicia , but raised in this city beside the feet of Gamaliel , taught according to the truth of the law of the fathers , zealous for the law , just as all of you also are to this day .
44022004	I persecuted this Way , even unto death , binding and delivering into custody both men and women ,
44022005	just as the high priest and all those greater by birth bear witness to me . Having received letters from them to the brothers , I journeyed to Damascus , so that I might lead them bound from there to Jerusalem , so that they might be punished .
44022006	But it happened that , as I was traveling and was approaching Damascus at midday , suddenly from heaven a great light shone around me .
44022007	And falling to the ground , I heard a voice saying to me , ‘ Saul , Saul , why are you persecuting me ? ’
44022008	And I responded , ‘ Who are you , Lord ? ’ And he said to me , ‘ I am Jesus the Nazarene , whom you are persecuting . ’
44022009	And those who were with me , indeed , saw the light , but they did not hear the voice of him who was speaking with me .
44022010	And I said , ‘ What should I do , Lord ? ’ Then the Lord said to me : ‘ Rise up , and go to Damascus . And there , you shall be told all that you must do . ’
44022011	And since I could not see , because of the brightness of that light , I was led by the hand by my companions , and I went to Damascus .
44022012	Then a certain Ananias , a man in accord with the law , having the testimony of all the Jews who were living there ,
44022013	drawing near to me and standing close by , said to me , ‘ Brother Saul , see ! ’ And in that same hour , I looked upon him .
44022014	But he said : ‘ The God of our fathers has preordained you , so that you would come to know his will and would see the Just One , and would hear the voice from his mouth .
44022015	For you shall be his witness to all men about those things which you have seen and heard .
44022016	And now , why do you delay ? Rise up , and be baptized , and wash away your sins , by invoking his name . ’
44022017	Then it happened that , when I returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple , a mental stupor came over me ,
44022018	and I saw him saying to me : ‘ Hurry ! Depart quickly from Jerusalem ! For they will not accept your testimony about me . ’
44022019	And I said : ‘ Lord , they know that I am beating and enclosing in prison , throughout every synagogue , those who have believed in you .
44022020	And when the blood of your witness Stephen was poured out , I stood nearby and was consenting , and I watched over the garments of those who put him to death . ’
44022021	And he said to me , ‘ Go forth . For I am sending you to far away nations . ’ ”
44022022	Now they were listening to him , until this word , and then they lifted up their voice , saying : “ Take this kind away from the earth ! For it is not fitting for him to live ! ”
44022023	And while they were shouting , and tossing aside their garments , and casting dust into the air ,
44022024	the tribune ordered him to be brought into the fortress , and to be scourged and tortured , in order to discover the reason that they were crying out in this way against him .
44022025	And when they had tied him with straps , Paul said to the centurion who was standing near him , “ Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman and has not been condemned ? ”
44022026	Upon hearing this , the centurion went to the tribune and reported it to him , saying : “ What do you intend to do ? For this man is a Roman citizen . ”
44022027	And the tribune , approaching , said to him : “ Tell me . Are you a Roman ? ” So he said , “ Yes . ”
44022028	And the tribune responded , “ I obtained this citizenship at great cost . ” And Paul said , “ But I was born to it . ”
44022029	Therefore , those who were going to torture him , immediately withdrew from him . The tribune was similarly afraid , after he realized that he was a Roman citizen , for he had bound him .
44022030	But on the next day , wanting to discover more diligently what the reason was that he was accused by the Jews , he released him , and he ordered the priests to convene , with the entire council . And , producing Paul , he stationed him among them .
44023001	Then Paul , gazing intently at the council , said , “ Noble brothers , I have spoken with all good conscience before God , even to this present day . ”
44023002	And the high priest , Ananias , instructed those who were standing nearby to strike him on the mouth .
44023003	Then Paul said to him : “ God shall strike you , you whitewashed wall ! For would you sit and judge me according to the law , when , contrary to the law , you order me to be struck ? ”
44023004	And those who were standing nearby said , “ Are you speaking evil about the high priest of God ? ”
44023005	And Paul said : “ I did not know , brothers , that he is the high priest . For it is written : ‘ You shall not speak evil of the leader of your people . ’ ”
44023006	Now Paul , knowing that one group were Sadducees and the other were Pharisees , exclaimed in the council : “ Noble brothers , I am a Pharisee , the son of Pharisees ! It is over the hope and resurrection of the dead that I am being judged . ”
44023007	And when he had said this , a dissension occurred between the Pharisees and the Sadducees . And the multitude was divided .
44023008	For the Sadducees claim that there is no resurrection , and neither angels , nor spirits . But the Pharisees confess both of these .
44023009	Then there occurred a great clamor . And some of the Pharisees , rising up , were fighting , saying : “ We find nothing evil in this man . What if a spirit has spoken to him , or an angel ? ”
44023010	And since a great dissension had been made , the tribune , fearing that Paul might be torn apart by them , ordered the soldiers to descend and to seize him from their midst , and to bring him into the fortress .
44023011	Then , on the following night , the Lord stood near him and said : “ Be constant . For just as you have testified about me in Jerusalem , so also it is necessary for you to testify at Rome . ”
44023012	And when daylight arrived , some of the Jews gathered together and bound themselves with an oath , saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul .
44023013	Now there were more than forty men who had taken this oath together .
44023014	And they approached the leaders of the priests , and the elders , and they said : “ We have sworn ourselves by an oath , so that we will taste nothing , until we have killed Paul .
44023015	Therefore , with the council , you should now give notice to the tribune , so that he may bring him to you , as if you intended to determine something else about him . But before he approaches , we have made preparations to put him to death . ”
44023016	But when Paul’s sister’s son had heard of this , about their treachery , he went and entered into the fortress , and he reported it to Paul .
44023017	And Paul , calling to him one of the centurions , said : “ Lead this young man to the tribune . For he has something to tell him . ”
44023018	And indeed , he took him and led him to the tribune , and he said , “ Paul , the prisoner , asked me to lead this young man to you , since he has something to say to you . ”
44023019	Then the tribune , taking him by the hand , withdrew with him by themselves , and he asked him : “ What is it that you have to tell me ? ”
44023020	Then he said : “ The Jews have met to ask you to bring Paul tomorrow to the council , as if they intended to question him about something else .
44023021	But truly , you should not believe them , for they would ambush him with more than forty men from among them , who have bound themselves by an oath neither to eat , nor to drink , until they have put him to death . And they are now prepared , hoping for an affirmation from you . ”
44023022	And then the tribune dismissed the young man , instructing him not to tell anyone that he had made known these things to him .
44023023	Then , having called two centurions , he said to them : “ Prepare two hundred soldiers , so that they may go as far as Caesarea , and seventy horsemen , and two hundred spearmen , for the third hour of the night .
44023024	And prepare beasts of burden to carry Paul , so that they may lead him safely to Felix , the governor . ”
44023025	For he was afraid , lest perhaps the Jews might seize him and kill him , and that afterwards he would be falsely accused , as if he had accepted a bribe . And so he wrote a letter containing the following :
44023026	“ Claudius Lysias , to the most excellent governor , Felix : greetings .
44023027	This man , having been apprehended by the Jews and being about to be put to death by them , I rescued , overwhelming them with soldiers , since I realized that he is a Roman .
44023028	And wanting to know the reason that they objected to him , I brought him into their council .
44023029	And I discovered him to be accused about questions of their law . Yet truly , nothing deserving of death or imprisonment was within the accusation .
44023030	And when I had been given news of ambushes , which they had prepared against him , I sent him to you , notifying his accusers also , so that they may plead their accusations before you . Farewell . ”
44023031	Therefore the soldiers , taking Paul according to their orders , brought him by night to Antipatris .
44023032	And the next day , sending the horsemen to go with him , they returned to the fortress .
44023033	And when they had arrived at Caesarea and had delivered the letter to the governor , they also presented Paul before him .
44023034	And when he had read it and had asked which province he was from , realizing that he was from Cilicia , he said :
44023035	“ I will hear you , when your accusers have arrived . ” And he ordered him to be kept in the praetorium of Herod .
44024001	Then , after five days , the high priest Ananias came down with some of the elders and a certain Tertullus , a speaker . And they went to the governor against Paul .
44024002	And having summoned Paul , Tertullus began to accuse him , saying : “ Most excellent Felix , since we have much peace through you , and many things may be corrected by your providence ,
44024003	we acknowledge this , always and everywhere , with acts of thanksgiving for everything .
44024004	But lest I speak at too great a length , I beg you , by your clemency , to listen to us briefly .
44024005	We have found this man to be pestilent , to be inciting seditions among all the Jews in the entire world , and to be the author of the sedition of the sect of the Nazarenes .
44024006	And he has even been attempting to violate the temple . And having apprehended him , we wanted him to be judged according to our law .
44024007	But Lysias , the tribune , overwhelming us with great violence , snatched him away from our hands ,
44024008	ordering his accusers to come to you . From them , you yourself will be able , by judging about all these things , to understand the reason that we accuse him . ”
44024009	And then the Jews interjected , saying that these things were so .
44024010	Then , since the governor had motioned for him to speak , Paul responded : “ Knowing that you have been the judge over this nation for many years , I will give an explanation of myself with an honest soul .
44024011	For , as you may realize , it has only been twelve days since I went up to worship in Jerusalem .
44024012	And they did not find me in the temple arguing with anyone , nor causing a rally of the people : neither in the synagogues , nor in the city .
44024013	And they are not able to prove to you the things about which they now accuse me .
44024014	But I confess this to you , that according to that sect , which they call a heresy , so do I serve my God and Father , believing all that is written in the Law and the Prophets ,
44024015	having a hope in God , which these others themselves also expect , that there will be a future resurrection of the just and the unjust .
44024016	And in this , I myself always strive to have a conscience that is lacking in any offence toward God and toward men .
44024017	Then , after many years , I went to my nation , bringing alms and offerings and vows ,
44024018	through which I obtained purification in the temple : neither with a crowd , nor with a commotion .
44024019	But certain Jews out of Asia are the ones who should have appeared before you to accuse me , if they have anything against me .
44024020	Or let these ones here say if they have found in me any iniquity , while standing before the council .
44024021	For while standing among them , I spoke out solely about this one matter : about the resurrection of the dead . It is about this that I am being judged today by you . ”
44024022	Then Felix , after having ascertained much knowledge about this Way , kept them waiting , by saying , “ When Lysias the tribune has arrived , I will give you a hearing . ”
44024023	And he ordered a centurion to guard him , and to take rest , and not to prohibit any of his own from ministering to him .
44024024	Then , after some days , Felix , arriving with his wife Drusilla who was a Jew , called for Paul and listened to him about the faith that is in Christ Jesus .
44024025	And after he discoursed about justice and chastity , and about the future judgment , Felix was trembling , and he responded : “ For now , go , but remain under guard . Then , at an opportune time , I will summon you . ”
44024026	He was also hoping that money might be given to him by Paul , and because of this , he frequently summoned him and spoke with him .
44024027	Then , when two years had passed , Felix was succeeded by Portius Festus . And since Felix wanted to show particular favor to the Jews , he left Paul behind as a prisoner .
44025001	And so , when Festus had arrived in the province , after three days , he ascended to Jerusalem from Caesarea .
44025002	And the leaders of the priests , and those first among the Jews , went to him against Paul . And they were petitioning him ,
44025003	asking for favor against him , so that he would order him to be led to Jerusalem , where they were maintaining an ambush in order to kill him along the way .
44025004	But Festus responded that Paul was to be kept in Caesarea , and that he himself would soon go there .
44025005	“ Therefore , ” he said , “ let those among you who are able , descend at the same time , and if there is any guilt in the man , they may accuse him . ”
44025006	Then , having stayed among them no more than eight or ten days , he descended to Caesarea . And on the next day , he sat in the judgment seat , and he ordered Paul to be led in .
44025007	And when he had been brought , the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him , throwing out many serious accusations , none of which they were able to prove .
44025008	Paul offered this defense : “ Neither against the law of the Jews , nor against the temple , nor against Caesar , have I offended in any matter . ”
44025009	But Festus , wanting to show greater favor to the Jews , responded to Paul by saying : “ Are you willing to ascend to Jerusalem and to be judged there about these things before me ? ”
44025010	But Paul said : “ I stand in Caesar’s tribunal , which is where I ought to be judged . I have done no harm to the Jews , as you well know .
44025011	For if I have harmed them , or if I have done anything deserving of death , I do not object to dying . But if there is nothing to these things about which they accuse me , no one is able to deliver me to them . I appeal to Caesar . ”
44025012	Then Festus , having spoken with the council , responded : “ You have appealed to Caesar , to Caesar you shall go . ”
44025013	And when some days had passed , king Agrippa and Bernice descended to Caesarea , to greet Festus .
44025014	And since they remained there for many days , Festus spoke to the king about Paul , saying : “ A certain man was left behind as a prisoner by Felix .
44025015	When I was at Jerusalem , the leaders of the priests and the elders of the Jews came to me about him , asking for condemnation against him .
44025016	I answered them that it is not the custom of the Romans to condemn any man , before he who is being accused has been confronted by his accusers and has received the opportunity to defend himself , so as to clear himself of the charges .
44025017	Therefore , when they had arrived here , without any delay , on the following day , sitting in the judgment seat , I ordered the man to be brought .
44025018	But when the accusers had stood up , they did not present any accusation about him from which I would suspect evil .
44025019	Instead , they brought against him certain disputes about their own superstition and about a certain Jesus , who had died , but whom Paul asserted to be alive .
44025020	Therefore , being in doubt about this kind of question , I asked him if he was willing go to Jerusalem and to be judged there about these things .
44025021	But since Paul was appealing to be kept for a decision before Augustus , I ordered him to be kept , until I might send him to Caesar . ”
44025022	Then Agrippa said to Festus : “ I myself also want to hear the man . ” “ Tomorrow , ” he said , “ you shall hear him . ”
44025023	And on the next day , when Agrippa and Bernice had arrived with great ostentation and had entered into the auditorium with the tribunes and the principal men of the city , Paul was brought in , at the order of Festus .
44025024	And Festus said : “ King Agrippa , and all who are present together with us , you see this man , about whom all the multitude of the Jews disturbed me at Jerusalem , petitioning and clamoring that he should not be allowed to live any longer .
44025025	Truly , I have discovered nothing brought forth against him that is worthy of death . But since he himself has appealed to Augustus , it was my judgment to send him .
44025026	But I have not determined what to write to the emperor about him . Because of this , I have brought him before you all , and especially before you , O king Agrippa , so that , once an inquiry has occurred , I may have something to write .
44025027	For it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner and not to indicate the accusations set against him . ”
44026001	Yet truly , Agrippa said to Paul , “ It is permitted for you to speak for yourself . ” Then Paul , extending his hand , began to offer his defense .
44026002	“ I consider myself blessed , O king Agrippa , that I am to give my defense today before you , about everything of which I am accused by the Jews ,
44026003	especially since you know everything that pertains to the Jews , both customs and questions . Because of this , I beg you to listen to me patiently .
44026004	And certainly , all the Jews know about my life from my youth , which had its beginning among my own people in Jerusalem .
44026005	They knew me well from the beginning , ( if they would be willing to offer testimony ) for I lived according to the most determined sect of our religion : as a Pharisee .
44026006	And now , it is in the hope of the Promise which was made by God to our fathers that I stand subject to judgment .
44026007	It is the Promise that our twelve tribes , worshiping night and day , hope to see . About this hope , O king , I am accused by the Jews .
44026008	Why should it be judged so unbelievable with you all that God might raise the dead ?
44026009	And certainly , I myself formerly considered that I ought to act in many ways which are contrary to the name of Jesus the Nazarene .
44026010	This is also how I acted at Jerusalem . And so , I enclosed many holy persons in prison , having received authority from the leaders of the priests . And when they were to be killed , I brought the sentence .
44026011	And in every synagogue , frequently while punishing them , I compelled them to blaspheme . And being all the more maddened against them , I persecuted them , even to foreign cities .
44026012	Thereafter , as I was going to Damascus , with authority and permission from the high priest ,
44026013	at midday , O king , I and those who were also with me , saw along the way a light from heaven shining around me with a splendor greater than that of the sun .
44026014	And when we had all fallen down to the ground , I heard a voice speaking to me in the Hebrew language : ‘ Saul , Saul , why are you persecuting me ? It is hard for you to kick against the goad . ’
44026015	Then I said , ‘ Who are you , Lord ? ’ And the Lord said , ‘ I am Jesus , whom you are persecuting .
44026016	But rise up and stand on your feet . For I appeared to you for this reason : so that I may establish you as a minister and a witness concerning the things that you have seen , and concerning the things that I will show to you :
44026017	rescuing you from the people and the nations to which I am now sending you ,
44026018	in order to open their eyes , so that they may be converted from darkness to light , and from the power of Satan to God , so that they may receive the remission of sins and a place among the saints , through the faith that is in me . ’
44026019	From then on , O king Agrippa , I was not unbelieving to the heavenly vision .
44026020	But I preached , first to those who are at Damascus and at Jerusalem , and then to the entire region of Judea , and to the Gentiles , so that they would repent and convert to God , doing the works that are worthy of repentance .
44026021	It was for this reason that the Jews , having apprehended me when I was in the temple , attempted to kill me .
44026022	But having been aided by the help of God , even to this day , I stand witnessing to the small and the great , saying nothing beyond what the Prophets and Moses have said would be in the future :
44026023	that the Christ would suffer , and that he would be the first from the resurrection of the dead , and that he would bring light to the people and to the nations . ”
44026024	While he was speaking these things and presenting his defense , Festus said with a loud voice : “ Paul , you are insane ! Too much studying has turned you to insanity . ”
44026025	And Paul said : “ I am not insane , most excellent Festus , but rather I am speaking words of truth and sobriety .
44026026	For the king knows about these things . To him also , I am speaking with constancy . For I think that none of these things are unknown to him . And neither were these things done in a corner .
44026027	Do you believe the Prophets , O king Agrippa ? I know that you believe . ”
44026028	Then Agrippa said to Paul , “ To some extent , you persuade me to become a Christian . ”
44026029	And Paul said , “ I hope to God that , both to a small extent and to a great extent , not only you , but also all those who hear me this day will become just as I also am , except for these chains . ”
44026030	And the king rose up , and the governor , and Bernice , and those who were sitting with them .
44026031	And when they had withdrawn , they were speaking among themselves , saying , “ This man has done nothing worthy of death , nor of imprisonment . ”
44026032	Then Agrippa said to Festus , “ This man could have been released , if he had not appealed to Caesar . ”
44027001	Then it was decided to send him by ship to Italy , and that Paul , with the others in custody , should be delivered to a centurion named Julius , of the cohort of Augusta .
44027002	After climbing aboard a ship from Adramyttium , we set sail and began to navigate along the ports of Asia , with Aristarchus , the Macedonian from Thessalonica , joining us .
44027003	And on the following day , we arrived at Sidon . And Julius , treating Paul humanely , permitted him to go to his friends and to look after himself .
44027004	And when we had set sail from there , we navigated below Cyprus , because the winds were contrary .
44027005	And navigating though the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia , we arrived at Lystra , which is in Lycia .
44027006	And there the centurion found a ship from Alexandria sailing to Italy , and he transferred us to it .
44027007	And when we had sailed slowly for many days and had barely arrived opposite Cnidus , for the wind was hindering us , we sailed to Crete , near Salmone .
44027008	And barely being able to sail past it , we arrived at a certain place , which is called Good Shelter , next to which was the city of Lasea .
44027009	Then , after much time had passed , and since sailing would no longer be prudent because the Fast Day had now passed , Paul consoled them ,
44027010	and he said to them : “ Men , I perceive that the voyage is now in danger of injury and much damage , not only to the cargo and the ship , but also to our own lives . ”
44027011	But the centurion put more trust in the captain and the navigator of the ship , than in the things being said by Paul .
44027012	And since it was not a fitting port in which to winter , the majority opinion was to sail from there , so that somehow they might be able to arrive at Phoenicia , in order to winter there , at a port of Crete , which looks out toward the southwest and northwest .
44027013	And since the south wind was blowing gently , they thought that they might reach their goal . And after they had set out from Asson , they weighed anchor at Crete .
44027014	But not long afterward , a violent wind came against them , which is called the Northeast Wind .
44027015	And once the ship had been caught in it and was not able to strive against the wind , giving over the ship to the winds , we were driven along .
44027016	Then , being forced along a certain island , which is called the Tail , we were barely able to hold on to the ship’s lifeboat .
44027017	When this was taken up , they used it to assist in securing the ship . For they were afraid that they might run aground . And having lowered the sails , they were being driven along in this way .
44027018	Then , since we were being tossed about strongly by the tempest , on the following day , they threw the heavy items overboard .
44027019	And on the third day , with their own hands , they threw the equipment of the ship overboard .
44027020	Then , when neither sun nor stars appeared for many days , and no end to the storm was imminent , all hope for our safety was now taken away .
44027021	And after they had fasted for a long time , Paul , standing in their midst , said : “ Certainly , men , you should have listened to me and not set out from Crete , so as to cause this injury and loss .
44027022	And now , let me persuade you to be courageous in soul . For there shall be no loss of life among you , but only of the ship .
44027023	For an Angel of God , who is assigned to me and whom I serve , stood beside me this night ,
44027024	saying : ‘ Do not be afraid , Paul ! It is necessary for you to stand before Caesar . And behold , God has given to you all those who are sailing with you . ’
44027025	Because of this , men , be courageous in soul . For I trust God that this will happen in the same way that it has been told to me .
44027026	But it is necessary for us to arrive at a certain island . ”
44027027	Then , after the fourteenth night arrived , as we were navigating in the sea of Adria , about the middle of the night , the sailors believed that they saw some portion of the land .
44027028	And upon dropping a weight , they found a depth of twenty paces . And some distance from there , they found a depth of fifteen paces .
44027029	Then , fearing that we might happen upon rough places , they cast four anchors out of the stern , and they were hoping for daylight to arrive soon .
44027030	Yet truly , the sailors were seeking a way to flee from the ship , for they had lowered a lifeboat into the sea , on the pretext that they were attempting to cast anchors from the bow of the ship .
44027031	So Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers , “ Unless these men remain in the ship , you will not be able to be saved . ”
44027032	Then the soldiers cut the ropes to the lifeboat , and they allowed it to fall .
44027033	And when it began to be light , Paul requested that they all take food , saying : “ This is the fourteenth day that you have been waiting and continuing to fast , taking nothing .
44027034	For this reason , I beg you to accept food for the sake of your health . For not a hair from the head of any of you shall perish . ”
44027035	And when he had said these things , taking bread , he gave thanks to God in the sight of them all . And when he had broken it , he began to eat .
44027036	Then they all became more peaceful in soul . And they also took food .
44027037	Truly , we were two hundred and seventy-six souls on the ship .
44027038	And having been nourished with food , they lightened the ship , casting the wheat into the sea .
44027039	And when day had arrived , they did not recognize the landscape . Yet truly , they caught sight of a certain narrow inlet having a shore , into which they thought it might be possible to force the ship .
44027040	And when they had taken up the anchors , they committed themselves to the sea , at the same time loosing the restraints of the rudders . And so , raising the mainsail to the gusting wind , they pressed on toward the shore .
44027041	And when we happened upon a place open to two seas , they ran the ship aground . And indeed , the bow , being immobilized , remained fixed , but truly the stern was broken by the violence of the sea .
44027042	Then the soldiers were in agreement that they should kill the prisoners , lest anyone , after escaping by swimming , might flee .
44027043	But the centurion , wanting to save Paul , prohibited it from being done . And he ordered those who were able to swim to jump in first , and to escape , and to get to the land .
44027044	And as for the others , some they carried on boards , and others on those things that belonged to the ship . And so it happened that every soul escaped to the land .
44028001	And after we had escaped , we then realized that the island was called Malta . Yet truly , the natives offered us no small amount of humane treatment .
44028002	For they refreshed us all by kindling a fire , because rain was imminent and because of the cold .
44028003	But when Paul had gathered together a bundle of twigs , and had placed them on the fire , a viper , which had been drawn to the heat , fastened itself to his hand .
44028004	And truly , when the natives saw the beast hanging from his hand , they were saying to one another : “ Certainly , this man must be a murderer , for though he escaped from the sea , vengeance will not permit him to live . ”
44028005	But shaking off the creature into the fire , he indeed suffered no ill effects .
44028006	But they were supposing that he would soon swell up , and then would suddenly fall down and die . But having waited a long time , and seeing no ill effects in him , they changed their minds and were saying that he was a god .
44028007	Now among these places were estates owned by the ruler of the island , named Publius . And he , taking us in , showed us kind hospitality for three days .
44028008	Then it happened that the father of Publius lay ill with a fever and with dysentery . Paul entered to him , and when he had prayed and had laid his hands on him , he saved him .
44028009	When this had been done , all who had diseases on the island approached and were cured .
44028010	And then they also presented us with many honors . And when we were ready to set sail , they gave us whatever we needed .
44028011	And so , after three months , we sailed in a ship from Alexandria , whose name was ‘ the Castors , ’ and which had wintered at the island .
44028012	And when we had arrived at Syracuse , we were delayed there for three days .
44028013	From there , sailing close to the shore , we arrived at Rhegium . And after one day , with the south wind blowing , we arrived on the second day at Puteoli .
44028014	There , after locating the brothers , we were asked to remain with them for seven days . And then we went on to Rome .
44028015	And there , when the brothers had heard of us , they went to meet us as far as the Forum of Appius and the Three Taverns . And when Paul had seen them , giving thanks to God , he took courage .
44028016	And when we had arrived at Rome , Paul was given permission to stay by himself , with a soldier to guard him .
44028017	And after the third day , he called together the leaders of the Jews . And when they had convened , he said to them : “ Noble brothers , I have done nothing against the people , nor against the customs of the fathers , yet I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans .
44028018	And after they held a hearing about me , they would have released me , because there was no case for death against me .
44028019	But with the Jews speaking against me , I was constrained to appeal to Caesar , though it was not as if I had any kind of accusation against my own nation .
44028020	And so , because of this , I requested to see you and to speak to you . For it is because of the hope of Israel that I am encircled with this chain . ”
44028021	But they said to him : “ We have not received letters about you from Judea , nor have any of the other new arrivals among the brothers reported or spoken anything evil against you .
44028022	But we are asking to hear your opinions from you , for concerning this sect , we know that it is being spoken against everywhere . ”
44028023	And when they had appointed a day for him , very many persons went to him at his guest quarters . And he discoursed , testifying to the kingdom of God , and persuading them about Jesus , using the law of Moses and the Prophets , from morning until evening .
44028024	And some believed the things that he was saying , yet others did not believe .
44028025	And when they could not agree among themselves , they departed , while Paul was speaking this one word : “ How well did the Holy Spirit speak to our fathers through the prophet Isaiah ,
44028026	saying : ‘ Go to this people and say to them : Hearing , you shall hear and not understand , and seeing , you shall see and not perceive .
44028027	For the heart of this people has grown dull , and they have listened with reluctant ears , and they have closed their eyes tightly , lest perhaps they might see with the eyes , and hear with the ears , and understand with the heart , and so be converted , and I would heal them . ’
44028028	Therefore , let it be known to you , that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles , and they shall listen to it . ”
44028029	And when he had said these things , the Jews went away from him , though they still had many questions among themselves .
44028030	Then he remained for two whole years in his own rented lodgings . And he received all who went in to him ,
44028031	preaching the kingdom of God and teaching the things which are from the Lord Jesus Christ , with all faithfulness , without prohibition .
45001001	Paul , a servant of Jesus Christ , called as an Apostle , separated for the Gospel of God ,
45001002	which he had promised beforehand , through his Prophets , in the Holy Scriptures ,
45001003	about his Son , who was made for him from the offspring of David according to the flesh ,
45001004	the Son of God , who was predestined in virtue according to the Spirit of sanctification from the resurrection of the dead , our Lord Jesus Christ ,
45001005	through whom we have received grace and Apostleship , for the sake of his name , for the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles ,
45001006	from whom you also have been called by Jesus Christ :
45001007	To all who are at Rome , the beloved of God , called as saints . Grace to you , and peace , from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
45001008	Certainly , I give thanks to my God , through Jesus Christ , first for all of you , because your faith is being announced throughout the entire world .
45001009	For God is my witness , whom I serve in my spirit by the Gospel of his Son , that without ceasing I have kept a remembrance of you
45001010	always in my prayers , pleading that in some way , at some time , I may have a prosperous journey , within the will of God , to come to you .
45001011	For I long to see you , so that I may impart to you a certain spiritual grace to strengthen you ,
45001012	specifically , to be consoled together with you through that which is mutual : your faith and mine .
45001013	But I want you to know , brothers , that I have often intended to come to you , ( though I have been hindered even to the present time ) so that I might obtain some fruit among you also , just as also among the other Gentiles .
45001014	To the Greeks and to the uncivilized , to the wise and to the foolish , I am in debt .
45001015	So within me there is a prompting to evangelize to you also who are at Rome .
45001016	For I am not ashamed of the Gospel . For it is the power of God unto salvation for all believers , the Jew first , and the Greek .
45001017	For the justice of God is revealed within it , by faith unto faith , just as it was written : “ For the just one lives by faith . ”
45001018	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven over every impiety and injustice among those men who fend off the truth of God with injustice .
45001019	For what is known about God is manifest in them . For God has manifested it to them .
45001020	For unseen things about him have been made conspicuous , since the creation of the world , being understood by the things that were made ; likewise his everlasting virtue and divinity , so much so that they have no excuse .
45001021	For although they had known God , they did not glorify God , nor give thanks . Instead , they became weakened in their thoughts , and their foolish heart was obscured .
45001022	For , while proclaiming themselves to be wise , they became foolish .
45001023	And they exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of an image of corruptible man , and of flying things , and of four-legged beasts , and of serpents .
45001024	For this reason , God handed them over to the desires of their own heart for impurity , so that they afflicted their own bodies with indignities among themselves .
45001025	And they exchanged the truth of God for a lie . And they worshipped and served the creature , rather than the Creator , who is blessed for all eternity . Amen .
45001026	Because of this , God handed them over to shameful passions . For example , their females have exchanged the natural use of the body for a use which is against nature .
45001027	And similarly , the males also , abandoning the natural use of females , have burned in their desires for one another : males doing with males what is disgraceful , and receiving within themselves the recompense that necessarily results from their error .
45001028	And since they did not prove to have God by knowledge , God handed them over to a morally depraved way of thinking , so that they might do those things which are not fitting :
45001029	having been completely filled with all iniquity , malice , fornication , avarice , wickedness ; full of envy , murder , contention , deceit , spite , gossiping ;
45001030	slanderous , hateful toward God , abusive , arrogant , self-exalting , devisers of evil , disobedient to parents ,
45001031	foolish , disorderly ; without affection , without fidelity , without mercy .
45001032	And these , though they had known the justice of God , did not understand that those who act in such a manner are deserving of death , and not only those who do these things , but also those who consent to what is done .
45002001	For this reason , O man , each one of you who judges is inexcusable . For by that which you judge another , you condemn yourself . For you do the same things that you judge .
45002002	For we know that the judgment of God is in accord with truth against those who do such things .
45002003	But , O man , when you judge those who do such things as you yourself also do , do you think that you will escape the judgment of God ?
45002004	Or do you despise the riches of his goodness and patience and forbearance ? Do you not know that the kindness of God is calling you to repentance ?
45002005	But in accord with your hard and impenitent heart , you store up wrath for yourself , unto the day of wrath and of revelation by the just judgment of God .
45002006	For he will render to each one according to his works :
45002007	To those who , in accord with patient good works , seek glory and honor and incorruption , certainly , he will render eternal life .
45002008	But to those who are contentious and who do not acquiesce to the truth , but instead trust in iniquity , he will render wrath and indignation .
45002009	Tribulation and anguish are upon every soul of man that works evil : the Jew first , and also the Greek .
45002010	But glory and honor and peace are for all who do what is good : the Jew first , and also the Greek .
45002011	For there is no favoritism with God .
45002012	For whoever had sinned without the law , will perish without the law . And whoever had sinned in the law , will be judged by the law .
45002013	For it is not the hearers of the law who are just before God , but rather it is the doers of the law who shall be justified .
45002014	For when the Gentiles , who do not have the law , do by nature those things which are of the law , such persons , not having the law , are a law unto themselves .
45002015	For they reveal the work of the law written in their hearts , while their conscience renders testimony about them , and their thoughts within themselves also accuse or even defend them ,
45002016	unto the day when God shall judge the hidden things of men , through Jesus Christ , according to my Gospel .
45002017	But if you are called by name a Jew , and you rest upon the law , and you find glory in God ,
45002018	and you have known his will , and you demonstrate the more useful things , having been instructed by the law :
45002019	you become confident within yourself that you are a guide to the blind , a light to those who are in darkness ,
45002020	an instructor to the foolish , a teacher to children , because you have a type of knowledge and truth in the law .
45002021	As a result , you teach others , but you do not teach yourself . You preach that men should not steal , but you yourself steal .
45002022	You speak against adultery , but you commit adultery . You abominate idols , but you commit sacrilege .
45002023	You would glory in the law , but through a betrayal of the law you dishonor God .
45002024	( For because of you the name of God is being blasphemed among the Gentiles , just as it was written . )
45002025	Certainly , circumcision is beneficial , if you observe the law . But if you are a betrayer of the law , your circumcision becomes uncircumcision .
45002026	And so , if the uncircumcised keep the justices of the law , shall not this lack of circumcision be counted as circumcision ?
45002027	And that which is by nature uncircumcised , if it fulfills the law , should it not judge you , who by the letter and by circumcision are a betrayer of the law ?
45002028	For a Jew is not he who seems so outwardly . Neither is circumcision that which seems so outwardly , in the flesh .
45002029	But a Jew is he who is so inwardly . And circumcision of the heart is in the spirit , not in the letter . For its praise is not of men , but of God .
45003001	So then , what more is the Jew , or what is the usefulness of circumcision ?
45003002	Much in every way : First of all , certainly , because the eloquence of God was entrusted to them .
45003003	But what if some of them have not believed ? Shall their unbelief nullify the faith of God ? Let it not be so !
45003004	For God is truthful , but every man is deceitful ; just as it was written : “ Therefore , you are justified in your words , and you will prevail when you give judgment . ”
45003005	But if even our injustice points to the justice of God , what shall we say ? Could God be unfair for inflicting wrath ?
45003006	( I am speaking in human terms . ) Let it not be so ! Otherwise , how would God judge this world ?
45003007	For if the truth of God has abounded , through my falseness , unto his glory , why should I still be judged as such a sinner ?
45003008	And should we not do evil , so that good may result ? For so we have been slandered , and so some have claimed we said ; their condemnation is just .
45003009	What is next ? Should we try to excel ahead of them ? By no means ! For we have accused all Jews and Greeks to be under sin ,
45003010	just as it was written : “ There is no one who is just .
45003011	There is no one who understands . There is no one who seeks God .
45003012	All have gone astray ; together they have become useless . There is no one who does good ; there is not even one .
45003013	Their throat is an open sepulcher . With their tongues , they have been acting deceitfully . The venom of asps is under their lips .
45003014	Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness .
45003015	Their feet are swift to shed blood .
45003016	Grief and unhappiness are in their ways .
45003017	And the way of peace they have not known .
45003018	There is no fear of God before their eyes . ”
45003019	But we know that whatever the law speaks , it speaks to those who are in the law , so that every mouth may be silenced and the entire world may be subject to God .
45003020	For in his presence no flesh shall be justified by the works of the law . For knowledge of sin is through the law .
45003021	But now , without the law , the justice of God , to which the law and the prophets have testified , has been made manifest .
45003022	And the justice of God , though the faith of Jesus Christ , is in all those and over all those who believe in him . For there is no distinction .
45003023	For all have sinned and all are in need of the glory of God .
45003024	We have been justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus ,
45003025	whom God has offered as a propitiation , through faith in his blood , to reveal his justice for the remission of the former offenses ,
45003026	and by the forbearance of God , to reveal his justice in this time , so that he himself might be both the Just One and the Justifier of anyone who is of the faith of Jesus Christ .
45003027	So then , where is your self-exaltation ? It is excluded . Through what law ? That of works ? No , but rather through the law of faith .
45003028	For we judge a man to be justified by faith , without the works of the law .
45003029	Is God of the Jews only and not also of the Gentiles ? On the contrary , of the Gentiles also .
45003030	For One is the God who justifies circumcision by faith and uncircumcision through faith .
45003031	Are we then destroying the law through faith ? Let it not be so ! Instead , we are making the law stand .
45004001	So then , what shall we say that Abraham had achieved , who is our father according to the flesh ?
45004002	For if Abraham was justified by works , he would have glory , but not with God .
45004003	For what does Scripture say ? “ Abram believed God , and it was reputed to him unto justice . ”
45004004	But for he who works , wages are not accounted according to grace , but according to debt .
45004005	Yet truly , for he who does not work , but who believes in him who justifies the impious , his faith is reputed unto justice , according to the purpose of the grace of God .
45004006	Similarly , David also declares the blessedness of a man , to whom God brings justice without works :
45004007	“ Blessed are they whose iniquities have been forgiven and whose sins have been covered .
45004008	Blessed is the man to whom the Lord has not imputed sin . ”
45004009	Does this blessedness , then , remain only in the circumcised , or is it even in the uncircumcised ? For we say that faith was reputed to Abraham unto justice .
45004010	But then how was it reputed ? In circumcision or in uncircumcision ? Not in circumcision , but in uncircumcision .
45004011	For he received the sign of circumcision as a symbol of the justice of that faith which exists apart from circumcision , so that he might be the father of all those who believe while uncircumcised , so that it might also be reputed to them unto justice ,
45004012	and he might be the father of circumcision , not only for those who are of circumcision , but even for those who follow the footsteps of that faith which is in the uncircumcision of our father Abraham .
45004013	For the Promise to Abraham , and to his posterity , that he would inherit the world , was not through the law , but through the justice of faith .
45004014	For if those who are of the law are the heirs , then faith becomes empty and the Promise is abolished .
45004015	For the law works unto wrath . And where there is no law , there is no law-breaking .
45004016	Because of this , it is from faith according to grace that the Promise is ensured for all posterity , not only for those who are of the law , but also for those who are of the faith of Abraham , who is the father of us all before God ,
45004017	in whom he believed , who revives the dead and who calls those things that do not exist into existence . For it is written : “ I have established you as the father of many nations . ”
45004018	And he believed , with a hope beyond hope , so that he might become the father of many nations , according to what was said to him : “ Thus shall your posterity shall be . ”
45004019	And he was not weakened in faith , nor did he consider his own body to be dead ( though he was then almost one hundred years old ) , nor the womb of Sarah to be dead .
45004020	And then , in the Promise of God , he did not hesitate out of distrust , but instead he was strengthened in faith , giving glory to God ,
45004021	knowing most fully that whatever God has promised , he is also able to accomplish .
45004022	And for this reason , it was reputed to him unto justice .
45004023	Now this has been written , that it was reputed to him unto justice , not only for his sake ,
45004024	but also for our sake . For the same shall be reputed to us , if we believe in him who raised up our Lord Jesus Christ from the dead ,
45004025	who was handed over because of our offenses , and who rose again for our justification .
45005001	Therefore , having been justified by faith , let us be at peace with God , through our Lord Jesus Christ .
45005002	For through him we also have access by faith to this grace , in which we stand firm , and to glory , in the hope of the glory of the sons of God .
45005003	And not only that , but we also find glory in tribulation , knowing that tribulation exercises patience ,
45005004	and patience leads to proving , yet truly proving leads to hope ,
45005005	but hope is not unfounded , because the love of God is poured forth in our hearts through the Holy Spirit , who has been given to us .
45005006	Yet why did Christ , while we were still infirm , at the proper time , suffer death for the impious ?
45005007	Now someone might barely be willing to die for the sake of justice , for example , perhaps someone might dare to die for the sake of a good man .
45005008	But God demonstrates his love for us in that , while we were yet sinners , at the proper time ,
45005009	Christ died for us . Therefore , having been justified now by his blood , all the more so shall we be saved from wrath through him .
45005010	For if we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son , while we were still enemies , all the more so , having been reconciled , shall we be saved by his life .
45005011	And not only that , but we also glory in God through our Lord Jesus Christ , through whom we have now received reconciliation .
45005012	Therefore , just as through one man sin entered into this world , and through sin , death ; so also death was transferred to all men , to all who have sinned .
45005013	For even before the law , sin was in the world , but sin was not imputed while the law did not exist .
45005014	Yet death reigned from Adam until Moses , even in those who have not sinned , in the likeness of the transgression of Adam , who is a figure of him who was to come .
45005015	But the gift is not entirely like the offense . For though by the offense of one , many died , yet much more so , by the grace of one man , Jesus Christ , has the grace and gift of God abounded to many .
45005016	And the sin through one is not entirely like the gift . For certainly , the judgment of one was unto condemnation , but the grace toward many offenses is unto justification .
45005017	For though , by the one offense , death reigned through one , yet so much more so shall those who receive an abundance of grace , both of the gift and of justice , reign in life through the one Jesus Christ .
45005018	Therefore , just as through the offense of one , all men fell under condemnation , so also through the justice of one , all men fall under justification unto life .
45005019	For , just as through the disobedience of one man , many were established as sinners , so also through the obedience of one man , many shall be established as just .
45005020	Now the law entered in such a way that offenses would abound . But where offenses were abundant , grace was superabundant .
45005021	So then , just as sin has reigned unto death , so also may grace reign through justice unto eternal life , through Jesus Christ our Lord .
45006001	So what shall we say ? Should we remain in sin , so that grace may abound ?
45006002	Let it not be so ! For how can we who have died to sin still live in sin ?
45006003	Do you not know that those of us who have been baptized in Christ Jesus have been baptized into his death ?
45006004	For through baptism we have been buried with him into death , so that , in the manner that Christ rose from the dead , by the glory of the Father , so may we also walk in the newness of life .
45006005	For if we have been planted together , in the likeness of his death , so shall we also be , in the likeness of his resurrection .
45006006	For we know this : that our former selves have been crucified together with him , so that the body which is of sin may be destroyed , and moreover , so that we may no longer serve sin .
45006007	For he who has died has been justified from sin .
45006008	Now if we have died with Christ , we believe that we shall also live together with Christ .
45006009	For we know that Christ , in rising up from the dead , can no longer die : death no longer has dominion over him .
45006010	For in as much as he died for sin , he died once . But in as much as he lives , he lives for God .
45006011	And so , you should consider yourselves to be certainly dead to sin , and to be living for God in Christ Jesus our Lord .
45006012	Therefore , let not sin reign in your mortal body , such that you would obey its desires .
45006013	Nor should you offer the parts of your body as instruments of iniquity for sin . Instead , offer yourselves to God , as if you were living after death , and offer the parts of your body as instruments of justice for God .
45006014	For sin should not have dominion over you . For you are not under the law , but under grace .
45006015	What is next ? Should we sin because we are not under the law , but under grace ? Let it not be so !
45006016	Do you not know to whom you are offering yourselves as servants under obedience ? You are the servants of whomever you obey : whether of sin , unto death , or of obedience , unto justice .
45006017	But thanks be to God that , though you used to be the servants of sin , now you have been obedient from the heart to the very form of the doctrine into which you have been received .
45006018	And having been freed from sin , we have become servants of justice .
45006019	I am speaking in human terms because of the infirmity of your flesh . For just as you offered the parts of your body to serve impurity and iniquity , for the sake of iniquity , so also have you now yielded the parts of your body to serve justice , for the sake of sanctification .
45006020	For though you were once the servants of sin , you have become the children of justice .
45006021	But what fruit did you hold at that time , in those things about which you are now ashamed ? For the end of those things is death .
45006022	Yet truly , having been freed now from sin , and having been made servants of God , you hold your fruit in sanctification , and truly its end is eternal life .
45006023	For the wages of sin is death . But the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord .
45007001	Or do you not know , brothers , ( now I am speaking to those who know the law ) that the law has dominion over a man only so long as he lives ?
45007002	For example , a woman who is subject to a husband is obligated by the law while her husband lives . But when her husband has died , she is released from the law of her husband .
45007003	Therefore , while her husband lives , if she has been with another man , she should be called an adulteress . But when her husband has died , she is freed from the law of her husband , such that , if she has been with another man , she is not an adulteress .
45007004	And so , my brothers , you also have become dead to the law , through the body of Christ , so that you may be another one who has risen from the dead , in order that we may bear fruit for God .
45007005	For when we were in the flesh , the passions of sins , which were under the law , operated within our bodies , so as to bear fruit unto death .
45007006	But now we have been released from the law of death , by which we were being held , so that now we may serve with a renewed spirit , and not in the old way , by the letter .
45007007	What should we say next ? Is the law sin ? Let it not be so ! But I do not know sin , except through the law . For example , I would not have known about coveting , unless the law said : “ You shall not covet . ”
45007008	But sin , receiving an opportunity through the commandment , wrought in me all manner of coveting . For apart from the law , sin was dead .
45007009	Now I lived for some time apart from the law . But when the commandment had arrived , sin was revived ,
45007010	and I died . And the commandment , which was unto life , was itself found to be unto death for me .
45007011	For sin , receiving an opportunity through the commandment , seduced me , and , through the law , sin killed me .
45007012	And so , the law itself is indeed holy , and the commandment is holy and just and good .
45007013	Then was what is good made into death for me ? Let it not be so ! But rather sin , in order that it might be known as sin by what is good , wrought death in me ; so that sin , through the commandment , might become sinful beyond measure .
45007014	For we know that the law is spiritual . But I am carnal , having been sold under sin .
45007015	For I do things that I do not understand . For I do not do the good that I want to do . But the evil that I hate is what I do .
45007016	So , when I do what I do not want to do , I am in agreement with the law , that the law is good .
45007017	But I am then acting not according to the law , but according to the sin which lives within me .
45007018	For I know that what is good does not live within me , that is , within my flesh . For the willingness to do good lies close to me , but the carrying out of that good , I cannot reach .
45007019	For I do not do the good that I want to do . But instead , I do the evil that I do not want to do .
45007020	Now if I do what I am not willing to do , it is no longer I who am doing it , but the sin which lives within me .
45007021	And so , I discover the law , by wanting to do good within myself , though evil lies close beside me .
45007022	For I am delighted with the law of God , according to the inner man .
45007023	But I perceive another law within my body , fighting against the law of my mind , and captivating me with the law of sin which is in my body .
45007024	Unhappy man that I am , who will free me from this body of death ?
45007025	The grace of God , by Jesus Christ our Lord ! Therefore , I serve the law of God with my own mind ; but with the flesh , the law of sin .
45008001	Therefore , there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus , who are not walking according to the flesh .
45008002	For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and death .
45008003	For though this was impossible under the law , because it was weakened by the flesh , God sent his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and because of sin , in order to condemn sin in the flesh ,
45008004	so that the justification of the law might be fulfilled in us . For we are not walking according to the flesh , but according to the spirit .
45008005	For those who are in agreement with the flesh are mindful of the things of the flesh . But those who are in agreement with the spirit are mindful of the things of the spirit .
45008006	For the prudence of the flesh is death . But the prudence of the spirit is life and peace .
45008007	And the wisdom of the flesh is inimical to God . For it is not subject to the law of God , nor can it be .
45008008	So those who are in the flesh are not able to please God .
45008009	And you are not in the flesh , but in the spirit , if it is true that the Spirit of God lives within you . But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ , he does not belong to him .
45008010	But if Christ is within you , then the body is indeed dead , concerning sin , but the spirit truly lives , because of justification .
45008011	But if the Spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead lives within you , then he who raised up Jesus Christ from the dead shall also enliven your mortal bodies , by means of his Spirit living within you .
45008012	Therefore , brothers , we are not debtors to the flesh , so as to live according to the flesh .
45008013	For if you live according to the flesh , you will die . But if , by the Spirit , you mortify the deeds of the flesh , you shall live .
45008014	For all those who are led by the Spirit of God are the sons of God .
45008015	And you have not received , again , a spirit of servitude in fear , but you have received the Spirit of the adoption of sons , in whom we cry out : “ Abba , Father ! ”
45008016	For the Spirit himself renders testimony to our spirit that we are the sons of God .
45008017	But if we are sons , then we are also heirs : certainly heirs of God , but also co-heirs with Christ , yet in such a way that , if we suffer with him , we shall also be glorified with him .
45008018	For I consider that the sufferings of this time are not worthy to be compared with that future glory which shall be revealed in us .
45008019	For the anticipation of the creature anticipates the revelation of the sons of God .
45008020	For the creature was made subject to emptiness , not willingly , but for the sake of the One who made it subject , unto hope .
45008021	For the creature itself shall also be delivered from the servitude of corruption , into the liberty of the glory of the sons of God .
45008022	For we know that every creature groans inwardly , as if giving birth , even until now ;
45008023	and not only these , but also ourselves , since we hold the first-fruits of the Spirit . For we also groan within ourselves , anticipating our adoption as the sons of God , and the redemption of our body .
45008024	For we have been saved by hope . But a hope which is seen is not hope . For when a man sees something , why would he hope ?
45008025	But since we hope for what we do not see , we wait with patience .
45008026	And similarly , the Spirit also helps our weakness . For we do not know how to pray as we ought , but the Spirit himself asks on our behalf with ineffable sighing .
45008027	And he who examines hearts knows what the Spirit seeks , because he asks on behalf of the saints in accordance with God .
45008028	And we know that , for those who love God , all things work together unto good , for those who , in accordance with his purpose , are called to be saints .
45008029	For those whom he foreknew , he also predestinated , in conformity with the image of his Son , so that he might be the Firstborn among many brothers .
45008030	And those whom he predestinated , he also called . And those whom he called , he also justified . And those whom he justified , he also glorified .
45008031	So , what should we say about these things ? If God is for us , who is against us ?
45008032	He who did not spare even his own Son , but handed him over for the sake of us all , how could he not also , with him , have given us all things ?
45008033	Who will make an accusation against the elect of God ? God is the One who justifies ;
45008034	who is the one who condemns ? Christ Jesus who has died , and who has indeed also risen again , is at the right hand of God , and even now he intercedes for us .
45008035	Then who will separate us from the love of Christ ? Tribulation ? Or anguish ? Or famine ? Or nakedness ? Or peril ? Or persecution ? Or the sword ?
45008036	For it is as it has been written : “ For your sake , we are being put to death all day long . We are being treated like sheep for the slaughter . ”
45008037	But in all these things we overcome , because of him who has loved us .
45008038	For I am certain that neither death , nor life , nor Angels , nor Principalities , nor Powers , nor the present things , nor the future things , nor strength ,
45008039	nor the heights , nor the depths , nor any other created thing , will be able to separate us from the love of God , which is in Christ Jesus our Lord .
45009001	I am speaking the truth in Christ ; I am not lying . My conscience offers testimony to me in the Holy Spirit ,
45009002	because the sadness within me is great , and there is a continuous sorrow in my heart .
45009003	For I was desiring that I myself might be anathemized from Christ , for the sake of my brothers , who are my kinsmen according to the flesh .
45009004	These are the Israelites , to whom belongs adoption as sons , and the glory and the testament , and the giving and following of the law , and the promises .
45009005	Theirs are the fathers , and from them , according to the flesh , is the Christ , who is over all things , blessed God , for all eternity . Amen .
45009006	But it is not that the Word of God has perished . For not all those who are Israelites are of Israel .
45009007	And not all sons are the offspring of Abraham : “ For your offspring will be invoked in Isaac . ”
45009008	In other words , those who are the sons of God are not those who are sons of the flesh , but those who are sons of the Promise ; these are considered to be the offspring .
45009009	For the word of promise is this : “ I will return at the proper time . And there shall be a son for Sarah . ”
45009010	And she was not alone . For Rebecca also , having conceived by Isaac our father , from one act ,
45009011	when the children had not yet been born , and had not yet done anything good or bad ( such that the purpose of God might be based on their choice ) ,
45009012	and not because of deeds , but because of a calling , it was said to her : “ The elder shall serve the younger . ”
45009013	So also it was written : “ I have loved Jacob , but I have hated Esau . ”
45009014	What should we say next ? Is there unfairness with God ? Let it not be so !
45009015	For to Moses he says : “ I will pity whomever I pity . And I will offer mercy to whomever I will pity . ”
45009016	Therefore , it is not based on those who choose , nor on those who excel , but on God who takes pity .
45009017	For Scripture says to the Pharaoh : “ I have raised you up for this purpose , so that I may reveal my power by you , and so that my name may be announced to all the earth . ”
45009018	Therefore , he takes pity on whomever he wills , and he hardens whomever he wills .
45009019	And so , you would say to me : “ Then why does he still find fault ? For who can resist his will ? ”
45009020	O man , who are you to question God ? How can the thing that has been formed say to the One who formed him : “ Why have you made me this way ? ”
45009021	And does not the potter have the authority over the clay to make , from the same material , indeed , one vessel unto honor , yet truly another unto disgrace ?
45009022	What if God , wanting to reveal his wrath and to make his power known , endured , with much patience , vessels deserving wrath , fit to be destroyed ,
45009023	so that he might reveal the wealth of his glory , within these vessels of mercy , which he has prepared unto glory ?
45009024	And so it is with those of us whom he has also called , not only from among the Jews , but even from among the Gentiles ,
45009025	just as he says in Hosea : “ I will call those who were not my people , ‘ my people , ’ and she who was not beloved , ‘ beloved , ’ and she who had not obtained mercy , ‘ one who has obtained mercy . ’
45009026	And this shall be : in the place where it was said to them , ‘ You are not my people , ’ there they shall be called the sons of the living God . ”
45009027	And Isaiah cried out on behalf of Israel : “ When the number of the sons of Israel is like the sand of the sea , a remnant shall be saved .
45009028	For he shall complete his word , while abbreviating it out of equity . For the Lord shall accomplish a brief word upon the earth . ”
45009029	And it is just as Isaiah predicted : “ Unless the Lord of hosts had bequeathed offspring , we would have become like Sodom , and we would have been made similar to Gomorrah . ”
45009030	What should we say next ? That the Gentiles who did not follow justice have attained justice , even the justice that is of faith .
45009031	Yet truly , Israel , though following the law of justice , has not arrived at the law of justice .
45009032	Why is this ? Because they did not seek it from faith , but as if it were from works . For they stumbled over a stumbling block ,
45009033	just as it was written : “ Behold , I am placing a stumbling block in Zion , and a rock of scandal . But whoever believes in him shall not be confounded . ”
45010001	Brothers , certainly the will of my heart , and my prayer to God , is for them unto salvation .
45010002	For I offer testimony to them , that they have a zeal for God , but not according to knowledge .
45010003	For , being ignorant of the justice of God , and seeking to establish their own justice , they have not subjected themselves to the justice of God .
45010004	For the end of the law , Christ , is unto justice for all who believe .
45010005	And Moses wrote , about the justice that is of the law , that the man who will have done justice shall live by justice .
45010006	But the justice that is of faith speaks in this way : Do not say in your heart : “ Who shall ascend into heaven ? ” ( that is , to bring Christ down ) ;
45010007	“ Or who shall descend into the abyss ? ” ( that is , to call back Christ from the dead ) .
45010008	But what does Scripture say ? “ The word is near , in your mouth and in your heart . ” This is the word of faith , which we are preaching .
45010009	For if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus , and if you believe in your heart that God has raised him up from the dead , you shall be saved .
45010010	For with the heart , we believe unto justice ; but with the mouth , confession is unto salvation .
45010011	For Scripture says : “ All those who believe in him shall not be confounded . ”
45010012	For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek . For the same Lord is over all , richly in all who call upon him .
45010013	For all those who have called upon the name of the Lord shall be saved .
45010014	Then in what way will those who have not believed in him call upon him ? Or in what way will those who have not heard of him believe in him ? And in what way will they hear of him without preaching ?
45010015	And truly , in what way will they preach , unless they have been sent , just as it has been written : “ How beautiful are the feet of those who evangelize peace , of those who evangelize what is good ! ”
45010016	But not all are obedient to the Gospel . For Isaiah says : “ Lord , who has believed our report ? ”
45010017	Therefore , faith is from hearing , and hearing is through the Word of Christ .
45010018	But I say : Have they not heard ? For certainly : “ Their sound has gone forth throughout all the earth , and their words unto the limits of the whole world . ”
45010019	But I say : Has Israel not known ? First , Moses says : “ I will lead you into a rivalry with those who are not a nation ; in the midst of a foolish nation , I will send you into wrath . ”
45010020	And Isaiah dares to say : “ I was discovered by those who were not seeking me . I appeared openly to those who were not asking about me . ”
45010021	Then to Israel he says : “ All day long I have stretched out my hands to a people who do not believe and who contradict me . ”
45011001	Therefore , I say : Has God driven away his people ? Let it not be so ! For I , too , am an Israelite of the offspring of Abraham , from the tribe of Benjamin .
45011002	God has not driven away his people , whom he foreknew . And do you not know what Scripture says in Elijah , how he calls upon God against Israel ?
45011003	“ Lord , they have slain your Prophets . They have overturned your altars . And I alone remain , and they are seeking my life . ”
45011004	But what is the Divine response to him ? “ I have retained for myself seven thousand men , who have not bent their knees before Baal . ”
45011005	Therefore , in the same way , again in this time , there is a remnant that has been saved in accord with the choice of grace .
45011006	And if it is by grace , then it is not now by works ; otherwise grace is no longer free .
45011007	What is next ? What Israel was seeking , he has not obtained . But the elect have obtained it . And truly , these others have been blinded ,
45011008	just as it was written : “ God has given them a spirit of reluctance : eyes that do not perceive , and ears that do not hear , even until this very day . ”
45011009	And David says : “ Let their table become like a snare , and a deception , and a scandal , and a retribution for them .
45011010	Let their eyes be obscured , so that they may not see , and so that they may bow down their backs always . ”
45011011	Therefore , I say : Have they stumbled in such a way that they should fall ? Let it not be so ! Instead , by their offense , salvation is with the Gentiles , so that they may be a rival to them .
45011012	Now if their offense is the riches of the world , and if their diminution is the riches of the Gentiles , how much more is their fullness ?
45011013	For I say to you Gentiles : Certainly , as long as I am an Apostle to the Gentiles , I will honor my ministry ,
45011014	in such a way that I might provoke to rivalry those who are my own flesh , and so that I may save some of them .
45011015	For if their loss is for the reconciliation of the world , what could their return be for , except life out of death ?
45011016	For if the first-fruit has been sanctified , so also has the whole . And if the root is holy , so also are the branches .
45011017	And if some of the branches are broken , and if you , being a wild olive branch , are grafted on to them , and you become a partaker of the root and of the fatness of the olive tree ,
45011018	do not glorify yourself above the branches . For though you glory , you do not support the root , but the root supports you .
45011019	Therefore , you would say : The branches were broken off , so that I might be grafted on .
45011020	Well enough . They were broken off because of unbelief . But you stand on faith . So do not choose to savor what is exalted , but instead be afraid .
45011021	For if God has not spared the natural branches , perhaps also he might not spare you .
45011022	So then , notice the goodness and the severity of God . Certainly , toward those who have fallen , there is severity ; but toward you , there is the goodness of God , if you remain in goodness . Otherwise , you also will be cut off .
45011023	Moreover , if they do not remain in unbelief , they will be grafted on . For God is able to graft them on again .
45011024	So if you have been cut off from the wild olive tree , which is natural to you , and , contrary to nature , you are grafted on to the good olive tree , how much more shall those who are the natural branches be grafted on to their own olive tree ?
45011025	For I do not want you to be ignorant , brothers , of this mystery ( lest you seem wise only to yourselves ) that a certain blindness has occurred in Israel , until the fullness of the Gentiles has arrived .
45011026	And in this way , all of Israel may be saved , just as it was written : “ From Zion shall arrive he who delivers , and he shall turn impiety away from Jacob .
45011027	And this will be my covenant for them , when I will take away their sins . ”
45011028	Certainly , according to the Gospel , they are enemies for your sake . But according to the election , they are most beloved for the sake of the fathers .
45011029	For the gifts and the call of God are without regret .
45011030	And just as you also , in times past , did not believe in God , but now you have obtained mercy because of their unbelief ,
45011031	so also have these now not believed , for your mercy , so that they might obtain mercy also .
45011032	For God has enclosed everyone in unbelief , so that he may have mercy on everyone .
45011033	Oh , the depths of the richness of the wisdom and knowledge of God ! How incomprehensible are his judgments , and how unsearchable are his ways !
45011034	For who has known the mind of the Lord ? Or who has been his counselor ?
45011035	Or who first gave to him , so that repayment would be owed ?
45011036	For from him , and through him , and in him are all things . To him is glory , for all eternity . Amen .
45012001	And so , I beg you , brothers , by the mercy of God , that you offer your bodies as a living sacrifice , holy and pleasing to God , with the subservience of your mind .
45012002	And do not choose to be conformed to this age , but instead choose to be reformed in the newness of your mind , so that you may demonstrate what is the will of God : what is good , and what is well-pleasing , and what is perfect .
45012003	For I say , through the grace that has been given to me , to all who are among you : Taste no more than it is necessary to taste , but taste unto sobriety and just as God has distributed a share of the faith to each one .
45012004	For just as , within one body , we have many parts , though all the parts do not have the same role ,
45012005	so also we , being many , are one body in Christ , and each one is a part , the one of the other .
45012006	And we each have different gifts , according to the grace that has been given to us : whether prophecy , in agreement with the reasonableness of faith ;
45012007	or ministry , in ministering ; or he who teaches , in doctrine ;
45012008	he who exhorts , in exhortation ; he who gives , in simplicity ; he who governs , in solicitude ; he who shows mercy , in cheerfulness .
45012009	Let love be without falseness : hating evil , clinging to what is good ,
45012010	loving one another with fraternal charity , surpassing one another in honor :
45012011	in solicitude , not lazy ; in spirit , fervent ; serving the Lord ;
45012012	in hope , rejoicing ; in tribulation , enduring ; in prayer , ever-willing ;
45012013	in the difficulties of the saints , sharing ; in hospitality , attentive .
45012014	Bless those who are persecuting you : bless , and do not curse .
45012015	Rejoice with those who are rejoicing . Weep with those who are weeping .
45012016	Be of the same mind toward one another : not savoring what is exalted , but consenting in humility . Do not choose to seem wise to yourself .
45012017	Render to no one harm for harm . Provide good things , not only in the sight of God , but also in the sight of all men .
45012018	If it is possible , in so far as you are able , be at peace with all men .
45012019	Do not defend yourselves , dearest ones . Instead , step aside from wrath . For it is written : “ Vengeance is mine . I shall give retribution , says the Lord . ”
45012020	So if an enemy is hungry , feed him ; if he is thirsty , give him a drink . For in doing so , you will heap burning coals upon his head .
45012021	Do not allow evil to prevail , instead prevail over evil by means of goodness .
45013001	Let every soul be subject to higher authorities . For there is no authority except from God and those who have been ordained by God .
45013002	And so , whoever resists authority , resists what has been ordained by God . And those who resist are acquiring damnation for themselves .
45013003	For leaders are not a source of fear to those who work good , but to those who work evil . And would you prefer not to be afraid of authority ? Then do what is good , and you shall have praise from them .
45013004	For he is a minister of God for you unto good . But if you do what is evil , be afraid . For it is not without reason that he carries a sword . For he is a minister of God ; an avenger to execute wrath upon whomever does evil .
45013005	For this reason , it is necessary to be subject , not solely because of wrath , but also because of conscience .
45013006	Therefore , you must also offer tribute . For they are the ministers of God , serving him in this .
45013007	Therefore , render to all whatever is owed . Taxes , to whom taxes is due ; revenue , to whom revenue is due ; fear , to whom fear is due ; honor , to whom honor is due .
45013008	You should owe nothing to anyone , except so as to love one another . For whoever loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law .
45013009	For example : You shall not commit adultery . You shall not kill . You shall not steal . You shall not speak false testimony . You shall not covet . And if there is any other commandment , it is summed up in this word : You shall love your neighbor as yourself .
45013010	The love of neighbor does no harm . Therefore , love is the plenitude of the law .
45013011	And we know the present time , that now is the hour for us to rise up from sleep . For already our salvation is closer than when we first believed .
45013012	The night has passed , and the day draws near . Therefore , let us cast aside the works of darkness , and be clothed with the armor of light .
45013013	Let us walk honestly , as in the daylight , not in carousing and drunkenness , not in promiscuity and sexual immorality , not in contention and envy .
45013014	Instead , be clothed with the Lord Jesus Christ , and make no provision for the flesh in its desires .
45014001	But accept those who are weak in faith , without disputing about ideas .
45014002	For one person believes that he may eat all things , but if another is weak , let him eat plants .
45014003	He who eats should not despise him who does not eat . And he who does not eat should not judge him who eats . For God has accepted him .
45014004	Who are you to judge the servant of another ? He stands or falls by his own Lord . But he shall stand . For God is able to make him stand .
45014005	For one person discerns one age from the next . But another discerns unto every age . Let each one increase according to his own mind .
45014006	He who understands the age , understands for the Lord . And he who eats , eats for the Lord ; for he gives thanks to God . And he who does not eat , does not eat for the Lord , and he gives thanks to God .
45014007	For none of us lives for himself , and none of us dies for himself .
45014008	For if we live , we live for the Lord , and if we die , we die for the Lord . Therefore , whether we live or die , we belong to the Lord .
45014009	For Christ died and rose again for this purpose : that he might be the ruler of both the dead and the living .
45014010	So then , why do you judge your brother ? Or why do you despise your brother ? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ .
45014011	For it is written : “ As I live , says the Lord , every knee shall bend to me , and every tongue shall confess to God . ”
45014012	And so , each one of us shall offer an explanation of himself to God .
45014013	Therefore , we should no longer judge one another . Instead , judge this to a greater extent : that you should not place an obstacle before your brother , nor lead him astray .
45014014	I know , with confidence in the Lord Jesus , that nothing is unclean in and of itself . But to him who considers anything to be unclean , it is unclean to him .
45014015	For if your brother is grieved because of your food , you are not now walking according to love . Do not allow your food to destroy him for whom Christ died .
45014016	Therefore , what is good for us should not be a cause of blasphemy .
45014017	For the kingdom of God is not food and drink , but rather justice and peace and joy , in the Holy Spirit .
45014018	For he who serves Christ in this , pleases God and is proven before men .
45014019	And so , let us pursue the things that are of peace , and let us keep to the things that are for the edification of one another .
45014020	Do not be willing to destroy the work of God because of food . Certainly , all things are clean . But there is harm for a man who offends by eating .
45014021	It is good to refrain from eating meat and from drinking wine , and from anything by which your brother is offended , or led astray , or weakened .
45014022	Do you have faith ? It belongs to you , so hold it before God . Blessed is he who does not judge himself in that by which he is tested .
45014023	But he who discerns , if he eats , is condemned , because it is not of faith . For all that is not of faith is sin .
45015001	But we who are stronger must bear with the feebleness of the weak , and not so as to please ourselves .
45015002	Each one of you should please his neighbor unto good , for edification .
45015003	For even Christ did not please himself , but as it was written : “ The reproaches of those who reproached you fell upon me . ”
45015004	For whatever was written , was written to teach us , so that , through patience and the consolation of the Scriptures , we might have hope .
45015005	So may the God of patience and solace grant you to be of one mind toward one another , in accord with Jesus Christ ,
45015006	so that , together with one mouth , you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
45015007	For this reason , accept one another , just as Christ also has accepted you , in the honor of God .
45015008	For I declare that Christ Jesus was the minister of circumcision because of the truth of God , so as to confirm the promises to the fathers ,
45015009	and that the Gentiles are to honor God because of his mercy , just as it was written : “ Because of this , I will confess you among the Gentiles , O Lord , and I will sing to your name . ”
45015010	And again , he says : “ Rejoice , O Gentiles , along with his people . ”
45015011	And again : “ All Gentiles , praise the Lord ; and all peoples , magnify him . ”
45015012	And again , Isaiah says : “ There shall be a root of Jesse , and he shall rise up to rule the Gentiles , and in him the Gentiles shall hope . ”
45015013	So may the God of hope fill you with every joy and with peace in believing , so that you may abound in hope and in the virtue of the Holy Spirit .
45015014	But I am also certain about you , my brothers , that you also have been filled with love , completed with all knowledge , so that you are able to admonish one another .
45015015	But I have written to you , brothers , more boldly than to the others , as if calling you to mind again , because of the grace which has been given to me from God ,
45015016	so that I may be a minister of Christ Jesus among the Gentiles , sanctifying the Gospel of God , in order that the oblation of the Gentiles may be made acceptable and may be sanctified in the Holy Spirit .
45015017	Therefore , I have glory in Christ Jesus before God .
45015018	So I dare not speak of any of those things which Christ does not effect through me , unto the obedience of the Gentiles , in word and deed ,
45015019	with the power of signs and wonders , by power of the Holy Spirit . For in this way , from Jerusalem , throughout its surroundings , as far as Illyricum , I have replenished the Gospel of Christ .
45015020	And so I have preached this Gospel , not where Christ was known by name , lest I build upon the foundation of another ,
45015021	but just as it was written : “ Those to whom he was not announced shall perceive , and those who have not heard shall understand . ”
45015022	Because of this also , I was greatly hindered in coming to you , and I have been prevented until the present time .
45015023	Yet truly now , having no other destination in these regions , and having already had a great desire to come to you over the past many years ,
45015024	when I begin to set out on my journey to Spain , I hope that , as I pass by , I may see you , and I may be guided from there by you , after first having borne some fruit among you .
45015025	But next I will set out for Jerusalem , to minister to the saints .
45015026	For those of Macedonia and Achaia have decided to make a collection for those of the poor among the saints who are at Jerusalem .
45015027	And this has pleased them , because they are in their debt . For , since the Gentiles have become partakers of their spiritual things , they also ought to minister to them in worldly things .
45015028	Therefore , when I have completed this task , and have consigned to them this fruit , I shall set out , by way of you , to Spain .
45015029	And I know that when I come to you I shall arrive with an abundance of the blessings of the Gospel of Christ .
45015030	Therefore , I beg you , brothers , through our Lord Jesus Christ and though the love of the Holy Spirit , that you assist me with your prayers to God on my behalf ,
45015031	so that I may be freed from the unfaithful who are in Judea , and so that the oblation of my service may be acceptable to the saints in Jerusalem .
45015032	So may I come to you with joy , through the will of God , and so may I be refreshed with you .
45015033	And may the God of peace be with you all . Amen .
45016001	Now I commend to you our sister Phoebe , who is in the ministry of the church , which is at Cenchreae ,
45016002	so that you may receive her in the Lord with the worthiness of the saints , and so that you may be of assistance to her in whatever task she will have need of you . For she herself has also assisted many , and myself also .
45016003	Greet Prisca and Aquila , my helpers in Christ Jesus ,
45016004	who have risked their own necks on behalf of my life , for whom I give thanks , not I alone , but also all the churches of the Gentiles ;
45016005	and greet the church at their house . Greet Epaenetus , my beloved , who is among the first-fruits of Asia in Christ .
45016006	Greet Mary , who has labored much among you .
45016007	Greet Andronicus and Junias , my kinsmen and fellow captives , who are noble among the Apostles , and who were in Christ prior to me .
45016008	Greet Ampliatus , most beloved to me in the Lord .
45016009	Greet Urbanus , our helper in Christ Jesus , and Stachys , my beloved .
45016010	Greet Apelles , who has been tested in Christ .
45016011	Greet those who are from the household of Aristobulus . Greet Herodian , my kinsman . Greet those who are of the household of Narcissus , who are in the Lord .
45016012	Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa , who labor in the Lord . Greet Persis , most beloved , who has labored much in the Lord .
45016013	Greet Rufus , elect in the Lord , and his mother and mine .
45016014	Greet Asyncritus , Phlegon , Hermas , Patrobas , Hermes , and the brothers who are with them .
45016015	Greet Philologus and Julia , Nereus and his sister , and Olympas , and all the saints who are with them .
45016016	Greet one another with a holy kiss . All the churches of Christ greet you .
45016017	But I beg you , brothers , to take note of those who cause dissensions and offenses contrary to the doctrine that you have learned , and to turn away from them .
45016018	For ones such as these do not serve Christ our Lord , but their inner selves , and , through pleasing words and skillful speaking , they seduce the hearts of the innocent .
45016019	But your obedience has been made known in every place . And so , I rejoice in you . But I want you to be wise in what is good , and simple in what is evil .
45016020	And may the God of peace quickly crush Satan under your feet . The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you .
45016021	Timothy , my fellow laborer , greets you , and Lucius and Jason and Sosipater , my kinsmen .
45016022	I , Tertius , who wrote this epistle , greet you in the Lord .
45016023	Gaius , my host , and the entire church , greets you . Erastus , the treasurer of the city , greets you , and Quartus , a brother .
45016024	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all . Amen .
45016025	But to him who is able to confirm you according to my Gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ , in accord with the revelation of the mystery which has been hidden from time immemorial ,
45016026	( which now has been made clear through the Scriptures of the Prophets , in accord with the precept of the eternal God , unto the obedience of faith ) which has been made known among all the Gentiles :
45016027	to God , who alone is wise , through Jesus Christ , to him be honor and glory forever and ever . Amen .
46001001	Paul , called as an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God ; and Sosthenes , a brother :
46001002	to the Church of God which is at Corinth , to those sanctified in Christ Jesus , called to be saints with all who are invoking the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place of theirs and of ours .
46001003	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
46001004	I give thanks to my God continuously for you because of the grace of God that has been given to you in Christ Jesus .
46001005	By that grace , in all things , you have become wealthy in him , in every word and in all knowledge .
46001006	And so , the testimony of Christ has been strengthened in you .
46001007	In this way , nothing is lacking to you in any grace , as you await the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ .
46001008	And he , too , will strengthen you , even until the end , without guilt , until the day of the advent of our Lord Jesus Christ .
46001009	God is faithful . Through him , you have been called into the fellowship of his Son , Jesus Christ our Lord .
46001010	And so , I beg you , brothers , by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that every one of you speak in the same way , and that there be no schisms among you . So may you become perfect , with the same mind and with the same judgment .
46001011	For it has been indicated to me , about you , my brothers , by those who are with Chloes , that there are contentions among you .
46001012	Now I say this because each of you is saying : “ Certainly , I am of Paul ; ” “ But I am of Apollo ; ” “ Truly , I am of Cephas ; ” as well as : “ I am of Christ . ”
46001013	Has Christ been divided ? Was Paul crucified for you ? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul ?
46001014	I give thanks to God that I have baptized none of you , except Crispus and Gaius ,
46001015	lest anyone say that you have been baptized in my name .
46001016	And I also baptized the household of Stephanus . Other than these , I do not recall if I baptized any others .
46001017	For Christ did not send me to baptize , but to evangelize : not through the wisdom of words , lest the cross of Christ become empty .
46001018	For the Word of the Cross is certainly foolishness to those who are perishing . But to those who have been saved , that is , to us , it is the power of God .
46001019	For it has been written : “ I will perish the wisdom of the wise , and I will reject the discernment of the prudent . ”
46001020	Where are the wise ? Where are the scribes ? Where are the truth-seekers of this age ? Has not God made the wisdom of this world into foolishness ?
46001021	For the world did not know God through wisdom , and so , in the wisdom of God , it pleased God to accomplish the salvation of believers , through the foolishness of our preaching .
46001022	For the Jews ask for signs , and the Greeks seek wisdom .
46001023	But we are preaching Christ crucified . Certainly , to the Jews , this is a scandal , and to the Gentiles , this is foolishness .
46001024	But to those who have been called , Jews as well as Greeks , the Christ is the virtue of God and the wisdom of God .
46001025	For what is foolishness to God is considered wise by men , and that which is weakness to God is considered strong by men .
46001026	So take care of your vocation , brothers . For not many are wise according to the flesh , not many are powerful , not many are noble .
46001027	But God has chosen the foolish of the world , so that he may confound the wise . And God has chosen the weak of the world , so that he may confound the strong .
46001028	And God has chosen the ignoble and contemptible of the world , those who are nothing , so that he may reduce to nothing those who are something .
46001029	So then , nothing that is of the flesh should glory in his sight .
46001030	But you are of him in Christ Jesus , who was made by God to be our wisdom and justice and sanctification and redemption .
46001031	And so , in the same way , it was written : “ Whoever glories , should glory in the Lord . ”
46002001	And so , brothers , when I came to you , announcing to you the testimony of Christ , I did not bring exalted words or lofty wisdom .
46002002	For I did not judge myself to know anything among you , except Jesus Christ , and him crucified .
46002003	And I was with you in weakness , and in fear , and with much trembling .
46002004	And my words and preaching were not the persuasive words of human wisdom , but were a manifestation of the Spirit and of virtue ,
46002005	so that your faith would not be based on the wisdom of men , but on the virtue of God .
46002006	Now , we do speak wisdom among the perfect , yet truly , this is not the wisdom of this age , nor that of the leaders of this age , which shall be reduced to nothing .
46002007	Instead , we speak of the wisdom of God in a mystery which has been hidden , which God predestined before this age for our glory ,
46002008	something that none of the leaders of this world have known . For if they had known it , they would never have crucified the Lord of glory .
46002009	But this is just as it has been written : “ The eye has not seen , and the ear has not heard , nor has it entered into the heart of man , what things God has prepared for those who love him . ”
46002010	But God has revealed these things to us through his Spirit . For the Spirit searches all things , even the depths of God .
46002011	And who can know the things that are of a man , except the spirit which is within that man ? So also , no one knows the things which are of God , except the Spirit of God .
46002012	But we have not received the spirit of this world , but the Spirit who is of God , so that we may understand the things that have been given to us by God .
46002013	And we are also speaking of these things , not in the learned words of human wisdom , but in the doctrine of the Spirit , bringing spiritual things together with spiritual things .
46002014	But the animal nature of man does not perceive these things that are of the Spirit of God . For it is foolishness to him , and he is not able to understand it , because it must be examined spiritually .
46002015	But the spiritual nature of man judges all things , and he himself may be judged by no man .
46002016	For who has known the mind of the Lord , so that he may instruct him ? But we have the mind of Christ .
46003001	And so , brothers , I was not able to speak to you as if to those who are spiritual , but rather as if to those who are carnal . For you are like infants in Christ .
46003002	I gave you milk to drink , not solid food . For you were not yet able . And indeed , even now , you are not able ; for you are still carnal .
46003003	And since there is still envy and contention among you , are you not carnal , and are you not walking according to man ?
46003004	For if one says , “ Certainly , I am of Paul , ” while another says , “ I am of Apollo , ” are you not men ? But what is Apollo , and what is Paul ?
46003005	We are only the ministers of him in whom you have believed , just as the Lord has granted to each of you .
46003006	I planted , Apollo watered , but God provided the growth .
46003007	And so , neither he who plants , nor he who waters , is anything , but only God , who provides the growth .
46003008	Now he who plants , and he who waters , are one . But each shall receive his proper reward , according to his labors .
46003009	For we are God’s assistants . You are God’s cultivation ; you are God’s construction .
46003010	According to the grace of God , which has been given to me , I have laid the foundation like a wise architect . But another builds upon it . So then , let each one be careful how he builds upon it .
46003011	For no one is able to lay any other foundation , in place of that which has been laid , which is Christ Jesus .
46003012	But if anyone builds upon this foundation , whether gold , silver , precious stones , wood , hay , or stubble ,
46003013	each one’s work shall be made manifest . For the day of the Lord shall declare it , because it will be revealed by fire . And this fire will test each one’s work , as to what kind it is .
46003014	If anyone’s work , which he has built upon it , remains , then he will receive a reward .
46003015	If anyone’s work is burned up , he will suffer its loss , but he himself will still be saved , but only as through fire .
46003016	Do you not know that you are the Temple of God , and that the Spirit of God lives within you ?
46003017	But if anyone violates the Temple of God , God will destroy him . For the Temple of God is holy , and you are that Temple .
46003018	Let no one deceive himself . If anyone among you seems to be wise in this age , let him become foolish , so that he may be truly wise .
46003019	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God . And so it has been written : “ I will catch the wise in their own astuteness . ”
46003020	And again : “ The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise , that they are vain . ”
46003021	And so , let no one glory in men .
46003022	For all is yours : whether Paul , or Apollo , or Cephas , or the world , or life , or death , or the present , or the future . Yes , all is yours .
46003023	But you are Christ’s , and Christ is God’s .
46004001	Accordingly , let man consider us to be ministers of Christ and attendants of the mysteries of God .
46004002	Here and now , it is required of attendants that each one be found to be faithful .
46004003	But as for me , it is such a small thing to be judged by you , or by the age of mankind . And neither do I judge myself .
46004004	For I have nothing on my conscience . But I am not justified by this . For the Lord is the One who judges me .
46004005	And so , do not choose to judge before the time , until the Lord returns . He will illuminate the hidden things of the darkness , and he will make manifest the decisions of hearts . And then each one shall have praise from God .
46004006	And so , brothers , I have presented these things in myself and in Apollo , for your sakes , so that you may learn , through us , that no one should be inflated against one person and for another , not beyond what has been written .
46004007	For what distinguishes you from another ? And what do you have that you have not received ? But if you have received it , why do you glory , as if you had not received it ?
46004008	So , now you have been filled , and now you have been made wealthy , as if to reign without us ? But I wish that you would reign , so that we , too , might reign with you !
46004009	For I think that God has presented us as the last Apostles , as those destined for death . For we have been made into a spectacle for the world , and for Angels , and for men .
46004010	So we are fools because of Christ , but you are discerning in Christ ? We are weak , but you are strong ? You are noble , but we are ignoble ?
46004011	Even to this very hour , we hunger and thirst , and we are naked and repeatedly beaten , and we are unsteady .
46004012	And we labor , working with our own hands . We are slandered , and so we bless . We suffer and endure persecution .
46004013	We are cursed , and so we pray . We have become like the refuse of this world , like the reside of everything , even until now .
46004014	I am not writing these things in order to confound you , but in order to admonish you , as my dearest sons .
46004015	For you might have ten thousand instructors in Christ , but not so many fathers . For in Christ Jesus , through the Gospel , I have begotten you .
46004016	Therefore , I beg you , be imitators of me , just as I am of Christ .
46004017	For this reason , I have sent you Timothy , who is my dearest son , and who is faithful in the Lord . He will remind you of my ways , which are in Christ Jesus , just as I teach everywhere , in every church .
46004018	Certain persons have become inflated in thinking that I would not return to you .
46004019	But I will return to you soon , if the Lord is willing . And I will consider , not the words of those who are inflated , but the virtue .
46004020	For the kingdom of God is not in words , but in virtue .
46004021	What would you prefer ? Should I return to you with a rod , or with charity and a spirit of meekness ?
46005001	Above all else , it is being said that there is fornication among you , even fornication of a such kind that is not among the Gentiles , so that someone would have the wife of his father .
46005002	And yet you are inflated , and you have not instead been grieved , so that he who has done this thing would be taken away from your midst .
46005003	Certainly , though absent in body , I am present in spirit . Thus , I have already judged , as if I were present , him who has done this .
46005004	In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , you have been gathered together with my spirit , in the power of our Lord Jesus ,
46005005	to hand over such a one as this to Satan , for the destruction of the flesh , so that the spirit may be saved in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ .
46005006	It is not good for you to glory . Do you not know that a little leaven corrupts the entire mass ?
46005007	Purge the old leaven , so that you may become the new bread , for you are unleavened . For Christ , our Passover , has now been immolated .
46005008	And so , let us feast , not with the old leaven , not with the leaven of malice and wickedness , but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth .
46005009	As I have written to you in an epistle : “ Do not associate with fornicators , ”
46005010	certainly not with the fornicators of this world , nor with the greedy , nor with robbers , nor with the servants of idolatry . Otherwise , you ought to depart from this world .
46005011	But now I have written to you : do not associate with anyone who is called a brother and yet is a fornicator , or greedy , or a servant of idolatry , or a slanderer , or inebriated , or a robber . With such a one as this , do not even take food .
46005012	For what have I to do with judging those who are outside ? But do not even you yourselves judge those who are inside ?
46005013	For those who are outside , God will judge . But send this evil person away from yourselves .
46006001	How is it that anyone of you , having a dispute against another , would dare to be judged before the iniquitous , and not before the saints ?
46006002	Or do you not know that the saints from this age shall judge it ? And if the world is to be judged by you , are you unworthy , then , to judge even the smallest matters ?
46006003	Do you not know that we shall judge angels ? How much more the things of this age ?
46006004	Therefore , if you have matters to judge concerning this age , why not appoint those who are most contemptible in the Church to judge these things !
46006005	But I am speaking so as to shame you . Is there no one among you wise enough , so that he might be able to judge between his brothers ?
46006006	Instead , brother contends against brother in court , and this before the unfaithful !
46006007	Now there is certainly an offense among you , beyond everything else , when you have court cases against one another . Should you not accept injury instead ? Should you not endure being cheated instead ?
46006008	But you are doing the injuring and the cheating , and this toward brothers !
46006009	Do you not know that the iniquitous will not possess the kingdom of God ? Do not choose to wander astray . For neither fornicators , nor servants of idolatry , nor adulterers ,
46006010	nor the effeminate , nor males who sleep with males , nor thieves , nor the avaricious , nor the inebriated , nor slanderers , nor the rapacious shall possess the kingdom of God .
46006011	And some of you were like this . But you have been absolved , but you have been sanctified , but you have been justified : all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God .
46006012	All is lawful to me , but not all is expedient . All is lawful to me , but I will not be driven back by the authority of anyone .
46006013	Food is for the stomach , and the stomach is for food . But God shall destroy both the stomach and food . And the body is not for fornication , but rather for the Lord ; and the Lord is for the body .
46006014	Truly , God has raised up the Lord , and he will raise us up by his power .
46006015	Do you not know that your bodies are a part of Christ ? So then , should I take a part of Christ and make it a part of a harlot ? Let it not be so !
46006016	And do you not know that whoever is joined to a harlot becomes one body ? “ For the two , ” he said , “ shall be as one flesh . ”
46006017	But whoever is joined to the Lord is one spirit .
46006018	Flee from fornication . Every sin whatsoever that a man commits is outside of the body , but whoever fornicates , sins against his own body .
46006019	Or do you not know that your bodies are the Temple of the Holy Spirit , who is in you , whom you have from God , and that you are not your own ?
46006020	For you have been bought at a great price . Glorify and carry God in your body .
46007001	Now concerning the things about which you wrote to me : It is good for a man not to touch a woman .
46007002	But , because of fornication , let each man have his own wife , and let each woman have her own husband .
46007003	A husband should fulfill his obligation to his wife , and a wife should also act similarly toward her husband .
46007004	It is not the wife , but the husband , who has power over her body . But , similarly also , it is not the husband , but the wife , who has power over his body .
46007005	So , do not fail in your obligations to one another , except perhaps by consent , for a limited time , so that you may empty yourselves for prayer . And then , return together again , lest Satan tempt you by means of your abstinence .
46007006	But I am saying this , neither as an indulgence , nor as a commandment .
46007007	For I would prefer it if you were all like myself . But each person has his proper gift from God : one in this way , yet another in that way .
46007008	But I say to the unmarried and to widows : It is good for them , if they would remain as they are , just as I also am .
46007009	But if they cannot restrain themselves , they should marry . For it is better to marry , than to be burned .
46007010	But to those who have been joined in matrimony , it is not I who commands you , but the Lord : a wife is not to separate from her husband .
46007011	But if she has separated from him , she must remain unmarried , or be reconciled to her husband . And a husband should not divorce his wife .
46007012	Concerning the rest , I am speaking , not the Lord . If any brother has an unbelieving wife , and she consents to live with him , he should not divorce her .
46007013	And if any woman has an unbelieving husband , and he consents to live with her , she should not divorce her husband .
46007014	For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified through the believing wife , and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified through the believing husband . Otherwise , your children would be unclean , whereas instead they are holy .
46007015	But if the unbeliever departs , let him depart . For a brother or sister cannot be made subject to servitude in this way . For God has called us to peace .
46007016	And how do you know , wife , whether you will save your husband ? Or how do you know , husband , whether you will save your wife ?
46007017	However , let each one walk just as the Lord has distributed to him , each one just as God has called him . And thus do I teach in all the churches .
46007018	Has any circumcised man been called ? Let him not cover his circumcision . Has any uncircumcised man been called ? Let him not be circumcised .
46007019	Circumcision is nothing , and uncircumcision is nothing ; there is only the observance of the commandments of God .
46007020	Let each and every one remain in the same calling to which he was called .
46007021	Are you a servant who has been called ? Do not be concerned about it . But if you ever have the ability to be free , make use of it .
46007022	For any servant who has been called in the Lord is free in the Lord . Similarly , any free person who has been called is a servant in Christ .
46007023	You have been bought with a price . Do not be willing to become the servants of men .
46007024	Brothers , let each one , in whatever state he was called , remain in that state with God .
46007025	Now , concerning virgins , I have no commandment from the Lord . But I give counsel , as one who has obtained the mercy of the Lord , so as to be faithful .
46007026	Therefore , I consider this to be good , because of the present necessity : that it is good for a man to be such as I am .
46007027	Are you bound to a wife ? Do not seek to be freed . Are you free of a wife ? Do not seek a wife .
46007028	But if you take a wife , you have not sinned . And if a virgin has married , she has not sinned . Even so , such as these will have the tribulation of the flesh . But I would spare you from this .
46007029	And so , this is what I say , brothers : The time is short . What remains of it is such that : those who have wives should be as if they had none ;
46007030	and those who weep , as though they were not weeping ; and those who rejoice , as if they were not rejoicing ; and those who buy , as if they possessed nothing ;
46007031	and those who use the things of this world , as if they were not using them . For the figure of this world is passing away .
46007032	But I would prefer you to be without worry . Whoever is without a wife is worried about the things of the Lord , as to how he may please God .
46007033	But whoever is with a wife is worried about the things of the world , as to how he may please his wife . And so , he is divided .
46007034	And the unmarried woman and the virgin think about the things that are of the Lord , so that she may be holy in body and in spirit . But she who is married thinks about the things that are of the world , as to how she may please her husband .
46007035	Furthermore , I am saying this for your own benefit , not in order to cast a snare over you , but toward whatever is honest and whatever may provide you with the ability to be without hindrance , so as to worship the Lord .
46007036	But if any man considers himself to seem dishonorable , concerning a virgin who is of adult age , and so it ought to be , he may do as he wills . If he marries her , he does not sin .
46007037	But if he has decided firmly in his heart , and he does not have any obligation , but only the power of his free will , and if he has judged this in his heart , to let her remain a virgin , he does well .
46007038	And so , he who joins with his virgin in matrimony does well , and he who does not join with her does better .
46007039	A woman is bound under the law for as long as her husband lives . But if her husband has died , she is free . She may marry whomever she wishes , but only in the Lord .
46007040	But she will be more blessed , if she remains in this state , in accord with my counsel . And I think that I , too , have the Spirit of God .
46008001	Now concerning those things that are sacrificed to idols : we know that we all have knowledge . Knowledge puffs up , but charity builds up .
46008002	But if anyone considers himself to know anything , he does not yet know in the way that he ought to know .
46008003	For if anyone loves God , he is known by him .
46008004	But as to the foods that are immolated to idols , we know that an idol in the world is nothing , and that no one is God , except One .
46008005	For although there are things that are called gods , whether in heaven or on earth , ( if one even considers there to be many gods and many lords )
46008006	yet we know that there is only one God , the Father , from whom all things are , and in whom we are , and one Lord Jesus Christ , through whom all things are , and by whom we are .
46008007	But knowledge is not in everyone . For some persons , even now , with consent to an idol , eat what has been sacrificed to an idol . And their conscience , being infirm , becomes polluted .
46008008	Yet food does not commend us to God . For if we eat , we will not have more , and if we do not eat , we will not have less .
46008009	But be careful not to let your liberty become a cause of sin to those who are weak .
46008010	For if anyone sees someone with knowledge sitting down to eat in idolatry , will not his own conscience , being infirm , be emboldened to eat what has been sacrificed to idols ?
46008011	And should an infirm brother perish by your knowledge , even though Christ died for him ?
46008012	So when you sin in this way against the brothers , and you harm their weakened conscience , then you sin against Christ .
46008013	Because of this , if food leads my brother to sin , I will never eat meat , lest I lead my brother to sin .
46009001	Am I not free ? Am I not an Apostle ? Have I not seen Christ Jesus our Lord ? Are you not my work in the Lord ?
46009002	And if I am not an Apostle to others , yet still I am to you . For you are the seal of my Apostleship in the Lord .
46009003	My defense with those who question me is this :
46009004	Do we not have the authority to eat and to drink ?
46009005	Do we not have the authority to travel around with a woman who is a sister , just as do the other Apostles , and the brothers of the Lord , and Cephas ?
46009006	Or is it only myself and Barnabas who do not have the authority to act in this way ?
46009007	Who has ever served as a soldier and paid his own stipend ? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat from its produce ? Who pastures a flock and does not drink from the milk of the flock ?
46009008	Am I saying these things according to man ? Or does the law not also say these things ?
46009009	For it is written in the law of Moses : “ You shall not bind the mouth of an ox , while it is treading out the grain . ” Is God here concerned with the oxen ?
46009010	Or is he saying this , indeed , for our sake ? These things were written specifically for us , because he who plows , ought to plow in hope , and he who threshes , too , in hope of receiving the produce .
46009011	If we have sown spiritual things in you , is it important if we harvest from your worldly things ?
46009012	If others are sharers in this authority over you , why are we not more entitled ? And yet we have not used this authority . Instead , we bear all things , lest we give any hindrance to the Gospel of Christ .
46009013	Do you not know that those who work in the holy place eat the things that are for the holy place , and that those who serve at the altar also share with the altar ?
46009014	So , too , has the Lord ordained that those who announce the Gospel should live by the Gospel .
46009015	Yet I have used none of these things . And I have not written so that these things may be done for me . For it is better for me to die , rather than to let anyone empty out my glory .
46009016	For if I preach the Gospel , it is not glory for me . For an obligation has been laid upon me . And woe to me , if I do not preach the Gospel .
46009017	For if I do this willingly , I have a reward . But if I do this reluctantly , a dispensation is granted to me .
46009018	And what , then , would be my reward ? So , when preaching the Gospel , I should give the Gospel without taking , so that I may not misuse my authority in the Gospel .
46009019	For when I was a free man to all , I made myself the servant of all , so that I might gain all the more .
46009020	And so , to the Jews , I became like a Jew , so that I might gain the Jews .
46009021	To those who are under the law , I became as if I were under the law , ( though I was not under the law ) so that I might gain those who were under the law . To those who were without the law , I became as if I were without the law , ( though I was not without the law of God , being in the law of Christ ) so that I might gain those who were without the law .
46009022	To the weak , I became weak , so that I might gain the weak . To all , I became all , so that I might save all .
46009023	And I do everything for the sake of the Gospel , so that I may become its partner .
46009024	Do you not know that , of those who run in a race , all of them , certainly , are runners , but only one achieves the prize . Similarly , you must run , so that you may achieve .
46009025	And one who competes in a contest abstains from all things . And they do this , of course , so that they may achieve a corruptible crown . But we do this , so that we may achieve what is incorruptible .
46009026	And so I run , but not with uncertainty . And so I fight , but not by flailing in the air .
46009027	Instead , I chastise my body , so as to redirect it into servitude . Otherwise , I might preach to others , but become myself an outcast .
46010001	For I do not want you to be ignorant , brothers , that our fathers were all under the cloud , and they all went across the sea .
46010002	And in Moses , they all were baptized , in the cloud and in the sea .
46010003	And they all ate of the same spiritual food .
46010004	And they all drank of the same spiritual drink . And so , they all were drinking of the spiritual rock seeking to obtain them ; and that rock was Christ .
46010005	But with most of them , God was not well-pleased . For they were struck down in the desert .
46010006	Now these things were done as an example for us , so that we might not desire evil things , just as they desired .
46010007	And so , do not take part in idolatry , as some of them did , just as it was written : “ The people sat down to eat and to drink , and then they rose up to amuse themselves . ”
46010008	And let us not commit fornication , as some of them fornicated , and so twenty-three thousand fell on one day .
46010009	And let us not tempt Christ , as some of them tempted , and so they perished by serpents .
46010010	And you should not murmur , as some of them murmured , and so they perished by the destroyer .
46010011	Now all of these things happened to them as an example , and so they have been written for our correction , because the final age has fallen upon us .
46010012	And so , whosoever considers himself to be standing , let him be careful not to fall .
46010013	Temptation should not take hold of you , except what is human . For God is faithful , and he will not permit you to be tempted beyond your ability . Instead , he will effect his Providence , even during temptation , so that you may be able to bear it .
46010014	Because of this , most beloved of mine , flee from the worship of idols .
46010015	Since I am speaking to those who are prudent , judge what I say for yourselves .
46010016	The cup of benediction that we bless , is it not a communion in the Blood of Christ ? And the bread that we break , is it not a participation in the Body of the Lord ?
46010017	Through the one bread , we , though many , are one body : all of us who are partakers of the one bread .
46010018	Consider Israel , according to the flesh . Are not those who eat from the sacrifices partakers of the altar ?
46010019	What is next ? Should I say that what is immolated to idols is anything ? Or that the idol is anything ?
46010020	But the things that the Gentiles immolate , they immolate to demons , and not to God . And I do not want you to become partakers with demons .
46010021	You cannot drink the cup of the Lord , and the cup of demons . You cannot be partakers of the table of the Lord , and partakers of the table of demons .
46010022	Or should we provoke the Lord to jealousy ? Are we stronger than he is ? All is lawful to me , but not all is expedient .
46010023	All is lawful to me , but not all is edifying .
46010024	Let no one seek for himself , but for others .
46010025	Whatever is sold in the market , you may eat , without asking questions for the sake of conscience .
46010026	“ The earth and all its fullness belong to the Lord . ”
46010027	If you are invited by any unbelievers , and you are willing to go , you may eat whatever is set before you , without asking questions for the sake of conscience .
46010028	But if anyone says , “ This has been sacrificed to idols , ” do not eat it , for the sake of the one who told you , and for the sake of conscience .
46010029	But I am referring to the conscience of the other person , not to yours . For why should my liberty be judged by the conscience of another ?
46010030	If I partake with thanksgiving , why should I be slandered over that for which I give thanks ?
46010031	Therefore , whether you eat or drink , or whatever else you may do , do everything for the glory of God .
46010032	Be without offense toward the Jews , and toward the Gentiles , and toward the Church of God ,
46010033	just as I also , in all things , please everyone , not seeking what is best for myself , but what is best for many others , so that they may be saved .
46011001	Be imitators of me , as I also am of Christ .
46011002	Now I praise you , brothers , because you are mindful of me in everything , in such a way as to hold to my precepts as I have handed them down to you .
46011003	So I want you to know that the head of every man is Christ . But the head of woman is man . Yet truly , the head of Christ is God .
46011004	Every man praying or prophesying with his head covered disgraces his head .
46011005	But every woman praying or prophesying with her head not covered disgraces her head . For it is the same as if her head were shaven .
46011006	So if a woman is not veiled , let her hair be cut off . Truly then , if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut off , or to have her head shaven , then she should cover her head .
46011007	Certainly , a man ought not to cover his head , for he is the image and glory of God . But woman is the glory of man .
46011008	For man is not of woman , but woman is of man .
46011009	And indeed , man was not created for woman , but woman was created for man .
46011010	Therefore , a woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head , because of the Angels .
46011011	Yet truly , man would not exist without woman , nor would woman exist without man , in the Lord .
46011012	For just as woman came into existence from man , so also does man exist through woman . But all things are from God .
46011013	Judge for yourselves . Is it proper for a woman to pray to God unveiled ?
46011014	Does not even nature herself teach you that , indeed , if a man grows his hair long , it is a disgrace for him ?
46011015	Yet truly , if a woman grows her hair long , it is a glory for her , because her hair has been given to her as a covering .
46011016	But if anyone has a mind to be contentious , we have no such custom , nor does the Church of God .
46011017	Now I caution you , without praising , about this : that you assemble together , and not for better , but for worse .
46011018	First of all , indeed , I hear that when you assemble together in the church , there are schisms among you . And I believe this , in part .
46011019	For there must also be heresies , so that those who have been tested may be made manifest among you .
46011020	And so , when you assemble together as one , it is no longer in order to eat the Lord’s supper .
46011021	For each one first takes his own supper to eat . And as a result , one person is hungry , while another is inebriated .
46011022	Do you not have houses , in which to eat and drink ? Or do you have such contempt for the Church of God that you would confound those who do not have such contempt ? What should I say to you ? Should I praise you ? I am not praising you in this .
46011023	For I have received from the Lord what I have also delivered to you : that the Lord Jesus , on the same night that he was handed over , took bread ,
46011024	and giving thanks , he broke it , and said : “ Take and eat . This is my body , which shall be given up for you . Do this in remembrance of me . ”
46011025	Similarly also , the cup , after he had eaten supper , saying : “ This cup is the new covenant in my blood . Do this , as often as you drink it , in remembrance of me . ”
46011026	For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup , you proclaim the death of the Lord , until he returns .
46011027	And so , whoever eats this bread , or drinks from the cup of the Lord , unworthily , shall be liable of the body and blood of the Lord .
46011028	But let a man examine himself , and , in this way , let him eat from that bread , and drink from that cup .
46011029	For whoever eats and drinks unworthily , eats and drinks a sentence against himself , not discerning it to be the body of the Lord .
46011030	As a result , many are weak and sick among you , and many have fallen asleep .
46011031	But if we ourselves were discerning , then certainly we would not be judged .
46011032	Yet when we are judged , we are being corrected by the Lord , so that we might not be condemned along with this world .
46011033	And so , my brothers , when you assemble together to eat , be attentive to one another .
46011034	If anyone is hungry , let him eat at home , so that you may not assemble together unto judgment . As for the rest , I will set it in order when I arrive .
46012001	Now concerning spiritual things , I do not want you to be ignorant , brothers .
46012002	You know that when you were Gentiles , you approached mute idols , doing what you were led to do .
46012003	Because of this , I would have you know that no one speaking in the Spirit of God utters a curse against Jesus . And no one is able to say that Jesus is Lord , except in the Holy Spirit .
46012004	Truly , there are diverse graces , but the same Spirit .
46012005	And there are diverse ministries , but the same Lord .
46012006	And there are diverse works , but the same God , who works everything in everyone .
46012007	However , the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one toward what is beneficial .
46012008	Certainly , to one , through the Spirit , is given words of wisdom ; but to another , according to the same Spirit , words of knowledge ;
46012009	to another , in the same Spirit , faith ; to another , in the one Spirit , the gift of healing ;
46012010	to another , miraculous works ; to another , prophecy ; to another , the discernment of spirits ; to another , different kinds of languages ; to another , the interpretation of words .
46012011	But one and the same Spirit works all these things , distributing to each one according to his will .
46012012	For just as the body is one , and yet has many parts , so all the parts of the body , though they are many , are only one body . So also is Christ .
46012013	And indeed , in one Spirit , we were all baptized into one body , whether Jews or Gentiles , whether servant or free . And we all drank in the one Spirit .
46012014	For the body , too , is not one part , but many .
46012015	If the foot were to say , “ Because I am not the hand , I am not of the body , ” would it then not be of the body ?
46012016	And if the ear were to say , “ Because I am not the eye , I am not of the body , ” would it then not be of the body ?
46012017	If the whole body were the eye , how would it hear ? If the whole were hearing , how would it smell ?
46012018	But instead , God has placed the parts , each one of them , in the body , just as it has pleased him .
46012019	So if they were all one part , how would it be a body ?
46012020	But instead , there are many parts , indeed , yet one body .
46012021	And the eye cannot say to the hand , “ I have no need for your works . ” And again , the head cannot say to the feet , “ You are of no use to me . ”
46012022	In fact , so much more necessary are those parts of the body which seem to be weaker .
46012023	And though we consider certain parts of the body to be less noble , we surround these with more abundant dignity , and so , those parts which are less presentable end up with more abundant respect .
46012024	However , our presentable parts have no such need , since God has tempered the body together , distributing the more abundant honor to that which has the need ,
46012025	so that there might be no schism in the body , but instead the parts themselves might take care of one another .
46012026	And so , if one part suffers anything , all the parts suffer with it . Or , if one part finds glory , all the parts rejoice with it .
46012027	Now you are the body of Christ , and parts like any part .
46012028	And indeed , God has established a certain order in the Church : first Apostles , second Prophets , third Teachers , next miracle-workers , and then the grace of healing , of helping others , of governing , of different kinds of languages , and of the interpretation of words .
46012029	Are all Apostles ? Are all Prophets ? Are all Teachers ?
46012030	Are all workers of miracles ? Do all have the grace of healing ? Do all speak in tongues ? Do all interpret ?
46012031	But be zealous for the better charisms . And I reveal to you a yet more excellent way .
46013001	If I were to speak in the language of men , or of Angels , yet not have charity , I would be like a clanging bell or a crashing cymbal .
46013002	And if I have prophecy , and learn every mystery , and obtain all knowledge , and possess all faith , so that I could move mountains , yet not have charity , then I am nothing .
46013003	And if I distribute all my goods in order to feed the poor , and if I hand over my body to be burned , yet not have charity , it offers me nothing .
46013004	Charity is patient , is kind . Charity does not envy , does not act wrongly , is not inflated .
46013005	Charity is not ambitious , does not seek for itself , is not provoked to anger , devises no evil .
46013006	Charity does not rejoice over iniquity , but rejoices in truth .
46013007	Charity suffers all , believes all , hopes all , endures all .
46013008	Charity is never torn away , even if prophecies pass away , or languages cease , or knowledge is destroyed .
46013009	For we know only in part , and we prophesy only in part .
46013010	But when the perfect arrives , the imperfect passes away .
46013011	When I was a child , I spoke like a child , I understood like a child , I thought like a child . But when I became a man , I put aside the things of a child .
46013012	Now we see through a glass darkly . But then we shall see face to face . Now I know in part , but then I shall know , even as I am known .
46013013	But for now , these three continue : faith , hope , and charity . And the greatest of these is charity .
46014001	Pursue charity . Be zealous for spiritual things , but only so that you may prophesy .
46014002	For whoever speaks in tongues , speaks not to men , but to God . For no one understands . Yet by the Spirit , he speaks mysteries .
46014003	But whoever prophesies speaks to men for edification and exhortation and consolation .
46014004	Whoever speaks in tongues edifies himself . But whoever prophesies edifies the Church .
46014005	Now I want you all to speak in tongues , but more so to prophesy . For he who prophesies is greater than he who speaks in tongues , unless perhaps he interprets , so that the Church may receive edification .
46014006	But now , brothers , if I were to come to you speaking in tongues , how would it benefit you , unless instead I speak to you in revelation , or in knowledge , or in prophecy , or in doctrine ?
46014007	Even those things that are without a soul can make sounds , whether it is a wind or a stringed instrument . But unless they present a distinction within the sounds , how will it be known which is from the pipe and which is from the string ?
46014008	For example , if the trumpet made an uncertain sound , who would prepare himself for battle ?
46014009	So it is with you also , for unless you utter with the tongue in plain speech , how will it be known what is said ? For then you would be speaking into the air .
46014010	Consider that there are so many different kinds of languages in this world , and yet none is without a voice .
46014011	Therefore , if I do not understand the nature of the voice , then I shall be like a foreigner to the one with whom I am speaking ; and he who is speaking will be like a foreigner to me .
46014012	So it is with you also . And since you are zealous for what is spiritual , seek the edification of the Church , so that you may abound .
46014013	For this reason , too , whoever speaks in tongues , let him pray for the interpretation .
46014014	So , if I pray in tongues , my spirit prays , but my mind is without fruit .
46014015	What is next ? I should pray with the spirit , and also pray with the mind . I should sing psalms with the spirit , and also recite psalms with the mind .
46014016	Otherwise , if you have blessed only with the spirit , how can someone , in a state of ignorance , add an “ Amen ” to your blessing ? For he does not know what you are saying .
46014017	In this case , certainly , you give thanks well , but the other person is not edified .
46014018	I thank my God that I speak in tongues for all of you .
46014019	But in the Church , I prefer to speak five words from my mind , so that I may instruct others also , rather than ten thousand words in tongues .
46014020	Brothers , do not choose to have the minds of children . Instead , be free of malice like infants , but be mature in your minds .
46014021	It is written in the law : “ I will speak to this people with other tongues and other lips , and even so , they will not heed me , says the Lord . ”
46014022	And so , tongues are a sign , not for believers , but for unbelievers ; and prophecies are not for unbelievers , but for believers .
46014023	If then , the entire Church were to gather together as one , and if all were to speak in tongues , and then ignorant or unbelieving persons were to enter , would they not say that you were insane ?
46014024	But if everyone prophesies , and one who is ignorant or unbelieving enters , he may be convinced by it all , because he understands it all .
46014025	The secrets of his heart are then made manifest . And so , falling to his face , he would adore God , proclaiming that God is truly among you .
46014026	What is next , brothers ? When you gather together , each one of you may have a psalm , or a doctrine , or a revelation , or a language , or an interpretation , but let everything be done for edification .
46014027	If anyone is speaking in tongues , let there be only two , or at most three , and then in turn , and let someone interpret .
46014028	But if there is no one to interpret , he should remain silent in the church , then he may speak when he is alone with God .
46014029	And let the prophets speak , two or three , and let the others discern .
46014030	But then , if something is revealed to another who is sitting , let the first one become silent .
46014031	For you are all able to prophesy one at a time , so that all may learn and all may be encouraged .
46014032	For the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets .
46014033	And God is not of dissension , but of peace , just as I also teach in all the churches of the saints .
46014034	Women should be silent in the churches . For it is not permitted for them to speak ; but instead , they should be subordinate , as the law also says .
46014035	And if they want to learn anything , let them ask their husbands at home . For it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in church .
46014036	So now , did the Word of God proceed from you ? Or was it sent to you alone ?
46014037	If anyone seems to be a prophet or a spiritual person , he should understand these things which I am writing to you , that these things are the commandments of the Lord .
46014038	If anyone does not recognize these things , he should not be recognized .
46014039	And so , brothers , be zealous to prophesy , and do not prohibit speaking in tongues .
46014040	But let everything be done respectfully and according to proper order .
46015001	And so I make known to you , brothers , the Gospel that I preached to you , which you also received , and on which you stand .
46015002	By the Gospel , too , you are being saved , if you hold to the understanding that I preached to you , lest you believe in vain .
46015003	For I handed on to you , first of all , what I also received : that Christ died for our sins , according to the Scriptures ;
46015004	and that he was buried ; and that he rose again on the third day , according to the Scriptures ;
46015005	and that he was seen by Cephas , and after that by the eleven .
46015006	Next he was seen by more than five hundred brothers at one time , many of whom remain , even to the present time , although some have fallen asleep .
46015007	Next , he was seen by James , then by all the Apostles .
46015008	And last of all , he was seen also by me , as if I were someone born at the wrong time .
46015009	For I am the least of the Apostles . I am not worthy to be called an Apostle , because I persecuted the Church of God .
46015010	But , by the grace of God , I am what I am . And his grace in me has not been empty , since I have labored more abundantly than all of them . Yet it is not I , but the grace of God within me .
46015011	For whether it is I or they : so we preach , and so you have believed .
46015012	Now if Christ is preached , that he rose again from the dead , how is it that some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead ?
46015013	For if there is no resurrection of the dead , then Christ has not risen .
46015014	And if Christ has not risen , then our preaching is useless , and your faith is also useless .
46015015	Then , too , we would be found to be false witnesses of God , because we would have given testimony against God , saying that he had raised up Christ , when he had not raised him up , if , indeed , the dead do not rise again .
46015016	For if the dead do not rise again , then neither has Christ risen again .
46015017	But if Christ has not risen , then your faith is vain ; for you would still be in your sins .
46015018	Then , too , those who have fallen asleep in Christ would have perished .
46015019	If we have hope in Christ for this life only , then we are more miserable than all men .
46015020	But now Christ has risen again from the dead , as the first-fruits of those who sleep .
46015021	For certainly , death came through a man . And so , the resurrection of the dead came through a man
46015022	And just as in Adam all die , so also in Christ all will be brought to life ,
46015023	but each one in his proper order : Christ , as the first-fruits , and next , those who are of Christ , who have believed in his advent .
46015024	Afterwards is the end , when he will have handed over the kingdom to God the Father , when he will have emptied all principality , and authority , and power .
46015025	For it is necessary for him to reign , until he has set all his enemies under his feet .
46015026	Lastly , the enemy called death shall be destroyed . For he has subjected all things under his feet . And although he says ,
46015027	“ All things have been subjected to him , ” without doubt he does not include the One who has subjected all things to him .
46015028	And when all things will have been subjected to him , then even the Son himself will be subjected to the One who subjected all things to him , so that God may be all in all .
46015029	Otherwise , what will those who are being baptized for the dead do , if the dead do not rise again at all ? Why then are they being baptized for them ?
46015030	Why also do we endure trials every hour ?
46015031	Daily I die , by means of your boasting , brothers : you whom I have in Christ Jesus our Lord .
46015032	If , according to man , I fought with the beasts at Ephesus , how would that benefit me , if the dead do not rise again ? “ Let us eat and drink , for tomorrow we shall die . ”
46015033	Do not be led astray . Evil communication corrupts good morals .
46015034	Be vigilant , you just ones , and do not be willing to sin . For certain persons have an ignorance of God . I say this to you with respect .
46015035	But someone may say , “ How do the dead rise again ? ” or , “ What type of body do they return with ? ”
46015036	How foolish ! What you sow cannot be brought back to life , unless it first dies .
46015037	And what you sow is not the body that will be in the future , but a bare grain , such as of wheat , or of some other grain .
46015038	For God gives it a body according to his will , and according to each seed’s proper body .
46015039	Not all flesh is the same flesh . But one is indeed of men , another truly is of beasts , another is of birds , and another is of fish .
46015040	Also , there are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies . But while the one , certainly , has the glory of heaven , the other has the glory of earth .
46015041	One has the brightness of the sun , another the brightness of the moon , and another the brightness of the stars . For even star differs from star in brightness .
46015042	So it is also with the resurrection of the dead . What is sown in corruption shall rise to incorruption .
46015043	What is sown in dishonor shall rise to glory . What is sown in weakness shall rise to power .
46015044	What is sown with an animal body shall rise with a spiritual body . If there is an animal body , there is also a spiritual one .
46015045	Just as it was written that the first man , Adam , was made with a living soul , so shall the last Adam be made with a spirit brought back to life .
46015046	So what is , at first , not spiritual , but animal , next becomes spiritual .
46015047	The first man , being earthly , was of the earth ; the second man , being heavenly , will be of heaven .
46015048	Such things as are like the earth are earthly ; and such things as are like the heavens are heavenly .
46015049	And so , just as we have carried the image of what is earthly , let us also carry the image of what is heavenly .
46015050	Now I say this , brothers , because flesh and blood is not able to possess the kingdom of God ; neither will what is corrupt possess what is incorrupt .
46015051	Behold , I tell you a mystery . Certainly , we shall all rise again , but we shall not all be transformed :
46015052	in a moment , in the twinkling of an eye , at the last trumpet . For the trumpet will sound , and the dead will rise up , incorruptible . And we shall be transformed .
46015053	Thus , it is necessary for this corruptibility to be clothed with incorruptibility , and for this mortality to be clothed with immortality .
46015054	And when this mortality has been clothed with immortality , then the word that was written shall occur : “ Death is swallowed up in victory . ”
46015055	“ O death , where is your victory ? O death , where is your sting ? ”
46015056	Now the sting of death is sin , and the power of sin is the law .
46015057	But thanks be to God , who has given us victory through our Lord Jesus Christ .
46015058	And so , my beloved brothers , be steadfast and unmovable , abounding always in the work of the Lord , knowing that your labor is not useless in the Lord .
46016001	Now concerning the collections which are made for the saints : just as I have arranged for the churches of Galatia , so should it also be done with you .
46016002	On the first day of the week , the Sabbath , let each one of you take from himself , setting aside what will be well-pleasing to him , so that when I arrive , the collections will not have to be made then .
46016003	And when I am present , whomever you shall approve through letters , these I shall send to bear your gifts to Jerusalem .
46016004	And if it is fitting for me to go too , they shall go with me .
46016005	Now I will visit you after I have passed through Macedonia . For I will pass through Macedonia .
46016006	And perhaps I will stay with you , and even spend the winter , so that you may lead me on my way , whenever I depart .
46016007	For I am not willing to see you now only in passing , since I hope that I may remain with you for some length of time , if the Lord permits .
46016008	But I must remain at Ephesus , even until Pentecost .
46016009	For a door , great and unavoidable , has opened to me , as well as many adversaries .
46016010	Now if Timothy arrives , see to it that he may be among you without fear . For he is doing the work of the Lord , just as I also do .
46016011	Therefore , let no one despise him . Instead , lead him on his way in peace , so that he may come to me . For I am awaiting him with the brothers .
46016012	But concerning our brother , Apollo , I am letting you know that I pleaded with him greatly to go to you with the brothers , and clearly it was not his will to go at this time . But he will arrive when there is a space of time for him .
46016013	Be vigilant . Stand with faith . Act manfully and be strengthened .
46016014	Let all that is yours be immersed in charity .
46016015	And I beg you , brothers : You know the house of Stephanus , and of Fortunatus , and of Achaicus , that they are the first-fruits of Achaia , and that they have dedicated themselves to the ministry of the saints .
46016016	So you should be subject also to persons such as this , as well as to all who are cooperating and working with them .
46016017	Now I rejoice in the presence of Stephanus and Fortunatus and Achaicus , because what was lacking in you , they have supplied .
46016018	For they have refreshed my spirit and yours . Therefore , recognize persons such as this .
46016019	The churches of Asia greet you . Aquila and Priscilla greet you greatly in the Lord , with the church of their household , where I also am a guest .
46016020	All the brothers greet you . Greet one another with a holy kiss .
46016021	This is a greeting from my own hand , Paul .
46016022	If anyone does not love our Lord Jesus Christ , let him be anathema ! Maran Atha .
46016023	May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all .
46016024	My charity is with all of you in Christ Jesus . Amen .
47001001	Paul , an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God , and Timothy , a brother , to the church of God which is at Corinth , with all the saints who are in all of Achaia :
47001002	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
47001003	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of mercies and the God of all consolation .
47001004	He consoles us in all our tribulation , so that we too may be able to console those who are in any kind of distress , through the exhortation by which we also are being exhorted by God .
47001005	For just as the Passion of Christ abounds in us , so also , through Christ , does our consolation abound .
47001006	So , if we are in tribulation , it is for your exhortation and salvation , or if we are in consolation , it is for your consolation , or if we are exhorted , it is for your exhortation and salvation , which results in the patience endurance of the same passion which we also endure .
47001007	So may our hope for you be made firm , knowing that , just as you are participants in the suffering , so also shall you be participants in the consolation .
47001008	For we do not want you to be ignorant , brothers , about our tribulation , which happened to us in Asia . For we were weighed down beyond measure , beyond our strength , so that we became weary , even of life itself .
47001009	But we had within ourselves the response to death , so that we would not have faith in ourselves , but in God , who raises the dead .
47001010	He has rescued us , and he is rescuing us , from great peril . In him , we hope that he will continue to rescue us .
47001011	And you are assisting , with your prayers for us , so that from many persons , by that which is a gift in us , thanks may be given through many persons , because of us .
47001012	For our glory is this : the testimony of our conscience , which is found in simplicity of heart and in sincerity toward God . And it is not with worldly wisdom , but in the grace of God , that we have conversed with this world , and more abundantly toward you .
47001013	For we write nothing else to you other than what you have read and understood . And I hope that you will continue to understand , even unto the end .
47001014	And just as you have acknowledged us in our role , that we are your glory , so also you are ours , unto the day of our Lord Jesus Christ .
47001015	And with this confidence , I wanted to come to you sooner , so that you might have a second grace ,
47001016	and through you to pass into Macedonia , and to return to you again from Macedonia , and so be led by you on my way to Judea .
47001017	Then , although I had intended this , did I act lightly ? Or in the things that I consider , do I consider according to the flesh , so that there would be , with me , both Yes and No ?
47001018	But God is faithful , so our word , which was set before you , was not , in him , both Yes and No .
47001019	For the Son of God , Jesus Christ , who was preached among you through us , through myself and Sylvanus and Timothy , was not Yes , and No ; but was simply Yes in him .
47001020	For whatever promises are of God are , in him , Yes . For this reason , too , through him : Amen to God for our glory .
47001021	Now the One who confirms us with you in Christ , and who has anointed us , is God .
47001022	And he has sealed us , and he has placed the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts .
47001023	But I call God as a witness to my soul , that I was lenient with you , in that I did not return to Corinth :
47001024	not because we have dominion over your faith , but because we are assistants of your joy . For by faith you stand .
47002001	But I determined this within myself , not to return again to you in sorrow .
47002002	For if I make you sorrowful , then who is it that can make me glad , except the one who is made sorrowful by me ?
47002003	And so , I wrote this same thing to you , so that I might not , when I arrive , add sorrow to sorrow for those with whom I ought to rejoice , having confidence in you in all things , so that my joy may be entirely yours .
47002004	For with much tribulation and anguish of heart , I wrote to you with many tears : not so that you would be sorrowful , but so that you might know the charity that I have more abundantly toward you .
47002005	But if anyone has brought sorrow , he has not sorrowed me . Yet , for my part , this is so that I might not burden all of you .
47002006	Let this rebuke be sufficient for someone like this , for it has been brought by many .
47002007	So then , to the contrary , you should be more forgiving and consoling , lest perhaps someone like this may be overwhelmed with excessive sorrow .
47002008	Because of this , I beg you to confirm your charity toward him .
47002009	It was for this reason , also , that I wrote , so that I might know , by testing you , whether you would be obedient in all things .
47002010	But anyone whom you have forgiven of anything , I also forgive . And then , too , anyone I have forgiven , if I have forgiven anything , it was done in the person of Christ for your sakes ,
47002011	so that we would not be circumvented by Satan . For we are not ignorant of his intentions .
47002012	And when I had arrived at Troas , because of the Gospel of Christ , and a door had opened to me in the Lord ,
47002013	I had no rest within my spirit , because I was not able to find Titus , my brother . So , saying goodbye to them , I set out for Macedonia .
47002014	But thanks be to God , who always brings triumph to us in Christ Jesus , and who manifests the fragrance of his knowledge through us in every place .
47002015	For we are the sweet fragrance of Christ for God , both with those who are being saved and with those who are perishing .
47002016	To the one , certainly , the fragrance is of death unto death . But to the other , the fragrance is of life unto life . And concerning these things , who is so suitable ?
47002017	For we are not like many others , adulterating the Word of God . But instead , we speak with sincerity : from God , before God , and in Christ .
47003001	Must we begin again to commend ourselves ? Or are we in need ( as some are ) of epistles of commendation for you , or from you ?
47003002	You are our Epistle , written in our hearts , which is known and read by all men .
47003003	It has been made manifest that you are the Epistle of Christ , ministered by us , and written down , not with ink , but with the Spirit of the living God , and not on tablets of stone , but on the fleshly tablets of the heart .
47003004	And we have such faith , through Christ , toward God .
47003005	It is not that we are adequate to think anything of ourselves , as if anything was from us . But our adequacy is from God .
47003006	And he has made us suitable ministers of the New Testament , not in the letter , but in the Spirit . For the letter kills , but the Spirit gives life .
47003007	But if the ministration of death , engraved with letters upon stones , was in glory , ( so much so that the sons of Israel were not able to gaze intently upon the face of Moses , because of the glory of his countenance ) even though this ministration was ineffective ,
47003008	how could the ministration of the Spirit not be in greater glory ?
47003009	For if the ministration of condemnation is with glory , so much more is the ministration of justice abundant in glory .
47003010	And neither was it glorified by means of an excellent glory , though it was made illustrious in its own way .
47003011	For if even what was temporary has its glory , then what is lasting has an even greater glory .
47003012	Therefore , having such a hope , we act with much confidence ,
47003013	and not as Moses did , in placing a veil over his face , so that the sons of Israel would not gaze intently at his face . This was ineffective ,
47003014	for their minds were obtuse . And , even until this present day , the very same veil , in the readings from the Old Testament , remains not taken away ( though , in Christ , it is taken away ) .
47003015	But even until today , when Moses is read , a veil is still set over their hearts .
47003016	But when they will have been converted to the Lord , then the veil shall be taken away .
47003017	Now the Spirit is Lord . And wherever the Spirit of the Lord is , there is liberty .
47003018	Yet truly , all of us , as we gaze upon the unveiled glory of the face of the Lord , are transfigured into the same image , from one glory to another . And this is done by the Spirit of the Lord .
47004001	Therefore , since we have this ministry , and in as much as we have obtained mercy for ourselves , we are not inadequate .
47004002	For we renounce dishonorable and hidden acts , not walking by craftiness , nor by adulterating the Word of God . Instead , by the manifestation of truth , we commend ourselves to the conscience of each man before God .
47004003	But if our Gospel is in some way hidden , it is hidden to those who are perishing .
47004004	As for them , the god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers , so that the light of the Gospel of the glory of Christ , who is the image of God , would not shine in them .
47004005	For we are not preaching about ourselves , but about Jesus Christ our Lord . We are merely your servants through Jesus .
47004006	For God , who told the light to shine out of darkness , has shined a light into our hearts , to illuminate the knowledge of the splendor of God , in the person of Christ Jesus .
47004007	But we hold this treasure in earthen vessels , so that what is sublime may be of the power of God , and not of us .
47004008	In all things , we endure tribulation , yet we are not in anguish . We are constrained , yet we are not destitute .
47004009	We suffer persecution , yet we have not been abandoned . We are thrown down , yet we do not perish .
47004010	We ever carry around the mortification of Jesus in our bodies , so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies .
47004011	For we who live are ever handed over unto death for the sake of Jesus , so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our mortal flesh .
47004012	Therefore , death is at work in us , and life is at work in you .
47004013	But we have the same Spirit of faith . And just as it is written , “ I believed , and for that reason I spoke , ” so we also believe , and for that reason , we also speak .
47004014	For we know that the One who raised up Jesus will raise us up also with Jesus and will place us with you .
47004015	Thus , all is for you , so that grace , abounding through many in thanksgiving , may abound to the glory of God .
47004016	For this reason , we are not insufficient . But it is as though our outer man is corrupted , while our inner man is renewed from day to day .
47004017	For though our tribulation is , at the present time , brief and light , it accomplishes in us the weight of a sublime eternal glory , beyond measure .
47004018	And we are contemplating , not the things that are seen , but the things that are unseen . For the things that are seen are temporal , whereas the things that are not seen are eternal .
47005001	For we know that , when our earthly house of this habitation is dissolved , we have a building of God , a house not made with hands , eternal in heaven .
47005002	And for this reason also , we groan , desiring to be clothed from above with our habitation from heaven .
47005003	If we are so clothed , then we will not be found to be naked .
47005004	Then too , we who are in this tabernacle groan under the burden , because we do not want to be stripped , but rather to be clothed from above , so that what is mortal may be absorbed by life .
47005005	Now the One who accomplishes this very thing in us is God , who has given us the pledge of the Spirit .
47005006	Therefore , we are ever confident , knowing that , while we are in the body , we are on a pilgrimage in the Lord .
47005007	For we walk by means of faith , and not by sight .
47005008	So we are confident , and we have the good will to be on a pilgrimage in the body , so as to be present to the Lord .
47005009	And thus we struggle , whether absent or present , to please him .
47005010	For it is necessary for us to be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ , so that each one may receive the proper things of the body , according to his behavior , whether it was good or evil .
47005011	Therefore , having knowledge of the fear of the Lord , we appeal to men , but we are made manifest before God . Yet I hope , too , that we may be made manifest in your consciences .
47005012	We are not commending ourselves again to you , but rather we are presenting you with an opportunity to glory because of us , when you deal with those who glory in face , and not in heart .
47005013	For if we are excessive in mind , it is for God ; but if we are sober , it is for you .
47005014	For the charity of Christ urges us on , in consideration of this : that if one died for all , then all have died .
47005015	And Christ died for all , so that even those who live might not now live for themselves , but for him who died for them and who rose again .
47005016	And so , from now on , we know no one according to the flesh . And though we have known Christ according to the flesh , yet now we know him in this way no longer .
47005017	So if anyone is a new creature in Christ , what is old has passed away . Behold , all things have been made new .
47005018	But all is of God , who has reconciled us to himself through Christ , and who has given us the ministry of reconciliation .
47005019	For certainly God was in Christ , reconciling the world to himself , not charging them with their sins . And he has placed in us the Word of reconciliation .
47005020	Therefore , we are ambassadors for Christ , so that God is exhorting through us . We beseech you for Christ : be reconciled to God .
47005021	For God made him who did not know sin to be sin for us , so that we might become the justice of God in him .
47006001	But , as a help to you , we exhort you not to receive the grace of God in vain .
47006002	For he says : “ In a favorable time , I heeded you ; and on the day of salvation , I helped you . ” Behold , now is the favorable time ; behold , now is the day of salvation .
47006003	May we never give offense to anyone , so that our ministry may not be disparaged .
47006004	But in all things , let us exhibit ourselves as ministers of God with great patience : through tribulation , difficulties , and distress ;
47006005	despite wounds , imprisonment , and rebellion ; with hard work , vigilance , and fasting ;
47006006	by chastity , knowledge , and longsuffering ; in pleasantness , in the Holy Spirit , and in unfeigned charity ;
47006007	with the Word of truth , with the power of God , and with the armor of justice to the right and to the left ;
47006008	through honor and dishonor , despite good reports and bad , whether seen as deceivers or truth-tellers , whether ignored or acknowledged ;
47006009	as if dying and yet truly alive ; as if chastised and yet not subdued ;
47006010	as if sorrowful and yet always rejoicing ; as if needy and yet enriching many ; as if having nothing and possessing everything .
47006011	Our mouth is open to you , O Corinthians ; our heart is enlarged .
47006012	You are not narrowed by us , but it is by your own inner selves that you are narrowed .
47006013	But since we have the same recompense , ( I am speaking as if to my own sons ) , you , too , should be enlarged .
47006014	Do not choose to bear the yoke with unbelievers . For how can justice be a participant with iniquity ? Or how can the fellowship of light be a participant with darkness ?
47006015	And how can Christ join together with Belial ? Or what part do the faithful have with the unfaithful ?
47006016	And what consensus does the temple of God have with idols ? For you are the temple of the living God , just as God says : “ I will dwell with them , and I will walk among them . And I will be their God , and they shall be my people .
47006017	Because of this , you must depart from their midst and be separate , says the Lord . And do not touch what is unclean .
47006018	Then I will accept you . And I will be a Father to you , and you shall be sons and daughters to me , says the Lord Almighty . ”
47007001	Therefore , having these promises , most beloved , let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of the flesh and of the spirit , perfecting sanctification in the fear of God .
47007002	Consider us . We have injured no one ; we have corrupted no one ; we have defrauded no one .
47007003	I am not saying this to your condemnation . For we have told you before that you are in our hearts : to die together and to live together .
47007004	Great is my confidence in you . Great is my glorying over you . I have been filled with consolation . I have a superabundant joy throughout all our tribulation .
47007005	Then , too , when we had arrived in Macedonia , our flesh had no rest . Instead , we suffered every tribulation : exterior conflicts , interior fears .
47007006	But God , who consoles the humble , consoled us by the arrival of Titus ,
47007007	and not only by his arrival , but also by the consolation with which he was consoled among you . For he brought to us your desire , your weeping , your zeal for me , so that I rejoiced all the more .
47007008	For though I made you sorrowful by my epistle , I do not repent . And if I did repent , but only for a time , having realized that the same epistle made you sorrowful ,
47007009	now I am glad : not because you were sorrowful , but because you were sorrowful unto repentance . For you became sorrowful for God , so that you might not suffer any harm from us .
47007010	For the sorrow that is according to God accomplishes a repentance which is steadfast unto salvation . But the sorrow that is of the world accomplishes death .
47007011	So consider this same idea , being sorrowful according to God , and what great solicitude it accomplishes in you : including protection , and indignation , and fear , and desire , and zeal , and vindication . In all things , you have shown yourselves to be uncorrupted by this sorrow .
47007012	And so , though I wrote to you , it was not because of him who caused the injury , nor because of him who suffered from it , but so as to manifest our solicitude , which we have for you before God .
47007013	Therefore , we have been consoled . But in our consolation , we have rejoiced even more abundantly over the joy of Titus , because his spirit was refreshed by all of you .
47007014	And if I have gloried in anything to him about you , I have not been put to shame . But , just as we have spoken all things to you in truth , so also our glorying before Titus has been the truth .
47007015	And his feelings are now more abundant toward you , since he remembers the obedience of you all , and how you received him with fear and trembling .
47007016	I rejoice that in all things I have confidence in you .
47008001	And so we are making known to you , brothers , the grace of God that has been given in the churches of Macedonia .
47008002	For within a great experience of tribulation , they have had an abundance of joy , and their profound poverty has only increased the richness of their simplicity .
47008003	And I bear witness to them , that they were willing to accept what was in accord with their ability , and even what was beyond their ability .
47008004	For they were begging us , with great exhortation , for the grace and the communication of the ministry that is with the saints .
47008005	And this is beyond what we had hoped , since they gave themselves , first of all to the Lord , and then also to us , through the will of God ,
47008006	so much so that we petitioned Titus , that in the same manner as he had begun , he would also complete in you this same grace .
47008007	But , just as in all things you abound in faith and in word and in knowledge and in all solicitude , and even more so in your charity toward us , so also may you abound in this grace .
47008008	I am speaking , not commanding . But through the solicitude of others , I approve of the good character of your charity .
47008009	For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , that though he was rich , he became poor for your sakes , so that through his poverty , you might become rich .
47008010	And about this , I give my counsel . For this is useful to those of you who , only a year earlier , had just begun to act , or even to be willing to act .
47008011	So , truly now , accomplish this in deed , so that , in the same manner as your willing mind is prompted , you may also act , out of that which you have .
47008012	For when the will is prompted , it receives according to what that person has , not according to what that person does not have .
47008013	And it is not that others should be relieved , while you are troubled , but that there should be an equality .
47008014	In this present time , let your abundance supply their need , so that their abundance may also supply your need , in order that there may be an equality , just as it was written :
47008015	“ He with more did not have too much ; and he with less did not have too little . ”
47008016	But thanks be to God , who has granted to the heart of Titus , this same solicitude for you .
47008017	For certainly , he accepted the exhortation . But since he was more solicitous , he went to you of his own free will .
47008018	And we have even sent with him a brother whose praise accompanies the Gospel throughout all the churches .
47008019	And not only that , but he was also chosen by the churches to be a companion for our sojourn in this grace , which is ministered by us with our determined will , to the glory of the Lord .
47008020	So let us avoid this , lest anyone disparage us over the abundance that is ministered by us .
47008021	For we provide for what is good , not only in the sight of God , but also in the sight of men .
47008022	And we have also sent with them our brother , whom we have proven to be frequently solicitous in many matters . But now there is a greater solicitousness , which is greatly entrusted to you ;
47008023	and whether it concerns Titus , who is a companion to me and a helper to you , or whether it concerns our brothers , the Apostles of the churches , it is to the glory of Christ .
47008024	Therefore , in the sight of the churches , show them the proof of your charity and of our glorying about you .
47009001	Now , concerning the ministry that is done toward the saints , it is not necessary for me to write to you .
47009002	For I know your willing mind . I glory about you , concerning this , to the Macedonians . For Achaia has also been prepared , for the past year . And your example has inspired very many others .
47009003	Now I have sent the brothers , so that what we glory about concerning you might be not be empty in this matter , in order that ( as I have explained ) you may be prepared .
47009004	Otherwise , if the Macedonians arrive with me and find you unprepared , we ( not to mention you ) would be ashamed in this matter .
47009005	Therefore , I considered it necessary to ask the brothers to go to you in advance and to prepare this blessing as promised , and in this way , you may be ready as a blessing , not as an excess .
47009006	But I say this : Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly . And whoever sows with blessings shall also reap from blessings :
47009007	each one giving , just as he has determined in his heart , neither out of sadness , nor out of obligation . For God loves a cheerful giver .
47009008	And God is able to make every grace abound in you , so that , always having what you need in all things , you may abound unto every good work ,
47009009	just as it was written : “ He has distributed widely , he has given to the poor ; his justice remains from age to age . ”
47009010	And he who ministers seed to the sower will offer you bread to eat , and will multiply your seed , and will increase the growth of the fruits of your justice .
47009011	So then , having been enriched in all things , you may abound in all simplicity , which works thanksgiving to God through us .
47009012	For the ministration of this office not only supplies whatever the saints need , but also abounds through many thanksgivings in the Lord .
47009013	And so , through the evidence of this ministry , you glorify God by the obedience of your confession in the Gospel of Christ , and by the simplicity of your communion with them and with everyone ,
47009014	and they offer prayers for you , being solicitous about you , because of the excellent grace of God within you .
47009015	Thanks be to God for his ineffable gift .
47010001	But I myself , Paul , am begging you , through the meekness and modesty of Christ . I am certainly , by appearances , lowly among you , yet I have confidence in you , even while I am absent .
47010002	So I am petitioning you , lest I be bold , when present , with that bold confidence that I am considered to have by certain ones who judge us as if we were walking according to the flesh .
47010003	For though we walk in the flesh , we do not battle according to the flesh .
47010004	For the weapons of our battles are not carnal , yet still they are powerful with God , unto the destruction of fortifications : tearing down every counsel
47010005	and height that extols itself contrary to the wisdom of God , and leading every intellect into the captivity of obedience to Christ ,
47010006	and standing ready to repudiate every disobedience , when your own obedience has been fulfilled .
47010007	Consider the things that are in accord with appearances . If anyone trusts that by these things he belongs to Christ , let him reconsider this within himself . For just as he belongs to Christ , so also do we .
47010008	And if I were even to glory somewhat more about our authority , which the Lord has given to us for your edification , and not for your destruction , I should not be ashamed .
47010009	But let it not be said that I am scaring you by means of epistles .
47010010	For they say : “ His epistles , indeed , are weighty and strong . But his bodily presence is weak , and his speech is contemptible . ”
47010011	Let someone like this realize that whatever we are in word through epistles , while absent : we are much the same in deed , while present .
47010012	For we would not dare to interpose or compare ourselves with certain ones who commend themselves . But we measure ourselves by ourselves , and we compare ourselves with ourselves .
47010013	Thus , we will not glory beyond our measure , but rather according to the measure of the limit which God has measured out to us , a measure which extends even to you .
47010014	For we are not overextending ourselves , as if we are not able to reach as far as you are able . For we have gone even as far as you have in the Gospel of Christ .
47010015	We are not glorying immeasurably over the labors of others . Instead , we hold on to the hope of your growing faith , so as to be magnified in you , according to our own limits , but in abundance ,
47010016	and even so as to evangelize in those places that are beyond you , not in order to glory in the measure of others , but rather in those things which have already been prepared .
47010017	But whoever glories , let him glory in the Lord .
47010018	For it is not he who commends himself who is approved , but rather he whom God commends .
47011001	I wish that you would endure a small amount of my foolishness , so as to bear with me .
47011002	For I am jealous toward you , with the jealousy of God . And I have espoused you to one husband , offering you as a chaste virgin to Christ .
47011003	But I am afraid lest , as the serpent led astray Eve by his cleverness , so your minds might be corrupted and might fall away from the simplicity which is in Christ .
47011004	For if anyone arrives preaching another Christ , one whom we have not preached ; or if you receive another Spirit , one whom you have not received ; or another Gospel , one which you have not been given : you might permit him to guide you .
47011005	For I consider that I have done nothing less than the great Apostles .
47011006	For although I may be unskilled in speech , yet I am not so in knowledge . But , in all things , we have been made manifest to you .
47011007	Or did I commit a sin by humbling myself so that you would be exalted ? For I preached the Gospel of God to you freely .
47011008	I have taken from other churches , receiving a stipend from them to the benefit of your ministry .
47011009	And when I was with you and in need , I was burdensome to no one . For the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied whatever was lacking to me . And in all things , I have kept myself , and I will keep myself , from being burdensome to you .
47011010	The truth of Christ is in me , and so this glorying shall not be broken away from me in the regions of Achaia .
47011011	Why so ? Is it because I do not love you ? God knows I do .
47011012	But what I am doing , I will continue to do , so that I may take away an opportunity from those who desire an opportunity by which they may glory , so as to be considered to be like us .
47011013	For false apostles , such as these deceitful workers , are presenting themselves as if they were Apostles of Christ .
47011014	And no wonder , for even Satan presents himself as if he were an Angel of light .
47011015	Therefore , it is no great thing if his ministers present themselves as if they were ministers of justice , for their end shall be according to their works .
47011016	I say again . And let no one consider me to be foolish . Or , at least , accept me as if I were foolish , so that I also may glory a small amount .
47011017	What I am saying is not said according to God , but as if in foolishness , in this matter of glorying .
47011018	Since so many glory according to the flesh , I will glory also .
47011019	For you freely accept the foolish , though you yourselves claim to be wise .
47011020	For you permit it when someone guides you into servitude , even if he devours you , even if he takes from you , even if he is extolled , even if he strikes you repeatedly on the face .
47011021	I speak according to disgrace , as if we had been weak in this regard . In this matter , ( I speak in foolishness ) if anyone dares , I dare also .
47011022	They are Hebrews ; so am I . They are Israelites ; so am I . They are the offspring of Abraham ; so am I .
47011023	They are the ministers of Christ ( I speak as if I were less wise ) ; more so am I : with many more labors , with numerous imprisonments , with wounds beyond measure , with frequent mortifications .
47011024	On five occasions , I received forty stripes , less one , from the Jews .
47011025	Three times , I was beaten with rods . One time , I was stoned . Three times , I was shipwrecked . For a night and a day , I was in the depths of the sea .
47011026	I have made frequent journeys , through dangerous waters , in danger of robbers , in danger from my own nation , in danger from the Gentiles , in danger in the city , in danger in the wilderness , in danger in the sea , in danger from false brothers ,
47011027	with hardships and difficulties , with much vigilance , in hunger and thirst , with frequent fasts , in cold and nakedness ,
47011028	and , in addition to these things , which are external : there is my daily earnestness and solicitude for all the churches .
47011029	Who is weak , and I am not weak ? Who is scandalized , and I am not being burned ?
47011030	If it is necessary to glory , I will glory of the things that concern my weaknesses .
47011031	The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who is blessed forever , knows that I am not lying .
47011032	At Damascus , the governor of the nation under Aretas the king , watched over the city of the Damascenes , so as to apprehend me .
47011033	And , through a window , I was let down along the wall in a basket ; and so I escaped his hands .
47012001	If it is necessary ( though certainly not expedient ) to glory , then I will next tell of visions and revelations from the Lord .
47012002	I know a man in Christ , who , more than fourteen years ago ( whether in the body , I do not know , or out of the body , I do not know : God knows ) , was enraptured to the third heaven .
47012003	And I know a certain man ( whether in the body , or out of the body , I do not know : God knows ) ,
47012004	who was enraptured into Paradise . And he heard words of mystery , which it is not permitted for man to speak .
47012005	On behalf of someone like this , I will glory . But on behalf of myself , I will not glory about anything , except my infirmities .
47012006	For even though I am willing to glory , I will not be foolish . But I will speak the truth . Yet I will do so sparingly , lest anyone may consider me to be anything more than what he sees in me , or anything more than what he hears from me .
47012007	And lest the greatness of the revelations should extol me , there was given to me a prodding in my flesh : an angel of Satan , who struck me repeatedly .
47012008	Because of this , three times I petitioned the Lord that it might be taken away from me .
47012009	And he said to me : “ My grace is sufficient for you . For virtue is perfected in weakness . ” And so , willingly shall I glory in my weaknesses , so that the virtue of Christ may live within me .
47012010	Because of this , I am pleased in my infirmity : in reproaches , in difficulties , in persecutions , in distresses , for the sake of Christ . For when I am weak , then I am powerful .
47012011	I have become foolish ; you have compelled me . For I ought to have been commended by you . For I have been nothing less than those who claim to be above the measure of Apostles , even though I am nothing .
47012012	And the seal of my Apostleship has been set over you , with all patience , with signs and wonders and miracles .
47012013	For what is there that you have had which is less than the other churches , except that I myself did not burden you ? Forgive me this injury .
47012014	Behold , this is the third time I have prepared to come to you , and yet I will not be a burden to you . For I am seeking not the things that are yours , but you yourselves . And neither should the children store up for the parents , but the parents for the children .
47012015	And so , very willingly , I will spend and exhaust myself for the sake of your souls , loving you more , while being loved less .
47012016	And so be it . I have not burdened you , but instead , being astute , I obtained you by guile .
47012017	And yet , did I defraud you by means of any of those whom I sent to you ?
47012018	I asked for Titus , and I sent a brother with him . Did Titus defraud you ? Did we not walk with the same spirit ? Did we not walk in the same steps ?
47012019	Have you ever thought that we should explain ourselves to you ? We speak in the sight of God , in Christ . But all things , most beloved , are for your edification .
47012020	Yet I fear , lest perhaps , when I have arrived , I might not find you such as I would want , and I might be found by you , such as you would not want . For perhaps there may be among you : contention , envy , animosity , dissension , detraction , whispering , self-exaltation , and rebellion .
47012021	If so , then , when I have arrived , God may again humble me among you . And so , I mourn for the many who sinned beforehand , and did not repent , over the lust and fornication and homosexuality , which they have committed .
47013001	Behold , this is the third time that I am coming to you . By the mouth of two or three witnesses , every word shall stand .
47013002	I have preached when present , and I will preach now while absent , to those who sinned before , and to all the others , because , when I arrive again , I will not be lenient with you .
47013003	Do you seek evidence that it is Christ who speaks in me , who is not weak with you , but is powerful with you ?
47013004	For although he was crucified in weakness , yet he lives by the power of God . And yes , we are weak in him . But we shall live with him by the power of God among you .
47013005	Test yourselves as to whether you are in the faith . Examine yourselves . Or do you yourselves not know whether Christ Jesus is in you ? But perhaps you are reprobates .
47013006	But I hope you know that we ourselves are not reprobates .
47013007	Now we pray to God that you shall do nothing evil , not so that we may seem to be approved , but so that you may do what is good , even if we seem like reprobates .
47013008	For we cannot do anything against the truth , but only for the truth .
47013009	For we rejoice that we are weak , while you are strong . This is also what we pray for : your perfection .
47013010	Therefore , I write these things while absent , so that , when present , I may not have to act more harshly , according to the authority which the Lord has given to me , for edification and not for destruction .
47013011	As to the rest , brothers , rejoice , be perfect , be encouraged , have the same mind , have peace . And so the God of peace and love will be with you .
47013012	Greet one another with a holy kiss .
47013013	All the saints greet you .
47013014	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , and the charity of God , and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with you all . Amen .
48001001	Paul , an Apostle , not from men and not through man , but through Jesus Christ , and God the Father , who raised him from the dead ,
48001002	and all the brothers who are with me : to the churches of Galatia .
48001003	Grace and peace to you from God the Father , and from our Lord Jesus Christ ,
48001004	who gave himself on behalf of our sins , so that he might deliver us from this present wicked age , according to the will of God our Father .
48001005	To him is glory forever and ever . Amen .
48001006	I wonder that you have been so quickly transferred , from him who called you into the grace of Christ , over to another gospel .
48001007	For there is no other , except that there are some persons who disturb you and who want to overturn the Gospel of Christ .
48001008	But if anyone , even we ourselves or an Angel from Heaven , were to preach to you a gospel other than the one that we have preached to you , let him be anathema .
48001009	Just as we have said before , so now I say again : If anyone has preached a gospel to you , other than that which you have received , let him be anathema .
48001010	For am I now persuading men , or God ? Or , am I seeking to please men ? If I still were pleasing men , then I would not be a servant of Christ .
48001011	For I would have you understand , brothers , that the Gospel which has been preached by me is not according to man .
48001012	And I did not receive it from man , nor did I learn it , except through the revelation of Jesus Christ .
48001013	For you have heard of my former behavior within Judaism : that , beyond measure , I persecuted the Church of God and fought against Her .
48001014	And I advanced in Judaism beyond many of my equals among my own kind , having proven to be more abundant in zeal toward the traditions of my fathers .
48001015	But , when it pleased him who , from my mother’s womb , had set me apart , and who has called me by his grace ,
48001016	to reveal his Son within me , so that I might evangelize him among the Gentiles , I did not next seek the consent of flesh and blood .
48001017	Neither did I go to Jerusalem , to those who were Apostles before me . Instead , I went into Arabia , and next I returned to Damascus .
48001018	And then , after three years , I went to Jerusalem to see Peter ; and I stayed with him for fifteen days .
48001019	But I saw none of the other Apostles , except James , the brother of the Lord .
48001020	Now what I am writing to you : behold , before God , I am not lying .
48001021	Next , I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia .
48001022	But I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea , which were in Christ .
48001023	For they had only heard that : “ He , who formerly persecuted us , now evangelizes the faith which he once fought . ”
48001024	And they glorified God in me .
48002001	Next , after fourteen years , I went up again to Jerusalem , taking with me Barnabas and Titus .
48002002	And I went up according to revelation , and I debated with them about the Gospel that I am preaching among the Gentiles , but away from those who were pretending to be something , lest perhaps I might run , or have run , in vain .
48002003	But even Titus , who was with me , though he was a Gentile , was not compelled to be circumcised ,
48002004	but only because of false brothers , who were brought in unknowingly . They entered secretly to spy on our liberty , which we have in Christ Jesus , so that they might reduce us to servitude .
48002005	We did not yield to them in subjection , even for an hour , in order that the truth of the Gospel would remain with you ,
48002006	and away from those who were pretending to be something . ( Whatever they might have been once , it means nothing to me . God does not accept the reputation of a man . ) And those who were claiming to be something had nothing to offer me .
48002007	But it was to the contrary , since they had seen that the Gospel to the uncircumcised was entrusted to me , just as the Gospel to the circumcised was entrusted to Peter .
48002008	For he who was working the Apostleship to the circumcised in Peter , was also working in me among the Gentiles .
48002009	And so , when they had acknowledged the grace that was given to me , James and Cephas and John , who seemed like pillars , gave to me and to Barnabas the right hand of fellowship , so that we would go to the Gentiles , while they went to the circumcised ,
48002010	asking only that we should be mindful of the poor , which was the very thing that I also was solicitous to do .
48002011	But when Cephas had arrived at Antioch , I stood against him to his face , because he was blameworthy .
48002012	For before certain ones arrived from James , he ate with the Gentiles . But when they had arrived , he drew apart and separated himself , fearing those who were of the circumcision .
48002013	And the other Jews consented to his pretense , so that even Barnabas was led by them into that falseness .
48002014	But when I had seen that they were not walking correctly , by the truth of the Gospel , I said to Cephas in front of everyone : “ If you , while you are a Jew , are living like the Gentiles and not the Jews , how is it that you compel the Gentiles to keep the customs of the Jews ? ”
48002015	By nature , we are Jews , and not of the Gentiles , sinners .
48002016	And we know that man is not justified by the works of the law , but only by the faith of Jesus Christ . And so we believe in Christ Jesus , in order that we may be justified by the faith of Christ , and not by the works of the law . For no flesh will be justified by the works of the law .
48002017	But if , while seeking to be justified in Christ , we ourselves are also found to be sinners , would then Christ be the minister of sin ? Let it not be so !
48002018	For if I rebuild the things that I have destroyed , I establish myself as a prevaricator .
48002019	For through the law , I have become dead to the law , so that I may live for God . I have been nailed to the cross with Christ .
48002020	I live ; yet now , it is not I , but truly Christ , who lives in me . And though I live now in the flesh , I live in the faith of the Son of God , who loved me and who delivered himself for me .
48002021	I do not reject the grace of God . For if justice is through the law , then Christ died in vain .
48003001	O senseless Galatians , who has so fascinated you that you would not obey the truth , even though Jesus Christ has been presented before your eyes , crucified among you ?
48003002	I wish to know only this from you : Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law , or by the hearing of faith ?
48003003	Are you so foolish that , though you began with the Spirit , you would now end with the flesh ?
48003004	Have you been suffering so much without a reason ? If so , then it is in vain .
48003005	Therefore , does he who distributes the Spirit to you , and who works miracles among you , act by the works of the law , or by the hearing of the faith ?
48003006	It is just as it was written : “ Abraham believed God , and it was reputed to him unto justice . ”
48003007	Therefore , know that those who are of faith , these are the sons of Abraham .
48003008	Thus Scripture , foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith , foretold to Abraham : “ All nations shall be blessed in you . ”
48003009	And so , those who are of faith shall be blessed with faithful Abraham .
48003010	For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse . For it has been written : “ Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all the things that have been written in the book of the Law , so as to do them . ”
48003011	And , since in the law no one is justified with God , this is manifest : “ For the just man lives by faith . ”
48003012	But the law is not of faith ; instead , “ he who does these things shall live by them . ”
48003013	Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law , since he became a curse for us . For it is written : “ Cursed is anyone who hangs from a tree . ”
48003014	This was so that the blessing of Abraham might reach the Gentiles through Christ Jesus , in order that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith .
48003015	Brothers ( I speak according to man ) , if a man’s testament has been confirmed , no one would reject it or add to it .
48003016	The promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring . He did not say , “ and to descendents , ” as if to many , but instead , as if to one , he said , “ and to your offspring , ” who is Christ .
48003017	But I say this : the testament confirmed by God , which , after four hundred and thirty years became the Law , does not nullify , so as to make the promise empty .
48003018	For if the inheritance is of the law , then it is no longer of the promise . But God bestowed it to Abraham through the promise .
48003019	Why , then , was there a law ? It was established because of transgressions , until the offspring would arrive , to whom he made the promise , ordained by Angels through the hand of a mediator .
48003020	Now a mediator is not of one , yet God is one .
48003021	So then , was the law contrary to the promises of God ? Let it not be so ! For if a law had been given , which was able to give life , truly justice would be of the law .
48003022	But Scripture has enclosed everything under sin , so that the promise , by the faith of Jesus Christ , might be given to those who believe .
48003023	But before the faith arrived , we were preserved by being enclosed under the law , unto that faith which was to be revealed .
48003024	And so the law was our guardian in Christ , in order that we might be justified by faith .
48003025	But now that faith has arrived , we are no longer under a guardian .
48003026	For you are all sons of God , through the faith which is in Christ Jesus .
48003027	For as many of you as have been baptized in Christ have become clothed with Christ .
48003028	There is neither Jew nor Greek ; there is neither servant nor free ; there is neither male nor female . For you are all one in Christ Jesus .
48003029	And if you are Christ’s , then are you the offspring of Abraham , heirs according to the promise .
48004001	But I say that , during the time an heir is a child , he is no different from a servant , even though he is the owner of everything .
48004002	For he is under tutors and caretakers , until the time which was predetermined by the father .
48004003	So also we , when we were children , were subservient to the influences of the world .
48004004	But when the fullness of time arrived , God sent his Son , formed from a woman , formed under the law ,
48004005	so that he might redeem those who were under the law , in order that we might receive the adoption of sons .
48004006	Therefore , because you are sons , God has sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts , crying out : “ Abba , Father . ”
48004007	And so now he is not a servant , but a son . But if he is a son , then he is also an heir , through God .
48004008	But then , certainly , while ignorant of God , you served those who , by nature , are not gods .
48004009	But now , since you have known God , or rather , since you have been known by God : how can you turn away again , to weak and destitute influences , which you desire to serve anew ?
48004010	You serve the days , and months , and times , and years .
48004011	I am afraid for you , lest perhaps I may have labored in vain among you .
48004012	Brothers , I beg you . Be as I am . For I , too , am like you . You have not injured me at all .
48004013	But you know that , in the weakness of the flesh , I have preached the Gospel to you for a long time , and that your trials are in my flesh .
48004014	You did not despise or reject me . But instead , you accepted me like an Angel of God , even like Christ Jesus .
48004015	Therefore , where is your happiness ? For I offer to you testimony that , if it could be done , you would have plucked out your own eyes and would have given them to me .
48004016	So then , have I become your enemy by telling you the truth ?
48004017	They are not imitating you well . And they are willing to exclude you , so that you might imitate them .
48004018	But be imitators of what is good , always in a good way , and not only when I am present with you .
48004019	My little sons , I am giving birth to you again , until Christ is formed in you .
48004020	And I would willingly be present with you , even now . But I would alter my voice : for I am ashamed of you .
48004021	Tell me , you who desire to be under the law , have you not read the law ?
48004022	For it is written that Abraham had two sons : one by a servant woman , and one by a free woman .
48004023	And he who was of the servant was born according to the flesh . But he who was of the free woman was born by the promise .
48004024	These things are said through an allegory . For these represent the two testaments . Certainly the one , on Mount Sinai , gives birth unto servitude , which is Hagar .
48004025	For Sinai is a mountain in Arabia , which is related to the Jerusalem of the present time , and it serves with her sons .
48004026	But that Jerusalem which is above is free ; the same is our mother .
48004027	For it was written : “ Rejoice , O barren one , though you do not conceive . Burst forth and cry out , though you do not give birth . For many are the children of the desolate , even more than of her who has a husband . ”
48004028	Now we , brothers , like Isaac , are sons of the promise .
48004029	But just as then , he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit , so also it is now .
48004030	And what does Scripture say ? “ Cast out the woman servant and her son . For the son of a servant women shall not be an heir with the son of a free woman . ”
48004031	And so , brothers , we are not the sons of the servant woman , but rather of the free woman . And this is the freedom with which Christ has set us free .
48005001	Stand firm , and do not be willing to be again held by the yoke of servitude .
48005002	Behold , I , Paul , say to you , that if you have been circumcised , Christ will be of no benefit to you .
48005003	For I again testify , about every man circumcising himself , that he is obligated to act according to the entire law .
48005004	You are being emptied of Christ , you who are being justified by the law . You have fallen from grace .
48005005	For in spirit , by faith , we await the hope of justice .
48005006	For in Christ Jesus , neither circumcision nor uncircumcision prevails over anything , but only faith which works through charity .
48005007	You have run well . So what has impeded you , that you would not obey the truth ?
48005008	This kind of influence is not from him who is calling you .
48005009	A little leaven corrupts the whole mass .
48005010	I have confidence in you , in the Lord , that you will accept nothing of the kind . However , he who disturbs you shall bear the judgment , whomever he may be .
48005011	And as for me , brothers , if I still preach circumcision , why am I still suffering persecution ? For then the scandal of the Cross would be made empty .
48005012	And I wish that those who disturb you would be torn away .
48005013	For you , brothers , have been called to liberty . Only you must not make liberty into an occasion for the flesh , but instead , serve one another through the charity of the Spirit .
48005014	For the entire law is fulfilled by one word : “ You shall love your neighbor as yourself . ”
48005015	But if you bite and devour one another , be careful that you are not consumed by one another !
48005016	So then , I say : Walk in the spirit , and you will not fulfill the desires of the flesh .
48005017	For the flesh desires against the spirit , and the spirit against the flesh . And since these are against one another , you may not do whatever you want .
48005018	But if you are led by the Spirit , you are not under the law .
48005019	Now the works of the flesh are manifest ; they are : fornication , lust , homosexuality , self-indulgence ,
48005020	the serving of idols , drug use , hostility , contentiousness , jealousy , wrath , quarrels , dissensions , divisions ,
48005021	envy , murder , inebriation , carousing , and similar things . About these things , I continue to preach to you , as I have preached to you : that those who act in this way shall not obtain the kingdom of God .
48005022	But the fruit of the Spirit is charity , joy , peace , patience , kindness , goodness , forbearance ,
48005023	meekness , faith , modesty , abstinence , chastity . There is no law against such things .
48005024	For those who are Christ’s have crucified their flesh , along with its vices and desires .
48005025	If we live by the Spirit , we should also walk by the Spirit .
48005026	Let us not become desirous of empty glory , provoking one another , envying one another .
48006001	And , brothers , if a man has been overtaken by any offense , you who are spiritual should instruct someone like this with a spirit of leniency , considering that you yourselves might also be tempted .
48006002	Carry one another’s burdens , and so shall you fulfill the law of Christ .
48006003	For if anyone considers himself to be something , though he may be nothing , he deceives himself .
48006004	So let each one prove his own work . And in this way , he shall have glory in himself only , and not in another .
48006005	For each one shall carry his own burden .
48006006	And let him who is being taught the Word discuss it with him who is teaching it to him , in every good way .
48006007	Do not choose to wander astray . God is not to be ridiculed .
48006008	For whatever a man will have sown , that also shall he reap . For whoever sows in his flesh , from the flesh he shall also reap corruption . But whoever sows in the Spirit , from the Spirit he shall reap eternal life .
48006009	And so , let us not be deficient in doing good . For in due time , we shall reap without fail .
48006010	Therefore , while we have time , we should do good works toward everyone , and most of all toward those who are of the household of the faith .
48006011	Consider what kind of letters I have written to you with my own hand .
48006012	For as many of you as they desire to please in the flesh , they compel to be circumcised , but only so that they might not suffer the persecution of the cross of Christ .
48006013	And yet , neither do they themselves , who are circumcised , keep the law . Instead , they want you to be circumcised , so that they may glory in your flesh .
48006014	But far be it from me to glory , except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ , through whom the world is crucified to me , and I to the world .
48006015	For in Christ Jesus , neither circumcision nor uncircumcision prevails in any way , but instead there is a new creature .
48006016	And whoever follows this rule : may peace and mercy be upon them , and upon the Israel of God .
48006017	Concerning other matters , let no one trouble me . For I carry the stigmata of the Lord Jesus in my body .
48006018	May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit , brothers . Amen .
49001001	Paul , an Apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God , to all the saints who are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus .
49001002	Grace and peace to you from God the Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
49001003	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavens , in Christ ,
49001004	just as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world , so that we would be holy and immaculate in his sight , in charity .
49001005	He has predestined us to adoption as sons , through Jesus Christ , in himself , according to the purpose of his will ,
49001006	for the praise of the glory of his grace , with which he has gifted us in his beloved Son .
49001007	In him , we have redemption through his blood : the remission of sins in accord with the riches of his grace ,
49001008	which is superabundant in us , with all wisdom and prudence .
49001009	So does he make known to us the mystery of his will , which he has set forth in Christ , in a manner well-pleasing to him ,
49001010	in the dispensation of the fullness of time , so as to renew in Christ everything that exists through him in heaven and on earth .
49001011	In him , we too are called to our portion , having been predestined in accord with the plan of the One who accomplishes all things by the counsel of his will .
49001012	So may we be , to the praise of his glory , we who have hoped beforehand in Christ .
49001013	In him , you also , after you heard and believed the Word of truth , which is the Gospel of your salvation , were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the Promise .
49001014	He is the pledge of our inheritance , unto the acquisition of redemption , to the praise of his glory .
49001015	Because of this , and hearing of your faith that is in the Lord Jesus , and of your love toward all the saints ,
49001016	I have not ceased giving thanks for you , calling you to mind in my prayers ,
49001017	so that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of glory , may give a spirit of wisdom and of revelation to you , in knowledge of him .
49001018	May the eyes of your heart be illuminated , so that you may know what is the hope of his calling , and the wealth of the glory of his inheritance with the saints ,
49001019	and the preeminent magnitude of his virtue toward us , toward we who believe in accord with the work of his powerful virtue ,
49001020	which he wrought in Christ , raising him from the dead and establishing him at his right hand in the heavens ,
49001021	above every principality and power and virtue and dominion , and above every name that is given , not only in this age , but even in the future age .
49001022	And he has subjected all things under his feet , and he has made him the head over the entire Church ,
49001023	which is his body and which is the fullness of him who accomplishes everything in everyone .
49002001	And you were once dead in your sins and offenses ,
49002002	in which you walked in times past , according to the age of this world , according to the prince of the power of this sky , the spirit who now works in the sons of distrust .
49002003	And we too were all conversant in these things , in times past , by the desires of our flesh , acting according to the will of the flesh and according to our own thoughts . And so we were , by nature , sons of wrath , even like the others .
49002004	Yet still , God , who is rich in mercy , for the sake of his exceedingly great charity with which he loved us ,
49002005	even when we were dead in our sins , has enlivened us together in Christ , by whose grace you have been saved .
49002006	And he has raised us up together , and he has caused us to sit down together in the heavens , in Christ Jesus ,
49002007	so that he may display , in the ages soon to arrive , the abundant wealth of his grace , by his goodness toward us in Christ Jesus .
49002008	For by grace , you have been saved through faith . And this is not of yourselves , for it is a gift of God .
49002009	And this is not of works , so that no one may glory .
49002010	For we are his handiwork , created in Christ Jesus for the good works which God has prepared and in which we should walk .
49002011	Because of this , be mindful that , in times past , you were Gentiles in the flesh , and that you were called uncircumcised by those who are called circumcised in the flesh , something done by man ,
49002012	and that you were , in that time , without Christ , being foreign to the way of life of Israel , being visitors to the testament , having no hope of the promise , and being without God in this world .
49002013	But now , in Christ Jesus , you , who were in times past far away , have been brought near by the blood of Christ .
49002014	For he is our peace . He made the two into one , by dissolving the intermediate wall of separation , of opposition , by his flesh ,
49002015	emptying the law of commandments by decree , so that he might join these two , in himself , into one new man , making peace
49002016	and reconciling both to God , in one body , through the cross , destroying this opposition in himself .
49002017	And upon arriving , he evangelized peace to you who were far away , and peace to those who were near .
49002018	For by him , we both have access , in the one Spirit , to the Father .
49002019	Now , therefore , you are no longer visitors and new arrivals . Instead , you are citizens among the saints in the household of God ,
49002020	having been built upon the foundation of the Apostles and of the Prophets , with Jesus Christ himself as the preeminent cornerstone .
49002021	In him , all that has been built is framed together , rising up into a holy temple in the Lord .
49002022	In him , you also have been built together into a habitation of God in the Spirit .
49003001	By reason of this grace , I , Paul , am a prisoner of Jesus Christ , for the sake of you Gentiles .
49003002	Now certainly , you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God , which has been given to me among you :
49003003	that , by means of revelation , the mystery was made known to me , just as I have written above in a few words .
49003004	Yet , by reading this closely , you might be able to understand my prudence in the mystery of Christ .
49003005	In other generations , this was unknown to the sons of men , even as it has now been revealed to his holy Apostles and Prophets in the Spirit ,
49003006	so that the Gentiles would be co-heirs , and of the same body , and partners together , by his promise in Christ Jesus , through the Gospel .
49003007	Of this Gospel , I have been made a minister , according to the gift of the grace of God , which has been given to me by means of the operation of his virtue .
49003008	Although I am the least of all the saints , I have been given this grace : to evangelize among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ ,
49003009	and to enlighten everyone concerning the dispensation of the mystery , hidden before the ages in God who created all things ,
49003010	so that the manifold wisdom of God may become well-known to the principalities and powers in the heavens , through the Church ,
49003011	according to that timeless purpose , which he has formed in Christ Jesus our Lord .
49003012	In him we trust , and so we approach with confidence , through his faith .
49003013	Because of this , I ask you not to be weakened by my tribulations on your behalf ; for this is your glory .
49003014	By reason of this grace , I bend my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
49003015	from whom all paternity in heaven and on earth takes its name .
49003016	And I ask him to grant to you to be strengthened in virtue by his Spirit , in accord with the wealth of his glory , in the inner man ,
49003017	so that Christ may live in your hearts through a faith rooted in , and founded on , charity .
49003018	So may you be able to embrace , with all the saints , what is the width and length and height and depth
49003019	of the charity of Christ , and even be able to know that which surpasses all knowledge , so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God .
49003020	Now to him who is able to do all things , more abundantly than we could ever ask or understand , by means of the virtue which is at work in us :
49003021	to him be glory , in the Church and in Christ Jesus , throughout every generation , forever and ever . Amen .
49004001	And so , as a prisoner in the Lord , I beg you to walk in a manner worthy of the vocation to which you have been called :
49004002	with all humility and meekness , with patience , supporting one another in charity .
49004003	Be anxious to preserve the unity of the Spirit within the bonds of peace .
49004004	One body and one Spirit : to this you have been called by the one hope of your calling :
49004005	one Lord , one faith , one baptism ,
49004006	one God and Father of all , who is over all , and through all , and in us all .
49004007	Yet to each one of us there has been given grace according to the measure allotted by Christ .
49004008	Because of this , he says : “ Ascending on high , he took captivity itself captive ; he gave gifts to men . ”
49004009	Now that he has ascended , what is left except for him also to descended , first to the lower parts of the earth ?
49004010	He who descended is the same one who also ascended above all the heavens , so that he might fulfill everything .
49004011	And the same one granted that some would be Apostles , and some Prophets , yet truly others evangelists , and others pastors and teachers ,
49004012	for the sake of the perfection of the saints , by the work of the ministry , in the edification of the body of Christ ,
49004013	until we all meet in the unity of faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God , as a perfect man , in the measure of the age of the fullness of Christ .
49004014	So may we then no longer be little children , disturbed and carried about by every wind of doctrine , by the wickedness of men , and by the craftiness which deceives unto error .
49004015	Instead , acting according to truth in charity , we should increase in everything , in him who is the head , Christ himself .
49004016	For in him , the whole body is joined closely together , by every underlying joint , through the function allotted to each part , bringing improvement to the body , toward its edification in charity .
49004017	And so , I say this , and I testify in the Lord : that from now on you should walk , not as the Gentiles also walk , in the vanity of their mind ,
49004018	having their intellect obscured , being alienated from the life of God , through the ignorance that is within them , because of the blindness of their hearts .
49004019	Such as these , despairing , have given themselves over to sexual immorality , carrying out every impurity with rapacity .
49004020	But this is not what you have learned in Christ .
49004021	For certainly , you have listened to him , and you have been instructed in him , according to the truth that is in Jesus :
49004022	to set aside your earlier behavior , the former man , who was corrupted , by means of desire , unto error ,
49004023	and so be renewed in the spirit of your mind ,
49004024	and so put on the new man , who , in accord with God , is created in justice and in the holiness of truth .
49004025	Because of this , setting aside lying , speak the truth , each one with his neighbor . For we are all part of one another .
49004026	“ Be angry , but do not be willing to sin . ” Do not let the sun set over your anger .
49004027	Provide no place for the devil .
49004028	Whoever was stealing , let him now not steal , but rather let him labor , working with his hands , doing what is good , so that he may have something to distribute to those who suffer need .
49004029	Let no evil words proceed from your mouth , but only what is good , toward the edification of faith , so as to bestow grace upon those who listen .
49004030	And do not be willing to grieve the Holy Spirit of God , in whom you have been sealed , unto the day of redemption .
49004031	Let all bitterness and anger and indignation and outcry and blasphemy be taken away from you , along with all malice .
49004032	And be kind and merciful to one another , forgiving one another , just as God has forgiven you in Christ .
49005001	Therefore , as most beloved sons , be imitators of God .
49005002	And walk in love , just as Christ also loved us and delivered himself for us , as an oblation and a sacrifice to God , with a fragrance of sweetness .
49005003	But let not any kind of fornication , or impurity , or rapacity so much as be named among you , just as is worthy of the saints ,
49005004	nor any indecent , or foolish , or abusive talk , for this is without purpose ; but instead , give thanks .
49005005	For know and understand this : no one who is a fornicator , or lustful , or rapacious ( for these are a kind of service to idols ) holds an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God .
49005006	Let no one seduce you with empty words . For because of these things , the wrath of God was sent upon the sons of unbelief .
49005007	Therefore , do not choose to become participants with them .
49005008	For you were darkness , in times past , but now you are light , in the Lord . So then , walk as sons of the light .
49005009	For the fruit of the light is in all goodness and justice and truth ,
49005010	affirming what is well-pleasing to God .
49005011	And so , have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness , but instead , refute them .
49005012	For the things that are done by them in secret are shameful , even to mention .
49005013	But all things that are disputed are made manifest by the light . For all that is made manifest is light .
49005014	Because of this , it is said : “ You who are sleeping : awaken , and rise up from the dead , and so shall the Christ enlighten you . ”
49005015	And so , brothers , see to it that you walk cautiously , not like the foolish ,
49005016	but like the wise : atoning for this age , because this is an evil time .
49005017	For this reason , do not choose to be imprudent . Instead , understand what is the will of God .
49005018	And do not choose to be inebriated by wine , for this is self-indulgence . Instead , be filled with the Holy Spirit ,
49005019	speaking among yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual canticles , singing and reciting psalms to the Lord in your hearts ,
49005020	giving thanks always for everything , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , to God the Father .
49005021	Be subject to one another in the fear of Christ .
49005022	Wives should be submissive to their husbands , as to the Lord .
49005023	For the husband is the head of the wife , just as Christ is the head of the Church . He is the Savior of his body .
49005024	Therefore , just as the Church is subject to Christ , so also should wives be subject to their husbands in all things .
49005025	Husbands , love your wives , just as Christ also loved the Church and handed himself over for her ,
49005026	so that he might sanctify her , washing her clean by water and the Word of life ,
49005027	so that he might offer her to himself as a glorious Church , not having any spot or wrinkle or any such thing , so that she would be holy and immaculate .
49005028	So , too , husbands should love their wives as their own bodies . He who loves his wife loves himself .
49005029	For no man has ever hated his own flesh , but instead he nourishes and cherishes it , as Christ also does to the Church .
49005030	For we are a part of his body , of his flesh and of his bones .
49005031	“ For this reason , a man shall leave behind his father and mother , and he shall cling to his wife ; and the two shall be as one flesh . ”
49005032	This is a great Sacrament . And I am speaking in Christ and in the Church .
49005033	Yet truly , each and every one of you should love his wife as himself . And a wife should fear her husband .
49006001	Children , obey your parents in the Lord , for this is just .
49006002	Honor your father and your mother . This is the first commandment with a promise :
49006003	so that it may be well with you , and so that you may have a long life upon the earth .
49006004	And you , fathers , do not provoke your children to anger , but educate them with the discipline and correction of the Lord .
49006005	Servants , be obedient to your lords according to the flesh , with fear and trembling , in the simplicity of your heart , as to Christ .
49006006	Do not serve only when seen , as if to please men , but act as servants of Christ , doing the will of God from the heart .
49006007	Serve with good will , as to the Lord , and not to men .
49006008	For you know that whatever good each one will do , the same will he receive from the Lord , whether he is servant or free .
49006009	And you , lords , act similarly toward them , setting aside threats , knowing that the Lord of both you and them is in heaven . For with him there is no favoritism toward anyone .
49006010	Concerning the rest , brothers , be strengthened in the Lord , by the power of his virtue .
49006011	Be clothed in the armor of God , so that you may be able to stand against the treachery of the devil .
49006012	For our struggle is not against flesh and blood , but against principalities and powers , against the directors of this world of darkness , against the spirits of wickedness in high places .
49006013	Because of this , take up the armor of God , so that you may be able to withstand the evil day and remain perfect in all things .
49006014	Therefore , stand firm , having been girded about your waist with truth , and having been clothed with the breastplate of justice ,
49006015	and having feet which have been shod by the preparation of the Gospel of peace .
49006016	In all things , take up the shield of faith , with which you may be able to extinguish all the fiery darts of the most wicked one .
49006017	And take up the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit ( which is the Word of God ) .
49006018	Through every kind of prayer and supplication , pray at all times in spirit , and so be vigilant with every kind of earnest supplication , for all the saints ,
49006019	and also for me , so that words may be given to me , as I open my mouth with faith to make known the mystery of the Gospel ,
49006020	in such a manner that I may dare to speak exactly as I ought to speak . For I act as an ambassador in chains for the Gospel .
49006021	Now , so that you also may know the things that concern me and what I am doing , Tychicus , a most beloved brother and a faithful minister in the Lord , will make known everything to you .
49006022	I have sent him to you for this very reason , so that you may know the things that concern us , and so that he may console your hearts .
49006023	Peace to the brothers , and charity with faith , from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
49006024	May grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ , unto incorruption . Amen .
50001001	Paul and Timothy , servants of Jesus Christ , to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi , with the bishops and deacons .
50001002	Grace and peace to you , from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
50001003	I give thanks to my God , with every remembrance of you ,
50001004	always , in all my prayers , making supplication for all of you with joy ,
50001005	because of your communion in the Gospel of Christ , from the first day even until now .
50001006	I am confident of this very thing : that he who has begun this good work in you will perfect it , unto the day of Christ Jesus .
50001007	So then , it is right for me to feel this way about all of you , because I hold you in my heart , and because , in my chains and in the defense and confirmation of the Gospel , you all are partakers of my joy .
50001008	For God is my witness how , within the heart of Jesus Christ , I long for all of you .
50001009	And this I pray : that your charity may abound more and more , with knowledge and with all understanding ,
50001010	so that you may be confirmed in what is better , in order that you may be sincere and without offense on the day of Christ :
50001011	filled with the fruit of justice , through Jesus Christ , in the glory and praise of God .
50001012	Now , brothers , I want you to know that the things concerning me happened for the advancement of the Gospel ,
50001013	in such a way that my chains have become manifest in Christ in every place of judgment and in all other such places .
50001014	And many from among the brothers in the Lord , becoming confident through my chains , are now much bolder in speaking the Word of God without fear .
50001015	Certainly , some do so even because of envy and contention ; and others , too , do so because of a good will to preach Christ .
50001016	Some act out of charity , knowing that I have been appointed for the defense of the Gospel .
50001017	But others , out of contention , announce Christ insincerely , claiming that their difficulties lift them up to my chains .
50001018	But what does it matter ? As long as , by every means , whether under pretext or in truthfulness , Christ is announced . And about this , I rejoice , and moreover , I will continue to rejoice .
50001019	For I know that this will bring me to salvation , through your prayers and under the ministration of the Spirit of Jesus Christ ,
50001020	by means of my own expectation and hope . For in nothing shall I be confounded . Instead , with all confidence , now just as always , Christ shall be magnified in my body , whether by life or by death .
50001021	For to me , to live is Christ , and to die is gain .
50001022	And while I live in the flesh , for me , there is the fruit of works . But I do not know which I would choose .
50001023	For I am constrained between the two : having a desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ , which is the far better thing ,
50001024	but then to remain in the flesh is necessary for your sake .
50001025	And having this confidence , I know that I shall remain and that I shall continue to remain with all of you , for your advancement and for your joy in the faith ,
50001026	so that your rejoicing may abound in Christ Jesus for me , through my return to you again .
50001027	Only let your behavior be worthy of the Gospel of Christ , so that , whether I return and see you , or whether , being absent , I hear about you , still you may stand firm with one spirit , with one mind , laboring together for the faith of the Gospel .
50001028	And in nothing be terrified by the adversaries . For what is to them is an occasion of perdition , is to you an occasion of salvation , and this is from God .
50001029	For this has been given to you on behalf of Christ , not only so that you may believe in him , but even so that you may suffer with him ,
50001030	engaging in the same struggle , of a kind which you also have seen in me , and which you now have heard from me .
50002001	Therefore , if there is any consolation in Christ , any solace of charity , any fellowship of the Spirit , any feelings of commiseration :
50002002	complete my joy by having the same understanding , holding to the same charity , being of one mind , with the same sentiment .
50002003	Let nothing be done by contention , nor in vain glory . Instead , in humility , let each of you esteem others to be better than himself .
50002004	Let each of you not consider anything to be your own , but rather to belong to others .
50002005	For this understanding in you was also in Christ Jesus :
50002006	who , though he was in the form of God , did not consider equality with God something to be seized .
50002007	Instead , he emptied himself , taking the form of a servant , being made in the likeness of men , and accepting the state of a man .
50002008	He humbled himself , becoming obedient even unto death , even the death of the Cross .
50002009	Because of this , God has also exalted him and has given him a name which is above every name ,
50002010	so that , at the name of Jesus , every knee would bend , of those in heaven , of those on earth , and of those in hell ,
50002011	and so that every tongue would confess that the Lord Jesus Christ is in the glory of God the Father .
50002012	And so , my most beloved , just as you have always obeyed , not only in my presence , but even more so now in my absence : work toward your salvation with fear and trembling .
50002013	For it is God who works in you , both so as to choose , and so as to act , in accord with his good will .
50002014	And do everything without murmuring or hesitation .
50002015	So may you be without blame , simple sons of God , without reproof , in the midst of a depraved and perverse nation , among whom you shine like lights in the world ,
50002016	holding to the Word of Life , until my glory in the day of Christ . For I have not run in vain , nor have I labored in vain .
50002017	Moreover , if I am to be immolated because of the sacrifice and service of your faith , I rejoice and give thanks with all of you .
50002018	And over this same thing , you also should rejoice and give thanks , together with me .
50002019	Now I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon , in order that I may be encouraged , when I know the things concerning you .
50002020	For I have no one else with such an agreeable mind , who , with sincere affection , is solicitous for you .
50002021	For they all seek the things that are of themselves , not the things that are of Jesus Christ .
50002022	So know this evidence of him : that like a son with a father , so has he served with me in the Gospel .
50002023	Therefore , I hope to send him to you immediately , as soon as I see what will happen concerning me .
50002024	But I trust in the Lord that I myself will also return to you soon .
50002025	Now I have considered it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus , my brother , and co-worker , and fellow soldier , and an attendant to my needs , but your Apostle .
50002026	For certainly , he has desired all of you , and he was saddened because you had heard that he was sick .
50002027	For he was sick , even unto death , but God took pity on him , and not only on him , but truly on myself also , so that I would not have sorrow upon sorrow .
50002028	Therefore , I sent him more readily , in order that , by seeing him again , you may rejoice , and I may be without sorrow .
50002029	And so , receive him with every joy in the Lord , and treat all those like him with honor .
50002030	For he was brought close even to death , for the sake of the work of Christ , handing over his own life , so that he might fulfill what was lacking from you concerning my service .
50003001	Concerning other things , my brothers , rejoice in the Lord . It is certainly not tiresome for me to write the same things to you , but for you , it is not necessary .
50003002	Beware of dogs ; beware of those who work evil ; beware of those who are divisive .
50003003	For we are the circumcised , we who serve God in the Spirit and who glory in Christ Jesus , having no confidence in the flesh .
50003004	Nevertheless , I might have confidence also in the flesh , for if anyone else seems to have confidence in the flesh , more so do I .
50003005	For I was circumcised on the eighth day , of the stock of Israel , from the tribe of Benjamin , a Hebrew among Hebrews . According to the law , I was a Pharisee ;
50003006	according to zeal , I persecuted the Church of God ; according to the justice that is in the law , I lived without blame .
50003007	But the things which had been to my gain , the same have I considered a loss , for the sake of Christ .
50003008	Yet truly , I consider everything to be a loss , because of the preeminent knowledge of Jesus Christ , my Lord , for whose sake I have suffered the loss of everything , considering it all to be like dung , so that I may gain Christ ,
50003009	and so that you may be found in him , not having my justice , which is of the law , but that which is of the faith of Christ Jesus , the justice within faith , which is of God .
50003010	So shall I know him , and the power of his resurrection , and the fellowship of his Passion , having been fashioned according to his death ,
50003011	if , by some means , I might attain to the resurrection which is from the dead .
50003012	It is not as though I have already received this , or were already perfect . But rather I pursue , so that by some means I might attain , that in which I have already been attained by Christ Jesus .
50003013	Brothers , I do not consider that I have already attained this . Instead , I do one thing : forgetting those things that are behind , and extending myself toward those things that are ahead ,
50003014	I pursue the destination , the prize of the heavenly calling of God in Christ Jesus .
50003015	Therefore , as many of us as are being perfected , let us agree about this . And if in anything you disagree , God will reveal this to you also .
50003016	Yet truly , whatever point we reach , let us be of the same mind , and let us remain in the same rule .
50003017	Be imitators of me , brothers , and observe those who are walking similarly , just as you have seen by our example .
50003018	For many persons , about whom I have often told you ( and now tell you , weeping , ) are walking as enemies of the cross of Christ .
50003019	Their end is destruction ; their god is their belly ; and their glory is in their shame : for they are immersed in earthly things .
50003020	But our way of life is in heaven . And from heaven , too , we await the Savior , our Lord Jesus Christ ,
50003021	who will transform the body of our lowliness , according to the form of the body of his glory , by means of that power by which he is even able to subject all things to himself .
50004001	And so , my most beloved and most desired brothers , my joy and my crown : stand firm in this way , in the Lord , most beloved .
50004002	I ask Euodia , and I beg Syntyche , to have the same understanding in the Lord .
50004003	And I also ask you , as my genuine companion , to assist those women who have labored with me in the Gospel , with Clement and the rest of my assistants , whose names are in the Book of Life .
50004004	Rejoice in the Lord always . Again , I say , rejoice .
50004005	Let your modesty be known to all men . The Lord is near .
50004006	Be anxious about nothing . But in all things , with prayer and supplication , with acts of thanksgiving , let your petitions be made known to God .
50004007	And so shall the peace of God , which exceeds all understanding , guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus .
50004008	Concerning the rest , brothers , whatever is true , whatever is chaste , whatever is just , whatever is holy , whatever is worthy to be loved , whatever is of good repute , if there is any virtue , if there is any praiseworthy discipline : meditate on these .
50004009	All the things that you have learned and accepted and heard and seen in me , do these . And so shall the God of peace be with you .
50004010	Now I rejoice in the Lord exceedingly , because finally , after some time , your feelings for me have flourished again , just as you formerly felt . For you had been preoccupied .
50004011	I am not saying this as if out of need . For I have learned that , in whatever state I am , it is sufficient .
50004012	I know how to be humbled , and I know how to abound . I am prepared for anything , anywhere : either to be full or to be hungry , either to have abundance or to endure scarcity .
50004013	Everything is possible in him who has strengthened me .
50004014	Yet truly , you have done well by sharing in my tribulation .
50004015	But you also know , O Philippians , that at the beginning of the Gospel , when I set out from Macedonia , not a single church shared with me in the plan of giving and receiving , except you alone .
50004016	For you even sent to Thessalonica , once , and then a second time , for what was useful to me .
50004017	It is not that I am seeking a gift . Instead , I seek the fruit that abounds to your benefit .
50004018	But I have everything in abundance . I have been filled up , having received from Epaphroditus the things that you sent ; this is an odor of sweetness , an acceptable sacrifice , pleasing to God .
50004019	And may my God fulfill all your desires , according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus .
50004020	And to God our Father be glory forever and ever . Amen .
50004021	Greet every saint in Christ Jesus .
50004022	The brothers who are with me greet you . All the saints greet you , but especially those who are of Caesar’s household .
50004023	May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit . Amen .
51001001	Paul , an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God , and Timothy , a brother ,
51001002	to the saints and faithful brothers in Christ Jesus who are at Colossae .
51001003	Grace and peace to you , from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ . We give thanks to God , the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , praying for you always .
51001004	For we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus , and of the love that you have toward all the saints ,
51001005	because of the hope that has been stored up for you in heaven , which you have heard through the Word of Truth in the Gospel .
51001006	This has reached you , just as it is present in the whole world , where it grows and bears fruit , as it has also done in you , since the day when you first heard and knew the grace of God in truth ,
51001007	just as you learned it from Epaphras , our most beloved fellow servant , who is for you a faithful minister of Christ Jesus .
51001008	And he has also manifested to us your love in the Spirit .
51001009	Then , too , from the day when we first heard it , we have not ceased praying for you and requesting that you be filled with the knowledge of his will , with all wisdom and spiritual understanding ,
51001010	so that you may walk in a manner worthy of God , being pleasing in all things , being fruitful in every good work , and increasing in the knowledge of God ,
51001011	being strengthened in every virtue , in accord with the power of his glory , with all patience and longsuffering , with joy ,
51001012	giving thanks to God the Father , who has made us worthy to have a share in the portion of the saints , in the light .
51001013	For he has rescued us from the power of darkness , and he has transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of his love ,
51001014	in whom we have redemption through his blood , the remission of sins .
51001015	He is the image of the invisible God , the first-born of every creature .
51001016	For in him was created everything in heaven and on earth , visible and invisible , whether thrones , or dominations , or principalities , or powers . All things were created through him and in him .
51001017	And he is before all , and in him all things continue .
51001018	And he is the head of his body , the Church . He is the beginning , the first-born from the dead , so that in all things he may hold primacy .
51001019	For the Father is well-pleased that all fullness reside in him ,
51001020	and that , through him , all things be reconciled to himself , making peace through the blood of his cross , for the things that are on earth , as well as the things that are in heaven .
51001021	And you , though you had been , in times past , understood to be foreigners and enemies , with works of evil ,
51001022	yet now he has reconciled you , by his body of flesh , through death , so as to offer you , holy and immaculate and blameless , before him .
51001023	So then , continue in the faith : well-founded and steadfast and immovable , by the hope of the Gospel that you have heard , which has been preached throughout all creation under heaven , the Gospel of which I , Paul , have become a minister .
51001024	For now I rejoice in my passion on your behalf , and I complete in my flesh the things that are lacking in the Passion of Christ , for the sake of his body , which is the Church .
51001025	For I have become a minister of the Church , according to the dispensation of God that has been given to me among you , so that I may fulfill the Word of God ,
51001026	the mystery which had remained hidden to past ages and generations , but which now is manifested to his saints .
51001027	To them , God willed to made known the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles , which is Christ and the hope of his glory within you .
51001028	We are announcing him , correcting every man and teaching every man , with all wisdom , so that we may offer every man perfect in Christ Jesus .
51001029	In him , too , I labor , striving according to his action within me , which he works in virtue .
51002001	For I want you to know the kind of solicitude that I have for you , and for those who are at Laodicea , as well as for those who have not seen my face in the flesh .
51002002	May their hearts be consoled and instructed in charity , with all the riches of a plenitude of understanding , with knowledge of the mystery of God the Father and of Christ Jesus .
51002003	For in him are hidden all treasures of wisdom and knowledge .
51002004	Now I say this , so that no one may deceive you with grandiose words .
51002005	For though I may be absent in body , yet I am with you in spirit . And I rejoice as I gaze upon your order and its foundation , which is in Christ , your faith .
51002006	Therefore , just as you have received the Lord Jesus Christ , walk in him .
51002007	Be rooted and continually built up in Christ . And be confirmed in the faith , just as you have also learned it , increasing in him with acts of thanksgiving .
51002008	See to it that no one deceives you through philosophy and empty falsehoods , as found in the traditions of men , in accord with the influences of the world , and not in accord with Christ .
51002009	For in him , all the fullness of the Divine Nature dwells bodily .
51002010	And in him , you have been filled ; for he is the head of all principality and power .
51002011	In him also , you have been circumcised with a circumcision not made by hand , not by the despoiling of the body of flesh , but by the circumcision of Christ .
51002012	You have been buried with him in baptism . In him also , you have risen again through faith , by the work of God , who raised him up from the dead .
51002013	And when you were dead in your transgressions and in the uncircumcision of your flesh , he enlivened you , together with him , forgiving you of all transgressions ,
51002014	and wiping away the handwriting of the decree which was against us , which was contrary to us . And he has taken this away from your midst , affixing it to the Cross .
51002015	And so , despoiling principalities and powers , he has led them away confidently and openly , triumphing over them in himself .
51002016	Therefore , let no one judge you as concerns food or drink , or a particular feast day , or feast days of new moons , or of Sabbaths .
51002017	For these are a shadow of the future , but the body is of Christ .
51002018	Let no one seduce you , preferring base things and a religion of Angels , walking according to what he has not seen , being vainly inflated by the sensations of his flesh ,
51002019	and not holding up the head , with which the whole body , by its underlying joints and ligaments , is joined together and grows with an increase that is of God .
51002020	So then , if you have died with Christ to the influences of this world , why do you still make decisions as if you were living in the world ?
51002021	Do not touch , do not taste , do not handle these things ,
51002022	which all lead to destruction by their very use , in accord with the precepts and doctrines of men .
51002023	Such ideas have at least an intention to attain to wisdom , but through superstition and debasement , not sparing the body , and they are without any honor in satiating the flesh .
51003001	Therefore , if you have risen together with Christ , seek the things that are above , where Christ is seated at the right hand of God .
51003002	Consider the things that are above , not the things that are upon the earth .
51003003	For you have died , and so your life is hidden with Christ in God .
51003004	When Christ , your life , appears , then you also will appear with him in glory .
51003005	Therefore , mortify your body , while it is upon the earth . For because of fornication , impurity , lust , evil desires , and avarice , which are a kind of service to idols ,
51003006	the wrath of God has overwhelmed the sons of unbelief .
51003007	You , too , walked in these things , in times past , when you were living among them .
51003008	But now you must set aside all these things : anger , indignation , malice , blasphemy , and indecent speech from your mouth .
51003009	Do not lie to one another . Strip yourselves of the old man , with his deeds ,
51003010	and clothe yourself with the new man , who has been renewed by knowledge , in accord with the image of the One who created him ,
51003011	where there is neither Gentile nor Jew , circumcision nor uncircumcision , Barbarian nor Scythian , servant nor free . Instead , Christ is everything , in everyone .
51003012	Therefore , clothe yourselves like the elect of God : holy and beloved , with hearts of mercy , kindness , humility , modesty , and patience .
51003013	Support one another , and , if anyone has a complaint against another , forgive one another . For just as the Lord has forgiven you , so also must you do .
51003014	And above all these things have charity , which is the bond of perfection .
51003015	And let the peace of Christ lift up your hearts . For in this peace , you have been called , as one body . And be thankful .
51003016	Let the word of Christ live in you in abundance , with all wisdom , teaching and correcting one another , with psalms , hymns , and spiritual canticles , singing to God with the grace in your hearts .
51003017	Let everything whatsoever that you do , whether in word or in deed , be done all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ , giving thanks to God the Father through him .
51003018	Wives , be submissive to your husbands , as is proper in the Lord .
51003019	Husbands , love your wives , and do not be bitter toward them .
51003020	Children , obey your parents in all things . For this is well-pleasing to the Lord .
51003021	Fathers , do not provoke your children to indignation , lest they lose heart .
51003022	Servants , obey , in all things , your lords according to the flesh , not serving only when seen , as if to please men , but serving in simplicity of heart , fearing God .
51003023	Whatever you do , do it from the heart , as for the Lord , and not for men .
51003024	For you know that you will receive from the Lord the repayment of an inheritance . Serve Christ the Lord .
51003025	For whoever causes injury shall be repaid for what he has wrongfully done . And there no favoritism with God .
51004001	You masters , supply your servants with what is just and equitable , knowing that you , too , have a Master in heaven .
51004002	Pursue prayer . Be watchful in prayer with acts of thanksgiving .
51004003	Pray together , for us also , so that God may open a door of speech to us , so as to speak the mystery of Christ , ( because of which , even now , I am in chains )
51004004	so that I may manifest it in the manner that I ought to speak .
51004005	Walk in wisdom toward those who are outside , redeeming this age .
51004006	Let your speech be ever graceful , seasoned with salt , so that you may know how you ought to respond to each person .
51004007	As for the things that concern me , Tychicus , a most beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord , will make everything known to you .
51004008	I have sent him to you for this very purpose , so that he may know the things that concern you , and may console your hearts ,
51004009	with Onesimus , a most beloved and faithful brother , who is from among you . They shall make known to you everything that is happening here .
51004010	Aristarchus , my fellow prisoner , greets you , as does Mark , the near cousin of Barnabas , about whom you have received instructions , ( if he comes to you , receive him )
51004011	and Jesus , who is called Justus , and those who are of the circumcision . These alone are my assistants , unto the kingdom of God ; they have been a consolation to me .
51004012	Epaphras greets you , who is from among you , a servant of Christ Jesus , ever solicitous for you in prayer , so that you may stand , perfect and complete , in the entire will of God .
51004013	For I offer testimony to him , that he has labored greatly for you , and for those who are at Laodicea , and for those at Hierapolis .
51004014	Luke , a most beloved physician , greets you , as does Demas .
51004015	Greet the brothers who are at Laodicea , and Nymphas , and those who are at his house , a church .
51004016	And when this epistle has been read among you , cause it to be read also in the church of the Laodiceans , and you should read that which is from the Laodiceans .
51004017	And tell Archippus : “ See to the ministry that you have received in the Lord , in order to fulfill it . ”
51004018	The greeting of Paul by my own hand . Remember my chains . May grace be with you . Amen .
52001001	Paul and Sylvanus and Timothy , to the church of the Thessalonians , in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
52001002	Grace and peace to you . We give thanks to God always for all of you , keeping the memory of you in our prayers without ceasing ,
52001003	remembering your work of faith , and hardship , and charity , and enduring hope , in our Lord Jesus Christ , before God our Father .
52001004	For we know , brothers , beloved of God , of your election .
52001005	For our Gospel has not been among you in word alone , but also in virtue , and in the Holy Spirit , and with a great fullness , in the same manner as you know we have acted among you for your sake .
52001006	And so , you became imitators of us and of the Lord , accepting the Word in the midst of great tribulation , but with the joy of the Holy Spirit .
52001007	So have you become a pattern for all who believe in Macedonia and in Achaia .
52001008	For from you , the Word of the Lord was spread , not only in Macedonia and in Achaia , but also in every place . Your faith , which is toward God , has advanced so much so that we do not need to speak to you about anything .
52001009	For others are reporting among us of the kind of acceptance we had among you , and how you were converted from idols to God , to the service of the living and true God ,
52001010	and to the expectation of his Son from heaven ( whom he raised up from the dead ) , Jesus , who has rescued us from the approaching wrath .
52002001	For you yourselves know , brothers , that our acceptance among you was not empty .
52002002	Instead , having previously suffered and been treated shamefully , as you know , at Philippi , we had confidence in our God , so as to speak the Gospel of God to you with much solicitude .
52002003	For our exhortation was not in error , nor from impurity , nor with deception .
52002004	But , just as we have been tested by God , so that the Gospel would be entrusted to us , so also did we speak , not so as to please men , but rather to please God , who tests our hearts .
52002005	And neither did we , at any time , become flattering in speech , as you know , nor did we seek an opportunity for avarice , as God is witness .
52002006	Nor did we seek the glory of men , neither from you , nor from others .
52002007	And although we could have been a burden to you , as Apostles of Christ , instead we became like little ones in your midst , like a nurse cherishing her children .
52002008	So desirous were we for you that we were willing to hand over to you , not only the Gospel of God , but even our own souls . For you have become most beloved to us .
52002009	For you remember , brothers , our hardship and weariness . We preached the Gospel of God among you , working night and day , so that we would not be burdensome to any of you .
52002010	You are witnesses , as is God , of how holy and just and blameless we were with you who have believed .
52002011	And you know the manner , with each one of you , like a father with his sons ,
52002012	in which we were pleading with you and consoling you , bearing witness , so that you would walk in a manner worthy of God , who has called you into his kingdom and glory .
52002013	For this reason also , we give thanks to God without ceasing : because , when you had accepted from us the Word of the hearing of God , you accepted it not as the word of men , but ( as it truly is ) as the Word of God , who is working in you who have believed .
52002014	For you , brothers , have become imitators of the churches of God which are at Judea , in Christ Jesus . For you , too , have suffered the same things from your fellow countrymen as they have suffered from the Jews ,
52002015	who also killed both the Lord Jesus , and the Prophets , and who have persecuted us . But they do not please God , and so they are adversaries to all men .
52002016	They prohibit us to speak to the Gentiles , so that they may be saved , and thus do they continually add to their own sins . But the wrath of God will overtake them in the very end .
52002017	And we , brothers , having been deprived of you for a short time , in sight , but not in heart , have hurried all the more to see your face , with a great desire .
52002018	For we wanted to come to you , ( indeed , I , Paul , attempted to do so once , and then again , ) but Satan impeded us .
52002019	For what is our hope , and our joy , and our crown of glory ? Is it not you , before our Lord Jesus Christ at his return ?
52002020	For you are our glory and our joy .
52003001	Because of this , willing to wait no longer , it was pleasing to us to remain at Athens , alone .
52003002	And we sent Timothy , our brother and a minister of God in the Gospel of Christ , to confirm you and to exhort you , on behalf of your faith ,
52003003	so that no one would be disturbed during these tribulations . For you yourselves know that we have been appointed to this .
52003004	For even while we were with you , we predicted to you that we would suffer tribulations , even as it has happened , and as you know .
52003005	For this reason also , I was not willing to wait any longer , and I sent to find out about your faith , lest perhaps he who tempts may have tempted you , and our labor might have been in vain .
52003006	But then , when Timothy arrived to us from you , he reported to us your faith and charity , and that you keep a good remembrance of us always , desiring to see us , just as we likewise desire to see you .
52003007	As a result , we were consoled in you , brothers , in the midst of all our difficulties and tribulations , through your faith .
52003008	For we now live so that you may stand firm in the Lord .
52003009	For what thanks would we be able to repay to God because of you , for all the joy with which we rejoice over you before our God ?
52003010	For night and day , ever more abundantly , we are praying that we may see your face , and that we may complete those things that are lacking in your faith .
52003011	But may God our Father himself , and our Lord Jesus Christ , direct our way to you .
52003012	And may the Lord multiply you , and make you abound in your charity toward one another and toward all , just as we also do toward you ,
52003013	in order to confirm your hearts without blame , in sanctity , before God our Father , unto the return of our Lord Jesus Christ , with all his saints . Amen .
52004001	Therefore , concerning other things , brothers , we ask and beg you , in the Lord Jesus , that , just as you have received from us the way in which you ought to walk and to please God , so also may you walk , in order that you may abound all the more .
52004002	For you know what precepts I have given to you through the Lord Jesus .
52004003	For this is the will of God , your sanctification : that you should abstain from fornication ,
52004004	that each one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor ,
52004005	not in passions of lust , like the Gentiles who do not know God ,
52004006	and that no one should overwhelm or circumvent his brother in business . For the Lord is the vindicator of all these things , just as we have preached and testified to you .
52004007	For God has not called us to impurity , but to sanctification .
52004008	And so , whoever despises these teachings , does not despise man , but God , who has even provided his Holy Spirit within us .
52004009	But concerning the charity of brotherhood , we have no need to write to you . For you yourselves have learned from God that you should love one another .
52004010	For indeed , you act in this way with all the brothers in all of Macedonia . But we petition you , brothers , so that you may abound all the more ,
52004011	to choose work that allows you to be tranquil , and to carry out your business and to do your work with your own hands , just as we have instructed you ,
52004012	and to walk honestly with those who are outside , and to desire nothing belonging to another .
52004013	And we do not want you to be ignorant , brothers , concerning those who are sleeping , so as not to be sorrowful , like these others who do not have hope .
52004014	For if we believe that Jesus has died and risen again , so also will God bring back with Jesus those who sleep in him .
52004015	For we say this to you , in the Word of the Lord : that we who are alive , who remain until the return of the Lord , will not precede those who have fallen asleep .
52004016	For the Lord himself , with a command and with the voice of an Archangel and with a trumpet of God , shall descend from heaven . And the dead , who are in Christ , shall rise up first .
52004017	Next , we who are alive , who are remaining , shall be taken up quickly together with them into the clouds to meet Christ in the air . And in this way , we shall be with the Lord always .
52004018	Therefore , console one another with these words .
52005001	But concerning dates and times , brothers , you do not need us to write to you .
52005002	For you yourselves thoroughly understand that the day of the Lord shall arrive much like a thief in the night .
52005003	For when they will say , “ Peace and security ! ” then destruction will suddenly overwhelm them , like the labor pains of a woman with child , and they will not escape .
52005004	But you , brothers , are not in darkness , so that you would be overtaken by that day as by a thief .
52005005	For all of you are sons of light and sons of daytime ; we are not of nighttime , nor of darkness .
52005006	Therefore , let us not sleep , as the rest do . Instead , we should be vigilant and sober .
52005007	For those who sleep , sleep in the night ; and those who are inebriated , are inebriated in the night .
52005008	But we , who are of the daylight , should be sober , being clothed with the breastplate of faith and of charity and having , as a helmet , the hope of salvation .
52005009	For God has not appointed us for wrath , but for the acquisition of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ ,
52005010	who died for us , so that , whether we watch , or whether we sleep , we may live in union with him .
52005011	Because of this , console one another and build up one another , just as you are doing .
52005012	And we ask you , brothers , to recognize those who labor among you , and who preside over you in the Lord , and who admonish you ,
52005013	so that you may consider them with an abundance of charity , for the sake of their work . Be at peace with them .
52005014	And we ask you , brothers : correct the disruptive , console the weak-minded , support the sick , be patient with everyone .
52005015	See to it that no one repays evil for evil to anyone . Instead , always pursue whatever is good , with one another and with all .
52005016	Rejoice always .
52005017	Pray without ceasing .
52005018	Give thanks in everything . For this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for all of you .
52005019	Do not choose to extinguish the Spirit .
52005020	Do not spurn prophecies .
52005021	But test all things . Hold on to whatever is good .
52005022	Abstain from every kind of evil .
52005023	And may the God of peace himself sanctify you through all things , so that your whole spirit and soul and body may be preserved without blame unto the return of our Lord Jesus Christ .
52005024	He who has called you is faithful . He shall act even now .
52005025	Brothers , pray for us .
52005026	Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss .
52005027	I bind you , through the Lord , that this epistle is to be read to all the holy brothers .
52005028	May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you . Amen .
53001001	Paul and Sylvanus and Timothy , to the church of the Thessalonians , in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
53001002	Grace and peace to you , from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
53001003	We ought to give thanks always to God for you , brothers , in a fitting manner , because your faith is increasing greatly , and because the charity of each of you toward one another is abundant ,
53001004	so much so that we ourselves even glory in you among the churches of God , because of your patience and faith in all of your persecutions and tribulations that you endure ,
53001005	which are a sign of the just judgment of God , so that you may be held worthy of the kingdom of God , for which you also suffer .
53001006	For certainly , it is just for God to repay trouble to those who trouble you ,
53001007	and to repay you , who are being troubled , with a repose with us , when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with the Angels of his virtue ,
53001008	granting vindication , by a flame of fire , against those who do not know God and who are not obedient to the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ .
53001009	These shall be given the eternal punishment of destruction , apart from the face of the Lord and apart from the glory of his virtue ,
53001010	when he arrives to be glorified in his saints , and to become a wonder in all those who have believed , in that day , because our testimony has been believed by you .
53001011	Because of this , too , we pray always for you , so that our God may make you worthy of his calling and may complete every act of his goodness , as well as his work of faith in virtue ,
53001012	in order that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you , and you in him , in accord with the grace of our God and of the Lord Jesus Christ .
53002001	But we ask you , brothers , concerning the advent of our Lord Jesus Christ and of our gathering to him ,
53002002	that you not be readily disturbed or terrified in your minds , by any spirit , or word , or epistle , supposedly sent from us , claiming that the day of the Lord is close by .
53002003	Let no one deceive you in any way . For this cannot be , unless the apostasy will have arrived first , and the man of sin will have been revealed , the son of perdition ,
53002004	who is an adversary to , and who is lifted up above , all that is called God or that is worshipped , so much so that he sits in the temple of God , presenting himself as if he were God .
53002005	Do you not recall that , when I was still with you , I told you these things ?
53002006	And now you know what it is that holds him back , so that he may be revealed in his own time .
53002007	For the mystery of iniquity is already at work . And only one now holds back , and will continue to hold back , until he is taken from our midst .
53002008	And then that iniquitous one shall be revealed , the one whom the Lord Jesus shall bring to ruin with the spirit of his mouth , and shall destroy at the brightness of his return :
53002009	him whose advent is accompanied by the works of Satan , with every kind of power and signs and false miracles ,
53002010	and with every seduction of iniquity , toward those who are perishing because they have not accepted the love of truth , so that they may be saved .
53002011	For this reason , God will send to them works of deception , so that they may believe in lies ,
53002012	in order that all those who have not believed in the truth , but who have consented to iniquity , may be judged .
53002013	Yet we must always give thanks to God for you , brothers , beloved of God , because God has chosen you as first-fruits for salvation , by the sanctification of the Spirit and by faith in the truth .
53002014	He has also called you into truth through our Gospel , unto the acquisition of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ .
53002015	And so , brothers , stand firm , and hold to the traditions that you have learned , whether by word or by our epistle .
53002016	So may our Lord Jesus Christ himself , and God our Father , who has loved us and who has given us an everlasting consolation and good hope in grace ,
53002017	exhort your hearts and confirm you in every good word and deed .
53003001	Concerning other things , brothers , pray for us , so that the Word of God may advance and be glorified , just as it is among you ,
53003002	and so that we may be freed from pertinacious and evil men . For not everyone is faithful .
53003003	But God is faithful . He will strengthen you , and he will guard you from evil .
53003004	And we have confidence about you in the Lord , that you are doing , and will continue to do , just as we have instructed .
53003005	And may the Lord direct your hearts , in the charity of God and with the patience of Christ .
53003006	But we strongly caution you , brothers , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , to draw yourselves away from every brother who is walking in disorder and not according to the tradition that they received from us .
53003007	For you yourselves know the manner in which you ought to imitate us . For we were not disorderly among you .
53003008	Nor did we eat bread from anyone for free , but rather , we worked night and day , in hardship and weariness , so as not to be burdensome to you .
53003009	It was not as if we had no authority , but this was so that we might present ourselves as an example to you , in order to imitate us .
53003010	Then , too , while we were with you , we insisted on this to you : that if anyone was not willing to work , neither should he eat .
53003011	For we have heard that there are some among you who act disruptively , not working at all , but eagerly meddling .
53003012	Now we charge those who act in this way , and we beg them in the Lord Jesus Christ , that they work in silence and eat their own bread .
53003013	And you , brothers , do not grow weak in doing good .
53003014	But if anyone does not obey our word by this epistle , take note of him and do not keep company with him , so that he may be ashamed .
53003015	But do not be willing to consider him as an enemy ; instead , correct him as a brother .
53003016	Then may the Lord of peace himself give you an everlasting peace , in every place . May the Lord be with all of you .
53003017	The greeting of Paul with my own hand , which is the seal in every epistle . So do I write .
53003018	May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all . Amen .
54001001	Paul , an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the authority of God our Savior and Christ Jesus our hope ,
54001002	to Timothy , beloved son in the faith . Grace , mercy , and peace , from God the Father and from Christ Jesus our Lord .
54001003	Now I asked you to remain at Ephesus , while I went into Macedonia , so that you would speak strongly against certain ones who have been teaching a different way ,
54001004	against those who have been paying attention to fables and endless genealogies . These things present questions as if they were greater than the edification that is of God , which is in faith .
54001005	Now the goal of instruction is charity from a pure heart , and a good conscience , and an unfeigned faith .
54001006	Certain persons , wandering away from these things , have been turned aside to empty babbling ,
54001007	desiring to be teachers of the law , but understanding neither the things that they themselves are saying , nor what they are affirming about these things .
54001008	But we know that the law is good , if one makes use of it properly .
54001009	Knowing this , that the law was not set in place for the just , but for the unjust and the insubordinate , for the impious and sinners , for the wicked and the defiled , for those who commit patricide , matricide , or homicide ,
54001010	for fornicators , for males who sleep with males , for kidnappers , for liars , for perjurers , and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine ,
54001011	which is in accord with the Gospel of the glory of the blessed God , the Gospel which has been entrusted to me .
54001012	I give thanks to him who has strengthened me , Christ Jesus our Lord , because he has considered me faithful , placing me in the ministry ,
54001013	though previously I was a blasphemer , and a persecutor , and contemptuous . But then I obtained the mercy of God . For I had been acting ignorantly , in unbelief .
54001014	And so the grace of our Lord has abounded greatly , with the faith and love that is in Christ Jesus .
54001015	It is a faithful saying , and worthy of acceptance by everyone , that Christ Jesus came into this world to bring salvation to sinners , among whom I am first .
54001016	But it was for this reason that I obtained mercy , so that in me as first , Christ Jesus would display all patience , for the instruction of those who would believe in him unto eternal life .
54001017	So then , to the King of ages , to the immortal , invisible , solitary God , be honor and glory forever and ever . Amen .
54001018	This precept I commend to you , my son Timothy , in accord with the prophets who preceded you : that you serve among them like a soldier in a good war ,
54001019	holding to faith and good conscience , against those who , by rejecting these things , have made a shipwreck of the faith .
54001020	Among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander , whom I have handed over to Satan , so that they may learn not to blaspheme .
54002001	And so I beg you , first of all , to make supplications , prayers , petitions , and thanksgivings for all men ,
54002002	for kings , and for all who are in high places , so that we may lead a quiet and tranquil life in all piety and chastity .
54002003	For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior ,
54002004	who wants all men to be saved and to arrive at an acknowledgment of the truth .
54002005	For there is one God , and one mediator of God and of men , the man Christ Jesus ,
54002006	who gave himself as a redemption for all , as a testimony in its proper time .
54002007	Of this testimony , I have been appointed a preacher and an Apostle , ( I speak the truth , I do not lie ) as a teacher of the Gentiles , in faith and in truth .
54002008	Therefore , I want men to pray in every place , lifting up pure hands , without anger or dissension .
54002009	Similarly also , women should be dressed fittingly , adorning themselves with compunction and restraint , and not with plaited hair , nor gold , nor pearls , nor costly attire ,
54002010	but in a manner proper for women who are professing piety by means of good works .
54002011	Let a woman learn in silence with all subjection .
54002012	For I do not permit a woman to teach , nor to be in authority over a man , but to be in silence .
54002013	For Adam was formed first , then Eve .
54002014	And Adam was not seduced , but the woman , having been seduced , was in transgression .
54002015	Yet she will be saved by bearing children , if she has continued in faith and love , and in sanctification accompanied by self-restraint .
54003001	It is a faithful saying : if a man desires the episcopate , he desires a good work .
54003002	Therefore , it is necessary for a bishop to be beyond reproach , the husband of one wife , sober , prudent , gracious , chaste , hospitable , a teacher ,
54003003	not a drunkard , not combative but restrained , not quarrelsome , not covetous ;
54003004	but a man who leads his own house well , having children who are subordinate with all chastity .
54003005	For if a man does not know how to lead his own house , how will he take care of the Church of God ?
54003006	He must not be a new convert , lest , being elated by pride , he may fall under the sentence of the devil .
54003007	And it is necessary for him also to have good testimony from those who are outside , so that he may not fall into disrepute and the snare of the devil .
54003008	Similarly , deacons must be chaste , not double-tongued , not given to much wine , not pursuing tainted profit ,
54003009	holding to the mystery of the faith with a pure conscience .
54003010	And these things should be proven first , and then they may minister , being without offense .
54003011	Similarly , the women must be chaste , not slanderers , sober , faithful in all things .
54003012	Deacons should be the husband of one wife , men who lead their own children and their own houses well .
54003013	For those who have ministered well will acquire for themselves a good position , and much confidence in the faith which is in Christ Jesus .
54003014	I am writing these things to you , with the hope that I will come to you soon .
54003015	But , if I am delayed , you should know the manner in which it is necessary to conduct yourself in the house of God , which is the Church of the living God , the pillar and the foundation of truth .
54003016	And it is clearly great , this mystery of piety , which was manifested in the flesh , which was justified in the Spirit , which has appeared to Angels , which has been preached to the Gentiles , which is believed in the world , which has been taken up in glory .
54004001	Now the Spirit has clearly said that , in the end times , some persons will depart from the faith , paying attention to spirits of error and the doctrines of devils ,
54004002	speaking lies in hypocrisy , and having their consciences seared ,
54004003	prohibiting marriage , abstaining from foods , which God has created to be accepted with thanksgiving by the faithful and by those who have understood the truth .
54004004	For every creature of God is good , and nothing is to be rejected which is received with thanksgiving ;
54004005	for it has been sanctified by the Word of God and by prayer .
54004006	By proposing these things to the brothers , you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus , nourished by words of faith , and by the good doctrine that you have secured .
54004007	But avoid the silly fables of old women . And exercise yourself so as to advance in piety .
54004008	For the exercise of the body is somewhat useful . But piety is useful in all things , holding the promise of life , in the present and in the future .
54004009	This is a faithful saying and worthy of full acceptance .
54004010	For this reason we labor and are maligned : because we hope in the living God , who is the Savior of all men , most especially of the faithful .
54004011	Instruct and teach these things .
54004012	Let no one despise your youth , but be an example among the faithful in word , in behavior , in charity , in faith , in chastity .
54004013	Until I arrive , attend to reading , to exhortation , and to doctrine .
54004014	Do not be willing to neglect the grace that is within you , which was given to you through prophecy , with the imposition of the hands of the priesthood .
54004015	Meditate on these things , so that your progress may be manifest to all .
54004016	Pay attention to yourself and to doctrine . Pursue these things . For in doing so , you will save both yourself and those who listen to you .
54005001	You should not rebuke an old man , but rather plead with him , as if he were your father ; with young men , like brothers ;
54005002	with old women , like mothers ; with young women , in all chastity , like sisters .
54005003	Honor those widows who are true widows .
54005004	But if any widow has children or grandchildren , let her first learn to manage her own household , and to fulfill , in turn , her own obligation to her parents ; for this is acceptable before God .
54005005	But she who is truly a widow and is destitute , let her hope in God , and let her be urgent in supplications and prayers , night and day .
54005006	For she who is living in pleasures is dead , while living .
54005007	And give instruction in this , so that they may be beyond reproach .
54005008	But if anyone has no concern for his own , and especially for those of his own household , he has denied the faith , and he is worse than an unbeliever .
54005009	Let a widow be chosen who is no less than sixty years of age , who was the wife of one husband ,
54005010	who has testimony of her good works : whether she has educated children , or has provided hospitality , or has washed the feet of the saints , or has ministered to those suffering tribulation , or has pursued any kind of good work .
54005011	But avoid the younger widows . For once they have flourished in Christ , they will want to marry ,
54005012	resulting in damnation , because they have disregarded the primacy of faith .
54005013	And being at the same time also idle , they learn to go from house to house , being not only idle , but also talkative and curious , speaking of things which do not concern them .
54005014	Therefore , I want the younger women to marry , to procreate children , to be mothers of families , to provide no ready opportunity for the adversary to speak evil .
54005015	For certain ones have already been turned back to Satan .
54005016	If any among the faithful have widows , let him minister to them and not burden the Church , so that there may be enough for those who are true widows .
54005017	Let priests who lead well be held worthy of twice the honor , especially those who labor in the Word and in doctrine .
54005018	For Scripture says : “ You shall not muzzle an ox as it is treading out the grain , ” and , “ The worker is worthy of his pay . ”
54005019	Do not be willing to accept an accusation against a priest , except under two or three witnesses .
54005020	Reprove sinners in the sight of everyone , so that the others may have fear .
54005021	I testify before God and Christ Jesus and the elect Angels , that you should observe these things without prejudgment , doing nothing which shows favoritism to either side .
54005022	You should not be quick to impose hands on anyone , nor should you take part in the sins of outsiders . Keep yourself chaste .
54005023	Do not continue to drink only water , but make use of a little wine , for the sake of your stomach and your frequent infirmities .
54005024	The sins of some men have been made manifest , preceding them to judgment , but those of others are manifested later .
54005025	Similarly , too , good deeds have been made manifest , but even when they are not , they cannot remain hidden .
54006001	Whoever are servants under the yoke , let them consider their masters to be worthy of every honor , lest the name and doctrine of the Lord be blasphemed .
54006002	But those who have believing masters , let them not despise them because they are brothers , but rather serve them all the more because they are believing and beloved , participants of the same service . Teach and exhort these things .
54006003	If anyone teaches otherwise , and does not consent to the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ , and to that doctrine which is in accord with piety ,
54006004	then he is arrogant , knowing nothing , yet languishing amid the questions and quarrels of words . From these arise envy , contention , blasphemy , evil suspicions :
54006005	the conflicts of men who have been corrupted in mind and deprived of truth , who consider profit to be piety .
54006006	But piety with sufficiency is great gain .
54006007	For we brought nothing into this world , and there is no doubt that we can take nothing away .
54006008	But , having nourishment and some kind of covering , we should be content with these .
54006009	For those who want to become rich fall into temptation and into the snare of the devil and into many useless and harmful desires , which submerge men in destruction and in perdition .
54006010	For desire is the root of all evils . Some persons , hungering in this way , have strayed from the faith and have entangled themselves in many sorrows .
54006011	But you , O man of God , flee from these things , and truly pursue justice , piety , faith , charity , patience , meekness .
54006012	Fight the good fight of faith . Take hold of the eternal life to which you have been called , and make a good profession of faith in the sight of many witnesses .
54006013	I charge you , in the sight of God , who enlivens all things , and in the sight of Christ Jesus , who gave the testimony of a good profession under Pontius Pilate ,
54006014	to observe the commandment , immaculately , irreproachably , unto the return of our Lord Jesus Christ .
54006015	For at the proper time , he shall reveal the blessed and only Power , the King of kings and the Lord of lords ,
54006016	who alone holds immortality , and who inhabits the inaccessible light , whom no man has seen , nor even is able to see , to whom is honor and everlasting dominion . Amen .
54006017	Instruct the wealthy of this age not to have a superior attitude , nor to hope in the uncertainty of riches , but in the living God , who offers us everything in abundance to enjoy ,
54006018	and to do good , to become rich in good works , to donate readily , to share ,
54006019	to gather for themselves the treasure of a good foundation for the future , so that they may obtain true life .
54006020	O Timothy , guard what has been deposited with you , avoiding the voice of profane novelties and of opposing ideas , which are falsely called knowledge .
54006021	Certain persons , promising these things , have perished from the faith . May grace be with you . Amen .
55001001	Paul , an Apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God , in accord with the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus ,
55001002	to Timothy , most beloved son . Grace , mercy , peace , from God the Father and from Christ Jesus our Lord .
55001003	I give thanks to God , whom I serve , as my forefathers did , with a pure conscience . For without ceasing I hold the remembrance of you in my prayers , night and day ,
55001004	desiring to see you , recalling your tears so as to be filled with joy ,
55001005	calling to mind the same faith , which is in you unfeigned , which also first dwelt in your grandmother , Lois , and in your mother , Eunice , and also , I am certain , in you .
55001006	Because of this , I admonish you to revive the grace of God , which is in you by the imposition of my hands .
55001007	For God has not given us a spirit of fear , but of virtue , and of love , and of self-restraint .
55001008	And so , do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord , nor of me , his prisoner . Instead , collaborate with the Gospel in accord with the virtue of God ,
55001009	who has freed us and has called us to his holy vocation , not according to our works , but according to his own purpose and grace , which was given to us in Christ Jesus , before the ages of time .
55001010	And this has now been made manifest by the illumination of our Savior Jesus Christ , who certainly has destroyed death , and who has also illuminated life and incorruption through the Gospel .
55001011	Of this Gospel , I have been appointed a preacher , and an Apostle , and a teacher of the Gentiles .
55001012	For this reason , I also suffer these things . But I am not confounded . For I know in whom I have believed , and I am certain that he has the power to preserve what was entrusted to me , unto that day .
55001013	Hold to the kind of sound words that you have heard from me in the faith and love which is in Christ Jesus .
55001014	Guard the good entrusted to you through the Holy Spirit , who lives within us .
55001015	Know this : that all those who are in Asia have turned away from me , among whom are Phigellus and Hermogenes .
55001016	May the Lord have mercy on the house of Onesiphorus , because he has often refreshed me , and he has not been ashamed of my chains .
55001017	Instead , when he had arrived in Rome , he anxiously sought me and found me .
55001018	May the Lord grant to him to obtain mercy from the Lord in that day . And you know well in how many ways he has ministered to me at Ephesus .
55002001	And as for you , my son , be strengthened by the grace which is in Christ Jesus ,
55002002	and by the things which you have heard from me through many witnesses . These things encourage faithful men , who shall then be suitable to teach others also .
55002003	Labor like a good soldier of Christ Jesus .
55002004	No man , acting as a soldier for God , entangles himself in worldly matters , so that he may be pleasing to him for whom he has proven himself .
55002005	Then , too , whoever strives in a competition is not crowned , unless he has competed lawfully .
55002006	The farmer who labors ought to be the first to share in the produce .
55002007	Understand what I am saying . For the Lord will give you understanding in all things .
55002008	Be mindful that the Lord Jesus Christ , who is the offspring of David , has risen again from the dead , according to my Gospel .
55002009	I labor in this Gospel , even while chained like an evildoer . But the Word of God is not bound .
55002010	I endure all things for this reason : for the sake of the elect , so that they , too , may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus , with heavenly glory .
55002011	It is a faithful saying : that if we have died with him , we will also live with him .
55002012	If we suffer , we will also reign with him . If we deny him , he will also deny us .
55002013	If we are unfaithful , he remains faithful : he is not able to deny himself .
55002014	Insist on these things , testifying before the Lord . Do not be contentious about words , for this is useful for nothing but the subversion of listeners .
55002015	Be solicitous in the task of presenting yourself before God as a proven and unashamed worker who has handled the Word of Truth correctly .
55002016	But avoid profane or empty talk . For these things advance one greatly in impiety .
55002017	And their word spreads like a cancer : among these are Hymenaeus and Philetus ,
55002018	who have fallen away from the truth by saying that the resurrection is already complete . And so they have subverted the faith of certain persons .
55002019	But the firm foundation of God remains standing , having this seal : the Lord knows those who are his own , and all who know the name of the Lord depart from iniquity .
55002020	But , in a large house , there are not only vessels of gold and of silver , but also those of wood and of clay ; and certainly some are held in honor , but others in dishonor .
55002021	If anyone , then , will have cleansed himself from these things , he shall be a vessel held in honor , sanctified and useful to the Lord , prepared for every good work .
55002022	So then , flee from the desires of your youth , yet truly , pursue justice , faith , hope , charity , and peace , along with those who call upon the Lord from a pure heart .
55002023	But avoid foolish and undisciplined questions , for you know that these produce strife .
55002024	For the servant of the Lord must not be contentious , but instead he must be meek toward everyone , teachable , patient ,
55002025	correcting with self-restraint those who resist the truth . For at any time God may give them repentance , so as to recognize the truth ,
55002026	and then they may recover from the snares of the devil , by whom they are held captive at his will .
55003001	And know this : that in the last days perilous times will press near .
55003002	Men will be lovers of themselves , greedy , self-exalting , arrogant , blasphemers , disobedient to parents , ungrateful , wicked ,
55003003	without affection , without peace , false accusers , unchaste , cruel , without kindness ,
55003004	traitorous , reckless , self-important , loving pleasure more than God ,
55003005	even having the appearance of piety while rejecting its virtue . And so , avoid them .
55003006	For among these are ones who penetrate houses and lead away , like captives , foolish women burdened with sins , who are led away by means of various desires ,
55003007	always learning , yet never achieving knowledge of the truth .
55003008	And in the same manner that Jannes and Jambres resisted Moses , so also will these resist the truth , men corrupted in mind , reprobates from the faith .
55003009	But they will not advance beyond a certain point . For the folly of the latter shall be made manifest to all , just as that of the former .
55003010	But you have fully comprehended my doctrine , instruction , purpose , faith , longsuffering , love , patience ,
55003011	persecutions , afflictions ; such things as happened to me at Antioch , at Iconium , and at Lystra ; how I endured persecutions , and how the Lord rescued me from everything .
55003012	And all those who willingly live the piety in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution .
55003013	But evil men and deceivers will advance in evil , erring and sending into error .
55003014	Yet truly , you should remain in those things which you have learned and which have been entrusted to you . For you know from whom you have learned them .
55003015	And , from your infancy , you have known the Sacred Scriptures , which are able to instruct you toward salvation , through the faith which is in Christ Jesus .
55003016	All Scripture , having been divinely inspired , is useful for teaching , for reproof , for correction , and for instruction in justice ,
55003017	so that the man of God may be perfect , having been trained for every good work .
55004001	I testify before God , and before Jesus Christ , who shall judge the living and the dead through his return and his kingdom :
55004002	that you should preach the word urgently , in season and out of season : reprove , entreat , rebuke , with all patience and doctrine .
55004003	For there shall be a time when they will not endure sound doctrine , but instead , according to their own desires , they will gather to themselves teachers , with itching ears ,
55004004	and certainly , they will turn their hearing away from the truth , and they will be turned toward fables .
55004005	But as for you , truly , be vigilant , laboring in all things . Do the work of an Evangelist , fulfilling your ministry . Show self-restraint .
55004006	For I am already being worn away , and the time of my dissolution presses close .
55004007	I have fought the good fight . I have completed the course . I have preserved the faith .
55004008	As for the remainder , a crown of justice has been reserved for me , one which the Lord , the just judge , will render to me in that day , and not only to me , but also to those who look forward to his return . Hurry to return to me soon .
55004009	For Demas has abandoned me , out of love for this age , and he has departed for Thessalonica .
55004010	Crescens has gone to Galatia ; Titus to Dalmatia .
55004011	Luke alone is with me . Take Mark and bring him with you ; for he is useful to me in the ministry .
55004012	But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus .
55004013	When you return , bring with you the supplies that I left with Carpus at Troas , and the books , but especially the parchments .
55004014	Alexander the coppersmith has shown me much evil ; the Lord will repay him according to his works .
55004015	And you should also avoid him ; for he has strongly resisted our words .
55004016	At my first defense , no one stood by me , but everyone abandoned me . May it not be counted against them !
55004017	But the Lord stood with me and strengthened me , so that through me the preaching would be accomplished , and so that all the Gentiles would hear . And I was freed from the mouth of the lion .
55004018	The Lord has freed me from every evil work , and he will accomplish salvation by his heavenly kingdom . To him be glory forever and ever . Amen .
55004019	Greet Prisca , and Aquila , and the household of Onesiphorus .
55004020	Erastus remained at Corinth . And Trophimus I left sick at Miletus .
55004021	Hurry to arrive before winter . Eubulus , and Pudens , and Linus , and Claudia , and all the brothers greet you .
55004022	May the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit . May grace be with you . Amen .
56001001	Paul , a servant of God and an Apostle of Jesus Christ , in accord with the faith of God’s elect and in acknowledgment of the truth which is accompanied by piety ,
56001002	in the hope of the eternal life that God , who does not lie , promised before the ages of time ,
56001003	which , at the proper time , he has manifested by his Word , in the preaching that has been entrusted to me by the command of God our Savior ;
56001004	to Titus , beloved son according to the common faith . Grace and peace , from God the Father and from Christ Jesus our Savior .
56001005	For this reason , I left you behind in Crete : so that those things which are lacking , you would correct , and so that you would ordain , throughout the communities , priests , ( just as I also ordained you )
56001006	if such a man is without offense , the husband of one wife , having faithful children , not accused of self-indulgence , nor of insubordination .
56001007	And a bishop , as a steward of God , must be without offense : not arrogant , not short-tempered , not a drunkard , not violent , not desiring tainted profit ,
56001008	but instead : hospitable , kind , sober , just , holy , chaste ,
56001009	embracing faithful speech which is in agreement with doctrine , so that he may be able to exhort in sound doctrine and to argue against those who contradict .
56001010	For there are , indeed , many who are disobedient , who speak empty words , and who deceive , especially those who are of the circumcision .
56001011	These must be reproved , for they subvert entire houses , teaching things which should not be taught , for the favor of shameful gain .
56001012	A certain one of these , a prophet of their own kind , said : “ The Cretans are ever liars , evil beasts , lazy gluttons . ”
56001013	This testimony is true . Because of this , rebuke them sharply , so that they may be sound in the faith ,
56001014	not paying attention to Jewish fables , nor to the rules of men who have turned themselves away from the truth .
56001015	All things are clean to those who are clean . But to those who are defiled , and to unbelievers , nothing is clean ; for both their mind and their conscience have been polluted .
56001016	They claim that they know God . But , by their own works , they deny him , since they are abominable , and unbelieving , and reprobate , toward every good work .
56002001	But you are to speak the things that befit sound doctrine .
56002002	Old men should be sober , chaste , prudent , sound in faith , in love , in patience .
56002003	Old women , similarly , should be in holy attire , not false accusers , not given to much wine , teaching well ,
56002004	so that they may teach prudence to the young women , so that they may love their husbands , love their children ,
56002005	be sensible , chaste , restrained , have concern for the household , be kind , be subordinate to their husbands : so that the Word of God may be not blasphemed .
56002006	Exhort young men similarly , so that they may show self-restraint .
56002007	In all things , present yourself as an example of good works : in doctrine , with integrity , with seriousness ,
56002008	with sound words , irreproachably , so that he who is an opponent may dread that he has nothing evil to say about us .
56002009	Exhort servants to be submissive to their masters , in all things pleasing , not contradicting ,
56002010	not cheating , but in all things showing good fidelity , so that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things .
56002011	For the grace of God our Savior has appeared to all men ,
56002012	instructing us to reject impiety and worldly desires , so that we may live soberly and justly and piously in this age ,
56002013	looking forward to the blessed hope and the advent of the glory of the great God and of our Savior Jesus Christ .
56002014	He gave himself for our sake , so that he might redeem us from all iniquity , and might cleanse for himself an acceptable people , pursuers of good works .
56002015	Speak and exhort and argue these things with all authority . Let no one despise you .
56003001	Admonish them to be subordinate to the rulers and authorities , to obey their dictates , to be prepared for every good work ,
56003002	to speak evil of no one , not to be litigious , but to be reserved , displaying all meekness toward all men .
56003003	For , in times past , we ourselves were also unwise , unbelieving , erring , servants of various desires and pleasures , acting with malice and envy , being hateful and hating one another .
56003004	But then the kindness and humanity of God our Savior appeared .
56003005	And he saved us , not by works of justice that we had done , but , in accord with his mercy , by the washing of regeneration and by the renovation of the Holy Spirit ,
56003006	whom he has poured out upon us in abundance , through Jesus Christ our Savior ,
56003007	so that , having been justified by his grace , we may become heirs according to the hope of eternal life .
56003008	This is a faithful saying . And I want you to confirm these things , so that those who believe in God may take care to excel in good works . These things are good and useful to men .
56003009	But avoid foolish questions , and genealogies , and contentions , as well as arguments against the law . For these are useless and empty .
56003010	Avoid a man who is a heretic , after the first and second correction ,
56003011	knowing that one who is like this has been subverted , and that he offends ; for he has been condemned by his own judgment .
56003012	When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you , hurry to return to me at Nicopolis . For I have decided to winter there .
56003013	Send Zenas the lawyer and Apollo ahead with care , and let nothing be lacking to them .
56003014	But let our men also learn to excel in good works pertaining to the necessities of life , so that they may not be unfruitful .
56003015	All those who are with me greet you . Greet those who love us in the faith . May the grace of God be with you all . Amen .
57001001	Paul , a prisoner of Christ Jesus , and Timothy , a brother , to Philemon , our beloved fellow laborer ,
57001002	and to Apphia , most beloved sister , and to Archippus , our fellow soldier , and to the church which is in your house .
57001003	Grace and peace to you , from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
57001004	I give thanks to my God , always keeping remembrance of you in my prayers ,
57001005	( for I am hearing of your charity and faith , which you have in the Lord Jesus and with all the saints )
57001006	so that the participation of your faith may become evident by the recognition of every good work which is in you in Christ Jesus .
57001007	For I have found great joy and consolation in your charity , because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed by you , brother .
57001008	Because of this , I have enough confidence in Christ Jesus to command you concerning certain things ,
57001009	but I beg you instead , for the sake of charity , since you are so much like Paul : an old man and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ .
57001010	I beg you , on behalf of my son , whom I have begotten in my chains , Onesimus .
57001011	In times past , he was useless to you , but now he is useful both to me and to you .
57001012	So I have sent him back to you . And may you receive him like my own heart .
57001013	I myself wanted to retain him with me , so that he might minister to me , on your behalf , while I am in the chains of the Gospel .
57001014	But I was willing to do nothing without your counsel , so as not to make use of your good deed as if out of necessity , but only willingly .
57001015	So perhaps , then , he departed from you for a time , so that you might receive him again for eternity ,
57001016	no longer as a servant , but , in place of a servant , a most beloved brother , especially to me : but how much so more to you , both in the flesh and in the Lord !
57001017	Therefore , if you hold me to be a companion , receive him as you would me .
57001018	But if he has harmed you in any way , or if he is in your debt , charge it to me .
57001019	I , Paul , have written this with my own hand : I will repay . And I need not tell you , that you are also in debt yourself , to me .
57001020	So it is , brother . May I delight with you in the Lord ! Refresh my heart in Christ .
57001021	I have written to you , trusting in your obedience , knowing , too , that you will do even more than what I say .
57001022	But also , at once , prepare a lodging for me . For I am hoping , through your prayers , to present myself to you .
57001023	Greet Epaphras , my fellow captive in Christ Jesus ,
57001024	and Mark , Aristarchus , Demas , and Luke , my helpers .
57001025	May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit . Amen .
58001001	In many places and in many ways , in past times , God spoke to the fathers through the Prophets ;
58001002	lastly , in these days , he has spoken to us through the Son , whom he appointed as the heir of all things , and through whom he made the world .
58001003	And since the Son is the brightness of his glory , and the figure of his substance , and is carrying all things by the Word of his virtue , thereby accomplishing a purging of sins , he sits at the right hand of Majesty on high .
58001004	And having been made so much better than the Angels , he has inherited a name so much greater than theirs .
58001005	For to which of the Angels has he ever said : “ You are my Son ; today have I begotten you ? ” Or again : “ I will be a Father to him , and he shall be a Son to me ? ”
58001006	And again , when he brings the only-begotten Son into the world , he says : “ And let all the Angels of God adore him . ”
58001007	And about the Angels , certainly , he says : “ He makes his Angels spirits , and his ministers a flame of fire . ”
58001008	But about the Son : “ Your throne , O God , is forever and ever . The scepter of your kingdom is a scepter of equity .
58001009	You have loved justice , and you have hated iniquity . Because of this , God , your God , has anointed you with the oil of exultation , above your companions . ”
58001010	And : “ In the beginning , O Lord , you founded the earth . And the heavens are the work of your hands .
58001011	These shall pass away , but you will remain . And all will grow old like a garment .
58001012	And you will change them like a cloak , and they shall be changed . Yet you are ever the same , and your years will not diminish . ”
58001013	But to which of the Angels has he ever said : “ Sit at my right hand , until I make your enemies your footstool ? ”
58001014	Are they not all spirits of ministration , sent to minister for the sake of those who shall receive the inheritance of salvation ?
58002001	For this reason , it is necessary for us to observe more thoroughly the things that we have heard , lest we let them slip away .
58002002	For if a word that was spoken through the Angels has been made firm , and every transgression and disobedience has received the recompense of a just retribution ,
58002003	in what way might we escape , if we neglect such a great salvation ? For though initially it had begun to be described by the Lord , it was confirmed among us by those who heard him ,
58002004	with God testifying to it by signs and wonders , and by various miracles , and by the pouring out of the Holy Spirit , in accord with his own will .
58002005	For God did not subject the future world , about which we are speaking , to the Angels .
58002006	But someone , in a certain place , has testified , saying : “ What is man , that you are mindful of him , or the Son of man , that you visit him ?
58002007	You have reduced him to a little less than the Angels . You have crowned him with glory and honor , and you have set him over the works of your hands .
58002008	You have subjected all things under his feet . ” For in as much as he has subjected all things to him , he has left nothing not subject to him . But in the present time , we do not yet perceive that all things have been made subject to him .
58002009	Yet we understand that Jesus , who was reduced to a little less than the Angels , was crowned with glory and honor because of his Passion and death , in order that , by the grace of God , he might taste death for all .
58002010	For it was fitting for him , because of whom and through whom all things exist , who had led many children into glory , to complete the authorship of their salvation through his Passion .
58002011	For he who sanctifies , and those who are sanctified , are all from One . For this reason , he is not ashamed to call them brothers , saying :
58002012	“ I will announce your name to my brothers . In the midst of the Church , I will praise you . ”
58002013	And again : “ I will be faithful in him . ” And again : “ Behold , I and my children , whom God has given to me . ”
58002014	Therefore , because children have a common flesh and blood , he himself also , in like manner , has shared in the same , so that through death , he might destroy him who held the dominion of death , that is , the devil ,
58002015	and so that he might free those who , through the fear of death , had been condemned to servitude throughout their entire life .
58002016	For at no time did he take hold of the Angels , but instead he took hold of the offspring of Abraham .
58002017	Therefore , it is fitting for him to be made similar to his brothers in all things , so that he might become a merciful and faithful High Priest before God , in order that he might bring forgiveness to the offenses of the people .
58002018	For in as much as he himself has suffered and has been tempted , he also is able to assist those who are tempted .
58003001	Therefore , holy brothers , sharers in the heavenly calling , consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession : Jesus .
58003002	He is faithful to the One who made him , just as Moses also was , with his entire house .
58003003	For this Jesus was considered worthy of greater glory than Moses , so much so that the house which he has built holds a greater honor than the former one .
58003004	For every house is built by someone , but God is the One who has created all things .
58003005	And certainly Moses was faithful , with his entire house , like any servant , as a testimony to those things that would soon be said .
58003006	Yet truly , Christ is like a Son in his own house . We are that house , if we firmly retain the faithfulness and the glory of hope , even unto the end .
58003007	Because of this , it is just as the Holy Spirit says : “ If today you hear his voice ,
58003008	harden not your hearts , as in the provocation , the very day of temptation , in the desert ,
58003009	where your fathers tested me , even though they had seen and examined my works for forty years .
58003010	For this reason , I was enraged against this generation , and I said : They always wander astray in heart . For they have not known my ways .
58003011	So it is as I swore in my wrath : They shall not enter into my rest ! ”
58003012	Be cautious , brothers , lest perhaps there may be , in any of you , an evil heart of unbelief , turning aside from the living God .
58003013	Instead , exhort one another every day , while it is still called ‘ today , ’ so that none of you may become hardened through the falseness of sin .
58003014	For we have been made participants in Christ . This is only so , if we firmly retain the beginning of his substance , even unto the end .
58003015	For it has been said : “ If today you hear his voice , harden not your hearts , in the same manner as in the former provocation . ”
58003016	For some of those listening did provoke him . But not all of these had set forth from Egypt through Moses .
58003017	So against whom was he angry for forty years ? Was it not those who had sinned , whose dead bodies lay prostrate in the desert ?
58003018	But to whom did he swear that they would not enter into his rest , except to those who were incredulous ?
58003019	And so , we perceive that they were not able to enter because of unbelief .
58004001	Therefore , we should be afraid , lest the promise of entering into his rest may be relinquished , and some of you may be judged to be lacking .
58004002	For this was announced to us in a similar manner as to them . But the mere hearing of the word did not benefit them , since it was not joined together with a faith in those things that they heard .
58004003	For we who have believed shall enter into rest , in the same manner as he said : “ So it is as I have sworn in my wrath : They shall not enter into my rest ! ” And certainly , this is when the works from the foundation of the world have been finished .
58004004	For , in a certain place , he spoke about the seventh day in this manner : “ And God rested on the seventh day from all his works . ”
58004005	And in this place again : “ They shall not enter into my rest ! ”
58004006	Therefore , this is because certain ones remain who are to enter into it , and those to whom it was announced first did not enter into it , because of unbelief .
58004007	Again , he defines a certain day , after so much time , saying in David , “ Today , ” just as it was stated above , “ If today you hear his voice , harden not your hearts . ”
58004008	For if Jesus had offered them rest , he would never have spoken , afterward , about another day .
58004009	And so , there remains a Sabbath of rest for the people of God .
58004010	For whoever has entered into his rest , the same has also rested from his works , just as God did from his .
58004011	Therefore , let us hasten to enter into that rest , so that no one may fall into the same example of unbelief .
58004012	For the Word of God is living and effective : more piercing than any two-edged sword , reaching to the division even between the soul and the spirit , even between the joints and the marrow , and so it discerns the thoughts and intentions of the heart .
58004013	And there is no created thing that is invisible to his sight . For all things are naked and open to the eyes of him , about whom we are speaking .
58004014	Therefore , since we have a great High Priest , who has pierced the heavens , Jesus the Son of God , we should hold to our confession .
58004015	For we do not have a high priest who is unable to have compassion on our infirmities , but rather one who was tempted in all things , just as we are , yet without sin .
58004016	Therefore , let us go forth with confidence toward the throne of grace , so that we may obtain mercy , and find grace , in a helpful time .
58005001	For every high priest , having been taken from among men , is appointed on behalf of men toward the things which pertain to God , so that he may offer gifts and sacrifices on behalf of sins ;
58005002	he is able to commiserate with those who are ignorant and who wander astray , because he himself is also encompassed by infirmity .
58005003	And because of this , he also must make such offerings for sins even for himself , in the same manner as for the people .
58005004	Neither does anyone take up this honor himself , but rather he who is called by God , just as Aaron was .
58005005	Thus , even Christ did not glorify himself , so as to become High Priest , but instead , it was God who said to him : “ You are my Son . Today I have begotten you . ”
58005006	And similarly , he says in another place : “ You are a priest forever , according to the order of Melchizedek . ”
58005007	It is Christ who , in the days of his flesh , with a strong cry and tears , offered prayers and supplications to the One who was able to save him from death , and who was heard because of his reverence .
58005008	And although , certainly , he is the Son of God , he learned obedience by the things that he suffered .
58005009	And having reached his consummation , he was made , for all who are obedient to him , the cause of eternal salvation ,
58005010	having been called by God to be the High Priest , according to the order of Melchizedek .
58005011	Our message about him is great , and difficult to explain when speaking , because you have been made feeble when listening .
58005012	For even though it is the time when you ought to be teachers , you are still lacking , so that you must be taught the things that are the basic elements of the Word of God , and so you have been made like those who are in need of milk , and not of solid food .
58005013	For anyone who is still feeding on milk is still unskillful in the Word of Justice ; for he is like an infant .
58005014	But solid food is for those who are mature , for those who , by practice , have sharpened their mind , so as to discern good from evil .
58006001	Therefore , interrupting an explanation of the basics of Christ , let us consider what is more advanced , not presenting again the fundamentals of repentance from dead works , and of faith toward God ,
58006002	of the doctrine of baptism , and also of the imposition of hands , and of the resurrection of the dead , and of eternal judgment .
58006003	And we shall do this , if indeed God permits it .
58006004	For it is impossible for those who were once illuminated , and have even tasted of the heavenly gift , and have become sharers in the Holy Spirit ,
58006005	who , despite having tasted the good Word of God and the virtues of the future age , have yet fallen away ,
58006006	to be renewed again to penance , since they are crucifying again in themselves the Son of God and are still maintaining pretenses .
58006007	For the earth accepts a blessing from God , by drinking in the rain that often falls upon it , and by producing plants that are useful to those by whom it is cultivated .
58006008	But whatever brings forth thorns and briers is rejected , and is closest to what is accursed ; their consummation is in combustion .
58006009	But from you , most beloved , we are confident that there will be things better and closer to salvation ; even though we speak in this way .
58006010	For God is not unjust , such that he would forget your work and the love that you have shown in his name . For you have ministered , and you continue to minister , to the saints .
58006011	Yet we desire that each one of you display the same solicitude toward the fulfillment of hope , even unto the end ,
58006012	so that you may not be slow to act , but instead may be imitators of those who , through faith and patience , shall inherit the promises .
58006013	For God , in making promises to Abraham , swore by himself , ( because he had no one greater by whom he might swear ) ,
58006014	saying : “ Blessing , I shall bless you , and multiplying , I shall multiply you . ”
58006015	And in this way , by enduring patiently , he secured the promise .
58006016	For men swear by what is greater than themselves , and an oath as confirmation is the end of all their controversy .
58006017	In this matter , God , wanting to reveal more thoroughly the immutability of his counsel to the heirs of the promise , interposed an oath ,
58006018	so that by two immutable things , in which it is impossible for God to lie , we may have the strongest solace : we who have fled together so as to hold fast to the hope set before us .
58006019	This we have as an anchor of the soul , safe and sound , which advances even to the interior of the veil ,
58006020	to the place where the forerunner Jesus has entered on our behalf , so as to become the High Priest for eternity , according to the order of Melchizedek .
58007001	For this Melchizedek , king of Salem , priest of the Most High God , met Abraham , as he was returning from the slaughter of the kings , and blessed him .
58007002	And Abraham divided to him a tenth part of everything . And in translation his name is first , indeed , king of justice , and next also king of Salem , that is , king of peace .
58007003	Without father , without mother , without genealogy , having neither beginning of days , nor end of life , he is thereby likened to the Son of God , who remains a priest continuously .
58007004	Next , consider how great this man is , since the Patriarch Abraham even gave tithes to him from the principal things .
58007005	And indeed , those who are from the sons of Levi , having received the priesthood , hold a commandment to take tithes from the people in accord with the law , that is , from their brothers , even though they also went forth from the loins of Abraham .
58007006	But this man , whose lineage is not enumerated with them , received tithes from Abraham , and he blessed even the one who held the promises .
58007007	Yet this is without any contradiction , for what is less should be blessed by what is better .
58007008	And certainly , here , men who receive tithes still die ; but there , he bears witness that he lives .
58007009	And so it may be said that even Levi , who received tithes , was himself a tithe through Abraham .
58007010	For he was still in the loins of his father , when Melchizedek met him .
58007011	Therefore , if consummation had occurred through the Levitical priesthood ( for under it the people received the law ) , then what further need would there be for another Priest to rise up according to the order of Melchizedek , one who was not called according to the order of Aaron ?
58007012	For since the priesthood has been transferred , it is necessary that the law also be transferred .
58007013	For he about whom these things have been spoken is from another tribe , in which no one attends before the altar .
58007014	For it is evident that our Lord arose out of Judah , a tribe about which Moses said nothing concerning priests .
58007015	And yet it is far more evident that , according to the likeness of Melchizedek , there rises up another priest ,
58007016	who was made , not according to the law of a carnal commandment , but according to the virtue of an indissoluble life .
58007017	For he testifies : “ You are a priest forever , according to the order of Melchizedek . ”
58007018	Certainly , there is a setting aside of the former commandment , because of its weakness and lack of usefulness .
58007019	For the law led no one to perfection , yet truly it introduced a better hope , through which we draw near to God .
58007020	Moreover , it is not without an oath . For certainly , the others were made priests without an oath .
58007021	But this man was made a priest with an oath , by the One who said to him : “ The Lord has sworn and he will not repent . You are a priest forever . ”
58007022	By so much , Jesus has been made the sponsor of a better testament .
58007023	And certainly , so many of the others became priests because , due to death , they were prohibited from continuing .
58007024	But this man , because he continues forever , has an everlasting priesthood .
58007025	And for this reason , he is able , continuously , to save those who approach God through him , since he is ever alive to make intercession on our behalf .
58007026	For it was fitting that we should have such a High Priest : holy , innocent , undefiled , set apart from sinners , and exalted higher than the heavens .
58007027	And he has no need , daily , in the manner of other priests , to offer sacrifices , first for his own sins , and then for those of the people . For he has done this once , by offering himself .
58007028	For the law appoints men as priests , though they have infirmities . But , by the word of the oath that is after the law , the Son has been perfected for eternity .
58008001	Now the main point in the things that have been stated is this : that we have so great a High Priest , who is seated at the right hand of the throne of Majesty in the heavens ,
58008002	who is the minister of holy things , and of the true tabernacle , which was established by the Lord , not by man .
58008003	For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices . Therefore , it is necessary for him also to have something to offer .
58008004	And so , if he were upon the earth , he would not be a priest , since there would be others to offer gifts according to the law ,
58008005	gifts which serve as mere examples and shadows of the heavenly things . And so it was answered to Moses , when he was about to complete the tabernacle : “ See to it , ” he said , “ that you make everything according to the example which was revealed to you on the mountain . ”
58008006	But now he has been granted a better ministry , so much so that he is also the Mediator of a better testament , which has been confirmed by better promises .
58008007	For if the former one had been entirely without fault , then a place certainly would not have been sought for a subsequent one .
58008008	For , finding fault with them , he says : “ Behold , the days shall arrive , says the Lord , when I will consummate a New Testament over the house of Israel and the house of Judah ,
58008009	not according to the testament which I made with their fathers , on the day when I took them by the hand , so that I might lead them away from the land of Egypt . For they did not remain in my testament , and so I disregarded them , says the Lord .
58008010	For this is the testament which I will set before the house of Israel , after those days , says the Lord . I will instill my laws in their minds , and I will inscribe my laws on their hearts . And so , I will be their God , and they shall be my people .
58008011	And they will not teach , each one his neighbor , and each one his brother , saying : ‘ Know the Lord . ’ For all shall know me , from the least , even to the greatest of them .
58008012	For I will forgive their iniquities , and I will no longer remember their sins . ”
58008013	Now in saying something new , he has made the former old . But that which decays and grows old is close to passing away .
58009001	Certainly , the former also had the justifications of worship and a holy place for that age .
58009002	For a tabernacle was made at first , in which were the lampstand , and the table , and the bread of the Presence , which is called Holy .
58009003	Then , beyond the second veil , was the tabernacle , which is called the Holy of Holies ,
58009004	having a golden censer , and the ark of the testament , covered all around and on every part with gold , in which was a golden urn containing manna , and the rod of Aaron which had blossomed , and the tablets of the testament .
58009005	And over the ark were the Cherubim of glory , overshadowing the propitiatory . There is not enough time to speak about each of these things .
58009006	Yet truly , once such things were placed together , in the first part of the tabernacle , the priests were , indeed , continually entering , so as to carry out the duties of the sacrifices .
58009007	But into the second part , once a year , the high priest alone entered , not without blood , which he offered on behalf of the neglectful offenses of himself and of the people .
58009008	In this way , the Holy Spirit is signifying that the way to what is most holy was not yet made manifest , not while the first tabernacle was still standing .
58009009	And this is a parable for the present time . Accordingly , those gifts and sacrifices that are offered are not able , as concerns the conscience , to make perfect those things that serve only as food and drink ,
58009010	as well as the various washings and justices of the flesh , which were imposed upon them until the time of correction .
58009011	But Christ , standing as the High Priest of future good things , through a greater and more perfect tabernacle , one not made by hand , that is , not of this creation ,
58009012	entered once into the Holy of Holies , having obtained eternal redemption , neither by the blood of goats , nor of calves , but by his own blood .
58009013	For if the blood of goats and oxen , and the ashes of a calf , when these are sprinkled , sanctify those who have been defiled , in order to cleanse the flesh ,
58009014	how much more will the blood of Christ , who through the Holy Spirit has offered himself , immaculate , to God , cleanse our conscience from dead works , in order to serve the living God ?
58009015	And thus he is the Mediator of the new testament , so that , by his death , he intercedes for the redemption of those transgressions which were under the former testament , so that those who have been called may receive the promise of an eternal inheritance .
58009016	For where there is a testament , it is necessary for the death of the one who testifies to intervene .
58009017	For a testament is confirmed by death . Otherwise , it as yet has no force , as long as the one who testifies lives .
58009018	Therefore , indeed , the first was not dedicated without blood .
58009019	For when every commandment of the law had been read by Moses to the entire people , he took up the blood of calves and goats , with water and with scarlet wool and hyssop , and he sprinkled both the book itself and the entire people ,
58009020	saying : “ This is the blood of the testament which God has commanded for you . ”
58009021	And even the tabernacle , and all the vessels for the ministry , he similarly sprinkled with blood .
58009022	And nearly everything , according to the law , is to be cleansed with blood . And without the shedding of blood , there is no remission .
58009023	Therefore , it is necessary for the examples of heavenly things to be cleansed , just as , indeed , these things were . Yet the heavenly things are themselves better sacrifices than these .
58009024	For Jesus did not enter by means of holy things made with hands , mere examples of the true things , but he entered into Heaven itself , so that he may appear now before the face of God for us .
58009025	And he did not enter so as to offer himself repeatedly , as the high priest enters into the Holy of Holies each year , with the blood of another .
58009026	Otherwise , he would need to have suffered repeatedly since the beginning of the world . But now , one time , at the consummation of the ages , he has appeared in order to destroy sin though his own sacrifice .
58009027	And in the same manner as it has been appointed for men to die one time , and after this , to be judged ,
58009028	so also Christ was offered , one time , in order to empty the sins of so many . He shall appear a second time without sin , for those who await him , unto salvation .
58010001	For the law contains the shadow of future good things , not the very image of these things . So , by the very same sacrifices which they offer ceaselessly each year , they can never cause these to approach perfection .
58010002	Otherwise , they would have ceased to be offered , because the worshipers , once cleansed , would no longer be conscious of any sin .
58010003	Instead , in these things , a commemoration of sins is made every year .
58010004	For it is impossible for sins to be taken away by the blood of oxen and goats .
58010005	For this reason , as Christ enters into the world , he says : “ Sacrifice and oblation , you did not want . But you have fashioned a body for me .
58010006	Holocausts for sin were not pleasing to you .
58010007	Then I said , ‘ Behold , I draw near . ’ At the head of the book , it has been written of me that I should do your will , O God . ”
58010008	In the above , by saying , “ Sacrifices , and oblations , and holocausts for sin , you did not want , nor are those things pleasing to you , which are offered according to the law ;
58010009	then I said , ‘ Behold , I have come to do your will , O God , ’ ” he takes away the first , so that he may establish what follows .
58010010	For by this will , we have been sanctified , through the one time oblation of the body of Jesus Christ .
58010011	And certainly , every priest stands by , ministering daily , and frequently offering the same sacrifices , which are never able to take away sins .
58010012	But this man , offering one sacrifice for sins , sits at the right hand of God forever ,
58010013	awaiting that time when his enemies will be made his footstool .
58010014	For , by one oblation , he has brought to fulfillment , for all time , those who are sanctified .
58010015	Now the Holy Spirit also testifies for us about this . For afterward , he said :
58010016	“ And this is the testament which I will commit to them after those days , says the Lord . I will instill my laws in their hearts , and I will inscribe my laws on their minds .
58010017	And I will no longer remember their sins and iniquities . ”
58010018	Now , when there is a remission of these things , there is no longer an oblation for sin .
58010019	And so , brothers , have faith in the entrance into the Holy of Holies by the blood of Christ ,
58010020	and in the new and living Way , which he has initiated for us by the veil , that is , by his flesh ,
58010021	and in the Great Priest over the house of God .
58010022	So , let us draw near with a true heart , in the fullness of faith , having hearts cleansed from an evil conscience , and bodies absolved with clean water .
58010023	Let us hold fast to the confession of our hope , without wavering , for he who has promised is faithful .
58010024	And let us be considerate of one another , so as to prompt ourselves to charity and to good works ,
58010025	not deserting our assembly , as some are accustomed to do , but consoling one another , and even more so as you see that the day is approaching .
58010026	For if we sin willingly , after receiving knowledge of the truth , there is no sacrifice remaining for sins ,
58010027	but instead , a certain terrible expectation of judgment , and the rage of a fire that shall consume its adversaries .
58010028	If someone dies for acting against the law of Moses , and is shown no compassion because of two or three witnesses ,
58010029	how much more , do you think , someone would deserve worse punishments , if he has tread upon the Son of God , and has treated the blood of the testament , by which he was sanctified , as unclean , and has acted with disgrace toward the Spirit of grace ?
58010030	For we know that he has said : “ Vengeance is mine , and I will repay , ” and again , “ The Lord will judge his people . ”
58010031	It is dreadful to fall into the hands of the living God .
58010032	But call to mind the former days , in which , after being enlightened , you endured a great struggle of afflictions .
58010033	And certainly , in one way , by insults and tribulations , you were made a spectacle , but in another way , you became the companions of those who were the object of such behavior .
58010034	For you even had compassion on those who were imprisoned , and you accepted with gladness being deprived of your goods , knowing that you have a better and more lasting substance .
58010035	And so , do not lose your confidence , which has a great reward .
58010036	For it is necessary for you to be patient , so that , by doing the will of God , you may receive the promise .
58010037	“ For , in a little while , and somewhat longer , he who is to come will return , and he will not delay .
58010038	For my just man lives by faith . But if he were to draw himself back , he would not please my soul . ”
58010039	So then , we are not sons who are drawn away to perdition , but we are sons of faith toward the securing of the soul .
58011001	Now , faith is the substance of things hoped for , the evidence of things not apparent .
58011002	For this reason , the ancients were given testimony .
58011003	By faith , we understand the world to be fashioned by the Word of God , so that the visible might be made by the invisible .
58011004	By faith , Abel offered to God a much better sacrifice than that of Cain , through which he obtained testimony that he was just , in that God offered testimony to his gifts . And through that sacrifice , he still speaks to us , though he is dead .
58011005	By faith , Enoch was transferred , so that he would not see death , and he was not found because God had transferred him . For before he was transferred , he had testimony that he pleased God .
58011006	But without faith , it is impossible to please God . For whoever approaches God must believe that he exists , and that he rewards those who seek him .
58011007	By faith , Noah , having accepted an answer about those things which were not yet seen , being afraid , fashioned an ark for the salvation of his house . Through the ark , he condemned the world , and was established as the heir of the justice that occurs through faith .
58011008	By faith , the one called Abraham obeyed , going out to the place that he was to receive as an inheritance . And he went out , not knowing where he was going .
58011009	By faith , he stayed in the Land of the Promise as if in a foreign land , dwelling in cottages , with Isaac and Jacob , co-heirs of the same promise .
58011010	For he was awaiting a city having firm foundations , whose designer and builder is God .
58011011	By faith also , Sarah herself , being barren , received the ability to conceive offspring , even though she was past that age in life . For she believed him to be faithful , who had promised .
58011012	Because of this , there were also born , from one who himself was as if dead , a mulititude like the stars of heaven , who are , like the sand of the seashore , innumerable .
58011013	All of these passed away , adhering to faith , not having received the promises , yet beholding them from afar and saluting them , and confessing themselves to be sojourners and guests upon the earth .
58011014	For those who speak in this way are themselves indicating that they seek a homeland .
58011015	And if , indeed , they had been mindful of the very place from which they departed , they certainly would have returned in time .
58011016	But now they hunger for a better place , that is , Heaven . For this reason , God is not ashamed to be called their God . For he has prepared a city for them .
58011017	By faith , Abraham , when he was tested , offered Isaac , so that he who had received the promises was offering up his only son .
58011018	To him , it was said , “ Through Isaac , shall your offspring be summoned , ”
58011019	indicating that God is even able to raise up from the dead . And thus , he also established him as a parable .
58011020	By faith , also , Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau , concerning future events .
58011021	By faith , Jacob , as he was dying , blessed each of the sons of Joseph ; and he reverenced the summit of his rod .
58011022	By faith , Joseph , as he was dying , recalled the departure of the sons of Israel , and gave a commandment concerning his bones .
58011023	By faith , Moses , after being born , was hidden for three months by his parents , because they had seen that he was a graceful infant , and they did not fear the king’s edict .
58011024	By faith , Moses , after growing up , denied himself a place as the son of Pharaoh’s daughter ,
58011025	choosing to be afflicted with the people of God , rather than to have the pleasantness of sin for a time ,
58011026	valuing the reproach of Christ to be a greater wealth than the treasures of the Egyptians . For he looked forward to his reward .
58011027	By faith , he abandoned Egypt , not dreading the animosity of the king . For he pressed on , as if seeing him who is unseen .
58011028	By faith , he celebrated the Passover and the shedding of the blood , so that he who destroyed the firstborn might not touch them .
58011029	By faith , they crossed the Red Sea , as if on dry land , yet when the Egyptians attempted it , they were swallowed up .
58011030	By faith , the walls of Jericho collapsed , after being encircled for seven days .
58011031	By faith , Rahab , the harlot , did not perish with the unbelievers , after receiving the spies with peace .
58011032	And what should I say next ? For time is not sufficient for me to give an account of Gideon , Barak , Samson , Jephthah , David , Samuel , and the Prophets :
58011033	those who , by faith , conquered kingdoms , accomplished justice , obtained promises , closed the mouths of lions ,
58011034	extinguished the violence of fire , escaped the edge of the sword , recovered from infirmities , showed strength in battle , turned back the armies of foreigners .
58011035	Women received their dead by means of resurrection . But others suffered severe punishment , not yet receiving redemption , so that they would find a better resurrection .
58011036	Truly , others were tested by mocking and lashes , and moreover by chains and imprisonment .
58011037	They were stoned ; they were cut ; they were tempted . With the slaughter of the sword , they were killed . They wandered about in sheepskin and in goatskin , in dire need , in anguish afflicted .
58011038	Of them , the world was not worthy , wandering in solitude on mountains , in the caves and caverns of the earth .
58011039	And all these , having been proven by the testimony of faith , did not receive the Promise .
58011040	God’s Providence holds something better for us , so that not without us would they be perfected .
58012001	Furthermore , since we also have so great a cloud of witnesses over us , let us set aside every burden and sin which may surround us , and advance , through patience , to the struggle offered to us .
58012002	Let us gaze upon Jesus , as the Author and the completion of our faith , who , having joy laid out before him , endured the cross , disregarding the shame , and who now sits at the right hand of the throne of God .
58012003	So then , meditate upon him who endured such adversity from sinners against himself , so that you may not become weary , failing in your souls .
58012004	For you have not yet resisted unto blood , while striving against sin .
58012005	And you have forgotten the consolation which speaks to you like sons , saying : “ My son , do not be willing to neglect the discipline of the Lord . Neither should you become weary , while being rebuked by him . ”
58012006	For whomever the Lord loves , he chastises . And every son whom he accepts , he scourges .
58012007	Persevere in discipline . God presents you to himself as sons . But what son is there , whom his father does not correct ?
58012008	But if you are without that discipline in which all have become sharers , then you are of adultery , and you are not sons .
58012009	Then , too , we have certainly had the fathers of our flesh as instructors , and we reverenced them . Should we not obey the Father of spirits all the more , and so live ?
58012010	And indeed , for a few days and according to their own wishes , they instructed us . But he does so to our benefit , so that we may receive his sanctification .
58012011	Now every discipline , in the present time , does not seem a gladness , of course , but a grief . But afterwards , it will repay a most peaceful fruit of justice to those who become trained in it .
58012012	Because of this , lift up your lazy hands and your lax knees ,
58012013	and straighten the path of your feet , so that no one , being lame , may wander astray , but instead may be healed .
58012014	Pursue peace with everyone . Pursue sanctity , without which no one shall see God .
58012015	Be contemplative , lest anyone lack the grace of God , lest any root of bitterness spring up and impede you , and by it , many might be defiled ,
58012016	lest any fornicator or worldly person be like Esau , who , for the sake of one meal , sold his birthright .
58012017	For you know that afterwards , when he desired to inherit the benediction , he was rejected . For he found no place for repentance , even though he had sought it with tears .
58012018	But you have not drawn near to a tangible mountain , or a burning fire , or a whirlwind , or a mist , or a storm ,
58012019	or the sound of a trumpet , or a voice of words . Those who had experienced these things excused themselves , lest the Word be spoken to them .
58012020	For they could not bear what was said , and so , if even a beast would have touched the mountain , it would have been stoned .
58012021	And what was seen was so terrible that even Moses said : “ I am terrified , and so , I tremble . ”
58012022	But you have drawn near to mount Zion , and to the city of the living God , to the heavenly Jerusalem , and to the company of many thousands of Angels ,
58012023	and to the Church of the first-born , those who have been inscribed in the heavens , and to God , the judge of all , and to the spirits of the just made perfect ,
58012024	and to Jesus , the Mediator of the New Testament , and to a sprinkling of blood , which speaks better than the blood of Abel .
58012025	Be careful not to reject the One who is speaking . For if those who rejected him who was speaking upon the earth were not able to escape , so much more we who might turn away from the One who is speaking to us from heaven .
58012026	Then , his voice moved the earth . But now , he makes a promise , saying : “ There is still one more time , and then I will move , not only the earth , but also heaven itself . ”
58012027	And so , in saying , “ There is still one more time , ” he declares the transfer of the moveable things of creation , so that those things which are immoveable may remain .
58012028	Thus , in receiving an immoveable kingdom , we have grace . So , through grace , let us be of service , by pleasing God with fear and reverence .
58012029	For our God is a consuming fire .
58013001	May fraternal charity remain in you .
58013002	And do not be willing to forget hospitality . For by it , certain persons , without realizing it , have received Angels as guests .
58013003	Remember those who are prisoners , just as if you were imprisoned with them , and those who endure hardships , just as if you were in their place .
58013004	May marriage be honorable in every way , and may the marriage bed be immaculate . For God will judge fornicators and adulterers .
58013005	Let your behavior be without avarice ; be content with what you are offered . For he himself has said , “ I will not abandon you , and I will not neglect you . ”
58013006	So then , we may confidently say , “ The Lord is my helper . I will not fear what man can do to me . ”
58013007	Remember your leaders , who have spoken the Word of God to you , whose faith you imitate , by observing the goal of their way of life :
58013008	Jesus Christ , yesterday and today ; Jesus Christ forever .
58013009	Do not be led away by changing or strange doctrines . And it is best for the heart to be sustained by grace , not by foods . For the latter have not been as useful to those who walked by them .
58013010	We have an altar : those who serve in the tabernacle have no authority to eat from it .
58013011	For the bodies of those animals whose blood is carried into the Holy of holies by the high priest , on behalf of sin , are burned outside the camp .
58013012	Because of this , Jesus , too , in order to sanctify the people by his own blood , suffered outside the gate .
58013013	And so , let us go forth to him , outside the camp , bearing his reproach .
58013014	For in this place , we have no everlasting city ; instead , we seek one in the future .
58013015	Therefore , through him , let us offer the sacrifice of continual praise to God , which is the fruit of lips confessing his name .
58013016	But do not be willing to forget good works and fellowship . For God is deserving of such sacrifices .
58013017	Obey your leaders and be subject to them . For they watch over you , as if to render an account of your souls . So then , may they do this with joy , and not with grief . Otherwise , it would not be as helpful to you .
58013018	Pray for us . For we trust that we have a good conscience , being willing to conduct ourselves well in all things .
58013019	And I beg you , all the more , to do this , so that I may be quickly returned to you .
58013020	Then may the God of peace , who led back from the dead that great Pastor of sheep , our Lord Jesus Christ , with the blood of the eternal testament ,
58013021	equip you with all goodness , so that you may do his will . May he accomplish in you whatever is pleasing in his sight , through Jesus Christ , to whom is glory forever and ever . Amen .
58013022	And I beg you , brothers , that you may permit this word of consolation , especially since I have written to you with few words .
58013023	Know that our brother Timothy has been set free . If he arrives soon , then I will see you with him .
58013024	Greet all your leaders and all the saints . The brothers from Italy greet you .
58013025	Grace be with you all . Amen .
59001001	James , servant of God and of our Lord Jesus Christ , to the twelve tribes of the dispersion , greetings .
59001002	My brothers , when you have fallen into various trials , consider everything a joy ,
59001003	knowing that the proving of your faith exercises patience ,
59001004	and patience brings a work to perfection , so that you may be perfect and whole , deficient in nothing .
59001005	But if anyone among you is in need of wisdom , let him petition God , who gives abundantly to all without reproach , and it shall be given to him .
59001006	But he should ask with faith , doubting nothing . For he who doubts is like a wave on the ocean , which is moved about by the wind and carried away ;
59001007	then a man should not consider that he would receive anything from the Lord .
59001008	For a man who is of two minds is inconstant in all his ways .
59001009	Now a humble brother should glory in his exaltation ,
59001010	and a rich one , in his humiliation , for he will pass away like the flower of the grass .
59001011	For the sun has risen with a scorching heat , and has dried the grass , and its flower has fallen off , and the appearance of its beauty has perished . So also will the rich one wither away , according to his paths .
59001012	Blessed is the man who suffers temptation . For when he has been proven , he shall receive the crown of life which God has promised to those who love him .
59001013	No one should say , when he is tempted , that he was tempted by God . For God does not entice toward evils , and he himself tempts no one .
59001014	Yet truly , each one is tempted by his own desires , having been enticed and drawn away .
59001015	Thereafter , when desire has conceived , it gives birth to sin . Yet truly sin , when it has been consummated , produces death .
59001016	And so , do not choose to go astray , my most beloved brothers .
59001017	Every excellent gift and every perfect gift is from above , descending from the Father of lights , with whom there is no change , nor any shadow of alteration .
59001018	For by his own will he produced us through the Word of truth , so that we might be a kind of beginning among his creatures .
59001019	You know this , my most beloved brothers . So let every man be quick to listen , but slow to speak and slow to anger .
59001020	For the anger of man does not accomplish the justice of God .
59001021	Because of this , having cast away all uncleanness and an abundance of malice , receive with meekness the newly-grafted Word , which is able to save your souls .
59001022	So be doers of the Word , and not listeners only , deceiving yourselves .
59001023	For if anyone is a listener of the Word , but not also a doer , he is comparable to a man gazing into a mirror upon the face that he was born with ;
59001024	and after considering himself , he went away and promptly forgot what he had seen .
59001025	But he who gazes upon the perfect law of liberty , and who remains in it , is not a forgetful hearer , but instead a doer of the work . He shall be blessed in what he does .
59001026	But if anyone considers himself to be religious , but he does not restrain his tongue , but instead seduces his own heart : such a one’s religion is vanity .
59001027	This is religion , clean and undefiled before God the Father : to visit orphans and widows in their tribulations , and to keep yourself immaculate , apart from this age .
59002001	My brothers , within the glorious faith of our Lord Jesus Christ , do not choose to show favoritism toward persons .
59002002	For if a man has entered your assembly having a gold ring and splendid apparel , and if a poor man has also entered , in dirty clothing ,
59002003	and if you are then attentive to the one who is clothed in excellent apparel , so that you say to him , “ You may sit in this good place , ” but you say to the poor man , “ You stand over there , ” or , “ Sit below my footstool , ”
59002004	are you not judging within yourselves , and have you not become judges with unjust thoughts ?
59002005	My most beloved brothers , listen . Has not God chosen the poor in this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom that God has promised to those who love him ?
59002006	But you have dishonored the poor . Are not the rich the ones who oppress you through power ? And are not they the ones who drag you to judgment ?
59002007	Are not they the ones who blaspheme the good name which has been invoked over you ?
59002008	So if you perfect the regal law , according to the Scriptures , “ You shall love your neighbor as yourself , ” then you do well .
59002009	But if you show favoritism to persons , then you commit a sin , having been convicted again by the law as transgressors .
59002010	Now whoever has observed the whole law , yet who offends in one matter , has become guilty of all .
59002011	For he who said , “ You shall not commit adultery , ” also said , “ You shall not kill . ” So if you do not commit adultery , but you kill , you have become a transgressor of the law .
59002012	So speak and act just as you are beginning to be judged , by the law of liberty .
59002013	For judgment is without mercy toward him who has not shown mercy . But mercy exalts itself above judgment .
59002014	My brothers , what benefit is there if someone claims to have faith , but he does not have works ? How would faith be able to save him ?
59002015	So if a brother or sister is naked and daily in need of food ,
59002016	and if anyone of you were to say to them : “ Go in peace , keep warm and nourished , ” and yet not give them the things that are necessary for the body , of what benefit is this ?
59002017	Thus even faith , if it does not have works , is dead , in and of itself .
59002018	Now someone may say : “ You have faith , and I have works . ” Show me your faith without works ! But I will show you my faith by means of works .
59002019	You believe that there is one God . You do well . But the demons also believe , and they tremble greatly .
59002020	So then , are you willing to understand , O foolish man , that faith without works is dead ?
59002021	Was not our father Abraham justified by means of works , by offering his son Isaac upon the altar ?
59002022	Do you see that faith was cooperating with his works , and that by means of works faith was brought to fulfillment ?
59002023	And so the Scripture was fulfilled which says : “ Abraham believed God , and it was reputed to him unto justice . ” And so he was called the friend of God .
59002024	Do you see that a man is justified by means of works , and not by faith alone ?
59002025	Similarly also , Rahab , the harlot , was she not justified by works , by receiving the messengers and sending them out through another way ?
59002026	For just as the body without the spirit is dead , so also faith without works is dead .
59003001	My brothers , not many of you should choose to become teachers , knowing that you shall receive a stricter judgment .
59003002	For we all offend in many ways . If anyone does not offend in word , he is a perfect man . And he is then able , as if with a bridle , to lead the whole body around .
59003003	For so we put bridles into the mouths of horses , in order to submit them to our will , and so we turn their whole body around .
59003004	Consider also the ships , which , though they are great and may be driven by strong winds , yet they are turned around with a small rudder , to be directed to wherever the strength of the pilot might will .
59003005	So also the tongue certainly is a small part , but it moves great things . Consider that a small fire can set ablaze a great forest .
59003006	And so the tongue is like a fire , comprising all iniquity . The tongue , stationed in the midst of our body , can defile the entire body and inflame the wheel of our nativity , setting a fire from Hell .
59003007	For the nature of all beasts and birds and serpents and others is ruled over , and has been ruled over , by human nature .
59003008	But no man is able to rule over the tongue , a restless evil , full of deadly poison .
59003009	By it we bless God the Father , and by it we speak evil of men , who have been made in the likeness of God .
59003010	From the same mouth proceeds blessing and cursing . My brothers , these things ought not to be so !
59003011	Does a fountain emit , out of the same opening , both sweet and bitter water ?
59003012	My brothers , can the fig tree yield grapes ? Or the vine , figs ? Then neither is salt water able to produce fresh water .
59003013	Who is wise and well-taught among you ? Let him show , by means of good conversation , his work in the meekness of wisdom .
59003014	But if you hold a bitter zeal , and if there is contention in your hearts , then do not boast and do not be liars against the truth .
59003015	For this is not wisdom , descending from above , but rather it is earthly , beastly , and diabolical .
59003016	For wherever envy and contention is , there too is inconstancy and every depraved work .
59003017	But within the wisdom that is from above , certainly , chastity is first , and next peacefulness , meekness , openness , consenting to what is good , a plenitude of mercy and good fruits , not judging , without falseness .
59003018	And so the fruit of justice is sown in peace by those who make peace .
59004001	Where do wars and contentions among you come from ? Is it not from this : from your own desires , which battle within your members ?
59004002	You desire , and you do not have . You envy and you kill , and you are unable to obtain . You argue and you fight , and you do not have , because you do not ask .
59004003	You ask and you do not receive , because you ask badly , so that you may use it toward your own desires .
59004004	You adulterers ! Do you not know that the friendship of this world is hostile to God ? Therefore , whoever has chosen to be a friend of this world has been made into an enemy of God .
59004005	Or do you think that Scripture says in vain : “ The spirit which lives within you desires unto envy ? ”
59004006	But he gives a greater grace . Therefore he says : “ God resists the arrogant , but he gives grace to the humble . ”
59004007	Therefore , be subject to God . But resist the devil , and he will flee from you .
59004008	Draw near to God , and he will draw near to you . Cleanse your hands , you sinners ! And purify your hearts , you duplicitous souls !
59004009	Be afflicted : mourn and weep . Let your laughter be turned into mourning , and your gladness into sorrow .
59004010	Be humbled in the sight of the Lord , and he will exalt you .
59004011	Brothers , do not choose to slander one another . Whoever slanders his brother , or whoever judges his brother , slanders the law and judges the law . But if you judge the law , you are not a doer of the law , but a judge .
59004012	There is one lawgiver and one judge . He is able to destroy , and he is able to set free .
59004013	But who are you to judge your neighbor ? Consider this , you who say , “ Today or tomorrow we will go into that city , and certainly we will spend a year there , and we will do business , and we will make our profit , ”
59004014	consider that you do not know what will be tomorrow .
59004015	For what is your life ? It is a mist that appears for a brief time , and afterwards will vanish away . So what you ought to say is : “ If the Lord wills , ” or , “ If we live , ” we will do this or that .
59004016	But now you exult in your arrogance . All such exultation is wicked .
59004017	Therefore , he who knows that he ought to do a good thing , and does not do it , for him it is a sin .
59005001	Act now , you who are wealthy ! Weep and wail in your miseries , which will soon come upon you !
59005002	Your riches have been corrupted , and your garments have been eaten by moths .
59005003	Your gold and silver have rusted , and their rust will be a testimony against you , and it will eat away at your flesh like fire . You have stored up wrath for yourselves unto the last days .
59005004	Consider the pay of the workers who reaped your fields : it has been misappropriated by you ; it cries out . And their cry has entered into the ears of the Lord of hosts .
59005005	You have feasted upon the earth , and you have nourished your hearts with luxuries , unto the day of slaughter .
59005006	You led away and killed the Just One , and he did not resist you .
59005007	Therefore , be patient , brothers , until the advent of the Lord . Consider that the farmer anticipates the precious fruit of the earth , waiting patiently , until he receives the early and the late rains .
59005008	Therefore , you too should be patient and should strengthen your hearts . For the advent of the Lord draws near .
59005009	Brothers , do not complain against one another , so that you may not be judged . Behold , the judge stands before the door .
59005010	My brothers , consider the Prophets , who spoke in the name of the Lord , as an example of departing from evil , of labor , and of patience .
59005011	Consider that we beatify those who have endured . You have heard of the patient suffering of Job . And you have seen the end of the Lord , that the Lord is merciful and compassionate .
59005012	But before all things , my brothers , do not choose to swear , neither by heaven , nor by the earth , nor in any other oath . But let your word ‘ Yes ’ be yes , and your word ‘ No ’ be no , so that you may not fall under judgment .
59005013	Is any of you sad ? Let him pray . Is he even-tempered ? Let him sing psalms .
59005014	Is anyone ill among you ? Let him bring in the priests of the Church , and let them pray over him , anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord .
59005015	And a prayer of faith will save the infirm , and the Lord will alleviate him . And if he has sins , these will be forgiven him .
59005016	Therefore , confess your sins to one another , and pray for one another , so that you may be saved . For the unremitting prayer of a just person prevails over many things .
59005017	Elijah was a mortal man like us , and in prayer he prayed that it would not rain upon the earth . And it did not rain for three years and six months .
59005018	And he prayed again . And the heavens gave rain , and the earth brought forth her fruit .
59005019	My brothers , if anyone of you strays from the truth , and if someone converts him ,
59005020	he ought to know that whoever causes a sinner to be converted from the error of his ways will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins .
60001001	Peter , Apostle of Jesus Christ , to the newly-arrived elect of the dispersion in Pontus , Galatia , Cappadocia , Asia , and Bithynia ,
60001002	in accord with the foreknowledge of God the Father , in the sanctification of the Spirit , with the obedience and the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ : May grace and peace be multiplied for you .
60001003	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who according to his great mercy has regenerated us into a living hope , through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead :
60001004	unto an incorruptible and undefiled and unfading inheritance , which is reserved for you in heaven .
60001005	By the power of God , you are guarded through faith for a salvation which is ready to be revealed in the end time .
60001006	In this , you should exult , if now , for a brief time , it is necessary to be made sorrowful by various trials ,
60001007	so that the testing of your faith , which is much more precious than gold tested by fire , may be found in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ .
60001008	For though you have not seen him , you love him . In him also , though you do not see him , you now believe . And in believing , you shall exult with an inexpressible and glorious joy ,
60001009	returning with the goal of your faith , the salvation of souls .
60001010	About this salvation , the prophets inquired and diligently searched , those who prophesied about the future grace in you ,
60001011	inquiring as to what type of condition was signified to them by the Spirit of Christ , when foretelling those sufferings that are in Christ , as well as the subsequent glories .
60001012	To them , it was revealed that they were ministering , not for themselves , but for you those things which have now been announced to you through those who have preached the Gospel to you , through the Holy Spirit , who was sent down from heaven to the One upon whom the Angels desire to gaze .
60001013	For this reason , gird the waist of your mind , be sober , and hope perfectly in the grace that is offered to you in the revelation of Jesus Christ .
60001014	Be like sons of obedience , not conforming to the desires of your former ignorance ,
60001015	but in accord with him who has called you : the Holy One . And in every behavior , you yourself must be holy ,
60001016	for it is written : “ You shall be holy , for I am Holy . ”
60001017	And if you invoke as Father him who , without showing favoritism to persons , judges according to each one’s work , then act in fear during the time of your sojourning here .
60001018	For you know that it was not with corruptible gold or silver that you were redeemed away from your useless behavior in the traditions of your fathers ,
60001019	but it was with the precious blood of Christ , an immaculate and undefiled lamb ,
60001020	foreknown , certainly , before the foundation of the world , and made manifest in these latter times for your sake .
60001021	Through him , you have been faithful to God , who raised him up from the dead and gave him glory , so that your faith and hope would be in God .
60001022	So chastise your souls with the obedience of charity , in fraternal love , and love one another from a simple heart , attentively .
60001023	For you have been born again , not from corruptible seed , but from what is incorruptible , from the Word of God , living and remaining for all eternity .
60001024	For all flesh is like the grass and all its glory is like the flower of the grass . The grass withers and its flower falls away .
60001025	But the Word of the Lord endures for eternity . And this is the Word that has been evangelized to you .
60002001	Therefore , set aside all malice and all deceitfulness , as well as falseness and envy and every detraction .
60002002	Like newborn infants , desire the milk of reasonableness without guile , so that by this you may increase unto salvation ,
60002003	if it is true that you have tasted that the Lord is sweet .
60002004	And approaching him as if he were a living stone , rejected by men , certainly , but elect and honored by God ,
60002005	be also yourselves like living stones , built upon him , a spiritual house , a holy priesthood , so as to offer up spiritual sacrifices , acceptable to God through Jesus Christ .
60002006	Because of this , Scripture asserts : “ Behold , I am setting in Zion a chief cornerstone , elect , precious . And whoever will have believed in him will not be confounded . ”
60002007	Therefore , to you who believe , he is honor . But to those who do not believe , the stone which the builders have rejected , the same has been made into the head of the corner ,
60002008	and a stone of offense , and a rock of scandal , to those who are offended by the Word ; neither do they believe , though they also have been built upon him .
60002009	But you are a chosen generation , a royal priesthood , a holy nation , an acquired people , so that you may announce the virtues of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light .
60002010	Though in past times you were not a people , yet now you are the people of God . Though you had not obtained mercy , yet now you have obtained mercy .
60002011	Most beloved , I beg you , as new arrivals and sojourners , to abstain from carnal desires , which battle against the soul .
60002012	Keep your behavior among the Gentiles to what is good , so that , when they slander you as if you were evildoers , they may , by the good works that are seen in you , glorify God on the day of visitation .
60002013	Therefore , be subject to every human creature because of God , whether it is to the king as preeminent ,
60002014	or to leaders as having been sent from him for vindication over evildoers , it is truly for the praise of what is good .
60002015	For such is the will of God , that by doing good you may bring about the silence of imprudent and ignorant men ,
60002016	in an open manner , and not as if cloaking malice with liberty , but like servants of God .
60002017	Honor everyone . Love brotherhood . Fear God . Honor the king .
60002018	Servants , be subject to your masters with all fear , not only to the good and meek , but also to the unruly .
60002019	For this is grace : when , because of God , a man willingly endures sorrows , suffering injustice .
60002020	For what glory is there , if you sin and then suffer a beating ? But if you do well and suffer patiently , this is grace with God .
60002021	For you have been called to this because Christ also suffered for us , leaving you an example , so that you would follow in his footsteps .
60002022	He committed no sin , neither was deceit found in his mouth .
60002023	And when evil was spoken against him , he did not speak evil . When he suffered , he did not threaten . Then he handed himself over to him who judged him unjustly .
60002024	He himself bore our sins in his body upon the tree , so that we , having died to sin , would live for justice . By his wounds , you have been healed .
60002025	For you were like wandering sheep . But now you have been turned back toward the Pastor and the Bishop of your souls .
60003001	Similarly also , wives should be subject to their husbands , so that , even if some do not believe the Word , they may benefit without the Word , through the behavior of these wives ,
60003002	as they consider with fear your chaste behavior .
60003003	For you , there should be no unnecessary adornment of the hair , or surrounding with gold , or the wearing of ornate clothing .
60003004	Instead , you should be a hidden person of the heart , with the incorruptibility of a quiet and a meek spirit , rich in the sight of God .
60003005	For in this way , in past times also , holy women adorned themselves , hoping in God , being subject to their own husbands .
60003006	For so Sarah obeyed Abraham , calling him lord . You are her daughters , well-behaved and unafraid of any disturbance .
60003007	Similarly , you husbands should live with them in accord with knowledge , bestowing honor on the female as the weaker vessel and as co-heirs of the life of grace , so that your prayers may not be hindered .
60003008	And finally , may you all be of one mind : compassionate , loving brotherhood , merciful , meek , humble ,
60003009	not repaying evil with evil , nor slander with slander , but , to the contrary , repaying with blessings . For to this you have been called , so that you may possess the inheritance of a blessing .
60003010	For whoever wants to love life and to see good days should restrain his tongue from evil , and his lips , so that they utter no deceit .
60003011	Let him turn away from evil , and do good . Let him seek peace , and pursue it .
60003012	For the eyes of the Lord are upon the just , and his ears are with their prayers , but the countenance of the Lord is upon those who do evil .
60003013	And who is it who can harm you , if you are zealous in what is good ?
60003014	And yet , even when you suffer something for the sake of justice , you are blessed . So then , do not be afraid with their fear , and do not be disturbed .
60003015	But sanctify Christ the Lord in your hearts , being always ready to give an explanation to all who ask you the reason for that hope which is in you .
60003016	But do so with meekness and fear , having a good conscience , so that , in whatever matter they may slander you , they shall be confounded , since they falsely accuse your good behavior in Christ .
60003017	For it is better to suffer for doing good , if it is the will of God , than for doing evil .
60003018	For Christ also died once for our sins , the Just One on behalf of the unjust , so that he might offer us to God , having died , certainly , in the flesh , but having been enlivened by the Spirit .
60003019	And in the Spirit , he preached to those who were in prison , going to those souls
60003020	who had been unbelieving in past times , while they waited for the patience of God , as in the days of Noah , when the ark was being built . In that ark , a few , that is , eight souls , were saved by water .
60003021	And now you also are saved , in a similar manner , by baptism , not by the testimony of sordid flesh , but by the examination of a good conscience in God , through the resurrection of Jesus Christ .
60003022	He is at the right hand of God , devouring death , so that we may be made heirs to eternal life . And since he has journeyed to heaven , the Angels and powers and virtues are subject to him .
60004001	Since Christ has suffered in the flesh , you also should be armed with the same intention . For he who suffers in the flesh desists from sin ,
60004002	so that now he may live , for the remainder of his time in the flesh , not by the desires of men , but by the will of God .
60004003	For the time that has passed is sufficient to have fulfilled the will of the Gentiles , those who have walked in luxuries , lusts , intoxication , feasting , drinking , and the illicit worship of idols .
60004004	About this , they wonder why you do not rush with them into the same confusion of indulgences , blaspheming .
60004005	But they must render an account to him who is prepared to judge the living and the dead .
60004006	For because of this , the Gospel was also preached to the dead , so that they might be judged , certainly , just like men in the flesh , yet also , so that they might live according to God , in the Spirit .
60004007	But the end of everything draws near . And so , be prudent , and be vigilant in your prayers .
60004008	But , before all things , have a constant mutual charity among yourselves . For love covers a multitude of sins .
60004009	Show hospitality to one another without complaining .
60004010	Just as each of you has received grace , minister in the same way to one another , as good stewards of the manifold grace of God .
60004011	When anyone speaks , it should be like words of God . When anyone ministers , it should be from the virtue that God provides , so that in all things God may be honored through Jesus Christ . To him is glory and dominion forever and ever . Amen .
60004012	Most beloved , do not choose to sojourn in the passion which is a temptation to you , as if something new might happen to you .
60004013	But instead , commune in the Passion of Christ , and be glad that , when his glory will be revealed , you too may rejoice with exultation .
60004014	If you are reproached for the name of Christ , you will be blessed , because that which is of the honor , glory , and power of God , and that which is of his Spirit , rests upon you .
60004015	But let none of you suffer for being a murderer , or a thief , or a slanderer , or one who covets what belongs to another .
60004016	But if one of you suffers for being a Christian , he should not be ashamed . Instead , he should glorify God in that name .
60004017	For it is time that judgment begin at the house of God . And if it is first from us , what shall be the end of those who do not believe the Gospel of God ?
60004018	And if the just man will scarcely be saved , where will the impious and the sinner appear ?
60004019	Therefore , too , let those who suffer according to the will of God commend their souls by good deeds to the faithful Creator .
60005001	Therefore , I beg the elders who are among you , as one who is also an elder and a witness of the Passion of Christ , who also shares in that glory which is to be revealed in the future :
60005002	pasture the flock of God that is among you , providing for it , not as a requirement , but willingly , in accord with God , and not for the sake of tainted profit , but freely ,
60005003	not so as to dominate by means of the clerical state , but so as to be formed into a flock from the heart .
60005004	And when the Leader of pastors will have appeared , you shall secure an unfading crown of glory .
60005005	Similarly , young persons , be subject to the elders . And infuse all humility among one another , for God resists the arrogant , but to the humble he gives grace .
60005006	And so , be humbled under the powerful hand of God , so that he may exalt you in the time of visitation .
60005007	Cast all your cares upon him , for he takes care of you .
60005008	Be sober and vigilant . For your adversary , the devil , is like a roaring lion , traveling around and seeking those whom he might devour .
60005009	Resist him by being strong in faith , being aware that the same passions afflict those who are your brothers in the world .
60005010	But the God of all grace , who has called us to his eternal glory in Christ Jesus , will himself perfect , confirm , and establish us , after a brief time of suffering .
60005011	To him be glory and dominion forever and ever . Amen .
60005012	I have written briefly , through Sylvanus , whom I consider to be a faithful brother to you , begging and testifying that this is the true grace of God , in which you have been established .
60005013	The Church which is in Babylon , elect together with you , greets you , as does my son , Mark .
60005014	Greet one another with a holy kiss . Grace be to all of you who are in Christ Jesus . Amen .
61001001	Simon Peter , servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ , to those who have been allotted an equal faith with us in the justice of our God and in our Savior Jesus Christ .
61001002	Grace to you . And may peace be fulfilled according to the plan of God and of Christ Jesus our Lord ,
61001003	in the same manner that all things which are for life and piety have been given to us by his Divine virtue , through the plan of him who has called us to our own glory and virtue .
61001004	Through Christ , he has given us the greatest and most precious promises , so that by these things you may become sharers in the Divine Nature , fleeing from the corruption of that desire which is in the world .
61001005	But as for you , taking up every concern , minister virtue in your faith ; and in virtue , knowledge ;
61001006	and in knowledge , moderation ; and in moderation , patience ; and in patience , piety ;
61001007	and in piety , love of brotherhood ; and in love of brotherhood , charity .
61001008	For if these things are with you , and if they abound , they will cause you to be neither empty , nor without fruit , within the plan of our Lord Jesus Christ .
61001009	For he who does not have these things at hand is blind and groping , being forgetful of his purification from his former offenses .
61001010	Because of this , brothers , be all the more diligent , so that by good works you may make certain your calling and election . For in doing these things , you do not sin at any time .
61001011	For in this way , you shall be provided abundantly with an entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ .
61001012	For this reason , I will always begin to admonish you about these things , even though , certainly , you know them and are confirmed in the present truth .
61001013	But I consider it just , as long as I am in this tabernacle , to stir you up with admonishments .
61001014	For it is certain that the laying to rest of this , my tabernacle , is approaching swiftly , just as our Lord Jesus Christ has also indicated to me .
61001015	Therefore , I will present a work for you to have , so that , frequently after my passing , you may call to mind these things .
61001016	For it was not by following fanciful doctrines that we made known to you the power and presence of our Lord Jesus Christ , but we were made eyewitnesses of his greatness .
61001017	For he received honor and glory from God the Father , whose voice descended to him from the magnificent glory : “ This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased . Listen to him . ”
61001018	We also heard this voice conveyed from heaven , when we were with him on the holy mountain .
61001019	And so , we have an even firmer prophetic word , to which you would do well to listen , as to a light shining within a dark place , until the day dawns , and the daystar rises , in your hearts .
61001020	Understand this first : that every prophecy of Scripture does not result from one’s own interpretation .
61001021	For prophecy was not conveyed by human will at any time . Instead , holy men were speaking about God while inspired by the Holy Spirit .
61002001	But there were also false prophets among the people , just as there will be among you lying teachers , who will introduce divisions of perdition , and they will deny him who bought them , the Lord , bringing upon themselves swift destruction .
61002002	And many persons will follow their indulgences ; through such persons , the way of truth will be blasphemed .
61002003	And in avarice , they will negotiate about you with false words . Their judgment , in the near future , is not delayed , and their perdition does not sleep .
61002004	For God did not spare those Angels who sinned , but instead delivered them , as if dragged down by infernal ropes , into the torments of the underworld , to be reserved unto judgment .
61002005	And he did not spare the original world , but he preserved the eighth one , Noah , the herald of justice , bringing the flood upon the world of the impious .
61002006	And he reduced the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes , condemning them to be overthrown , setting them as an example to anyone who might act impiously .
61002007	And he rescued a just man , Lot , who was oppressed by the unjust and lewd behavior of the wicked .
61002008	For in seeing and in hearing , he was just , though he lived with those who , from day to day , crucified the just soul with works of iniquity .
61002009	Thus , the Lord knows how to rescue the pious from trials , and how to reserve the iniquitous for torments on the day of judgment ;
61002010	even more so , those who walk after the flesh in unclean desires , and who despise proper authority . Boldly pleasing themselves , they do not dread to introduce divisions by blaspheming ;
61002011	whereas the Angels , who are greater in strength and virtue , did not bring against themselves such a deplorable judgment .
61002012	Yet truly , these others , like irrational beasts , naturally fall into traps and into ruin by blaspheming whatever they do not understand , and so they shall perish in their corruption ,
61002013	receiving the reward of injustice , the fruition of valuing the delights of the day : defilements and stains , overflowing with self-indulgences , taking pleasure in their feasts with you ,
61002014	having eyes full of adultery and of incessant offenses , luring unstable souls , having a heart well-trained in avarice , sons of curses !
61002015	Abandoning the straight path , they wandered astray , having followed the way of Balaam , the son of Beor , who loved the wages of iniquity .
61002016	Yet truly , he had a correction of his madness : the mute animal under the yoke , which , by speaking with a human voice , forbid the folly of the prophet .
61002017	These ones are like fountains without water , and like clouds stirred up by whirlwinds . For them , the mist of darkness is reserved .
61002018	For , speaking with the arrogance of vanity , they lure , by the desires of fleshly pleasures , those who are fleeing to some extent , who are being turned from error ,
61002019	promising them freedoms , while they themselves are the servants of corruption . For by whatever a man is overcome , of this also is he the servant .
61002020	For if , after taking refuge from the defilements of the world in the understanding of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ , they again become entangled and overcome by these things , then the latter state becomes worse than the former .
61002021	For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of justice than , after acknowledging it , to turn away from that holy commandment which was handed on to them .
61002022	For the truth of the proverb has happened to them : The dog has returned to his own vomit , and the washed sow has returned to her wallowing in the mud .
61003001	Consider , most beloved , this second epistle which I am writing to you , in which I stir up , by admonition , your sincere mind ,
61003002	so that you may be mindful of those words that I preached to you from the holy prophets , and of the precepts of the Apostles of your Lord and Savior .
61003003	Know this first : that in the last days there will arrive deceitful mockers , walking according to their own desires ,
61003004	saying : “ Where is his promise or his advent ? For from the time that the fathers have slept , all things have continued just as they were from the beginning of creation . ”
61003005	But they willfully ignore this : that the heavens existed first , and that the earth , from water and through water , was established by the Word of God .
61003006	By water , the former world then , having been inundated with water , perished .
61003007	But the heavens and the earth that exist now were restored by the same Word , being reserved unto fire on the day of judgment , and unto the perdition of impious men .
61003008	Yet truly , let this one thing not escape notice , most beloved , that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years , and a thousand years is like one day .
61003009	The Lord is not delaying his promise , as some imagine , but he does act patiently for your sake , not wanting anyone to perish , but wanting all to be turned back to penance .
61003010	Then the day of the Lord shall arrive like a thief . On that day , the heavens shall pass away with great violence , and truly the elements shall be dissolved with heat ; then the earth , and the works that are within it , shall be completely burned up .
61003011	Therefore , since all these things will be dissolved , what kind of people ought you to be ? In behavior and in piety , be holy ,
61003012	waiting for , and hurrying toward , the advent of the day of the Lord , by which the burning heavens shall be dissolved , and the elements shall melt from the heat of the fire .
61003013	Yet truly , in accord with his promises , we are looking forward to the new heavens and the new earth , in which justice lives .
61003014	Therefore , most beloved , while awaiting these things , be diligent , so that you may be found to be immaculate and unassailable before him , in peace .
61003015	And let the longsuffering of our Lord be considered salvation , as also our most beloved brother Paul , according to the wisdom given to him , has written to you ,
61003016	just as he also spoke in all of his epistles about these things . In these , there are certain things which are difficult to understand , which the unlearned and the unsteady distort , as they also do the other Scriptures , to their own destruction .
61003017	But since you , brothers , know these things beforehand , be cautious , lest by being drawn into the error of the foolish , you may fall away from your own steadfastness .
61003018	Yet truly , increase in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ . To him be glory , both now and in the day of eternity . Amen .
62001001	He who was from the beginning , whom we have heard , whom we have seen with our eyes , upon whom we have gazed , and whom our hands have certainly touched : He is the Word of Life .
62001002	And that Life has been made manifest . And we have seen , and we testify , and we announce to you : the Eternal Life , who was with the Father , and who appeared to us .
62001003	He whom we have seen and heard , we announce to you , so that you , too , may have fellowship with us , and so that our fellowship may be with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ .
62001004	And this we write to you , so that you may rejoice , and so that your joy may be full .
62001005	And this is the announcement which we have heard from him , and which we announce to you : that God is light , and in him there is no darkness .
62001006	If we claim that we have fellowship with him , and yet we walk in darkness , then we are lying and not telling the truth .
62001007	But if we walk in the light , just as he also is in the light , then we have fellowship with one another , and the blood of Jesus Christ , his Son , cleanses us from all sin .
62001008	If we claim that we have no sin , then we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us .
62001009	If we confess our sins , then he is faithful and just , so as to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all iniquity .
62001010	If we claim that we have not sinned , then we make him a liar , and his Word is not in us .
62002001	My little sons , this I write to you , so that you may not sin . But if anyone has sinned , we have an Advocate with the Father , Jesus Christ , the Just One .
62002002	And he is the propitiation for our sins . And not only for our sins , but also for those of the whole world .
62002003	And we can be sure that we have known him by this : if we observe his commandments .
62002004	Whoever claims that he knows him , and yet does not keep his commandments , is a liar , and the truth is not in him .
62002005	But whoever keeps his word , truly in him the charity of God is perfected . And by this we know that we are in him .
62002006	Whoever declares himself to remain in him , ought to walk just as he himself walked .
62002007	Most beloved , I am not writing to you a new commandment , but the old commandment , which you had from the beginning . The old commandment is the Word , which you have heard .
62002008	Then too , I am writing to you a new commandment , which is the Truth in him and in you . For the darkness has passed away , and the true Light is now shining .
62002009	Whoever declares himself to be in the light , and yet hates his brother , is in the darkness even now .
62002010	Whoever loves his brother abides in the light , and there is no cause of offense in him .
62002011	But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness , and in darkness he walks , and he does not know where he is going . For the darkness has blinded his eyes .
62002012	I am writing to you , little sons , because your sins are forgiven for the sake of his name .
62002013	I am writing to you , fathers , because you have known him who is from the beginning . I am writing to you , adolescents , because you have overcome the evil one .
62002014	I am writing to you , little children , because you have known the Father . I am writing to you , young men , because you are strong , and the Word of God abides in you , and you have overcome the evil one .
62002015	Do not choose to love the world , nor the things that are in the world . If anyone loves the world , the charity of the Father is not in him .
62002016	For all that is in the world is the desire of the flesh , and the desire of the eyes , and the arrogance of a life which is not of the Father , but is of the world .
62002017	And the world is passing away , with its desire . But whoever does the will of God abides unto eternity .
62002018	Little sons , it is the last hour . And , as you have heard that the Antichrist is coming , so now many antichrists have arrived . By this , we know that it is the last hour .
62002019	They went out from among us , but they were not of us . For , if they had been of us , certainly they would have remained with us . But in this way , it is made manifest that none of them are of us .
62002020	Yet you have the anointing of the Holy One , and you know everything .
62002021	I have not written to you as to ones who are ignorant of the truth , but as to ones who know the truth . For no lie is of the truth .
62002022	Who is a liar , other than he who denies that Jesus is the Christ ? This one is the Antichrist , who denies the Father and the Son .
62002023	No one who denies the Son also has the Father . Whoever confesses the Son , also has the Father .
62002024	As for you , let what you have heard from the beginning remain in you . If what you have heard from the beginning remains in you , then you , too , shall abide in the Son and in the Father .
62002025	And this is the Promise , which he himself has promised to us : Eternal Life .
62002026	I have written these things to you , because of those who would seduce you .
62002027	But as for you , let the Anointing that you have received from him abide in you . And so , you have no need of anyone to teach you . For his Anointing teaches you about everything , and it is the truth , and it is not a lie . And just as his Anointing has taught you , abide in him .
62002028	And now , little sons , abide in him , so that when he appears , we may have faith , and we may not be confounded by him at his advent .
62002029	If you know that he is just , then know , too , that all who do what is just are born of him .
62003001	See what kind of love the Father has given to us , that we would be called , and would become , the sons of God . Because of this , the world does not know us , for it did not know him .
62003002	Most beloved , we are now the sons of God . But what we shall be then has not yet appeared . We know that when he does appear , we shall be like him , for we shall see him as he is .
62003003	And everyone who holds this hope in him , keeps himself holy , just as he also is holy .
62003004	Everyone who commits a sin , also commits iniquity . For sin is iniquity .
62003005	And you know that he appeared in order that he might take away our sins . For in him there is no sin .
62003006	Everyone who abides in him does not sin . For whoever sins has not seen him , and has not known him .
62003007	Little sons , let no one deceive you . Whoever does justice is just , even as he also is just .
62003008	Whoever commits sin is of the devil . For the devil sins from the beginning . For this reason , the Son of God appeared , so that he might eradicate the works of the devil .
62003009	All those who have been born of God do not commit sin . For the offspring of God abides in them , and he is not able to sin , because he was born of God .
62003010	In this way , the sons of God are made manifest , and also the sons of the devil . Everyone who is not just , is not of God , as also anyone who does not love his brother .
62003011	For this is the announcement that you heard from the beginning : that you should love one another .
62003012	Do not be like Cain , who was of the evil one , and who killed his brother . And why did he kill him ? Because his own works were wicked , but his brother’s works were just .
62003013	If the world hates you , brothers , do not be surprised .
62003014	We know that we have passed from death to life . For we love as brothers . Whoever does not love , abides in death .
62003015	Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer . And you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding within him .
62003016	We know the love of God in this way : because he laid down his life for us . And so , we must lay down our lives for our brothers .
62003017	Whoever possesses the goods of this world , and sees his brother to be in need , and yet closes his heart to him : in what way does the love of God abide in him ?
62003018	My little sons , let us not love in words only , but in works and in truth .
62003019	In this way , we will know that we are of the truth , and we will commend our hearts in his sight .
62003020	For even if our heart reproaches us , God is greater than our heart , and he knows all things .
62003021	Most beloved , if our heart does not reproach us , we can have confidence toward God ;
62003022	and whatever we shall request of him , we shall receive from him . For we keep his commandments , and we do the things that are pleasing in his sight .
62003023	And this is his commandment : that we should believe in the name of his Son , Jesus Christ , and love one another , just as he has commanded us .
62003024	And those who keep his commandments abide in him , and he in them . And we know that he abides in us by this : by the Spirit , whom he has given to us .
62004001	Most beloved , do not be willing to believe every spirit , but test the spirits to see if they are of God . For many false prophets have gone out into the world .
62004002	The Spirit of God may be known in this way . Every spirit who confesses that Jesus Christ has arrived in the flesh is of God ;
62004003	and every spirit who contradicts Jesus is not of God . And this one is the Antichrist , the one that you have heard is coming , and even now he is in the world .
62004004	Little sons , you are of God , and so you have overcome him . For he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world .
62004005	They are of the world . Therefore , they speak about the world , and the world listens to them .
62004006	We are of God . Whoever knows God , listens to us . Whoever is not of God , does not listen to us . In this way , we know the Spirit of truth from the spirit of error .
62004007	Most beloved , let us love one another . For love is of God . And everyone who loves is born of God and knows God .
62004008	Whoever does not love , does not know God . For God is love .
62004009	The love of God was made apparent to us in this way : that God sent his only-begotten Son into the world , so that we might live through him .
62004010	In this is love : not as if we had loved God , but that he first loved us , and so he sent his Son as a propitiation for our sins .
62004011	Most beloved , if God has so loved us , we also ought to love one another .
62004012	No one has ever seen God . But if we love one another , God abides in us , and his love is perfected in us .
62004013	In this way , we know that we abide in him , and he in us : because he has given to us from his Spirit .
62004014	And we have seen , and we testify , that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world .
62004015	Whoever has confessed that Jesus is the Son of God , God abides in him , and he in God .
62004016	And we have known and believed the love that God has for us . God is love . And he who abides in love , abides in God , and God in him .
62004017	In this way , the love of God is perfected with us , so that we may have confidence on the day of judgment . For as he is , so also are we , in this world .
62004018	Fear is not in love . Instead , perfect love casts out fear , for fear pertains to punishment . And whoever fears is not perfected in love .
62004019	Therefore , let us love God , for God first loved us .
62004020	If anyone says that he loves God , but hates his brother , then he is a liar . For he who does not love his brother , whom he does see , in what way can he love God , whom he does not see ?
62004021	And this is the commandment that we have from God , that he who loves God must also love his brother .
62005001	Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ , is born of God . And everyone who loves God , who provides that birth , also loves him who has been born of God .
62005002	In this way , we know that we love those born of God : when we love God and do his commandments .
62005003	For this is the love of God : that we keep his commandments . And his commandments are not heavy .
62005004	For all that is born of God overcomes the world . And this is the victory that overcomes the world : our faith .
62005005	Who is it that overcomes the world ? Only he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God !
62005006	This is the One who came by water and blood : Jesus Christ . Not by water only , but by water and blood . And the Spirit is the One who testifies that the Christ is the Truth .
62005007	For there are Three who give testimony in heaven : the Father , the Word , and the Holy Spirit . And these Three are One .
62005008	And there are three who give testimony on earth : the Spirit , and the water , and the blood . And these three are one .
62005009	If we accept the testimony of men , then the testimony of God is greater . For this is the testimony of God , which is greater : that he has testified about his Son .
62005010	Whoever believes in the Son of God , holds the testimony of God within himself . Whoever does not believe in the Son , makes him a liar , because he does not believe in the testimony which God has testified about his Son .
62005011	And this is the testimony which God has given to us : Eternal Life . And this Life is in his Son .
62005012	Whoever has the Son , has Life . Whoever does not have the Son , does not have Life .
62005013	I am writing this to you , so that you may know that you have Eternal Life : you who believe in the name of the Son of God .
62005014	And this is the confidence which we have toward God : that no matter what we shall request , in accord with his will , he hears us .
62005015	And we know that he hears us , no matter what we request ; so we know that we can obtain the things that we request of him .
62005016	Anyone who realizes that his brother has sinned , with a sin that is not unto death , let him pray , and life shall be given to him who has sinned not unto death . There is a sin which is unto death . I am not saying that anyone should ask on behalf of that sin .
62005017	All that is iniquity is sin . But there is a sin unto death .
62005018	We know that everyone who is born of God does not sin . Instead , rebirth in God preserves him , and the evil one cannot touch him .
62005019	We know that we are of God , and that the entire world is established in wickedness .
62005020	And we know that the Son of God has arrived , and that he has given us understanding , so that we may know the true God , and so that we may remain in his true Son . This is the true God , and this is Eternal Life .
62005021	Little sons , keep yourselves from false worship . Amen .
63001001	The Elder to the Elect Lady , and those born of her , whom I love in the truth : and not I alone , but also all those who have known the truth ,
63001002	because the truth which dwells in us shall be with us for eternity .
63001003	May grace , mercy , and peace be with you from God the Father , and from Christ Jesus , the Son of the Father , in truth and in love .
63001004	I was very glad because I discovered some of your sons walking in the truth , just as we received the commandment from the Father .
63001005	And now I petition you , Lady , not as if writing a new commandment to you , but instead that commandment which we have had from the beginning : that we love one another .
63001006	And this is love : that we walk according to his commandments . For this is the commandment that you have heard in the same way from the beginning , and in which you should walk .
63001007	For many deceivers have gone out into the world , those who do not confess that Jesus Christ has arrived in the flesh . Such a one as this is a deceiver and an antichrist .
63001008	Be cautious for yourselves , lest you lose what you have accomplished , and so that , instead , you may receive a full reward .
63001009	Everyone who withdraws and does not remain in the doctrine of Christ , does not have God . Whoever remains in the doctrine , such a one as this has both the Father and the Son .
63001010	If anyone comes to you , and does not bring this doctrine , do not be willing to receive him into the house , and do not speak a greeting to him .
63001011	For whoever speaks a greeting to him , is speaking with his evil works .
63001012	I have much more to write to you , but I am not willing to do so through paper and ink . For I hope that I may be with you in the future , and that I may speak face to face , so that your joy may be full .
63001013	The sons of your Elect Sister greet you .
64001001	The Elder , to Gaius , most beloved , whom I love in the truth .
64001002	Most beloved , concerning everything , I make it my prayer that you may benefit by advancing and succeeding in whatever may be to the benefit of your soul .
64001003	I was very glad when the brothers arrived , and when they offered testimony to the truth in you , that you are walking in the truth .
64001004	I have no greater grace than this , when I hear that my sons are walking in the truth .
64001005	Most beloved , you should act faithfully in whatever you do for the brothers , and those who are sojourners ;
64001006	they have given testimony to your charity in the sight of the Church . You would to well to lead these ones worthily to God .
64001007	For they set out , on behalf of his name , accepting nothing from the unbelievers .
64001008	Therefore , we must accept such as these , in order that we may cooperate with the truth .
64001009	As it happens , I had written to the church . But Diotrephes , who loves to bear the highest rank among them , would not accept us .
64001010	Because of this , when I come , I will admonish his works which he does , babbling against us with malicious words . And as if this were not sufficient for him , he himself does not receive the brothers . And those who do receive them , he hinders , and he ejects them from the church .
64001011	Most beloved , do not be willing to imitate what is evil ; instead imitate what is good . Whoever does good is of God . Whoever does evil has not seen God .
64001012	Testimony is being given for Demetrius by everyone , and by the truth itself . And we also offer testimony . And you know that our testimony is true .
64001013	I had many things to write to you , but I am not willing , through ink and pen , to write to you .
64001014	Yet I hope to see you soon , and then we will speak face to face . Peace to you . The friends greet you . Greet the friends by name .
64001015	
65001001	Jude , a servant of Jesus Christ , and brother of James , to those who are beloved in God the Father , and who are guarded and called in Jesus Christ :
65001002	May mercy , and peace , and love be fulfilled in you .
65001003	Most beloved , taking all care to write to you about your common salvation , I found it necessary to write to you in order to beg you to contend earnestly for the faith that was handed down once to the saints .
65001004	For certain men entered unnoticed , who were written of beforehand unto this judgment : impious persons who are transforming the grace of our God into self-indulgence , and who are denying both the sole Ruler and our Lord Jesus Christ .
65001005	So I want to caution you . Those who once knew everything that Jesus did , in saving the people from the land of Egypt , afterwards perished because they did not believe .
65001006	And truly , the Angels , who did not keep to their first place , but instead abandoned their own domiciles , he has reserved with perpetual chains under darkness , unto the great day of judgment .
65001007	And also Sodom and Gomorrah , and the adjoining cities , in similar ways , having given themselves over to fornication and to the pursuing of other flesh , were made an example , suffering the punishment of eternal fire .
65001008	Similarly also , these ones certainly defile the flesh , and they despise proper authority , and they blaspheme against majesty .
65001009	When Michael the Archangel , disputing with the devil , contended about the body of Moses , he did not dare to bring against him a judgment of blasphemy , so instead he said : “ The Lord commands you . ”
65001010	But these men certainly blaspheme against whatever they do not understand . And yet , whatever they , like mute animals , know from nature , in these things they are corrupted .
65001011	Woe to them ! For they have gone after the way of Cain , and they have poured out the error of Balaam for profit , and they have perished in the sedition of Korah .
65001012	These ones are defiled within their banquets , enjoying themselves and feeding themselves without fear ; waterless clouds , which are tossed about by winds ; autumn trees , unfruitful , twice dead , uprooted ;
65001013	raging waves of the sea , foaming from their own confusion ; wandering stars , for whom the whirlwind of darkness has been reserved forever !
65001014	And about these , Enoch , the seventh from Adam , also prophesied , saying : “ Behold , the Lord is arriving with thousands of his saints ,
65001015	to execute judgment against everyone , and to reprove all the impious concerning all the works of their impiety , by which they have acted impiously , and concerning all the harsh things that impious sinners have spoken against God . ”
65001016	These ones are complaining murmurers , walking according to their own desires . And their mouth is speaking arrogance , admiring persons for the sake of gain .
65001017	But as for you , most beloved , be mindful of the words which have been foretold by the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
65001018	who declared to you that , in the end time , there would arrive mockers , walking according to their own desires , in impieties .
65001019	These are the ones who segregate themselves ; they are animals , not having the Spirit .
65001020	But you , most beloved , are building yourselves up by your most holy faith , praying in the Holy Spirit ,
65001021	keeping yourselves in the love of God , and anticipating the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life .
65001022	So certainly , reprove them , after they have been judged .
65001023	Yet truly , save them , seizing them from the fire . And have mercy on others : in fear , hating even that which is of the flesh , the defiled garment .
65001024	Then , to him who has the power to keep you free from sin and to present you , immaculate , with exultation , before the presence of his glory at the advent of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
65001025	to the only God , our Savior , through Jesus Christ our Lord : to him be glory and magnificence , dominion and power , before all ages , and now , and in every age , forever . Amen .
66001001	The Revelation of Jesus Christ , which God gave to him , in order to make known to his servants the things that must soon occur , and which he signified by sending his Angel to his servant John ;
66001002	he has offered testimony to the Word of God , and whatever he saw is the testimony of Jesus Christ .
66001003	Blessed is he who reads or hears the words of this Prophecy , and who keeps the things that have been written in it . For the time is near .
66001004	John , to the seven Churches , which are in Asia . Grace and peace to you , from him who is , and who was , and who is to come , and from the seven spirits who are in the sight of his throne ,
66001005	and from Jesus Christ , who is the faithful witness , the first-born of the dead , and the leader over the kings of the earth , who has loved us and has washed us from our sins with his blood ,
66001006	and who has made us into a kingdom and into priests for God and for his Father . To him be glory and dominion forever and ever . Amen .
66001007	Behold , he arrives with the clouds , and every eye shall see him , even those who pierced him . And all the tribes of the earth shall lament for themselves over him . Even so . Amen .
66001008	“ I am the Alpha and the Omega , the Beginning and the End , ” says the Lord God , who is , and who was , and who is to come , the Almighty .
66001009	I , John , your brother , and a sharer in the tribulation and in the kingdom and in patient endurance for Christ Jesus , was on the island which is called Patmos , because of the Word of God and the testimony to Jesus .
66001010	I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day , and I heard behind me a great voice , like that of a trumpet ,
66001011	saying , “ What you see , write in a book , and send it to the seven Churches , which are in Asia : to Ephesus , and to Smyrna , and to Pergamus , and to Thyatira , and to Sardis , and to Philadelphia , and to Laodicea . ”
66001012	And I turned around , so as to see the voice which was speaking with me . And having turned around , I saw seven golden lampstands .
66001013	And in the midst of the seven golden lampstands was one resembling the Son of man , clothed to the feet with a vestment , and wrapped to the breast with a wide belt of gold .
66001014	But his head and hair were bright , like white wool , or like snow ; and his eyes were like a flame of fire ;
66001015	and his feet resembled shining brass , just as in a burning furnace ; and his voice was like the voice of many waters .
66001016	And in his right hand , he held the seven stars ; and from his mouth went out a sharp two-edged sword ; and his face was like the sun , shining with all its might .
66001017	And when I had seen him , I fell at his feet , like one who is dead . And he laid his right hand upon me , saying : “ Do not be afraid . I am the First and the Last .
66001018	And I am alive , though I was dead . And , behold , I live forever and ever . And I hold the keys of death and of Hell .
66001019	Therefore , write the things which you have seen , and which are , and which must occur afterward :
66001020	the mystery of the seven stars , which you have seen in my right hand , and of the seven golden lampstands . The seven stars are the Angels of the seven Churches , and the seven lampstands are the seven Churches . ”
66002001	“ And to the Angel of the Church of Ephesus write : Thus says the One who holds the seven stars in his right hand , who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands :
66002002	I know your works , and your hardship and patient endurance , and that you cannot stand those who are evil . And so , you have tested those who declare themselves to be Apostles and are not , and you have found them to be liars .
66002003	And you have patient endurance for the sake of my name , and you have not fallen away .
66002004	But I have this against you : that you have relinquished your first charity .
66002005	And so , call to mind the place from which you have fallen , and do penance , and do the first works . Otherwise , I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place , unless you repent .
66002006	But this you have , that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans , which I also hate .
66002007	Whoever has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the Churches . To him who prevails , I will give to eat from the Tree of Life , which is in the Paradise of my God .
66002008	And to the Angel of the Church of Smyrna write : Thus says the First and the Last , he who was dead and now lives :
66002009	I know your tribulation and your poverty , but you are rich , and that you are blasphemed by those who declare themselves to be Jews and are not , but who are a synagogue of Satan .
66002010	You should fear nothing amid those things which you will suffer . Behold , the devil will cast some of you into prison , so that you may be tested . And you will have tribulation for ten days . Be faithful even unto death , and I will give to you the crown of life .
66002011	Whoever has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the Churches . Whoever will prevail , he shall not be harmed by the second death .
66002012	And to the Angel of the Church of Pergamus write : Thus says he who holds the sharp two-edged spear :
66002013	I know where you dwell , where the seat of Satan is , and that you hold to my name and have not denied my faith , even in those days when Antipas was my faithful witness , who was slain among you , where Satan dwells .
66002014	But I have a few things against you . For you have , in that place , those who hold to the doctrine of Balaam , who instructed Balak to cast a stumbling block before the sons of Israel , to eat and to commit fornication .
66002015	And you also have those who hold to the doctrine of the Nicolaitans .
66002016	So do penance to the same extent . If you do less , I will come to you quickly and I will fight against these ones with the sword of my mouth .
66002017	Whoever has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the Churches . To him who prevails , I will give the hidden manna . And I will give to him a white emblem , and on the emblem , a new name has been written , which no one knows , except the one who receives it .
66002018	And to the Angel of the Church of Thyatira write : Thus says the Son of God , who has eyes like a flame of fire , and his feet are like shining brass .
66002019	I know your works , and your faith and charity , and your ministry and patient endurance , and that your more recent works are greater than the earlier ones .
66002020	But I have a few things against you . For you permit the woman Jezabel , who calls herself a prophetess , to teach and to seduce my servants , to commit fornication and to eat the food of idolatry .
66002021	And I gave her a time , so that she might do penance , but she is not willing to repent from her fornication .
66002022	Behold , I will cast her onto a bed , and those who commit adultery with her shall be in a very great tribulation , unless they repent from their works .
66002023	And I will put her sons to death , and all the Churches shall know that I am the one who examines temperaments and hearts . And I will give to each one of you according to your works . But I say to you ,
66002024	and to the others who are at Thyatira : Whoever does not hold to this doctrine , and who has not ‘ known the depths of Satan , ’ as they say , I will not set any other weight upon you .
66002025	Even so , that which you have , hold on to it until I return .
66002026	And whoever will prevail and will observe my works even unto the end , I will give to him authority over the nations .
66002027	And he shall rule them with an iron rod , and they shall be broken like the earthenware of a potter .
66002028	The same I also have received from my Father . And I will give to him the morning star .
66002029	Whoever has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the Churches . ”
66003001	“ And to the Angel of the Church of Sardis write : Thus says he who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars : I know your works , that you have a name which is alive , but you are dead .
66003002	Be vigilant , and confirm the things that remain , lest they soon die out . For I do not find your works to be full in the sight of my God .
66003003	Therefore , keep in mind the way that you have received and heard , and then observe it and repent . But if you will not be vigilant , I will come to you like a thief , and you will not know at what hour I will come to you .
66003004	But you have a few names in Sardis who have not defiled their garments . And these shall walk with me in white , because they are worthy .
66003005	Whoever prevails , so shall he be clothed in white vestments . And I will not delete his name from the Book of Life . And I will confess his name in the presence of my Father and in the presence of his Angels .
66003006	Whoever has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the Churches .
66003007	And to the Angel of the Church of Philadelphia write : Thus says the Holy One , the True One , he who holds the key of David . He opens and no one closes . He closes and no one opens .
66003008	I know your works . Behold , I have set an open door before you , which no one is able to close . For you have little power , and you have observed my word , and you have not denied my name .
66003009	Behold , I will take from the synagogue of Satan those who declare themselves to be Jews and are not , for they are lying . Behold , I will cause them to approach and to reverence before your feet . And they shall know that I have loved you .
66003010	Since you have kept the word of my patient endurance , I also will keep you from the hour of temptation , which shall overcome the whole world in order to test those living upon the earth .
66003011	Behold , I am approaching quickly . Hold on to what you have , so that no one may take your crown .
66003012	Whoever prevails , I will set him as a column in the temple of my God , and he shall not depart from it anymore . And I will write upon him the name of my God , and the name of the city of my God , the new Jerusalem that descends out of heaven from my God , and my new name .
66003013	Whoever has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the Churches .
66003014	And to the Angel of the Church of Laodicea write : Thus says the Amen , the faithful and true Witness , who is the Beginning of the creation of God :
66003015	I know your works : that you are neither cold , nor hot . I wish that you were either cold or hot .
66003016	But because you are lukewarm and are neither cold nor hot , I will begin to vomit you out of my mouth .
66003017	For you declare , ‘ I am wealthy , and I have been enriched further , and I have need of nothing . ’ And you do not know that you are wretched , and miserable , and poor , and blind , and naked .
66003018	I urge you to buy from me gold , tested by fire , so that you may be enriched and may be clothed in white vestments , and so that the shame of your nakedness may disappear . And anoint your eyes with an eye salve , so that you may see .
66003019	Those whom I love , I rebuke and chastise . Therefore , be zealous and do penance .
66003020	Behold , I stand at the door and knock . If anyone will hear my voice and will open the door to me , I will enter to him , and I will dine with him , and he with me .
66003021	Whoever prevails , I will grant to him to sit with me on my throne , just as I also have overcome and have sat down with my Father on his throne .
66003022	Whoever has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the Churches . ”
66004001	After these things , I saw , and behold , a door was opened in heaven , and the voice that I heard speaking with me first was like a trumpet , saying : “ Ascend to here , and I will reveal to you what must occur after these things . ”
66004002	And immediately I was in the Spirit . And behold , a throne had been placed in heaven , and there was One sitting upon the throne .
66004003	And the One who was sitting there was similar in appearance to a stone of jasper and sardius . And there was an iridescence surrounding the throne , in aspect similar to an emerald .
66004004	And surrounding the throne were twenty-four smaller thrones . And upon the thrones , twenty-four elders were sitting , clothed entirely in white vestments , and on their heads were gold crowns .
66004005	And from the throne , lightnings and voices and thunders went forth . And there were seven burning lamps before the throne , which are the seven spirits of God .
66004006	And in view of the throne , there was something that seemed like a sea of glass , similar to crystal . And in the middle of the throne , and all around the throne , there were four living creatures , full of eyes in front and in back .
66004007	And the first living creature resembled a lion , and the second living creature resembled a calf , and the third living creature had a face like a man , and the fourth living creature resembled a flying eagle .
66004008	And each of the four living creatures had upon them six wings , and all around and within they are full of eyes . And they took no rest , day or night , from saying : “ Holy , Holy , Holy is the Lord God Almighty , who was , and who is , and who is to come . ”
66004009	And while those living creatures were giving glory and honor and blessings to the One sitting upon the throne , who lives forever and ever ,
66004010	the twenty-four elders fell prostrate before the One sitting upon the throne , and they adored him who lives forever and ever , and they cast their crowns before the throne , saying :
66004011	“ You are worthy , O Lord our God , to receive glory and honor and power . For you have created all things , and they became and were created because of your will . ”
66005001	And in the right hand of the One sitting upon the throne , I saw a book , written inside and out , sealed with seven seals .
66005002	And I saw a strong Angel , proclaiming with a great voice , “ Who is worthy to open the book and to break its seals ? ”
66005003	And no one was able , neither in heaven , nor on earth , nor under the earth , to open the book , nor to gaze upon it .
66005004	And I wept greatly because no one was found worthy to open the book , nor to see it .
66005005	And one of the elders said to me : “ Weep not . Behold , the lion from the tribe of Judah , the root of David , has prevailed to open the book and to break its seven seals . ”
66005006	And I saw , and behold , in the midst of the throne and the four living creatures , and in the midst of the elders , a Lamb was standing , as if it were slain , having seven horns and seven eyes , which are the seven spirits of God , sent forth to all the earth .
66005007	And he approached and received the book from the right hand of the One sitting upon the throne .
66005008	And when he had opened the book , the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb , each having stringed instruments , as well as golden bowls full of fragrances , which are the prayers of the saints .
66005009	And they were singing a new canticle , saying : “ O Lord , you are worthy to receive the book and to open its seals , because you were slain and have redeemed us for God , by your blood , from every tribe and language and people and nation .
66005010	And you have made us into a kingdom and into priests for our God , and we shall reign over the earth . ”
66005011	And I saw , and I heard the voice of many Angels surrounding the throne and the living creatures and the elders , ( and their number was thousands of thousands )
66005012	saying with a great voice : “ The Lamb who was slain is worthy to receive power , and divinity , and wisdom , and strength , and honor , and glory , and blessing . ”
66005013	And every creature that is in heaven , and on earth , and under the earth , and all that is within the sea : I heard them all saying : “ To the One sitting upon the throne and to the Lamb be blessing , and honor , and glory , and authority , forever and ever . ”
66005014	And the four living creatures were saying , “ Amen . ” And the twenty-four elders fell down on their faces , and they adored the One who lives forever and ever .
66006001	And I saw that the Lamb had opened one of the seven seals . And I heard one of the four living creatures saying , in a voice like thunder : “ Draw near and see . ”
66006002	And I saw , and behold , a white horse . And he who was sitting upon it was holding a bow , and a crown was given to him , and he went forth conquering , so that he might prevail .
66006003	And when he had opened the second seal , I heard the second living creature saying : “ Draw near and see . ”
66006004	And another horse went forth , which was red . And it was granted to him who was sitting upon it that he would take peace from the earth , and that they would kill one another . And a great sword was given to him .
66006005	And when he had opened the third seal , I heard the third living creature saying : “ Draw near and see . ” And behold , a black horse . And he who was sitting upon it was holding a balance in his hand .
66006006	And I heard something like a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying , “ A double measure of wheat for a denarius , and three double measures of barley for a denarius , but do no harm to wine and oil . ”
66006007	And when he had opened the fourth seal , I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying : “ Draw near and see . ”
66006008	And behold , a pale horse . And he who was sitting upon it , his name was Death , and Hell was following him . And authority was given to him over the four parts of the earth , to destroy by the sword , by famine , and by death , and by the creatures of the earth .
66006009	And when he had opened the fifth seal , I saw , under the altar , the souls of those who had been slain because of the Word of God and because of the testimony that they held .
66006010	And they were crying out with a loud voice , saying : “ How long , O Holy and True Lord , will you not judge and not vindicate our blood against those who dwell upon the earth ? ”
66006011	And white robes were given to each of them . And they were told that they should rest for a brief time , until their fellow servants and their brothers , who were to be slain even as they were slain , would be completed .
66006012	And when he had opened the sixth seal , I saw , and behold , a great earthquake occurred . And the sun became black , like a haircloth sack , and the entire moon became like blood .
66006013	And the stars from heaven fell upon the earth , just as when a fig tree , shaken by a great wind , drops its immature figs .
66006014	And heaven receded , like a scroll being rolled up . And every mountain , and the islands , were moved from their places .
66006015	And the kings of the earth , and the rulers , and the military leaders , and the wealthy , and the strong , and everyone , servant and free , hid themselves in caves and among the rocks of the mountains .
66006016	And they said to the mountains and the rocks : “ Fall over us and hide us from the face of the One sitting upon the throne , and from the wrath of the Lamb .
66006017	For the great day of their wrath has arrived . And who will be able to stand ? ”
66007001	After these things , I saw four Angels standing above the four corners of the earth , holding the four winds of the earth , so that they would not blow upon the earth , nor upon the sea , nor upon any tree .
66007002	And I saw another Angel ascending from the rising of the sun , having the Seal of the living God . And he cried out , in a great voice , to the four Angels to whom it was given to harm the earth and the sea ,
66007003	saying : “ Do no harm to the earth , nor to the sea , nor to the trees , until we seal the servants of our God on their foreheads . ”
66007004	And I heard the number of those who were sealed : one hundred and forty-four thousand sealed , out of every tribe of the sons of Israel .
66007005	From the tribe of Judah , twelve thousand were sealed . From the tribe of Ruben , twelve thousand were sealed . From the tribe of Gad , twelve thousand were sealed .
66007006	From the tribe of Asher , twelve thousand were sealed . From the tribe of Naphtali , twelve thousand were sealed . From the tribe of Manasseh , twelve thousand were sealed .
66007007	From the tribe of Simeon , twelve thousand were sealed . From the tribe of Levi , twelve thousand were sealed . From the tribe of Issachar , twelve thousand were sealed .
66007008	From the tribe of Zebulun , twelve thousand were sealed . From the tribe of Joseph , twelve thousand were sealed . From the tribe of Benjamin , twelve thousand were sealed .
66007009	After these things , I saw a great crowd , which no one could number , from all the nations and tribes and peoples and languages , standing before the throne and in sight of the Lamb , clothed in white robes , with palm branches in their hands .
66007010	And they cried out , with a great voice , saying : “ Salvation is from our God , who sits upon the throne , and from the Lamb . ”
66007011	And all the Angels were standing around the throne , with the elders and the four living creatures . And they fell upon their faces in view of the throne , and they worshipped God ,
66007012	saying : “ Amen . Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving , honor and power and strength to our God , forever and ever . Amen . ”
66007013	And one of the elders responded and said to me : “ These ones who are clothed in white robes , who are they ? And where did they come from ? ”
66007014	And I said to him , “ My lord , you know . ” And he said to me : “ These are the ones who have come out of the great tribulation , and they have washed their robes and have made them white by the blood of the Lamb .
66007015	Therefore , they are before the throne of God , and they serve him , day and night , in his temple . And the One who sits upon the throne shall dwell over them .
66007016	They shall not hunger , nor shall they thirst , anymore . Neither shall the sun beat down upon them , nor any heat .
66007017	For the Lamb , who is in the midst of the throne , will rule over them , and he will lead them to the fountains of the waters of life . And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes . ”
66008001	And when he had opened the seventh seal , there was silence in heaven for about half an hour .
66008002	And I saw seven Angels standing in the sight of God . And seven trumpets were given to them .
66008003	And another Angel approached , and he stood before the altar , holding a golden censer . And much incense was given to him , so that he might offer upon the golden altar , which is before the throne of God , the prayers of all the saints .
66008004	And the smoke of the incense of the prayers of the saints ascended , in the presence of God , from the hand of the Angel .
66008005	And the Angel received the golden censer , and he filled it from the fire of the altar , and he cast it down upon the earth , and there were thunders and voices and lightnings and a great earthquake .
66008006	And the seven Angels who hold the seven trumpets prepared themselves , in order to sound the trumpet .
66008007	And the first Angel sounded the trumpet . And there came hail and fire , mixed with blood ; and it was cast down upon the earth . And a third part of the earth was burned , and a third part of the trees was entirely burned up , and all the green plants were burned .
66008008	And the second Angel sounded the trumpet . And something like a great mountain , burning with fire , was cast down into the sea . And a third part of the sea became like blood .
66008009	And a third part of the creatures that were living in the sea died . And a third part of the ships were destroyed .
66008010	And the third Angel sounded the trumpet . And a great star fell from heaven , burning like a torch . And it fell upon a third part of the rivers and upon the sources of water .
66008011	And the name of the star is called Wormwood . And a third part of the waters were turned into wormwood . And many men died from the waters , because they were made bitter .
66008012	And the fourth Angel sounded the trumpet . And a third part of the sun , and a third part of the moon , and a third part of the stars were struck , in such a way that a third part of them was obscured . And a third part of the day did not shine , and similarly the night .
66008013	And I saw , and I heard the voice of a lone eagle flying through the midst of heaven , calling with a great voice : “ Woe , Woe , Woe , to the inhabitants of the earth , from the remaining voices of the three Angels , who will soon sound the trumpet ! ”
66009001	And the fifth Angel sounded the trumpet . And I saw upon the earth , a star that had fallen from heaven , and the key to the well of the abyss was given to him .
66009002	And he opened the well of the abyss . And the smoke of the well ascended , like the smoke of a great furnace . And the sun and the air were obscured by the smoke of the well .
66009003	And locusts went forth from the smoke of the well into the earth . And power was given to them , like the power that the scorpions of the earth have .
66009004	And it was commanded of them that they must not harm the plants of the earth , nor anything green , nor any tree , but only those men who do not have the Seal of God upon their foreheads .
66009005	And it was given to them that they would not kill them , but that they would torture them for five months . And their torture was like the torture of a scorpion , when he strikes a man .
66009006	And in those days , men will seek death and they will not find it . And they will desire to die , and death will flee from them .
66009007	And the likenesses of the locusts resembled horses prepared for battle . And upon their heads were something like crowns similar to gold . And their faces were like the faces of men .
66009008	And they had hair like the hair of women . And their teeth were like the teeth of lions .
66009009	And they had breastplates like iron breastplates . And the noise of their wings was like the noise of many running horses , rushing to battle .
66009010	And they had tails similar to scorpions . And there were stingers in their tails , and these had the power to harm men for five months .
66009011	And they had over them a king , the Angel of the abyss , whose name in Hebrew is Doom ; in Greek , Destroyer ; in Latin , Exterminator .
66009012	One woe has gone out , but behold , there are still two woes approaching afterward .
66009013	And the sixth Angel sounded the trumpet . And I heard a lone voice from the four horns of the golden altar , which is before the eyes of God ,
66009014	saying to the sixth Angel who had the trumpet : “ Release the four Angels who were bound at the great river Euphrates . ”
66009015	And the four Angels were released , who had been prepared for that hour , and day , and month , and year , in order to kill one third part of men .
66009016	And the number of the army of horsemen was two hundred million . For I heard their number .
66009017	And I also saw the horses in the vision . And those who were sitting upon them had breastplates of fire and hyacinth and sulphur . And the heads of the horses were like the heads of lions . And from their mouths proceeded fire and smoke and sulphur .
66009018	And one third part of men were slain by these three afflictions : by the fire and by the smoke and by the sulphur , which proceeded from their mouths .
66009019	For the power of these horses is in their mouths and in their tails . For their tails resemble serpents , having heads ; and it is with these that they cause harm .
66009020	And the rest of men , who were not slain by these afflictions , did not repent from the works of their hands , so that they would not worship demons , or idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and wood , which can neither see , nor hear , nor walk .
66009021	And they did not repent from their murders , nor from their drugs , nor from their fornication , nor from their thefts .
66010001	And I saw another strong Angel , descending from heaven , clothed with a cloud . And a rainbow was upon his head , and his face was like the sun , and his feet were like columns of fire .
66010002	And he held in his hand a small open book . And he stationed his right foot upon the sea , and his left foot upon the land .
66010003	And he cried out with a great voice , in the manner of a lion roaring . And when he had cried out , seven thunders uttered their voices .
66010004	And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices , I was about to write . But I heard a voice from heaven , saying to me : “ Seal the things that the seven thunders have spoken , and do not write them . ”
66010005	And the Angel , whom I saw standing upon the sea and upon the land , lifted up his hand toward heaven .
66010006	And he swore by the One who lives forever and ever , who created heaven , and the things that are in it ; and the earth , and the things that are in it ; and the sea , and the things that are in it : that the time will not be any longer ,
66010007	but in the days of the voice of the seventh Angel , when he shall begin to sound the trumpet , the mystery of God will be completed , just as he has proclaimed in the Gospel , through his servants the Prophets .
66010008	And again , I heard a voice from heaven speaking with me and saying : “ Go and receive the open book from the hand of the Angel who stands upon the sea and upon the land . ”
66010009	And I went to the Angel , saying to him that he should give the book to me . And he said to me : “ Receive the book and consume it . And it shall cause bitterness in your stomach , but in your mouth it shall be sweet like honey . ”
66010010	And I received the book from the hand of the Angel , and I consumed it . And it was sweet like honey in my mouth . And when I had consumed it , my stomach was made bitter .
66010011	And he said to me , “ It is necessary for you to prophesy again about many nations and peoples and languages and kings . ”
66011001	And a reed , similar to a staff , was given to me . And it was said to me : “ Rise up and measure the temple of God , and those who are worshiping in it , and the altar .
66011002	But the atrium , which is outside of the temple , set it aside and do not measure it , because it has been given over to the Gentiles . And they shall trample upon the Holy City for forty-two months .
66011003	And I will present my two witnesses , and they shall prophesy for one thousand two hundred and sixty days , clothed in sackcloth .
66011004	These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands , standing in the sight of the lord of the earth .
66011005	And if anyone will want to harm them , fire shall go forth from their mouths , and it shall devour their enemies . And if anyone will want to wound them , so must he be slain .
66011006	These have the power to close up the heavens , so that it may not rain during the days of their prophesying . And they have power over the waters , to convert them into blood , and to strike the earth with every kind of affliction as often as they will .
66011007	And when they will have finished their testimony , the beast that ascended from the abyss will make war against them , and will overcome them , and will kill them .
66011008	And their bodies shall lie in the streets of the Great City , which is figuratively called ‘ Sodom ’ and ‘ Egypt , ’ the place where their Lord also was crucified .
66011009	And those from the tribes and peoples and languages and nations shall be watching their bodies for three and one half days . And they shall not permit their bodies to be placed in tombs .
66011010	And the inhabitants of the earth will rejoice over them , and they will celebrate , and they will send gifts to one another , because these two prophets tortured those who were living upon the earth .
66011011	And after three and one half days , the spirit of life from God entered into them . And they stood upright on their feet . And a great fear fell over those who saw them .
66011012	And they heard a great voice from heaven , saying to them , “ Ascend to here ! ” And they ascended into heaven on a cloud . And their enemies saw them .
66011013	And at that hour , a great earthquake occurred . And one tenth part of the City fell . And the names of the men slain in the earthquake were seven thousand . And the remainder were thrown into fear , and they gave glory to the God of heaven .
66011014	The second woe has gone out , but behold , the third woe approaches quickly .
66011015	And the seventh Angel sounded the trumpet . And there were great voices in heaven , saying : “ The kingdom of this world has become our Lord’s and his Christ’s , and he shall reign forever and ever . Amen . ”
66011016	And the twenty-four elders , who sit on their thrones in the sight of God , fell upon their faces , and they adored God , saying :
66011017	“ We give thanks to you , Lord God Almighty , who is , and who was , and who is to come . For you have taken your great power , and you have reigned .
66011018	And the nations became angry , but your wrath arrived , and the time for the dead to be judged , and to render a reward to your servants the prophets , and to the saints , and to those who fear your name , small and great , and to exterminate those who have corrupted the earth . ”
66011019	And the temple of God was opened in heaven . And the Ark of his Testament was seen in his temple . And there were lightnings and voices and thunders , and an earthquake , and great hail .
66012001	And a great sign appeared in heaven : a woman clothed with the sun , and the moon was under her feet , and on her head was a crown of twelve stars .
66012002	And being with child , she cried out while giving birth , and she was suffering in order to give birth .
66012003	And another sign was seen in heaven . And behold , a great red dragon , having seven heads and ten horns , and on his heads were seven diadems .
66012004	And his tail drew down a third part of the stars of heaven and cast them to the earth . And the dragon stood before the woman , who was about to give birth , so that , when she had brought forth , he might devour her son .
66012005	And she brought forth a male child , who was soon to rule all the nations with an iron rod . And her son was taken up to God and to his throne .
66012006	And the woman fled into solitude , where a place was being held ready by God , so that they might pasture her in that place for one thousand two hundred and sixty days .
66012007	And there was a great battle in heaven . Michael and his Angels were battling with the dragon , and the dragon was fighting , and so were his angels .
66012008	But they did not prevail , and a place for them was no longer found in heaven .
66012009	And he was thrown out , that great dragon , that ancient serpent , who is called the devil and Satan , who seduces the whole world . And he was thrown down to the earth , and his angels were cast down with him .
66012010	And I heard a great voice in heaven , saying : “ Now have arrived salvation and virtue and the kingdom of our God and the power of his Christ . For the accuser of our brothers has been cast down , he who accused them before our God day and night .
66012011	And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of his testimony . And they loved not their own lives , even unto death .
66012012	Because of this , rejoice , O heavens , and all who dwell within it . Woe to the earth and to the sea ! For the devil has descended to you , holding great anger , knowing that he has little time . ”
66012013	And after the dragon saw that he had been thrown down to the earth , he pursued the woman who brought forth the male child .
66012014	And the two wings of a great eagle were given to the woman , so that she might fly away , into the desert , to her place , where she is being nourished for a time , and times , and half a time , from the face of the serpent .
66012015	And the serpent sent out from his mouth , after the woman , water like a river , so that he might cause her to be carried away by the river .
66012016	But the earth assisted the woman . And the earth opened her mouth and absorbed the river , which the dragon sent out from his mouth .
66012017	And the dragon was angry at the woman . And so he went away to do battle with the remainder of her offspring , those who keep the commandments of God and who hold to the testimony of Jesus Christ .
66013001	And he stood upon the sand of the sea . And I saw a beast ascending from the sea , having seven heads and ten horns , and upon its horns were ten diadems , and upon its heads were names of blasphemy .
66013002	And the beast that I saw was similar to a leopard , and its feet were like the feet of a bear , and its mouth was like the mouth of a lion . And the dragon gave his own power and great authority to it .
66013003	And I saw that one of its heads seemed to be slain unto death , but his deadly wound was healed . And the entire world was in wonder following the beast .
66013004	And they worshiped the dragon , who gave authority to the beast . And they worshiped the beast , saying : “ Who is like the beast ? And who would be able to fight with it ? ”
66013005	And there was given to it a mouth , speaking great things and blasphemies . And authority was given to him to act for forty-two months .
66013006	And he opened his mouth in blasphemies against God , to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle and those who dwell in heaven .
66013007	And it was given to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them . And authority was given to him over every tribe and people and language and nation .
66013008	And all who inhabit the earth worshiped the beast , those whose names have not been written , from the origin of the world , in the Book of Life of the Lamb who was slain .
66013009	If anyone has an ear , let him hear .
66013010	Whoever will be led into captivity , into captivity he goes . Whoever will kill with the sword , with the sword he must be killed . Here is the patient endurance and faith of the Saints .
66013011	And I saw another beast ascending from the land . And she had two horns like the Lamb , but she was speaking like the dragon .
66013012	And she acted with all the authority of the first beast in his sight . And she caused the earth , and those dwelling in it , to worship the first beast , whose deadly wound was healed .
66013013	And she accomplished great signs , even so that she would cause fire to descend from the sky to the earth in the sight of men .
66013014	And she seduced those living on the earth , by means of the signs that were given to her to perform in the sight of the beast , saying to those dwelling on the earth that they should make an image of the beast who had a wound of the sword and yet lived .
66013015	And it was given to her to give a spirit to the image of the beast , so that the image of the beast would speak . And she acted so that whoever would not worship the image of the beast would be slain .
66013016	And she will cause everyone , small and great , wealthy and poor , free and servant , to have a character on their right hand or on their foreheads ,
66013017	so that no one may buy or sell , unless he has the character , or the name of the beast , or the number of his name .
66013018	Here is wisdom . Whoever has intelligence , let him determine the number of the beast . For it is the number of a man , and his number is six hundred and sixty-six .
66014001	And I saw , and behold , the Lamb was standing above mount Zion , and with him were one hundred and forty-four thousand , having his name and the name of his Father written on their foreheads .
66014002	And I heard a voice from heaven , like the voice of many waters , and like the voice of a great thunder . And the voice that I heard was like that of singers , while playing on their stringed instruments .
66014003	And they were singing what seemed like a new canticle before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders . And no one was able to recite the canticle , except those one hundred and forty-four thousand , who were redeemed from the earth .
66014004	These are the ones who were not defiled with women , for they are Virgins . These follow the Lamb wherever he will go . These were redeemed from men as the first-fruits for God and for the Lamb .
66014005	And in their mouth , no lie was found , for they are without flaw before the throne of God .
66014006	And I saw another Angel , flying through the midst of heaven , holding the eternal Gospel , so as to evangelize those sitting upon the earth and those of every nation and tribe and language and people ,
66014007	saying with a loud voice : “ Fear the Lord , and give honor to him , for the hour of his judgment has arrived . And worship him who made heaven and earth , the sea and the sources of water . ”
66014008	And another Angel followed , saying : “ Fallen , fallen is Babylon the great , who inebriated all nations with the wine of her wrath and of fornication . ”
66014009	And the third Angel followed them , saying with a great voice : “ If anyone has worshiped the beast , or his image , or has received his character on his forehead or on his hand ,
66014010	he shall drink also from the wine of the wrath of God , which has been mixed with strong wine in the cup of his wrath , and he shall be tortured with fire and sulphur in the sight of the holy Angels and before the sight of the Lamb .
66014011	And the smoke of their torments shall ascend forever and ever . And they shall have no rest , day or night , those who have worshiped the beast or his image , or who have received the character of his name . ”
66014012	Here is the patient endurance of the Saints , those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus .
66014013	And I heard a voice from heaven , saying to me : “ Write : Blessed are the dead , who die in the Lord , now and hereafter , says the Spirit , so that they may find rest from their labors . For their works follow them . ”
66014014	And I saw , and behold , a white cloud . And upon the cloud was one sitting , resembling a son of man , having a crown of gold on his head , and a sharp sickle in his hand .
66014015	And another Angel went forth from the temple , crying out in a great voice to the one sitting upon the cloud : “ Send out your sickle and reap ! For the hour of reaping has arrived , because the harvest of the earth has ripened . ”
66014016	And the one who was sitting upon the cloud sent out his sickle to the earth , and the earth was reaped .
66014017	And another Angel went forth from the temple that is in heaven ; he also had a sharp sickle .
66014018	And another Angel went forth from the altar , who held power over fire . And he cried out in a great voice to him who held the sharp sickle , saying : “ Send out your sharp sickle , and harvest the clusters of grapes from the vineyard of the earth , because its grapes have matured . ”
66014019	And the Angel sent out his sharp sickle to the earth , and he harvested the vineyard of the earth , and he cast it into the great basin of the wrath of God .
66014020	And the basin was trodden beyond the city , and blood went forth from the basin , even as high as the harnesses of horses , out to one thousand six hundred stadia .
66015001	And I saw another sign in heaven , great and wondrous : seven Angels , holding the seven last afflictions . For with them , the wrath of God is completed .
66015002	And I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire . And those who had overcome the beast and his image and the number of his name , were standing upon the sea of glass , holding the harps of God ,
66015003	and singing the canticle of Moses , the servant of God , and the canticle of the Lamb , saying : “ Great and wondrous are your works , Lord God Almighty . Just and true are your ways , King of all ages .
66015004	Who shall not fear you , O Lord , and magnify your name ? For you alone are blessed . For all nations shall approach and adore in your sight , because your judgments are manifest . ”
66015005	And after these things , I saw , and behold , the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened .
66015006	And the seven Angels went forth from the temple , holding the seven afflictions , clothed with clean white linen , and girded around the chest with wide golden belts .
66015007	And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven Angels seven golden bowls , filled with the wrath of God , of the One who lives forever and ever .
66015008	And the temple was filled with smoke from the majesty of God and from his power . And no one was able to enter into the temple , until the seven afflictions of the seven Angels were completed .
66016001	And I heard a great voice from the temple , saying to the seven Angels : “ Go forth and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath of God upon the earth . ”
66016002	And the first Angel went forth and poured out his bowl upon the earth . And a severe and most grievous wound occurred upon the men who had the character of the beast , and upon those who adored the beast or its image .
66016003	And the second Angel poured out his bowl upon the sea . And it became like the blood of the dead , and every living creature in the sea died .
66016004	And the third Angel poured out his bowl upon the rivers and the sources of water , and these became blood .
66016005	And I heard the Angel of the waters saying : “ You are just , O Lord , who is and who was : the Holy One who has judged these things .
66016006	For they have shed the blood of the Saints and the Prophets , and so you have given them blood to drink . For they deserve this . ”
66016007	And from the altar , I heard another one , saying , “ Even now , O Lord God Almighty , your judgments are true and just . ”
66016008	And the fourth Angel poured out his bowl upon the sun . And it was given to him to afflict men with heat and fire .
66016009	And men were scorched by the great heat , and they blasphemed the name of God , who holds power over these afflictions , but they did not repent , so as to give him glory .
66016010	And the fifth Angel poured out his bowl upon the throne of the beast . And his kingdom became darkened , and they gnawed at their tongues out of anguish .
66016011	And they blasphemed the God of heaven , because of their anguish and wounds , but they did not repent from their works .
66016012	And the sixth Angel poured out his bowl upon that great river Euphrates . And its water dried up , so that a way might be prepared for the kings from the rising of the sun .
66016013	And I saw , from the mouth of the dragon , and from the mouth of the beast , and from the mouth of the false prophetess , three unclean spirits go out in the manner of frogs .
66016014	For these are the spirits of the demons that were causing the signs . And they advance to the kings of the entire earth , to gather them for battle on the great day of Almighty God .
66016015	“ Behold , I arrive like a thief . Blessed is he who is vigilant and who preserves his vestment , lest he walk naked and they see his disgrace . ”
66016016	And he shall gather them together at a place which is called , in Hebrew , Armageddon .
66016017	And the seventh Angel poured out his bowl upon the air . And a great voice went out of the temple from the throne , saying : “ It is done . ”
66016018	And there were lightnings and voices and thunders . And a great earthquake occurred , of a kind such as has never happened since men have been upon the earth , so great was this kind of earthquake .
66016019	And the Great City became divided into three parts . And the cities of the Gentiles fell . And Babylon the great came to mind before God , to give her the cup of the wine of the indignation of his wrath .
66016020	And every island fled away , and the mountains were not found .
66016021	And hail as heavy as a talent descended from the sky upon men . And men blasphemed God , because of the affliction of the hail , for it was exceedingly great .
66017001	And one of the seven Angels , those who hold the seven bowls , approached and spoke with me , saying : “ Come , I will show you the condemnation of the great harlot , who sits upon many waters .
66017002	With her , the kings of the earth have fornicated . And those who inhabit the earth have been inebriated by the wine of her prostitution . ”
66017003	And he carried me away in spirit to the desert . And I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet beast , filled with names of blasphemy , having seven heads and ten horns .
66017004	And the woman was clothed all around with purple and scarlet , and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls , holding a golden cup in her hand , filled with the abomination and with the filth of her fornication .
66017005	And a name was written upon her forehead : Mystery , Babylon the great , the mother of the fornications and the abominations of the earth .
66017006	And I saw that the woman was inebriated from the blood of the saints and from the blood of the martyrs of Jesus . And I was amazed , when I had seen her , with a great wonder .
66017007	And the Angel said to me : “ Why do you wonder ? I will tell you the mystery of the woman , and of the beast that carries her , which has seven heads and ten horns .
66017008	The beast that you saw , was , and is not , and is soon to ascend from the abyss . And he goes forth unto destruction . And the inhabitants upon the earth ( those whose names have not been written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world ) shall be amazed upon seeing the beast who was and is not .
66017009	And this is for one who understands , who has wisdom : the seven heads are seven mountains , upon which the woman sits , and they are seven kings .
66017010	Five have fallen , one is , and the other has not yet arrived . And when he arrives , he must remain for a brief time .
66017011	And the beast who was , and is not , the same is also the eighth , and he is of the seven , and he goes forth unto destruction .
66017012	And the ten horns that you saw are ten kings ; these have not yet received a kingdom , but they shall receive authority , as if they were kings , for one hour , after the beast .
66017013	These hold to one plan , and they shall hand over their power and authority to the beast .
66017014	These shall fight against the Lamb , and the Lamb shall conquer them . For he is the Lord of lords and the King of kings . And those who are with him are called , and chosen , and faithful . ”
66017015	And he said to me : “ The waters that you saw , where the harlot sits , are peoples and nations and languages .
66017016	And the ten horns that you saw on the beast , these shall hate the woman who fornicates , and they shall make her desolate and naked , and they shall chew her flesh , and they shall burn her completely with fire .
66017017	For God has granted to their hearts that they may do to her whatever is pleasing , so that they may give their kingdom to the beast , until the words of God may be completed .
66017018	And the woman that you saw is the great City , which holds a kingdom above that of the kings of the earth . ”
66018001	And after these things , I saw another Angel , descending from heaven , having great authority . And the earth was illuminated by his glory .
66018002	And he cried out with strength , saying : “ Fallen , fallen is Babylon the great . And she has become the habitation of demons , and the keepsake of every unclean spirit , and the possession of every unclean and hateful flying thing .
66018003	For all the nations have imbibed the wine of the wrath of her fornication . And the kings of the earth have fornicated with her . And the merchants of the earth have become wealthy by the power of her pleasures . ”
66018004	And I heard another voice from heaven , saying : “ Go away from her , my people , so that you may not be participants in her pleasures , and so that you may not be recipients of her afflictions .
66018005	For her sins have pierced through even to heaven , and the Lord has remembered her iniquities .
66018006	Render to her , as she has also rendered to you . And repay her doubly , according to her works . Mix for her a double portion , in the cup with which she mixed .
66018007	As much as she has glorified herself and lived in pleasure , so much so give to her torment and grief . For in her heart , she has said : ‘ I am enthroned as queen , ’ and , ‘ I am not a widow , ’ and , ‘ I shall not see sorrow . ’
66018008	For this reason , her afflictions shall arrive in one day : death and grief and famine . And she shall be burned with fire . For God , who will judge her , is strong .
66018009	And the kings of the earth , who have fornicated with her and lived in luxury , shall weep and mourn for themselves over her , when they see the smoke of her conflagration ,
66018010	standing far away , out of fear of her torments , saying : ‘ Woe ! Woe ! to Babylon , that great city , that strong city . For in one hour , your judgment has arrived . ’
66018011	And the businessmen of the earth shall weep and mourn over her , because no one will buy their merchandise anymore :
66018012	merchandise of gold and silver and precious stones and pearls , and of fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet , and of every citrus tree wood , and of every tool of ivory , and of every tool from precious stone and brass and iron and marble ,
66018013	and of cinnamon and black cardamom , and of fragrances and ointments and incense , and of wine and oil and fine flour and wheat , and of beasts of burden and sheep and horses and four-wheeled wagons , and of slaves and the souls of men .
66018014	And the fruits of the desires of your soul have gone away from you . And all things fat and splendid have perished from you . And they shall never find these things again .
66018015	The merchants of these things , who were made wealthy , shall stand far away from her , out of fear of her torments , weeping and mourning ,
66018016	and saying : ‘ Woe ! Woe ! to that great city , which was clothed with fine linen and purple and scarlet , and which was adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls . ’
66018017	For such great wealth was brought to destitution in one hour . And every shipmaster , and all who navigate on lakes , and mariners , and those who work at sea , stood far away .
66018018	And they cried out , seeing the place of her conflagration , saying : ‘ What city resembles this great city ? ’
66018019	And they cast dust upon their heads . And they cried out , weeping and mourning , saying : ‘ Woe ! Woe ! to that great city , by which all who had ships at sea were made rich from her treasures . For she has been made desolate in one hour .
66018020	Exult over her , O heaven , O holy Apostles and Prophets . For God has judged your judgment upon her . ’ ”
66018021	And a certain strong Angel took up a stone , similar to a great millstone , and he cast it into the sea , saying : “ With this force shall Babylon , that great city , be cast down . And she shall never be found again .
66018022	And the sound of singers , and musicians , and flute and trumpet players shall not be heard in you again . And every artisan of every art shall not be found in you again . And the sound of the mill shall not be heard in you again .
66018023	And the light of the lamp shall not shine in you again . And the voice of the groom and of the bride shall not be heard in you anymore . For your merchants were the leaders of the earth . For all the nations were led astray by your drugs .
66018024	And in her was found the blood of the Prophets and of the Saints , and of all who were slain upon the earth . ”
66019001	After these things , I heard something like the voice of many multitudes in heaven , saying : “ Alleluia ! Praise and glory and power is for our God .
66019002	For true and just are his judgments , he who has judged the great harlot that corrupted the earth by her prostitution . And he has vindicated the blood of his servants from her hands . ”
66019003	And again , they said : “ Alleluia ! For her smoke ascends forever and ever . ”
66019004	And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God , sitting upon the throne , saying : “ Amen ! Alleluia ! ”
66019005	And a voice went out from the throne , saying : “ Express praise to our God , all you his servants , and you who fear him , small and great . ”
66019006	And I heard something like the voice of a great multitude , and like the voice of many waters , and like the voice of great thunders , saying : “ Alleluia ! For the Lord our God , the Almighty , has reigned .
66019007	Let us be glad and exult . And let us give glory to him . For the marriage feast of the Lamb has arrived , and his wife has prepared herself . ”
66019008	And it was granted to her that she should cover herself with fine linen , splendid and white . For the fine linen is the justifications of the Saints .
66019009	And he said to me : “ Write : Blessed are those who have been called to the wedding feast of the Lamb . ” And he said to me , “ These words of God are true . ”
66019010	And I fell down before his feet , to adore him . And he said to me : “ Be careful not to do so . I am your fellow servant , and I am among your brothers , who hold to the testimony of Jesus . Adore God . For the testimony of Jesus is a spirit of prophecy . ”
66019011	And I saw heaven opened , and behold , a white horse . And he who was sitting upon it was called Faithful and True . And with justice does he judge and fight .
66019012	And his eyes are like a flame of fire , and on his head are many diadems , having a name written , which no one knows except himself .
66019013	And he was clothed with a vestment sprinkled with blood . And his name is called : THE WORD OF GOD .
66019014	And the armies that are in heaven were following him on white horses , clothed in fine linen , white and clean .
66019015	And from his mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword , so that with it he may strike the nations . And he shall rule them with an iron rod . And he treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God Almighty .
66019016	And he has on his garment and on his thigh written : KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS .
66019017	And I saw a certain Angel , standing in the sun . And he cried out with a great voice , saying to all the birds that were flying through the midst of the sky , “ Come and gather together for the great supper of God ,
66019018	so that you may eat the flesh of kings , and the flesh of tribunes , and the flesh of the strong , and the flesh of horses and those sitting on them , and the flesh of all : free and servant , small and great . ”
66019019	And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies , having been gathered together to do battle against him who was sitting upon the horse , and against his army .
66019020	And the beast was apprehended , and with him the false prophetess , who in his presence caused the signs , by which she seduced those who accepted the character of the beast and who worshiped his image . These two were cast alive into the pool of fire burning with sulphur .
66019021	And the others were slain by the sword that proceeds from the mouth of him who was sitting upon the horse . And all the birds were sated with their flesh .
66020001	And I saw an Angel , descending from heaven , holding in his hand the key of the abyss and a great chain .
66020002	And he apprehended the dragon , the ancient serpent , who is the devil and Satan , and he bound him for a thousand years .
66020003	And he cast him into the abyss , and he closed and sealed it , so that he would no longer seduce the nations , until the thousand years are completed . And after these things , he must be released for a brief time .
66020004	And I saw thrones . And they sat upon them . And judgment was given to them . And the souls of those beheaded because of the testimony of Jesus and because of the Word of God , and who did not adore the beast , nor his image , nor accept his character on their foreheads or on their hands : they lived and they reigned with Christ for a thousand years .
66020005	The rest of the dead did not live , until the thousand years are completed . This is the First Resurrection .
66020006	Blessed and holy is he who takes part in the First Resurrection . Over these the second death has no power . But they shall be priests of God and of Christ , and they shall reign with him for a thousand years .
66020007	And when the thousand years will have been completed , Satan shall be released from his prison , and he will go out and seduce the nations which are upon the four quarters of the earth , Gog and Magog . And he will gather them together for battle , those whose number is like the sand of the sea .
66020008	And they climbed across the breadth of the earth , and they encompassed the camp of the Saints and the Beloved City .
66020009	And fire from God descended from heaven and devoured them . And the devil , who seduced them , was cast into the pool of fire and sulphur ,
66020010	where both the beast and the false prophetess shall be tortured , day and night , forever and ever .
66020011	And I saw a great white throne , and One sitting upon it , from whose sight earth and heaven fled , and no place was found for them .
66020012	And I saw the dead , great and small , standing in view of the throne . And books were opened . And another Book was opened , which is the Book of Life . And the dead were judged by those things that had been written in the books , according to their works .
66020013	And the sea gave up the dead who were in it . And death and Hell gave up their dead who were in them . And they were judged , each one according to his works .
66020014	And Hell and death were cast into the pool of fire . This is the second death .
66020015	And whoever was not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the pool of fire .
66021001	I saw the new heaven and the new earth . For the first heaven and the first earth passed away , and the sea is no more .
66021002	And I , John , saw the Holy City , the New Jerusalem , descending out of heaven from God , prepared like a bride adorned for her husband .
66021003	And I heard a great voice from the throne , saying : “ Behold the tabernacle of God with men . And he will dwell with them , and they will be his people . And God himself will be their God with them .
66021004	And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes . And death shall be no more . And neither mourning , nor crying out , nor grief shall be anymore . For the first things have passed away . ”
66021005	And the One who was sitting upon the throne , said , “ Behold , I make all things new . ” And he said to me , “ Write , for these words are entirely faithful and true . ”
66021006	And he said to me : “ It is done . I am the Alpha and the Omega , the Beginning and the End . To those who thirst , I will give freely from the fountain of the water of life .
66021007	Whoever prevails shall possess these things . And I will be his God , and he shall be my son .
66021008	But the fearful , and the unbelieving , and the abominable , and murderers , and fornicators , and drug users , and idolaters , and all liars , these shall be a part of the pool burning with fire and sulphur , which is the second death . ”
66021009	And one of the seven Angels , those holding the bowls filled with the seven last afflictions , approached and spoke with me , saying : “ Come , and I will show you the bride , the wife of the Lamb . ”
66021010	And he took me up in spirit to a great and high mountain . And he showed me the Holy City Jerusalem , descending out of heaven from God ,
66021011	having the glory of God . And its light was like that of a precious stone , even like that of the jasper stone or like crystal .
66021012	And it had a wall , great and high , having twelve gates . And at the gates were twelve Angels . And names were written upon them , which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel .
66021013	On the East were three gates , and on the North were three gates , and on the South were three gates , and on the West were three gates .
66021014	And the wall of the City had twelve foundations . And upon them were the twelve names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb .
66021015	And he who was speaking with me was holding a golden measuring reed , in order to measure the City , and its gates and wall .
66021016	And the city is laid out as a square , and so its length is as great as the width . And he measured the city with the golden reed for twelve thousand stadia , and its length and height and breadth were equal .
66021017	And he measured its wall as one hundred and forty-four cubits , the measure of a man , which is of an Angel .
66021018	And the structure of its wall was of jasper stone . Yet truly , the city itself was of pure gold , similar to pure glass .
66021019	And the foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every kind of precious stone . The first foundation was of jasper , the second was of sapphire , the third was of chalcedony , the fourth was of emerald ,
66021020	the fifth was of sardonyx , the sixth was of sardius , the seventh was of chrysolite , the eighth was of beryl , the ninth was of topaz , the tenth was of chrysoprasus , the eleventh was of jacinth , the twelfth was of amethyst .
66021021	And the twelve gates are twelve pearls , one for each , so that each gate was made from a single pearl . And the main street of the city was of pure gold , similar to transparent glass .
66021022	And I saw no temple in it . For the Lord God Almighty is its temple , and the Lamb .
66021023	And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine in it . For the glory of God has illuminated it , and the Lamb is its lamp .
66021024	And the nations shall walk by its light . And the kings of the earth shall bring their glory and honor into it .
66021025	And its gates shall not be closed throughout the day , for there shall be no night in that place .
66021026	And they shall bring the glory and honor of the nations into it .
66021027	There shall not enter into it anything defiled , nor anything causing an abomination , nor anything false , but only those who have been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb .
66022001	And he showed me the river of the water of life , shining like crystal , proceeding from the throne of God and of the Lamb .
66022002	In the midst of its main street , and on both sides of the river , was the Tree of Life , bearing twelve fruits , offering one fruit for each month , and the leaves of the tree are for the health of the nations .
66022003	And every curse shall be no more . But the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it , and his servants shall serve him .
66022004	And they shall see his face . And his name shall be on their foreheads .
66022005	And night shall be no more . And they will not need the light of a lamp , nor the light of the sun , because the Lord God will illuminate them . And they shall reign forever and ever .
66022006	And he said to me : “ These words are entirely faithful and true . ” And the Lord , the God of the spirits of the prophets , sent his Angel to reveal to his servant what must occur soon :
66022007	“ For behold , I am approaching quickly ! Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book . ”
66022008	And I , John , heard and saw these things . And , after I had heard and seen , I fell down , so as to adore before the feet of the Angel , who was revealing these things to me .
66022009	And he said to me : “ Be careful not to do so . For I am your fellow servant , and I am among your brothers the prophets , and among those who keep the words of the prophecy of this book . Adore God . ”
66022010	And he said to me : “ Do not seal the words of the prophecy of this book . For the time is near .
66022011	Whoever does harm , he might still do harm . And whoever is filthy , he might still be filthy . And whoever is just , he may still be just . And one who is holy , he may still be holy . ”
66022012	“ Behold , I am approaching quickly ! And my repayment is with me , to render to each one according to his works .
66022013	I am the Alpha and the Omega , the First and the Last , the Beginning and the End . ”
66022014	Blessed are those who wash their robes in the blood of the Lamb . So may they have a right to the tree of life ; so may they enter through the gates into the City .
66022015	Outside are dogs , and drug users , and homosexuals , and murderers , and those who serve idols , and all who love and do what is false .
66022016	“ I , Jesus , have sent my Angel , to testify to these things for you among the Churches . I am the Root and the Origin of David , the bright morning Star . ”
66022017	And the Spirit and the Bride say : “ Draw near . ” And whoever hears , let him say : “ Draw near . ” And whoever thirsts , let him draw near . And whoever is willing , let him accept the water of life , freely .
66022018	For I call as witnesses all listeners of the words of the prophecy of this book . If anyone will have added to these , God will add upon him the afflictions written in this book .
66022019	And if anyone will have taken away from the words of the book of this prophecy , God will take away his portion from the Book of Life , and from the Holy City , and from these things which have been written in this book .
66022020	He who offers testimony to these things , says : “ Even now , I am approaching quickly . ” Amen . Come , Lord Jesus .
66022021	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all . Amen .
