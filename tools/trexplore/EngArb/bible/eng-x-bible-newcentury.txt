40001005	Salmon was the father of Boaz . ( Boaz’s mother was Rahab . ) Boaz was the father of Obed . ( Obed’s mother was Ruth . ) Obed was the father of Jesse .
40001006	Jesse was the father of King David . David was the father of Solomon . ( Solomon’s mother had been Uriah’s wife . )
40001007	Solomon was the father of Rehoboam . Rehoboam was the father of Abijah . Abijah was the father of Asa .
40001008	Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat . Jehoshaphat was the father of Jehoram . Jehoram was the ancestor of Uzziah .
40001009	Uzziah was the father of Jotham . Jotham was the father of Ahaz . Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah .
40001010	Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh . Manasseh was the father of Amon . Amon was the father of Josiah .
40001011	Josiah was the grandfather of Jehoiachin and his brothers . ( This was at the time that the people were taken to Babylon . )
40001012	After they were taken to Babylon : Jehoiachin was the father of Shealtiel . Shealtiel was the grandfather of Zerubbabel .
40001013	Zerubbabel was the father of Abiud . Abiud was the father of Eliakim . Eliakim was the father of Azor .
40001014	Azor was the father of Zadok . Zadok was the father of Akim . Akim was the father of Eliud .
40001015	Eliud was the father of Eleazar . Eleazar was the father of Matthan . Matthan was the father of Jacob .
40001016	Jacob was the father of Joseph . Joseph was the husband of Mary , and Mary was the mother of Jesus . Jesus is called the Christ .
40001017	So there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David . And there were fourteen generations from David until the people were taken to Babylon . And there were fourteen generations from the time when the people were taken to Babylon until Christ was born .
40001018	This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about . His mother Mary was engaged to marry Joseph , but before they married , she learned she was pregnant by the power of the Holy Spirit .
40001019	Because Mary’s husband , Joseph , was a good man , he did not want to disgrace her in public , so he planned to divorce her secretly .
40001020	While Joseph thought about these things , an angel of the Lord came to him in a dream . The angel said , “ Joseph , descendant of David , don’t be afraid to take Mary as your wife , because the baby in her is from the Holy Spirit .
40001021	She will give birth to a son , and you will name him Jesus , because he will save his people from their sins . ”
40001022	All this happened to bring about what the Lord had said through the prophet :
40001023	“ The virgin will be pregnant . She will have a son , and they will name him Immanuel , ” which means “ God is with us . ”
40001024	When Joseph woke up , he did what the Lord’s angel had told him to do . Joseph took Mary as his wife ,
40001025	but he did not have sexual relations with her until she gave birth to the son . And Joseph named him Jesus .
40002001	Jesus was born in the town of Bethlehem in Judea during the time when Herod was king . When Jesus was born , some wise men from the east came to Jerusalem .
40002002	They asked , “ Where is the baby who was born to be the king of the Jews ? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him . ”
40002003	When King Herod heard this , he was troubled , as were all the people in Jerusalem .
40002004	Herod called a meeting of all the leading priests and teachers of the law and asked them where the Christ would be born .
40002005	They answered , “ In the town of Bethlehem in Judea . The prophet wrote about this in the Scriptures :
40002006	‘ But you , Bethlehem , in the land of Judah , are not just an insignificant village in Judah . A ruler will come from you who will be like a shepherd for my people Israel . ’ ”
40002007	Then Herod had a secret meeting with the wise men and learned from them the exact time they first saw the star .
40002008	He sent the wise men to Bethlehem , saying , “ Look carefully for the child . When you find him , come tell me so I can worship him too . ”
40002009	After the wise men heard the king , they left . The star that they had seen in the east went before them until it stopped above the place where the child was .
40002010	When the wise men saw the star , they were filled with joy .
40002011	They came to the house where the child was and saw him with his mother , Mary , and they bowed down and worshiped him . They opened their gifts and gave him treasures of gold , frankincense , and myrrh .
40002012	But God warned the wise men in a dream not to go back to Herod , so they returned to their own country by a different way .
40002013	After they left , an angel of the Lord came to Joseph in a dream and said , “ Get up ! Take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt , because Herod is starting to look for the child so he can kill him . Stay in Egypt until I tell you to return . ”
40002014	So Joseph got up and left for Egypt during the night with the child and his mother .
40002015	And Joseph stayed in Egypt until Herod died . This happened to bring about what the Lord had said through the prophet : “ I called my son out of Egypt . ”
40002016	When Herod saw that the wise men had tricked him , he was furious . So he gave an order to kill all the baby boys in Bethlehem and in the surrounding area who were two years old or younger . This was in keeping with the time he learned from the wise men .
40002017	So what God had said through the prophet Jeremiah came true :
40002018	“ A voice was heard in Ramah of painful crying and deep sadness : Rachel crying for her children . She refused to be comforted , because her children are dead . ”
40002019	After Herod died , an angel of the Lord spoke to Joseph in a dream while he was in Egypt .
40002020	The angel said , “ Get up ! Take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel , because the people who were trying to kill the child are now dead . ”
40002021	So Joseph took the child and his mother and went to Israel .
40002022	But he heard that Archelaus was now king in Judea since his father Herod had died . So Joseph was afraid to go there . After being warned in a dream , he went to the area of Galilee ,
40002023	to a town called Nazareth , and lived there . And so what God had said through the prophets came true : “ He will be called a Nazarene . ”
40003001	About that time John the Baptist began preaching in the desert area of Judea .
40003002	John said , “ Change your hearts and lives because the kingdom of heaven is near . ”
40003003	John the Baptist is the one Isaiah the prophet was talking about when he said : “ This is a voice of one who calls out in the desert : ‘ Prepare the way for the Lord . Make the road straight for him . ’ ”
40003004	John’s clothes were made from camel’s hair , and he wore a leather belt around his waist . For food , he ate locusts and wild honey .
40003005	Many people came from Jerusalem and Judea and all the area around the Jordan River to hear John .
40003006	They confessed their sins , and he baptized them in the Jordan River .
40003007	Many of the Pharisees and Sadducees came to the place where John was baptizing people . When John saw them , he said , “ You are snakes ! Who warned you to run away from God’s coming punishment ?
40003008	Do the things that show you really have changed your hearts and lives .
40003009	And don’t think you can say to yourselves , ‘ Abraham is our father . ’ I tell you that God could make children for Abraham from these rocks .
40003010	The ax is now ready to cut down the trees , and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire .
40003011	“ I baptize you with water to show that your hearts and lives have changed . But there is one coming after me who is greater than I am , whose sandals I am not good enough to carry . He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire .
40003012	He will come ready to clean the grain , separating the good grain from the chaff . He will put the good part of the grain into his barn , but he will burn the chaff with a fire that cannot be put out . ”
40003013	At that time Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River and wanted John to baptize him .
40003014	But John tried to stop him , saying , “ Why do you come to me to be baptized ? I need to be baptized by you ! ”
40003015	Jesus answered , “ Let it be this way for now . We should do all things that are God’s will . ” So John agreed to baptize Jesus .
40003016	As soon as Jesus was baptized , he came up out of the water . Then heaven opened , and he saw God’s Spirit coming down on him like a dove .
40003017	And a voice from heaven said , “ This is my Son , whom I love , and I am very pleased with him . ”
40004001	Then the Spirit led Jesus into the desert to be tempted by the devil .
40004002	Jesus fasted for forty days and nights . After this , he was very hungry .
40004003	The devil came to Jesus to tempt him , saying , “ If you are the Son of God , tell these rocks to become bread . ”
40004004	Jesus answered , “ It is written in the Scriptures , ‘ A person lives not on bread alone , but by everything God says . ’ ”
40004005	Then the devil led Jesus to the holy city of Jerusalem and put him on a high place of the Temple .
40004006	The devil said , “ If you are the Son of God , jump down , because it is written in the Scriptures : ‘ He has put his angels in charge of you . They will catch you in their hands so that you will not hit your foot on a rock . ’ ”
40004007	Jesus answered him , “ It also says in the Scriptures , ‘ Do not test the Lord your God . ’ ”
40004008	Then the devil led Jesus to the top of a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and all their splendor .
40004009	The devil said , “ If you will bow down and worship me , I will give you all these things . ”
40004010	Jesus said to the devil , “ Go away from me , Satan ! It is written in the Scriptures , ‘ You must worship the Lord your God and serve only him . ’ ”
40004011	So the devil left Jesus , and angels came and took care of him .
40004012	When Jesus heard that John had been put in prison , he went back to Galilee .
40004013	He left Nazareth and went to live in Capernaum , a town near Lake Galilee , in the area near Zebulun and Naphtali .
40004014	Jesus did this to bring about what the prophet Isaiah had said :
40004015	“ Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali along the sea , beyond the Jordan River . This is Galilee where the non-Jewish people live .
40004016	These people who live in darkness will see a great light . They live in a place covered with the shadows of death , but a light will shine on them . ”
40004017	From that time Jesus began to preach , saying , “ Change your hearts and lives , because the kingdom of heaven is near . ”
40004018	As Jesus was walking by Lake Galilee , he saw two brothers , Simon ( called Peter ) and his brother Andrew . They were throwing a net into the lake because they were fishermen .
40004019	Jesus said , “ Come follow me , and I will make you fish for people . ”
40004020	So Simon and Andrew immediately left their nets and followed him .
40004021	As Jesus continued walking by Lake Galilee , he saw two other brothers , James and John , the sons of Zebedee . They were in a boat with their father Zebedee , mending their nets . Jesus told them to come with him .
40004022	Immediately they left the boat and their father , and they followed Jesus .
40004023	Jesus went everywhere in Galilee , teaching in the synagogues , preaching the Good News about the kingdom of heaven , and healing all the people’s diseases and sicknesses .
40004024	The news about Jesus spread all over Syria , and people brought all the sick to him . They were suffering from different kinds of diseases . Some were in great pain , some had demons , some were epileptics , and some were paralyzed . Jesus healed all of them .
40004025	Many people from Galilee , the Ten Towns , Jerusalem , Judea , and the land across the Jordan River followed him .
40005001	When Jesus saw the crowds , he went up on a hill and sat down . His followers came to him ,
40005002	and he began to teach them , saying :
40005003	“ They are blessed who realize their spiritual poverty , for the kingdom of heaven belongs to them .
40005004	They are blessed who grieve , for God will comfort them .
40005005	They are blessed who are humble , for the whole earth will be theirs .
40005006	They are blessed who hunger and thirst after justice , for they will be satisfied .
40005007	They are blessed who show mercy to others , for God will show mercy to them .
40005008	They are blessed whose thoughts are pure , for they will see God .
40005009	They are blessed who work for peace , for they will be called God’s children .
40005010	They are blessed who are persecuted for doing good , for the kingdom of heaven belongs to them .
40005011	“ People will insult you and hurt you . They will lie and say all kinds of evil things about you because you follow me . But when they do , you will be blessed .
40005012	Rejoice and be glad , because you have a great reward waiting for you in heaven . People did the same evil things to the prophets who lived before you .
40005013	“ You are the salt of the earth . But if the salt loses its salty taste , it cannot be made salty again . It is good for nothing , except to be thrown out and walked on .
40005014	“ You are the light that gives light to the world . A city that is built on a hill cannot be hidden .
40005015	And people don’t hide a light under a bowl . They put it on a lampstand so the light shines for all the people in the house .
40005016	In the same way , you should be a light for other people . Live so that they will see the good things you do and will praise your Father in heaven .
40005017	“ Don’t think that I have come to destroy the law of Moses or the teaching of the prophets . I have not come to destroy them but to bring about what they said .
40005018	I tell you the truth , nothing will disappear from the law until heaven and earth are gone . Not even the smallest letter or the smallest part of a letter will be lost until everything has happened .
40005019	Whoever refuses to obey any command and teaches other people not to obey that command will be the least important in the kingdom of heaven . But whoever obeys the commands and teaches other people to obey them will be great in the kingdom of heaven .
40005020	I tell you that if you are no more obedient than the teachers of the law and the Pharisees , you will never enter the kingdom of heaven .
40005021	“ You have heard that it was said to our people long ago , ‘ You must not murder anyone . Anyone who murders another will be judged . ’
40005022	But I tell you , if you are angry with a brother or sister , you will be judged . If you say bad things to a brother or sister , you will be judged by the council . And if you call someone a fool , you will be in danger of the fire of hell .
40005023	“ So when you offer your gift to God at the altar , and you remember that your brother or sister has something against you ,
40005024	leave your gift there at the altar . Go and make peace with that person , and then come and offer your gift .
40005025	“ If your enemy is taking you to court , become friends quickly , before you go to court . Otherwise , your enemy might turn you over to the judge , and the judge might give you to a guard to put you in jail .
40005026	I tell you the truth , you will not leave there until you have paid everything you owe .
40005027	“ You have heard that it was said , ‘ You must not be guilty of adultery . ’
40005028	But I tell you that if anyone looks at a woman and wants to sin sexually with her , in his mind he has already done that sin with the woman .
40005029	If your right eye causes you to sin , take it out and throw it away . It is better to lose one part of your body than to have your whole body thrown into hell .
40005030	If your right hand causes you to sin , cut it off and throw it away . It is better to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell .
40005031	“ It was also said , ‘ Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a written divorce paper . ’
40005032	But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife forces her to be guilty of adultery . The only reason for a man to divorce his wife is if she has sexual relations with another man . And anyone who marries that divorced woman is guilty of adultery .
40005033	“ You have heard that it was said to our people long ago , ‘ Don’t break your promises , but keep the promises you make to the Lord . ’
40005034	But I tell you , never swear an oath . Don’t swear an oath using the name of heaven , because heaven is God’s throne .
40005035	Don’t swear an oath using the name of the earth , because the earth belongs to God . Don’t swear an oath using the name of Jerusalem , because that is the city of the great King .
40005036	Don’t even swear by your own head , because you cannot make one hair on your head become white or black .
40005037	Say only yes if you mean yes , and no if you mean no . If you say more than yes or no , it is from the Evil One .
40005038	“ You have heard that it was said , ‘ An eye for an eye , and a tooth for a tooth . ’
40005039	But I tell you , don’t stand up against an evil person . If someone slaps you on the right cheek , turn to him the other cheek also .
40005040	If someone wants to sue you in court and take your shirt , let him have your coat also .
40005041	If someone forces you to go with him one mile , go with him two miles .
40005042	If a person asks you for something , give it to him . Don’t refuse to give to someone who wants to borrow from you .
40005043	“ You have heard that it was said , ‘ Love your neighbor and hate your enemies . ’
40005044	But I say to you , love your enemies . Pray for those who hurt you .
40005045	If you do this , you will be true children of your Father in heaven . He causes the sun to rise on good people and on evil people , and he sends rain to those who do right and to those who do wrong .
40005046	If you love only the people who love you , you will get no reward . Even the tax collectors do that .
40005047	And if you are nice only to your friends , you are no better than other people . Even those who don’t know God are nice to their friends .
40005048	So you must be perfect , just as your Father in heaven is perfect .
40006001	“ Be careful ! When you do good things , don’t do them in front of people to be seen by them . If you do that , you will have no reward from your Father in heaven .
40006002	“ When you give to the poor , don’t be like the hypocrites . They blow trumpets in the synagogues and on the streets so that people will see them and honor them . I tell you the truth , those hypocrites already have their full reward .
40006003	So when you give to the poor , don’t let anyone know what you are doing .
40006004	Your giving should be done in secret . Your Father can see what is done in secret , and he will reward you .
40006005	“ When you pray , don’t be like the hypocrites . They love to stand in the synagogues and on the street corners and pray so people will see them . I tell you the truth , they already have their full reward .
40006006	When you pray , you should go into your room and close the door and pray to your Father who cannot be seen . Your Father can see what is done in secret , and he will reward you .
40006007	“ And when you pray , don’t be like those people who don’t know God . They continue saying things that mean nothing , thinking that God will hear them because of their many words .
40006008	Don’t be like them , because your Father knows the things you need before you ask him .
40006009	So when you pray , you should pray like this : ‘ Our Father in heaven , may your name always be kept holy .
40006010	May your kingdom come and what you want be done , here on earth as it is in heaven .
40006011	Give us the food we need for each day .
40006012	Forgive us for our sins , just as we have forgiven those who sinned against us .
40006013	And do not cause us to be tempted , but save us from the Evil One . ’ [ The kingdom , the power , and the glory are yours forever . Amen . ]
40006014	Yes , if you forgive others for their sins , your Father in heaven will also forgive you for your sins .
40006015	But if you don’t forgive others , your Father in heaven will not forgive your sins .
40006016	“ When you fast , don’t put on a sad face like the hypocrites . They make their faces look sad to show people they are fasting . I tell you the truth , those hypocrites already have their full reward .
40006017	So when you fast , comb your hair and wash your face .
40006018	Then people will not know that you are fasting , but your Father , whom you cannot see , will see you . Your Father sees what is done in secret , and he will reward you .
40006019	“ Don’t store treasures for yourselves here on earth where moths and rust will destroy them and thieves can break in and steal them .
40006020	But store your treasures in heaven where they cannot be destroyed by moths or rust and where thieves cannot break in and steal them .
40006021	Your heart will be where your treasure is .
40006022	“ The eye is a light for the body . If your eyes are good , your whole body will be full of light .
40006023	But if your eyes are evil , your whole body will be full of darkness . And if the only light you have is really darkness , then you have the worst darkness .
40006024	“ No one can serve two masters . The person will hate one master and love the other , or will follow one master and refuse to follow the other . You cannot serve both God and worldly riches .
40006025	“ So I tell you , don’t worry about the food or drink you need to live , or about the clothes you need for your body . Life is more than food , and the body is more than clothes .
40006026	Look at the birds in the air . They don’t plant or harvest or store food in barns , but your heavenly Father feeds them . And you know that you are worth much more than the birds .
40006027	You cannot add any time to your life by worrying about it .
40006028	“ And why do you worry about clothes ? Look at how the lilies in the field grow . They don’t work or make clothes for themselves .
40006029	But I tell you that even Solomon with his riches was not dressed as beautifully as one of these flowers .
40006030	God clothes the grass in the field , which is alive today but tomorrow is thrown into the fire . So you can be even more sure that God will clothe you . Don’t have so little faith !
40006031	Don’t worry and say , ‘ What will we eat ? ’ or ‘ What will we drink ? ’ or ‘ What will we wear ? ’
40006032	The people who don’t know God keep trying to get these things , and your Father in heaven knows you need them .
40006033	Seek first God’s kingdom and what God wants . Then all your other needs will be met as well .
40006034	So don’t worry about tomorrow , because tomorrow will have its own worries . Each day has enough trouble of its own .
40007001	“ Don’t judge others , or you will be judged .
40007002	You will be judged in the same way that you judge others , and the amount you give to others will be given to you .
40007003	“ Why do you notice the little piece of dust in your friend’s eye , but you don’t notice the big piece of wood in your own eye ?
40007004	How can you say to your friend , ‘ Let me take that little piece of dust out of your eye ’ ? Look at yourself ! You still have that big piece of wood in your own eye .
40007005	You hypocrite ! First , take the wood out of your own eye . Then you will see clearly to take the dust out of your friend’s eye .
40007006	“ Don’t give holy things to dogs , and don’t throw your pearls before pigs . Pigs will only trample on them , and dogs will turn to attack you .
40007007	“ Ask , and God will give to you . Search , and you will find . Knock , and the door will open for you .
40007008	Yes , everyone who asks will receive . Everyone who searches will find . And everyone who knocks will have the door opened .
40007009	“ If your children ask for bread , which of you would give them a stone ?
40007010	Or if your children ask for a fish , would you give them a snake ?
40007011	Even though you are bad , you know how to give good gifts to your children . How much more your heavenly Father will give good things to those who ask him !
40007012	“ Do to others what you want them to do to you . This is the meaning of the law of Moses and the teaching of the prophets .
40007013	“ Enter through the narrow gate . The gate is wide and the road is wide that leads to hell , and many people enter through that gate .
40007014	But the gate is small and the road is narrow that leads to true life . Only a few people find that road .
40007015	“ Be careful of false prophets . They come to you looking gentle like sheep , but they are really dangerous like wolves .
40007016	You will know these people by what they do . Grapes don’t come from thornbushes , and figs don’t come from thorny weeds .
40007017	In the same way , every good tree produces good fruit , but a bad tree produces bad fruit .
40007018	A good tree cannot produce bad fruit , and a bad tree cannot produce good fruit .
40007019	Every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire .
40007020	In the same way , you will know these false prophets by what they do .
40007021	“ Not all those who say ‘ You are our Lord ’ will enter the kingdom of heaven . The only people who will enter the kingdom of heaven are those who do what my Father in heaven wants .
40007022	On the last day many people will say to me , ‘ Lord , Lord , we spoke for you , and through you we forced out demons and did many miracles . ’
40007023	Then I will tell them clearly , ‘ Get away from me , you who do evil . I never knew you . ’
40007024	“ Everyone who hears my words and obeys them is like a wise man who built his house on rock .
40007025	It rained hard , the floods came , and the winds blew and hit that house . But it did not fall , because it was built on rock .
40007026	Everyone who hears my words and does not obey them is like a foolish man who built his house on sand .
40007027	It rained hard , the floods came , and the winds blew and hit that house , and it fell with a big crash . ”
40007028	When Jesus finished saying these things , the people were amazed at his teaching ,
40007029	because he did not teach like their teachers of the law . He taught like a person who had authority .
40008001	When Jesus came down from the hill , great crowds followed him .
40008002	Then a man with a skin disease came to Jesus . The man bowed down before him and said , “ Lord , you can heal me if you will . ”
40008003	Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man and said , “ I will . Be healed ! ” And immediately the man was healed from his disease .
40008004	Then Jesus said to him , “ Don’t tell anyone about this . But go and show yourself to the priest and offer the gift Moses commanded for people who are made well . This will show the people what I have done . ”
40008005	When Jesus entered the city of Capernaum , an army officer came to him , begging for help .
40008006	The officer said , “ Lord , my servant is at home in bed . He can’t move his body and is in much pain . ”
40008007	Jesus said to the officer , “ I will go and heal him . ”
40008008	The officer answered , “ Lord , I am not worthy for you to come into my house . You only need to command it , and my servant will be healed .
40008009	I , too , am a man under the authority of others , and I have soldiers under my command . I tell one soldier , ‘ Go , ’ and he goes . I tell another soldier , ‘ Come , ’ and he comes . I say to my servant , ‘ Do this , ’ and my servant does it .
40008010	When Jesus heard this , he was amazed . He said to those who were following him , “ I tell you the truth , this is the greatest faith I have found , even in Israel .
40008011	Many people will come from the east and from the west and will sit and eat with Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven .
40008012	But those people who should be in the kingdom will be thrown outside into the darkness , where people will cry and grind their teeth with pain . ”
40008013	Then Jesus said to the officer , “ Go home . Your servant will be healed just as you believed he would . ” And his servant was healed that same hour .
40008014	When Jesus went to Peter’s house , he saw that Peter’s mother-in-law was sick in bed with a fever .
40008015	Jesus touched her hand , and the fever left her . Then she stood up and began to serve Jesus .
40008016	That evening people brought to Jesus many who had demons . Jesus spoke and the demons left them , and he healed all the sick .
40008017	He did these things to bring about what Isaiah the prophet had said : “ He took our suffering on him and carried our diseases . ”
40008018	When Jesus saw the crowd around him , he told his followers to go to the other side of the lake .
40008019	Then a teacher of the law came to Jesus and said , “ Teacher , I will follow you any place you go . ”
40008020	Jesus said to him , “ The foxes have holes to live in , and the birds have nests , but the Son of Man has no place to rest his head . ”
40008021	Another man , one of Jesus’ followers , said to him , “ Lord , first let me go and bury my father . ”
40008022	But Jesus told him , “ Follow me , and let the people who are dead bury their own dead . ”
40008023	Jesus got into a boat , and his followers went with him .
40008024	A great storm arose on the lake so that waves covered the boat , but Jesus was sleeping .
40008025	His followers went to him and woke him , saying , “ Lord , save us ! We will drown ! ”
40008026	Jesus answered , “ Why are you afraid ? You don’t have enough faith . ” Then Jesus got up and gave a command to the wind and the waves , and it became completely calm .
40008027	The men were amazed and said , “ What kind of man is this ? Even the wind and the waves obey him ! ”
40008028	When Jesus arrived at the other side of the lake in the area of the Gadarene people , two men who had demons in them met him . These men lived in the burial caves and were so dangerous that people could not use the road by those caves .
40008029	They shouted , “ What do you want with us , Son of God ? Did you come here to torture us before the right time ? ”
40008030	Near that place there was a large herd of pigs feeding .
40008031	The demons begged Jesus , “ If you make us leave these men , please send us into that herd of pigs . ”
40008032	Jesus said to them , “ Go ! ” So the demons left the men and went into the pigs . Then the whole herd rushed down the hill into the lake and were drowned .
40008033	The herdsmen ran away and went into town , where they told about all of this and what had happened to the men who had demons .
40008034	Then the whole town went out to see Jesus . When they saw him , they begged him to leave their area .
40009001	Jesus got into a boat and went back across the lake to his own town .
40009002	Some people brought to Jesus a man who was paralyzed and lying on a mat . When Jesus saw the faith of these people , he said to the paralyzed man , “ Be encouraged , young man . Your sins are forgiven . ”
40009003	Some of the teachers of the law said to themselves , “ This man speaks as if he were God . That is blasphemy ! ”
40009004	Knowing their thoughts , Jesus said , “ Why are you thinking evil thoughts ?
40009005	Which is easier : to say , ‘ Your sins are forgiven , ’ or to tell him , ‘ Stand up and walk ’ ?
40009006	But I will prove to you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins . ” Then Jesus said to the paralyzed man , “ Stand up , take your mat , and go home . ”
40009007	And the man stood up and went home .
40009008	When the people saw this , they were amazed and praised God for giving power like this to human beings .
40009009	When Jesus was leaving , he saw a man named Matthew sitting in the tax collector’s booth . Jesus said to him , “ Follow me , ” and he stood up and followed Jesus .
40009010	As Jesus was having dinner at Matthew’s house , many tax collectors and “ sinners ” came and ate with Jesus and his followers .
40009011	When the Pharisees saw this , they asked Jesus’ followers , “ Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners ? ”
40009012	When Jesus heard them , he said , “ It is not the healthy people who need a doctor , but the sick .
40009013	Go and learn what this means : ‘ I want kindness more than I want animal sacrifices . ’ I did not come to invite good people but to invite sinners . ”
40009014	Then the followers of John came to Jesus and said , “ Why do we and the Pharisees often fast for a certain time , but your followers don’t ? ”
40009015	Jesus answered , “ The friends of the bridegroom are not sad while he is with them . But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them , and then they will fast .
40009016	“ No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth over a hole in an old coat . If he does , the patch will shrink and pull away from the coat , making the hole worse .
40009017	Also , people never pour new wine into old leather bags . Otherwise , the bags will break , the wine will spill , and the wine bags will be ruined . But people always pour new wine into new wine bags . Then both will continue to be good . ”
40009018	While Jesus was saying these things , a leader of the synagogue came to him . He bowed down before Jesus and said , “ My daughter has just died . But if you come and lay your hand on her , she will live again . ”
40009019	So Jesus and his followers stood up and went with the leader .
40009020	Then a woman who had been bleeding for twelve years came behind Jesus and touched the edge of his coat .
40009021	She was thinking , “ If I can just touch his clothes , I will be healed . ”
40009022	Jesus turned and saw the woman and said , “ Be encouraged , dear woman . You are made well because you believed . ” And the woman was healed from that moment on .
40009023	Jesus continued along with the leader and went into his house . There he saw the funeral musicians and many people crying .
40009024	Jesus said , “ Go away . The girl is not dead , only asleep . ” But the people laughed at him .
40009025	After the crowd had been thrown out of the house , Jesus went into the girl’s room and took hold of her hand , and she stood up .
40009026	The news about this spread all around the area .
40009027	When Jesus was leaving there , two blind men followed him . They cried out , “ Have mercy on us , Son of David ! ”
40009028	After Jesus went inside , the blind men went with him . He asked the men , “ Do you believe that I can make you see again ? ” They answered , “ Yes , Lord . ”
40009029	Then Jesus touched their eyes and said , “ Because you believe I can make you see again , it will happen . ”
40009030	Then the men were able to see . But Jesus warned them strongly , saying , “ Don’t tell anyone about this . ”
40009031	But the blind men left and spread the news about Jesus all around that area .
40009032	When the two men were leaving , some people brought another man to Jesus . This man could not talk because he had a demon in him .
40009033	After Jesus forced the demon to leave the man , he was able to speak . The crowd was amazed and said , “ We have never seen anything like this in Israel . ”
40009034	But the Pharisees said , “ The prince of demons is the one that gives him power to force demons out . ”
40009035	Jesus traveled through all the towns and villages , teaching in their synagogues , preaching the Good News about the kingdom , and healing all kinds of diseases and sicknesses .
40009036	When he saw the crowds , he felt sorry for them because they were hurting and helpless , like sheep without a shepherd .
40009037	Jesus said to his followers , “ There are many people to harvest but only a few workers to help harvest them .
40009038	Pray to the Lord , who owns the harvest , that he will send more workers to gather his harvest . ”
40010001	Jesus called his twelve followers together and gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every kind of disease and sickness .
40010002	These are the names of the twelve apostles : Simon ( also called Peter ) and his brother Andrew ; James son of Zebedee , and his brother John ;
40010003	Philip and Bartholomew ; Thomas and Matthew , the tax collector ; James son of Alphaeus , and Thaddaeus ;
40010004	Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot , who turned against Jesus .
40010005	Jesus sent out these twelve men with the following order : “ Don’t go to the non-Jewish people or to any town where the Samaritans live .
40010006	But go to the people of Israel , who are like lost sheep .
40010007	When you go , preach this : ‘ The kingdom of heaven is near . ’
40010008	Heal the sick , raise the dead to life again , heal those who have skin diseases , and force demons out of people . I give you these powers freely , so help other people freely .
40010009	Don’t carry any money with you — gold or silver or copper .
40010010	Don’t carry a bag or extra clothes or sandals or a walking stick . Workers should be given what they need .
40010011	“ When you enter a city or town , find some worthy person there and stay in that home until you leave .
40010012	When you enter that home , say , ‘ Peace be with you . ’
40010013	If the people there welcome you , let your peace stay there . But if they don’t welcome you , take back the peace you wished for them .
40010014	And if a home or town refuses to welcome you or listen to you , leave that place and shake its dust off your feet .
40010015	I tell you the truth , on the Judgment Day it will be better for the towns of Sodom and Gomorrah than for the people of that town .
40010016	“ Listen , I am sending you out like sheep among wolves . So be as clever as snakes and as innocent as doves .
40010017	Be careful of people , because they will arrest you and take you to court and whip you in their synagogues .
40010018	Because of me you will be taken to stand before governors and kings , and you will tell them and the non-Jewish people about me .
40010019	When you are arrested , don’t worry about what to say or how to say it . At that time you will be given the things to say .
40010020	It will not really be you speaking but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you .
40010021	“ Brothers will give their own brothers to be killed , and fathers will give their own children to be killed . Children will fight against their own parents and have them put to death .
40010022	All people will hate you because you follow me , but those people who keep their faith until the end will be saved .
40010023	When you are treated badly in one city , run to another city . I tell you the truth , you will not finish going through all the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes .
40010024	“ A student is not better than his teacher , and a servant is not better than his master .
40010025	A student should be satisfied to become like his teacher ; a servant should be satisfied to become like his master . If the head of the family is called Beelzebul , then the other members of the family will be called worse names !
40010026	“ So don’t be afraid of those people , because everything that is hidden will be shown . Everything that is secret will be made known .
40010027	I tell you these things in the dark , but I want you to tell them in the light . What you hear whispered in your ear you should shout from the housetops .
40010028	Don’t be afraid of people , who can kill the body but cannot kill the soul . The only one you should fear is the one who can destroy the soul and the body in hell .
40010029	Two sparrows cost only a penny , but not even one of them can die without your Father’s knowing it .
40010030	God even knows how many hairs are on your head .
40010031	So don’t be afraid . You are worth much more than many sparrows .
40010032	“ All those who stand before others and say they believe in me , I will say before my Father in heaven that they belong to me .
40010033	But all who stand before others and say they do not believe in me , I will say before my Father in heaven that they do not belong to me .
40010034	“ Don’t think that I came to bring peace to the earth . I did not come to bring peace , but a sword .
40010035	I have come so that ‘ a son will be against his father , a daughter will be against her mother , a daughter-in-law will be against her mother-in-law .
40010036	A person’s enemies will be members of his own family . ’
40010037	“ Those who love their father or mother more than they love me are not worthy to be my followers . Those who love their son or daughter more than they love me are not worthy to be my followers .
40010038	Whoever is not willing to carry the cross and follow me is not worthy of me .
40010039	Those who try to hold on to their lives will give up true life . Those who give up their lives for me will hold on to true life .
40010040	Whoever accepts you also accepts me , and whoever accepts me also accepts the One who sent me .
40010041	Whoever meets a prophet and accepts him will receive the reward of a prophet . And whoever accepts a good person because that person is good will receive the reward of a good person .
40010042	Those who give one of these little ones a cup of cold water because they are my followers will truly get their reward . ”
40011001	After Jesus finished telling these things to his twelve followers , he left there and went to the towns in Galilee to teach and preach .
40011002	John the Baptist was in prison , but he heard about what the Christ was doing . So John sent some of his followers to Jesus .
40011003	They asked him , “ Are you the One who is to come , or should we wait for someone else ? ”
40011004	Jesus answered them , “ Go tell John what you hear and see :
40011005	The blind can see , the crippled can walk , and people with skin diseases are healed . The deaf can hear , the dead are raised to life , and the Good News is preached to the poor .
40011006	Those who do not stumble in their faith because of me are blessed . ”
40011007	As John’s followers were leaving , Jesus began talking to the people about John . Jesus said , “ What did you go out into the desert to see ? A reed blown by the wind ?
40011008	What did you go out to see ? A man dressed in fine clothes ? No , those who wear fine clothes live in kings’ palaces .
40011009	So why did you go out ? To see a prophet ? Yes , and I tell you , John is more than a prophet .
40011010	This was written about him : ‘ I will send my messenger ahead of you , who will prepare the way for you . ’
40011011	I tell you the truth , John the Baptist is greater than any other person ever born , but even the least important person in the kingdom of heaven is greater than John .
40011012	Since the time John the Baptist came until now , the kingdom of heaven has been going forward in strength , and people have been trying to take it by force .
40011013	All the prophets and the law of Moses told about what would happen until the time John came .
40011014	And if you will believe what they said , you will believe that John is Elijah , whom they said would come .
40011015	Let those with ears use them and listen !
40011016	“ What can I say about the people of this time ? What are they like ? They are like children sitting in the marketplace , who call out to each other ,
40011017	‘ We played music for you , but you did not dance ; we sang a sad song , but you did not cry . ’
40011018	John came and did not eat or drink like other people . So people say , ‘ He has a demon . ’
40011019	The Son of Man came , eating and drinking , and people say , ‘ Look at him ! He eats too much and drinks too much wine , and he is a friend of tax collectors and sinners . ’ But wisdom is proved to be right by what she does . ”
40011020	Then Jesus criticized the cities where he did most of his miracles , because the people did not change their lives and stop sinning .
40011021	He said , “ How terrible for you , Korazin ! How terrible for you , Bethsaida ! If the same miracles I did in you had happened in Tyre and Sidon , those people would have changed their lives a long time ago . They would have worn rough cloth and put ashes on themselves to show they had changed .
40011022	But I tell you , on the Judgment Day it will be better for Tyre and Sidon than for you .
40011023	And you , Capernaum , will you be lifted up to heaven ? No , you will be thrown down to the depths . If the miracles I did in you had happened in Sodom , its people would have stopped sinning , and it would still be a city today .
40011024	But I tell you , on the Judgment Day it will be better for Sodom than for you . ”
40011025	At that time Jesus said , “ I praise you , Father , Lord of heaven and earth , because you have hidden these things from the people who are wise and smart . But you have shown them to those who are like little children .
40011026	Yes , Father , this is what you really wanted .
40011027	“ My Father has given me all things . No one knows the Son , except the Father . And no one knows the Father , except the Son and those whom the Son chooses to tell .
40011028	“ Come to me , all of you who are tired and have heavy loads , and I will give you rest .
40011029	Accept my teachings and learn from me , because I am gentle and humble in spirit , and you will find rest for your lives .
40011030	The burden that I ask you to accept is easy ; the load I give you to carry is light . ”
40012001	At that time Jesus was walking through some fields of grain on a Sabbath day . His followers were hungry , so they began to pick the grain and eat it .
40012002	When the Pharisees saw this , they said to Jesus , “ Look ! Your followers are doing what is unlawful to do on the Sabbath day . ”
40012003	Jesus answered , “ Have you not read what David did when he and the people with him were hungry ?
40012004	He went into God’s house , and he and those with him ate the holy bread , which was lawful only for priests to eat .
40012005	And have you not read in the law of Moses that on every Sabbath day the priests in the Temple break this law about the Sabbath day ? But the priests are not wrong for doing that .
40012006	I tell you that there is something here that is greater than the Temple .
40012007	The Scripture says , ‘ I want kindness more than I want animal sacrifices . ’ You don’t really know what those words mean . If you understood them , you would not judge those who have done nothing wrong .
40012008	“ So the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath day . ”
40012009	Jesus left there and went into their synagogue ,
40012010	where there was a man with a crippled hand . They were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus , so they asked him , “ Is it right to heal on the Sabbath day ? ”
40012011	Jesus answered , “ If any of you has a sheep , and it falls into a ditch on the Sabbath day , you will help it out of the ditch .
40012012	Surely a human being is more important than a sheep . So it is lawful to do good things on the Sabbath day . ”
40012013	Then Jesus said to the man with the crippled hand , “ Hold out your hand . ” The man held out his hand , and it became well again , like the other hand .
40012014	But the Pharisees left and made plans to kill Jesus .
40012015	Jesus knew what the Pharisees were doing , so he left that place . Many people followed him , and he healed all who were sick .
40012016	But Jesus warned the people not to tell who he was .
40012017	He did these things to bring about what Isaiah the prophet had said :
40012018	“ Here is my servant whom I have chosen . I love him , and I am pleased with him . I will put my Spirit upon him , and he will tell of my justice to all people .
40012019	He will not argue or cry out ; no one will hear his voice in the streets .
40012020	He will not break a crushed blade of grass or put out even a weak flame until he makes justice win the victory .
40012021	In him will the non-Jewish people find hope . ”
40012022	Then some people brought to Jesus a man who was blind and could not talk , because he had a demon . Jesus healed the man so that he could talk and see .
40012023	All the people were amazed and said , “ Perhaps this man is the Son of David ! ”
40012024	When the Pharisees heard this , they said , “ Jesus uses the power of Beelzebul , the ruler of demons , to force demons out of people . ”
40012025	Jesus knew what the Pharisees were thinking , so he said to them , “ Every kingdom that is divided against itself will be destroyed . And any city or family that is divided against itself will not continue .
40012026	And if Satan forces out himself , then Satan is divided against himself , and his kingdom will not continue .
40012027	You say that I use the power of Beelzebul to force out demons . If that is true , then what power do your people use to force out demons ? So they will be your judges .
40012028	But if I use the power of God’s Spirit to force out demons , then the kingdom of God has come to you .
40012029	“ If anyone wants to enter a strong person’s house and steal his things , he must first tie up the strong person . Then he can steal the things from the house .
40012030	“ Whoever is not with me is against me . Whoever does not work with me is working against me .
40012031	So I tell you , people can be forgiven for every sin and everything they say against God . But whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven .
40012032	Anyone who speaks against the Son of Man can be forgiven , but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven , now or in the future .
40012033	“ If you want good fruit , you must make the tree good . If your tree is not good , it will have bad fruit . A tree is known by the kind of fruit it produces .
40012034	You snakes ! You are evil people , so how can you say anything good ? The mouth speaks the things that are in the heart .
40012035	Good people have good things in their hearts , and so they say good things . But evil people have evil in their hearts , so they say evil things .
40012036	And I tell you that on the Judgment Day people will be responsible for every careless thing they have said .
40012037	The words you have said will be used to judge you . Some of your words will prove you right , but some of your words will prove you guilty . ”
40012038	Then some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law answered Jesus , saying , “ Teacher , we want to see you work a miracle as a sign . ”
40012039	Jesus answered , “ Evil and sinful people are the ones who want to see a miracle for a sign . But no sign will be given to them , except the sign of the prophet Jonah .
40012040	Jonah was in the stomach of the big fish for three days and three nights . In the same way , the Son of Man will be in the grave three days and three nights .
40012041	On the Judgment Day the people from Nineveh will stand up with you people who live now , and they will show that you are guilty . When Jonah preached to them , they were sorry and changed their lives . And I tell you that someone greater than Jonah is here .
40012042	On the Judgment Day , the Queen of the South will stand up with you people who live today . She will show that you are guilty , because she came from far away to listen to Solomon’s wise teaching . And I tell you that someone greater than Solomon is here .
40012043	“ When an evil spirit comes out of a person , it travels through dry places , looking for a place to rest , but it doesn’t find it .
40012044	So the spirit says , ‘ I will go back to the house I left . ’ When the spirit comes back , it finds the house still empty , swept clean , and made neat .
40012045	Then the evil spirit goes out and brings seven other spirits even more evil than it is , and they go in and live there . So the person has even more trouble than before . It is the same way with the evil people who live today . ”
40012046	While Jesus was talking to the people , his mother and brothers stood outside , trying to find a way to talk to him .
40012047	Someone told Jesus , “ Your mother and brothers are standing outside , and they want to talk to you . ”
40012048	He answered , “ Who is my mother ? Who are my brothers ? ”
40012049	Then he pointed to his followers and said , “ Here are my mother and my brothers .
40012050	My true brother and sister and mother are those who do what my Father in heaven wants . ”
40013001	That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the lake .
40013002	Large crowds gathered around him , so he got into a boat and sat down , while the people stood on the shore .
40013003	Then Jesus used stories to teach them many things . He said : “ A farmer went out to plant his seed .
40013004	While he was planting , some seed fell by the road , and the birds came and ate it all up .
40013005	Some seed fell on rocky ground , where there wasn’t much dirt . That seed grew very fast , because the ground was not deep .
40013006	But when the sun rose , the plants dried up , because they did not have deep roots .
40013007	Some other seed fell among thorny weeds , which grew and choked the good plants .
40013008	Some other seed fell on good ground where it grew and produced a crop . Some plants made a hundred times more , some made sixty times more , and some made thirty times more .
40013009	Let those with ears use them and listen . ”
40013010	The followers came to Jesus and asked , “ Why do you use stories to teach the people ? ”
40013011	Jesus answered , “ You have been chosen to know the secrets about the kingdom of heaven , but others cannot know these secrets .
40013012	Those who have understanding will be given more , and they will have all they need . But those who do not have understanding , even what they have will be taken away from them .
40013013	This is why I use stories to teach the people : They see , but they don’t really see . They hear , but they don’t really hear or understand .
40013014	So they show that the things Isaiah said about them are true : ‘ You will listen and listen , but you will not understand . You will look and look , but you will not learn .
40013015	For the minds of these people have become stubborn . They do not hear with their ears , and they have closed their eyes . Otherwise they might really understand what they see with their eyes and hear with their ears . They might really understand in their minds and come back to me and be healed . ’
40013016	But you are blessed , because you see with your eyes and hear with your ears .
40013017	I tell you the truth , many prophets and good people wanted to see the things that you now see , but they did not see them . And they wanted to hear the things that you now hear , but they did not hear them .
40013018	“ So listen to the meaning of that story about the farmer .
40013019	What is the seed that fell by the road ? That seed is like the person who hears the message about the kingdom but does not understand it . The Evil One comes and takes away what was planted in that person’s heart .
40013020	And what is the seed that fell on rocky ground ? That seed is like the person who hears the teaching and quickly accepts it with joy .
40013021	But he does not let the teaching go deep into his life , so he keeps it only a short time . When trouble or persecution comes because of the teaching he accepted , he quickly gives up .
40013022	And what is the seed that fell among the thorny weeds ? That seed is like the person who hears the teaching but lets worries about this life and the temptation of wealth stop that teaching from growing . So the teaching does not produce fruit in that person’s life .
40013023	But what is the seed that fell on the good ground ? That seed is like the person who hears the teaching and understands it . That person grows and produces fruit , sometimes a hundred times more , sometimes sixty times more , and sometimes thirty times more . ”
40013024	Then Jesus told them another story : “ The kingdom of heaven is like a man who planted good seed in his field .
40013025	That night , when everyone was asleep , his enemy came and planted weeds among the wheat and then left .
40013026	Later , the wheat sprouted and the heads of grain grew , but the weeds also grew .
40013027	Then the man’s servants came to him and said , ‘ You planted good seed in your field . Where did the weeds come from ? ’
40013028	The man answered , ‘ An enemy planted weeds . ’ The servants asked , ‘ Do you want us to pull up the weeds ? ’
40013029	The man answered , ‘ No , because when you pull up the weeds , you might also pull up the wheat .
40013030	Let the weeds and the wheat grow together until the harvest time . At harvest time I will tell the workers , “ First gather the weeds and tie them together to be burned . Then gather the wheat and bring it to my barn . ” ’ ”
40013031	Then Jesus told another story : “ The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a man planted in his field .
40013032	That seed is the smallest of all seeds , but when it grows , it is one of the largest garden plants . It becomes big enough for the wild birds to come and build nests in its branches . ”
40013033	Then Jesus told another story : “ The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and hid in a large tub of flour until it made all the dough rise . ”
40013034	Jesus used stories to tell all these things to the people ; he always used stories to teach them .
40013035	This is as the prophet said : “ I will speak using stories ; I will tell things that have been secret since the world was made . ”
40013036	Then Jesus left the crowd and went into the house . His followers came to him and said , “ Explain to us the meaning of the story about the weeds in the field . ”
40013037	Jesus answered , “ The man who planted the good seed in the field is the Son of Man .
40013038	The field is the world , and the good seed are all of God’s children who belong to the kingdom . The weeds are those people who belong to the Evil One .
40013039	And the enemy who planted the bad seed is the devil . The harvest time is the end of the age , and the workers who gather are God’s angels .
40013040	“ Just as the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire , so it will be at the end of the age .
40013041	The Son of Man will send out his angels , and they will gather out of his kingdom all who cause sin and all who do evil .
40013042	The angels will throw them into the blazing furnace , where the people will cry and grind their teeth with pain .
40013043	Then the good people will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father . Let those with ears use them and listen .
40013044	“ The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field . One day a man found the treasure , and then he hid it in the field again . He was so happy that he went and sold everything he owned to buy that field .
40013045	“ Also , the kingdom of heaven is like a man looking for fine pearls .
40013046	When he found a very valuable pearl , he went and sold everything he had and bought it .
40013047	“ Also , the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was put into the lake and caught many different kinds of fish .
40013048	When it was full , the fishermen pulled the net to the shore . They sat down and put all the good fish in baskets and threw away the bad fish .
40013049	It will be this way at the end of the age . The angels will come and separate the evil people from the good people .
40013050	The angels will throw the evil people into the blazing furnace , where people will cry and grind their teeth with pain . ”
40013051	Jesus asked his followers , “ Do you understand all these things ? ” They answered , “ Yes , we understand . ”
40013052	Then Jesus said to them , “ So every teacher of the law who has been taught about the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house . He brings out both new things and old things he has saved . ”
40013053	When Jesus finished teaching with these stories , he left there .
40013054	He went to his hometown and taught the people in the synagogue , and they were amazed . They said , “ Where did this man get this wisdom and this power to do miracles ?
40013055	He is just the son of a carpenter . His mother is Mary , and his brothers are James , Joseph , Simon , and Judas .
40013056	And all his sisters are here with us . Where then does this man get all these things ? ”
40013057	So the people were upset with Jesus . But Jesus said to them , “ A prophet is honored everywhere except in his hometown and in his own home . ”
40013058	So he did not do many miracles there because they had no faith .
40014001	At that time Herod , the ruler of Galilee , heard the reports about Jesus .
40014002	So he said to his servants , “ Jesus is John the Baptist , who has risen from the dead . That is why he can work these miracles . ”
40014003	Sometime before this , Herod had arrested John , tied him up , and put him into prison . Herod did this because of Herodias , who had been the wife of Philip , Herod’s brother .
40014004	John had been telling Herod , “ It is not lawful for you to be married to Herodias . ”
40014005	Herod wanted to kill John , but he was afraid of the people , because they believed John was a prophet .
40014006	On Herod’s birthday , the daughter of Herodias danced for Herod and his guests , and she pleased him .
40014007	So he promised with an oath to give her anything she wanted .
40014008	Herodias told her daughter what to ask for , so she said to Herod , “ Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter . ”
40014009	Although King Herod was very sad , he had made a promise , and his dinner guests had heard him . So Herod ordered that what she asked for be done .
40014010	He sent soldiers to the prison to cut off John’s head .
40014011	And they brought it on a platter and gave it to the girl , and she took it to her mother .
40014012	John’s followers came and got his body and buried it . Then they went and told Jesus .
40014013	When Jesus heard what had happened to John , he left in a boat and went to a lonely place by himself . But the crowds heard about it and followed him on foot from the towns .
40014014	When he arrived , he saw a great crowd waiting . He felt sorry for them and healed those who were sick .
40014015	When it was evening , his followers came to him and said , “ No one lives in this place , and it is already late . Send the people away so they can go to the towns and buy food for themselves . ”
40014016	But Jesus answered , “ They don’t need to go away . You give them something to eat . ”
40014017	They said to him , “ But we have only five loaves of bread and two fish . ”
40014018	Jesus said , “ Bring the bread and the fish to me . ”
40014019	Then he told the people to sit down on the grass . He took the five loaves and the two fish and , looking to heaven , he thanked God for the food . Jesus divided the bread and gave it to his followers , who gave it to the people .
40014020	All the people ate and were satisfied . Then the followers filled twelve baskets with the leftover pieces of food .
40014021	There were about five thousand men there who ate , not counting women and children .
40014022	Immediately Jesus told his followers to get into the boat and go ahead of him across the lake . He stayed there to send the people home .
40014023	After he had sent them away , he went by himself up into the hills to pray . It was late , and Jesus was there alone .
40014024	By this time , the boat was already far away from land . It was being hit by waves , because the wind was blowing against it .
40014025	Between three and six o’clock in the morning , Jesus came to them , walking on the water .
40014026	When his followers saw him walking on the water , they were afraid . They said , “ It’s a ghost ! ” and cried out in fear .
40014027	But Jesus quickly spoke to them , “ Have courage ! It is I . Do not be afraid . ”
40014028	Peter said , “ Lord , if it is really you , then command me to come to you on the water . ”
40014029	Jesus said , “ Come . ” And Peter left the boat and walked on the water to Jesus .
40014030	But when Peter saw the wind and the waves , he became afraid and began to sink . He shouted , “ Lord , save me ! ”
40014031	Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught Peter . Jesus said , “ Your faith is small . Why did you doubt ? ”
40014032	After they got into the boat , the wind became calm .
40014033	Then those who were in the boat worshiped Jesus and said , “ Truly you are the Son of God ! ”
40014034	When they had crossed the lake , they came to shore at Gennesaret .
40014035	When the people there recognized Jesus , they told people all around there that Jesus had come , and they brought all their sick to him .
40014036	They begged Jesus to let them touch just the edge of his coat , and all who touched it were healed .
40015001	Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem . They asked him ,
40015002	“ Why don’t your followers obey the unwritten laws which have been handed down to us ? They don’t wash their hands before they eat . ”
40015003	Jesus answered , “ And why do you refuse to obey God’s command so that you can follow your own teachings ?
40015004	God said , ‘ Honor your father and your mother , ’ and ‘ Anyone who says cruel things to his father or mother must be put to death . ’
40015005	But you say a person can tell his father or mother , ‘ I have something I could use to help you , but I have given it to God already . ’
40015006	You teach that person not to honor his father or his mother . You rejected what God said for the sake of your own rules .
40015007	You are hypocrites ! Isaiah was right when he said about you :
40015008	‘ These people show honor to me with words , but their hearts are far from me .
40015009	Their worship of me is worthless . The things they teach are nothing but human rules . ’ ”
40015010	After Jesus called the crowd to him , he said , “ Listen and understand what I am saying .
40015011	It is not what people put into their mouths that makes them unclean . It is what comes out of their mouths that makes them unclean . ”
40015012	Then his followers came to him and asked , “ Do you know that the Pharisees are angry because of what you said ? ”
40015013	Jesus answered , “ Every plant that my Father in heaven has not planted himself will be pulled up by the roots .
40015014	Stay away from the Pharisees ; they are blind leaders . And if a blind person leads a blind person , both will fall into a ditch . ”
40015015	Peter said , “ Explain the example to us . ”
40015016	Jesus said , “ Do you still not understand ?
40015017	Surely you know that all the food that enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then goes out of the body .
40015018	But what people say with their mouths comes from the way they think ; these are the things that make people unclean .
40015019	Out of the mind come evil thoughts , murder , adultery , sexual sins , stealing , lying , and speaking evil of others .
40015020	These things make people unclean ; eating with unwashed hands does not make them unclean . ”
40015021	Jesus left that place and went to the area of Tyre and Sidon .
40015022	A Canaanite woman from that area came to Jesus and cried out , “ Lord , Son of David , have mercy on me ! My daughter has a demon , and she is suffering very much . ”
40015023	But Jesus did not answer the woman . So his followers came to Jesus and begged him , “ Tell the woman to go away . She is following us and shouting . ”
40015024	Jesus answered , “ God sent me only to the lost sheep , the people of Israel . ”
40015025	Then the woman came to Jesus again and bowed before him and said , “ Lord , help me ! ”
40015026	Jesus answered , “ It is not right to take the children’s bread and give it to the dogs . ”
40015027	The woman said , “ Yes , Lord , but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters’ table . ”
40015028	Then Jesus answered , “ Woman , you have great faith ! I will do what you asked . ” And at that moment the woman’s daughter was healed .
40015029	After leaving there , Jesus went along the shore of Lake Galilee . He went up on a hill and sat there .
40015030	Great crowds came to Jesus , bringing with them the lame , the blind , the crippled , those who could not speak , and many others . They put them at Jesus’ feet , and he healed them .
40015031	The crowd was amazed when they saw that people who could not speak before were now able to speak . The crippled were made strong . The lame could walk , and the blind could see . And they praised the God of Israel for this .
40015032	Jesus called his followers to him and said , “ I feel sorry for these people , because they have already been with me three days , and they have nothing to eat . I don’t want to send them away hungry . They might faint while going home . ”
40015033	His followers asked him , “ How can we get enough bread to feed all these people ? We are far away from any town . ”
40015034	Jesus asked , “ How many loaves of bread do you have ? ” They answered , “ Seven , and a few small fish . ”
40015035	Jesus told the people to sit on the ground .
40015036	He took the seven loaves of bread and the fish and gave thanks to God . Then he divided the food and gave it to his followers , and they gave it to the people .
40015037	All the people ate and were satisfied . Then his followers filled seven baskets with the leftover pieces of food .
40015038	There were about four thousand men there who ate , besides women and children .
40015039	After sending the people home , Jesus got into the boat and went to the area of Magadan .
40016001	The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus , wanting to trick him . So they asked him to show them a miracle from God .
40016002	Jesus answered , “ At sunset you say we will have good weather , because the sky is red .
40016003	And in the morning you say that it will be a rainy day , because the sky is dark and red . You see these signs in the sky and know what they mean . In the same way , you see the things that I am doing now , but you don’t know their meaning .
40016004	Evil and sinful people ask for a miracle as a sign , but they will not be given any sign , except the sign of Jonah . ” Then Jesus left them and went away .
40016005	Jesus’ followers went across the lake , but they had forgotten to bring bread .
40016006	Jesus said to them , “ Be careful ! Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees . ”
40016007	His followers discussed the meaning of this , saying , “ He said this because we forgot to bring bread . ”
40016008	Knowing what they were talking about , Jesus asked them , “ Why are you talking about not having bread ? Your faith is small .
40016009	Do you still not understand ? Remember the five loaves of bread that fed the five thousand ? And remember that you filled many baskets with the leftovers ?
40016010	Or the seven loaves of bread that fed the four thousand and the many baskets you filled then also ?
40016011	I was not talking to you about bread . Why don’t you understand that ? I am telling you to beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees . ”
40016012	Then the followers understood that Jesus was not telling them to beware of the yeast used in bread but to beware of the teaching of the Pharisees and the Sadducees .
40016013	When Jesus came to the area of Caesarea Philippi , he asked his followers , “ Who do people say the Son of Man is ? ”
40016014	They answered , “ Some say you are John the Baptist . Others say you are Elijah , and still others say you are Jeremiah or one of the prophets . ”
40016015	Then Jesus asked them , “ And who do you say I am ? ”
40016016	Simon Peter answered , “ You are the Christ , the Son of the living God . ”
40016017	Jesus answered , “ You are blessed , Simon son of Jonah , because no person taught you that . My Father in heaven showed you who I am .
40016018	So I tell you , you are Peter . On this rock I will build my church , and the power of death will not be able to defeat it .
40016019	I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven ; the things you don’t allow on earth will be the things that God does not allow , and the things you allow on earth will be the things that God allows . ”
40016020	Then Jesus warned his followers not to tell anyone he was the Christ .
40016021	From that time on Jesus began telling his followers that he must go to Jerusalem , where the Jewish elders , the leading priests , and the teachers of the law would make him suffer many things . He told them he must be killed and then be raised from the dead on the third day .
40016022	Peter took Jesus aside and told him not to talk like that . He said , “ God save you from those things , Lord ! Those things will never happen to you ! ”
40016023	Then Jesus said to Peter , “ Go away from me , Satan ! You are not helping me ! You don’t care about the things of God , but only about the things people think are important . ”
40016024	Then Jesus said to his followers , “ If people want to follow me , they must give up the things they want . They must be willing even to give up their lives to follow me .
40016025	Those who want to save their lives will give up true life , and those who give up their lives for me will have true life .
40016026	It is worthless to have the whole world if they lose their souls . They could never pay enough to buy back their souls .
40016027	The Son of Man will come again with his Father’s glory and with his angels . At that time , he will reward them for what they have done .
40016028	I tell you the truth , some people standing here will see the Son of Man coming with his kingdom before they die . ”
40017001	Six days later , Jesus took Peter , James , and John , the brother of James , up on a high mountain by themselves .
40017002	While they watched , Jesus’ appearance was changed ; his face became bright like the sun , and his clothes became white as light .
40017003	Then Moses and Elijah appeared to them , talking with Jesus .
40017004	Peter said to Jesus , “ Lord , it is good that we are here . If you want , I will put up three tents here — one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . ”
40017005	While Peter was talking , a bright cloud covered them . A voice came from the cloud and said , “ This is my Son , whom I love , and I am very pleased with him . Listen to him ! ”
40017006	When his followers heard the voice , they were so frightened they fell to the ground .
40017007	But Jesus went to them and touched them and said , “ Stand up . Don’t be afraid . ”
40017008	When they looked up , they saw Jesus was now alone .
40017009	As they were coming down the mountain , Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone about what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead .
40017010	Then his followers asked him , “ Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first ? ”
40017011	Jesus answered , “ They are right to say that Elijah is coming and that he will make everything the way it should be .
40017012	But I tell you that Elijah has already come , and they did not recognize him . They did to him whatever they wanted to do . It will be the same with the Son of Man ; those same people will make the Son of Man suffer . ”
40017013	Then the followers understood that Jesus was talking about John the Baptist .
40017014	When Jesus and his followers came back to the crowd , a man came to Jesus and bowed before him .
40017015	The man said , “ Lord , have mercy on my son . He has epilepsy and is suffering very much , because he often falls into the fire or into the water .
40017016	I brought him to your followers , but they could not cure him . ”
40017017	Jesus answered , “ You people have no faith , and your lives are all wrong . How long must I put up with you ? How long must I continue to be patient with you ? Bring the boy here . ”
40017018	Jesus commanded the demon inside the boy . Then the demon came out , and the boy was healed from that time on .
40017019	The followers came to Jesus when he was alone and asked , “ Why couldn’t we force the demon out ? ”
40017020	Jesus answered , “ Because your faith is too small . I tell you the truth , if your faith is as big as a mustard seed , you can say to this mountain , ‘ Move from here to there , ’ and it will move . All things will be possible for you . [
40017021	That kind of spirit comes out only if you use prayer and fasting . ] ”
40017022	While Jesus’ followers were gathering in Galilee , he said to them , “ The Son of Man will be handed over to people ,
40017023	and they will kill him . But on the third day he will be raised from the dead . ” And the followers were filled with sadness .
40017024	When Jesus and his followers came to Capernaum , the men who collected the Temple tax came to Peter . They asked , “ Does your teacher pay the Temple tax ? ”
40017025	Peter answered , “ Yes , Jesus pays the tax . ” Peter went into the house , but before he could speak , Jesus said to him , “ What do you think ? The kings of the earth collect different kinds of taxes . But who pays the taxes — the king’s children or others ? ”
40017026	Peter answered , “ Other people pay the taxes . ” Jesus said to Peter , “ Then the children of the king don’t have to pay taxes .
40017027	But we don’t want to upset these tax collectors . So go to the lake and fish . After you catch the first fish , open its mouth and you will find a coin . Take that coin and give it to the tax collectors for you and me . ”
40018001	At that time the followers came to Jesus and asked , “ Who is greatest in the kingdom of heaven ? ”
40018002	Jesus called a little child to him and stood the child before his followers .
40018003	Then he said , “ I tell you the truth , you must change and become like little children . Otherwise , you will never enter the kingdom of heaven .
40018004	The greatest person in the kingdom of heaven is the one who makes himself humble like this child .
40018005	“ Whoever accepts a child in my name accepts me .
40018006	If one of these little children believes in me , and someone causes that child to sin , it would be better for that person to have a large stone tied around the neck and be drowned in the sea .
40018007	How terrible for the people of the world because of the things that cause them to sin . Such things will happen , but how terrible for the one who causes them to happen !
40018008	If your hand or your foot causes you to sin , cut it off and throw it away . It is better for you to lose part of your body and live forever than to have two hands and two feet and be thrown into the fire that burns forever .
40018009	If your eye causes you to sin , take it out and throw it away . It is better for you to have only one eye and live forever than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell .
40018010	“ Be careful . Don’t think these little children are worth nothing . I tell you that they have angels in heaven who are always with my Father in heaven . [
40018011	The Son of Man came to save lost people . ]
40018012	“ If a man has a hundred sheep but one of the sheep gets lost , he will leave the other ninety-nine on the hill and go to look for the lost sheep .
40018013	I tell you the truth , if he finds it he is happier about that one sheep than about the ninety-nine that were never lost .
40018014	In the same way , your Father in heaven does not want any of these little children to be lost .
40018015	“ If your fellow believer sins against you , go and tell him in private what he did wrong . If he listens to you , you have helped that person to be your brother or sister again .
40018016	But if he refuses to listen , go to him again and take one or two other people with you . ‘ Every case may be proved by two or three witnesses . ’
40018017	If he refuses to listen to them , tell the church . If he refuses to listen to the church , then treat him like a person who does not believe in God or like a tax collector .
40018018	“ I tell you the truth , the things you don’t allow on earth will be the things God does not allow . And the things you allow on earth will be the things that God allows .
40018019	“ Also , I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about something and pray for it , it will be done for you by my Father in heaven .
40018020	This is true because if two or three people come together in my name , I am there with them . ”
40018021	Then Peter came to Jesus and asked , “ Lord , when my fellow believer sins against me , how many times must I forgive him ? Should I forgive him as many as seven times ? ”
40018022	Jesus answered , “ I tell you , you must forgive him more than seven times . You must forgive him even if he wrongs you seventy times seven .
40018023	“ The kingdom of heaven is like a king who decided to collect the money his servants owed him .
40018024	When the king began to collect his money , a servant who owed him several million dollars was brought to him .
40018025	But the servant did not have enough money to pay his master , the king . So the master ordered that everything the servant owned should be sold , even the servant’s wife and children . Then the money would be used to pay the king what the servant owed .
40018026	“ But the servant fell on his knees and begged , ‘ Be patient with me , and I will pay you everything I owe . ’
40018027	The master felt sorry for his servant and told him he did not have to pay it back . Then he let the servant go free .
40018028	“ Later , that same servant found another servant who owed him a few dollars . The servant grabbed him around the neck and said , ‘ Pay me the money you owe me ! ’
40018029	“ The other servant fell on his knees and begged him , ‘ Be patient with me , and I will pay you everything I owe . ’
40018030	“ But the first servant refused to be patient . He threw the other servant into prison until he could pay everything he owed .
40018031	When the other servants saw what had happened , they were very sorry . So they went and told their master all that had happened .
40018032	“ Then the master called his servant in and said , ‘ You evil servant ! Because you begged me to forget what you owed , I told you that you did not have to pay anything .
40018033	You should have showed mercy to that other servant , just as I showed mercy to you . ’
40018034	The master was very angry and put the servant in prison to be punished until he could pay everything he owed .
40018035	“ This king did what my heavenly Father will do to you if you do not forgive your brother or sister from your heart . ”
40019001	After Jesus said all these things , he left Galilee and went into the area of Judea on the other side of the Jordan River .
40019002	Large crowds followed him , and he healed them there .
40019003	Some Pharisees came to Jesus and tried to trick him . They asked , “ Is it right for a man to divorce his wife for any reason he chooses ? ”
40019004	Jesus answered , “ Surely you have read in the Scriptures : When God made the world , ‘ he made them male and female . ’
40019005	And God said , ‘ So a man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife , and the two will become one body . ’
40019006	So there are not two , but one . God has joined the two together , so no one should separate them . ”
40019007	The Pharisees asked , “ Why then did Moses give a command for a man to divorce his wife by giving her divorce papers ? ”
40019008	Jesus answered , “ Moses allowed you to divorce your wives because you refused to accept God’s teaching , but divorce was not allowed in the beginning .
40019009	I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman is guilty of adultery . The only reason for a man to divorce his wife is if his wife has sexual relations with another man . ”
40019010	The followers said to him , “ If that is the only reason a man can divorce his wife , it is better not to marry . ”
40019011	Jesus answered , “ Not everyone can accept this teaching , but God has made some able to accept it .
40019012	There are different reasons why some men cannot marry . Some men were born without the ability to become fathers . Others were made that way later in life by other people . And some men have given up marriage because of the kingdom of heaven . But the person who can marry should accept this teaching about marriage . ”
40019013	Then the people brought their little children to Jesus so he could put his hands on them and pray for them . His followers told them to stop ,
40019014	but Jesus said , “ Let the little children come to me . Don’t stop them , because the kingdom of heaven belongs to people who are like these children . ”
40019015	After Jesus put his hands on the children , he left there .
40019016	A man came to Jesus and asked , “ Teacher , what good thing must I do to have life forever ? ”
40019017	Jesus answered , “ Why do you ask me about what is good ? Only God is good . But if you want to have life forever , obey the commands . ”
40019018	The man asked , “ Which commands ? ” Jesus answered , “ ‘ You must not murder anyone ; you must not be guilty of adultery ; you must not steal ; you must not tell lies about your neighbor ;
40019019	honor your father and mother ; and love your neighbor as you love yourself . ’ ”
40019020	The young man said , “ I have obeyed all these things . What else do I need to do ? ”
40019021	Jesus answered , “ If you want to be perfect , then go and sell your possessions and give the money to the poor . If you do this , you will have treasure in heaven . Then come and follow me . ”
40019022	But when the young man heard this , he left sorrowfully , because he was rich .
40019023	Then Jesus said to his followers , “ I tell you the truth , it will be hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven .
40019024	Yes , I tell you that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God . ”
40019025	When Jesus’ followers heard this , they were very surprised and asked , “ Then who can be saved ? ”
40019026	Jesus looked at them and said , “ For people this is impossible , but for God all things are possible . ”
40019027	Peter said to Jesus , “ Look , we have left everything and followed you . So what will we have ? ”
40019028	Jesus said to them , “ I tell you the truth , when the age to come has arrived , the Son of Man will sit on his great throne . All of you who followed me will also sit on twelve thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
40019029	And all those who have left houses , brothers , sisters , father , mother , children , or farms to follow me will get much more than they left , and they will have life forever .
40019030	Many who are first now will be last in the future . And many who are last now will be first in the future .
40020001	“ The kingdom of heaven is like a person who owned some land . One morning , he went out very early to hire some people to work in his vineyard .
40020002	The man agreed to pay the workers one coin for working that day . Then he sent them into the vineyard to work .
40020003	About nine o’clock the man went to the marketplace and saw some other people standing there , doing nothing .
40020004	So he said to them , ‘ If you go and work in my vineyard , I will pay you what your work is worth . ’
40020005	So they went to work in the vineyard . The man went out again about twelve o’clock and three o’clock and did the same thing .
40020006	About five o’clock the man went to the marketplace again and saw others standing there . He asked them , ‘ Why did you stand here all day doing nothing ? ’
40020007	They answered , ‘ No one gave us a job . ’ The man said to them , ‘ Then you can go and work in my vineyard . ’
40020008	“ At the end of the day , the owner of the vineyard said to the boss of all the workers , ‘ Call the workers and pay them . Start with the last people I hired and end with those I hired first . ’
40020009	“ When the workers who were hired at five o’clock came to get their pay , each received one coin .
40020010	When the workers who were hired first came to get their pay , they thought they would be paid more than the others . But each one of them also received one coin .
40020011	When they got their coin , they complained to the man who owned the land .
40020012	They said , ‘ Those people were hired last and worked only one hour . But you paid them the same as you paid us who worked hard all day in the hot sun . ’
40020013	But the man who owned the vineyard said to one of those workers , ‘ Friend , I am being fair to you . You agreed to work for one coin .
40020014	So take your pay and go . I want to give the man who was hired last the same pay that I gave you .
40020015	I can do what I want with my own money . Are you jealous because I am good to those people ? ’
40020016	“ So those who are last now will someday be first , and those who are first now will someday be last . ”
40020017	While Jesus was going to Jerusalem , he took his twelve followers aside privately and said to them ,
40020018	“ Look , we are going to Jerusalem . The Son of Man will be turned over to the leading priests and the teachers of the law , and they will say that he must die .
40020019	They will give the Son of Man to the non-Jewish people to laugh at him and beat him with whips and crucify him . But on the third day , he will be raised to life again . ”
40020020	Then the wife of Zebedee came to Jesus with her sons . She bowed before him and asked him to do something for her .
40020021	Jesus asked , “ What do you want ? ” She said , “ Promise that one of my sons will sit at your right side and the other will sit at your left side in your kingdom . ”
40020022	But Jesus said , “ You don’t understand what you are asking . Can you drink the cup that I am about to drink ? ” The sons answered , “ Yes , we can . ”
40020023	Jesus said to them , “ You will drink from my cup . But I cannot choose who will sit at my right or my left ; those places belong to those for whom my Father has prepared them . ”
40020024	When the other ten followers heard this , they were angry with the two brothers .
40020025	Jesus called all the followers together and said , “ You know that the rulers of the non-Jewish people love to show their power over the people . And their important leaders love to use all their authority .
40020026	But it should not be that way among you . Whoever wants to become great among you must serve the rest of you like a servant .
40020027	Whoever wants to become first among you must serve the rest of you like a slave .
40020028	In the same way , the Son of Man did not come to be served . He came to serve others and to give his life as a ransom for many people . ”
40020029	When Jesus and his followers were leaving Jericho , a great many people followed him .
40020030	Two blind men sitting by the road heard that Jesus was going by , so they shouted , “ Lord , Son of David , have mercy on us ! ”
40020031	The people warned the blind men to be quiet , but they shouted even more , “ Lord , Son of David , have mercy on us ! ”
40020032	Jesus stopped and said to the blind men , “ What do you want me to do for you ? ”
40020033	They answered , “ Lord , we want to see . ”
40020034	Jesus felt sorry for the blind men and touched their eyes , and at once they could see . Then they followed Jesus .
40021001	As Jesus and his followers were coming closer to Jerusalem , they stopped at Bethphage at the hill called the Mount of Olives . From there Jesus sent two of his followers
40021002	and said to them , “ Go to the town you can see there . When you enter it , you will quickly find a donkey tied there with its colt . Untie them and bring them to me .
40021003	If anyone asks you why you are taking the donkeys , say that the Master needs them , and he will send them at once . ”
40021004	This was to bring about what the prophet had said :
40021005	“ Tell the people of Jerusalem , ‘ Your king is coming to you . He is gentle and riding on a donkey , on the colt of a donkey . ’ ”
40021006	The followers went and did what Jesus told them to do .
40021007	They brought the donkey and the colt to Jesus and laid their coats on them , and Jesus sat on them .
40021008	Many people spread their coats on the road . Others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road .
40021009	The people were walking ahead of Jesus and behind him , shouting , “ Praise to the Son of David ! God bless the One who comes in the name of the Lord ! Praise to God in heaven ! ”
40021010	When Jesus entered Jerusalem , all the city was filled with excitement . The people asked , “ Who is this man ? ”
40021011	The crowd said , “ This man is Jesus , the prophet from the town of Nazareth in Galilee . ”
40021012	Jesus went into the Temple and threw out all the people who were buying and selling there . He turned over the tables of those who were exchanging different kinds of money , and he upset the benches of those who were selling doves .
40021013	Jesus said to all the people there , “ It is written in the Scriptures , ‘ My Temple will be called a house for prayer . ’ But you are changing it into a ‘ hideout for robbers . ’ ”
40021014	The blind and crippled people came to Jesus in the Temple , and he healed them .
40021015	The leading priests and the teachers of the law saw that Jesus was doing wonderful things and that the children were praising him in the Temple , saying , “ Praise to the Son of David . ” All these things made the priests and the teachers of the law very angry .
40021016	They asked Jesus , “ Do you hear the things these children are saying ? ” Jesus answered , “ Yes . Haven’t you read in the Scriptures , ‘ You have taught children and babies to sing praises’ ? ”
40021017	Then Jesus left and went out of the city to Bethany , where he spent the night .
40021018	Early the next morning , as Jesus was going back to the city , he became hungry .
40021019	Seeing a fig tree beside the road , Jesus went to it , but there were no figs on the tree , only leaves . So Jesus said to the tree , “ You will never again have fruit . ” The tree immediately dried up .
40021020	When his followers saw this , they were amazed . They asked , “ How did the fig tree dry up so quickly ? ”
40021021	Jesus answered , “ I tell you the truth , if you have faith and do not doubt , you will be able to do what I did to this tree and even more . You will be able to say to this mountain , ‘ Go , fall into the sea . ’ And if you have faith , it will happen .
40021022	If you believe , you will get anything you ask for in prayer . ”
40021023	Jesus went to the Temple , and while he was teaching there , the leading priests and the elders of the people came to him . They said , “ What authority do you have to do these things ? Who gave you this authority ? ”
40021024	Jesus answered , “ I also will ask you a question . If you answer me , then I will tell you what authority I have to do these things .
40021025	Tell me : When John baptized people , did that come from God or just from other people ? ” They argued about Jesus’ question , saying , “ If we answer , ‘ John’s baptism was from God , ’ Jesus will say , ‘ Then why didn’t you believe him ? ’
40021026	But if we say , ‘ It was from people , ’ we are afraid of what the crowd will do because they all believe that John was a prophet . ”
40021027	So they answered Jesus , “ We don’t know . ” Jesus said to them , “ Then I won’t tell you what authority I have to do these things .
40021028	“ Tell me what you think about this : A man had two sons . He went to the first son and said , ‘ Son , go and work today in my vineyard . ’
40021029	The son answered , ‘ I will not go . ’ But later the son changed his mind and went .
40021030	Then the father went to the other son and said , ‘ Son , go and work today in my vineyard . ’ The son answered , ‘ Yes , sir , I will go and work , ’ but he did not go .
40021031	Which of the two sons obeyed his father ? ” The priests and leaders answered , “ The first son . ” Jesus said to them , “ I tell you the truth , the tax collectors and the prostitutes will enter the kingdom of God before you do .
40021032	John came to show you the right way to live . You did not believe him , but the tax collectors and prostitutes believed him . Even after seeing this , you still refused to change your ways and believe him .
40021033	“ Listen to this story : There was a man who owned a vineyard . He put a wall around it and dug a hole for a winepress and built a tower . Then he leased the land to some farmers and left for a trip .
40021034	When it was time for the grapes to be picked , he sent his servants to the farmers to get his share of the grapes .
40021035	But the farmers grabbed the servants , beat one , killed another , and then killed a third servant with stones .
40021036	So the man sent some other servants to the farmers , even more than he sent the first time . But the farmers did the same thing to the servants that they had done before .
40021037	So the man decided to send his son to the farmers . He said , ‘ They will respect my son . ’
40021038	But when the farmers saw the son , they said to each other , ‘ This son will inherit the vineyard . If we kill him , it will be ours ! ’
40021039	Then the farmers grabbed the son , threw him out of the vineyard , and killed him .
40021040	So what will the owner of the vineyard do to these farmers when he comes ? ”
40021041	The priests and leaders said , “ He will surely kill those evil men . Then he will lease the vineyard to some other farmers who will give him his share of the crop at harvest time . ”
40021042	Jesus said to them , “ Surely you have read this in the Scriptures : ‘ The stone that the builders rejected became the cornerstone . The Lord did this , and it is wonderful to us . ’
40021043	“ So I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to people who do the things God wants in his kingdom .
40021044	The person who falls on this stone will be broken , and on whomever that stone falls , that person will be crushed . ”
40021045	When the leading priests and the Pharisees heard these stories , they knew Jesus was talking about them .
40021046	They wanted to arrest him , but they were afraid of the people , because the people believed that Jesus was a prophet .
40022001	Jesus again used stories to teach them . He said ,
40022002	“ The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding feast for his son .
40022003	The king invited some people to the feast . When the feast was ready , the king sent his servants to tell the people , but they refused to come .
40022004	“ Then the king sent other servants , saying , ‘ Tell those who have been invited that my feast is ready . I have killed my best bulls and calves for the dinner , and everything is ready . Come to the wedding feast . ’
40022005	“ But the people refused to listen to the servants and left to do other things . One went to work in his field , and another went to his business .
40022006	Some of the other people grabbed the servants , beat them , and killed them .
40022007	The king was furious and sent his army to kill the murderers and burn their city .
40022008	“ After that , the king said to his servants , ‘ The wedding feast is ready . I invited those people , but they were not worthy to come .
40022009	So go to the street corners and invite everyone you find to come to my feast . ’
40022010	So the servants went into the streets and gathered all the people they could find , both good and bad . And the wedding hall was filled with guests .
40022011	“ When the king came in to see the guests , he saw a man who was not dressed for a wedding .
40022012	The king said , ‘ Friend , how were you allowed to come in here ? You are not dressed for a wedding . ’ But the man said nothing .
40022013	So the king told some servants , ‘ Tie this man’s hands and feet . Throw him out into the darkness , where people will cry and grind their teeth with pain . ’
40022014	“ Yes , many are invited , but only a few are chosen . ”
40022015	Then the Pharisees left that place and made plans to trap Jesus in saying something wrong .
40022016	They sent some of their own followers and some people from the group called Herodians . They said , “ Teacher , we know that you are an honest man and that you teach the truth about God’s way . You are not afraid of what other people think about you , because you pay no attention to who they are .
40022017	So tell us what you think . Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not ? ”
40022018	But knowing that these leaders were trying to trick him , Jesus said , “ You hypocrites ! Why are you trying to trap me ?
40022019	Show me a coin used for paying the tax . ” So the men showed him a coin .
40022020	Then Jesus asked , “ Whose image and name are on the coin ? ”
40022021	The men answered , “ Caesar’s . ” Then Jesus said to them , “ Give to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s , and give to God the things that are God’s . ”
40022022	When the men heard what Jesus said , they were amazed and left him and went away .
40022023	That same day some Sadducees came to Jesus and asked him a question . ( Sadducees believed that people would not rise from the dead . )
40022024	They said , “ Teacher , Moses said if a married man dies without having children , his brother must marry the widow and have children for him .
40022025	Once there were seven brothers among us . The first one married and died . Since he had no children , his brother married the widow .
40022026	Then the second brother also died . The same thing happened to the third brother and all the other brothers .
40022027	Finally , the woman died .
40022028	Since all seven men had married her , when people rise from the dead , whose wife will she be ? ”
40022029	Jesus answered , “ You don’t understand , because you don’t know what the Scriptures say , and you don’t know about the power of God .
40022030	When people rise from the dead , they will not marry , nor will they be given to someone to marry . They will be like the angels in heaven .
40022031	Surely you have read what God said to you about rising from the dead .
40022032	God said , ‘ I am the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . ’ God is the God of the living , not the dead . ”
40022033	When the people heard this , they were amazed at Jesus’ teaching .
40022034	When the Pharisees learned that the Sadducees could not argue with Jesus’ answers to them , the Pharisees met together .
40022035	One Pharisee , who was an expert on the law of Moses , asked Jesus this question to test him :
40022036	“ Teacher , which command in the law is the most important ? ”
40022037	Jesus answered , “ ‘ Love the Lord your God with all your heart , all your soul , and all your mind . ’
40022038	This is the first and most important command .
40022039	And the second command is like the first : ‘ Love your neighbor as you love yourself . ’
40022040	All the law and the writings of the prophets depend on these two commands . ”
40022041	While the Pharisees were together , Jesus asked them ,
40022042	“ What do you think about the Christ ? Whose son is he ? ” They answered , “ The Christ is the Son of David . ”
40022043	Then Jesus said to them , “ Then why did David call him ‘ Lord ’ ? David , speaking by the power of the Holy Spirit , said ,
40022044	‘ The Lord said to my Lord , “ Sit by me at my right side , until I put your enemies under your control . ” ’
40022045	David calls the Christ ‘ Lord , ’ so how can the Christ be his son ? ”
40022046	None of the Pharisees could answer Jesus’ question , and after that day no one was brave enough to ask him any more questions .
40023001	Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his followers ,
40023002	“ The teachers of the law and the Pharisees have the authority to tell you what the law of Moses says .
40023003	So you should obey and follow whatever they tell you , but their lives are not good examples for you to follow . They tell you to do things , but they themselves don’t do them .
40023004	They make strict rules and try to force people to obey them , but they are unwilling to help those who struggle under the weight of their rules .
40023005	“ They do good things so that other people will see them . They enlarge the little boxes holding Scriptures that they wear , and they make their special prayer clothes very long .
40023006	Those Pharisees and teachers of the law love to have the most important seats at feasts and in the synagogues .
40023007	They love people to greet them with respect in the marketplaces , and they love to have people call them ‘ Teacher . ’
40023008	“ But you must not be called ‘ Teacher , ’ because you have only one Teacher , and you are all brothers and sisters together .
40023009	And don’t call any person on earth ‘ Father , ’ because you have one Father , who is in heaven .
40023010	And you should not be called ‘ Master , ’ because you have only one Master , the Christ .
40023011	Whoever is your servant is the greatest among you .
40023012	Whoever makes himself great will be made humble . Whoever makes himself humble will be made great .
40023013	“ How terrible for you , teachers of the law and Pharisees ! You are hypocrites ! You close the door for people to enter the kingdom of heaven . You yourselves don’t enter , and you stop others who are trying to enter . [
40023014	How terrible for you , teachers of the law and Pharisees . You are hypocrites . You take away widows’ houses , and you say long prayers so that people will notice you . So you will have a worse punishment . ]
40023015	“ How terrible for you , teachers of the law and Pharisees ! You are hypocrites ! You travel across land and sea to find one person who will change to your ways . When you find that person , you make him more fit for hell than you are .
40023016	“ How terrible for you ! You guide the people , but you are blind . You say , ‘ If people swear by the Temple when they make a promise , that means nothing . But if they swear by the gold that is in the Temple , they must keep that promise . ’
40023017	You are blind fools ! Which is greater : the gold or the Temple that makes that gold holy ?
40023018	And you say , ‘ If people swear by the altar when they make a promise , that means nothing . But if they swear by the gift on the altar , they must keep that promise . ’
40023019	You are blind ! Which is greater : the gift or the altar that makes the gift holy ?
40023020	The person who swears by the altar is really using the altar and also everything on the altar .
40023021	And the person who swears by the Temple is really using the Temple and also everything in the Temple .
40023022	The person who swears by heaven is also using God’s throne and the One who sits on that throne .
40023023	“ How terrible for you , teachers of the law and Pharisees ! You are hypocrites ! You give to God one-tenth of everything you earn — even your mint , dill , and cumin . But you don’t obey the really important teachings of the law — justice , mercy , and being loyal . These are the things you should do , as well as those other things .
40023024	You guide the people , but you are blind ! You are like a person who picks a fly out of a drink and then swallows a camel !
40023025	“ How terrible for you , teachers of the law and Pharisees ! You are hypocrites ! You wash the outside of your cups and dishes , but inside they are full of things you got by cheating others and by pleasing only yourselves .
40023026	Pharisees , you are blind ! First make the inside of the cup clean , and then the outside of the cup can be truly clean .
40023027	“ How terrible for you , teachers of the law and Pharisees ! You are hypocrites ! You are like tombs that are painted white . Outside , those tombs look fine , but inside , they are full of the bones of dead people and all kinds of unclean things .
40023028	It is the same with you . People look at you and think you are good , but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and evil .
40023029	“ How terrible for you , teachers of the law and Pharisees ! You are hypocrites ! You build tombs for the prophets , and you show honor to the graves of those who lived good lives .
40023030	You say , ‘ If we had lived during the time of our ancestors , we would not have helped them kill the prophets . ’
40023031	But you give proof that you are descendants of those who murdered the prophets .
40023032	And you will complete the sin that your ancestors started .
40023033	“ You are snakes ! A family of poisonous snakes ! How are you going to escape God’s judgment ?
40023034	So I tell you this : I am sending to you prophets and wise men and teachers . Some of them you will kill and crucify . Some of them you will beat in your synagogues and chase from town to town .
40023035	So you will be guilty for the death of all the good people who have been killed on earth — from the murder of that good man Abel to the murder of Zechariah son of Berakiah , whom you murdered between the Temple and the altar .
40023036	I tell you the truth , all of these things will happen to you people who are living now .
40023037	“ Jerusalem , Jerusalem ! You kill the prophets and stone to death those who are sent to you . Many times I wanted to gather your people as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings , but you did not let me .
40023038	Now your house will be left completely empty .
40023039	I tell you , you will not see me again until that time when you will say , ‘ God bless the One who comes in the name of the Lord . ’ ”
40024001	As Jesus left the Temple and was walking away , his followers came up to show him the Temple’s buildings .
40024002	Jesus asked , “ Do you see all these buildings ? I tell you the truth , not one stone will be left on another . Every stone will be thrown down to the ground . ”
40024003	Later , as Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives , his followers came to be alone with him . They said , “ Tell us , when will these things happen ? And what will be the sign that it is time for you to come again and for this age to end ? ”
40024004	Jesus answered , “ Be careful that no one fools you .
40024005	Many will come in my name , saying , ‘ I am the Christ , ’ and they will fool many people .
40024006	You will hear about wars and stories of wars that are coming , but don’t be afraid . These things must happen before the end comes .
40024007	Nations will fight against other nations ; kingdoms will fight against other kingdoms . There will be times when there is no food for people to eat , and there will be earthquakes in different places .
40024008	These things are like the first pains when something new is about to be born .
40024009	“ Then people will arrest you , hand you over to be hurt , and kill you . They will hate you because you believe in me .
40024010	At that time , many will lose their faith , and they will turn against each other and hate each other .
40024011	Many false prophets will come and cause many people to believe lies .
40024012	There will be more and more evil in the world , so most people will stop showing their love for each other .
40024013	But those people who keep their faith until the end will be saved .
40024014	The Good News about God’s kingdom will be preached in all the world , to every nation . Then the end will come .
40024015	“ Daniel the prophet spoke about ‘ a blasphemous object that brings destruction . ’ You will see this standing in the holy place . ” ( You who read this should understand what it means . )
40024016	“ At that time , the people in Judea should run away to the mountains .
40024017	If people are on the roofs of their houses , they must not go down to get anything out of their houses .
40024018	If people are in the fields , they must not go back to get their coats .
40024019	At that time , how terrible it will be for women who are pregnant or have nursing babies !
40024020	Pray that it will not be winter or a Sabbath day when these things happen and you have to run away ,
40024021	because at that time there will be much trouble . There will be more trouble than there has ever been since the beginning of the world until now , and nothing as bad will ever happen again .
40024022	God has decided to make that terrible time short . Otherwise , no one would go on living . But God will make that time short to help the people he has chosen .
40024023	At that time , someone might say to you , ‘ Look , there is the Christ ! ’ Or another person might say , ‘ There he is ! ’ But don’t believe them .
40024024	False Christs and false prophets will come and perform great wonders and miracles . They will try to fool even the people God has chosen , if that is possible .
40024025	Now I have warned you about this before it happens .
40024026	“ If people tell you , ‘ The Christ is in the desert , ’ don’t go there . If they say , ‘ The Christ is in the inner room , ’ don’t believe it .
40024027	When the Son of Man comes , he will be seen by everyone , like lightning flashing from the east to the west .
40024028	Wherever the dead body is , there the vultures will gather .
40024029	“ Soon after the trouble of those days , ‘ the sun will grow dark , and the moon will not give its light . The stars will fall from the sky . And the powers of the heavens will be shaken . ’
40024030	“ At that time , the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky . Then all the peoples of the world will cry . They will see the Son of Man coming on clouds in the sky with great power and glory .
40024031	He will use a loud trumpet to send his angels all around the earth , and they will gather his chosen people from every part of the world .
40024032	“ Learn a lesson from the fig tree : When its branches become green and soft and new leaves appear , you know summer is near .
40024033	In the same way , when you see all these things happening , you will know that the time is near , ready to come .
40024034	I tell you the truth , all these things will happen while the people of this time are still living .
40024035	Earth and sky will be destroyed , but the words I have said will never be destroyed .
40024036	“ No one knows when that day or time will be , not the angels in heaven , not even the Son . Only the Father knows .
40024037	When the Son of Man comes , it will be like what happened during Noah’s time .
40024038	In those days before the flood , people were eating and drinking , marrying and giving their children to be married , until the day Noah entered the boat .
40024039	They knew nothing about what was happening until the flood came and destroyed them . It will be the same when the Son of Man comes .
40024040	Two men will be in the field . One will be taken , and the other will be left .
40024041	Two women will be grinding grain with a mill . One will be taken , and the other will be left .
40024042	“ So always be ready , because you don’t know the day your Lord will come .
40024043	Remember this : If the owner of the house knew what time of night a thief was coming , the owner would watch and not let the thief break in .
40024044	So you also must be ready , because the Son of Man will come at a time you don’t expect him .
40024045	“ Who is the wise and loyal servant that the master trusts to give the other servants their food at the right time ?
40024046	When the master comes and finds the servant doing his work , the servant will be blessed .
40024047	I tell you the truth , the master will choose that servant to take care of everything he owns .
40024048	But suppose that evil servant thinks to himself , ‘ My master will not come back soon , ’
40024049	and he begins to beat the other servants and eat and get drunk with others like him ?
40024050	The master will come when that servant is not ready and is not expecting him .
40024051	Then the master will cut him in pieces and send him away to be with the hypocrites , where people will cry and grind their teeth with pain .
40025001	“ At that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten bridesmaids who took their lamps and went to wait for the bridegroom .
40025002	Five of them were foolish and five were wise .
40025003	The five foolish bridesmaids took their lamps , but they did not take more oil for the lamps to burn .
40025004	The wise bridesmaids took their lamps and more oil in jars .
40025005	Because the bridegroom was late , they became sleepy and went to sleep .
40025006	“ At midnight someone cried out , ‘ The bridegroom is coming ! Come and meet him ! ’
40025007	Then all the bridesmaids woke up and got their lamps ready .
40025008	But the foolish ones said to the wise , ‘ Give us some of your oil , because our lamps are going out . ’
40025009	The wise bridesmaids answered , ‘ No , the oil we have might not be enough for all of us . Go to the people who sell oil and buy some for yourselves . ’
40025010	“ So while the five foolish bridesmaids went to buy oil , the bridegroom came . The bridesmaids who were ready went in with the bridegroom to the wedding feast . Then the door was closed and locked .
40025011	“ Later the others came back and said , ‘ Sir , sir , open the door to let us in . ’
40025012	But the bridegroom answered , ‘ I tell you the truth , I don’t want to know you . ’
40025013	“ So always be ready , because you don’t know the day or the hour the Son of Man will come .
40025014	“ The kingdom of heaven is like a man who was going to another place for a visit . Before he left , he called for his servants and told them to take care of his things while he was gone .
40025015	He gave one servant five bags of gold , another servant two bags of gold , and a third servant one bag of gold , to each one as much as he could handle . Then he left .
40025016	The servant who got five bags went quickly to invest the money and earned five more bags .
40025017	In the same way , the servant who had two bags invested them and earned two more .
40025018	But the servant who got one bag went out and dug a hole in the ground and hid the master’s money .
40025019	“ After a long time the master came home and asked the servants what they did with his money .
40025020	The servant who was given five bags of gold brought five more bags to the master and said , ‘ Master , you trusted me to care for five bags of gold , so I used your five bags to earn five more . ’
40025021	The master answered , ‘ You did well . You are a good and loyal servant . Because you were loyal with small things , I will let you care for much greater things . Come and share my joy with me . ’
40025022	“ Then the servant who had been given two bags of gold came to the master and said , ‘ Master , you gave me two bags of gold to care for , so I used your two bags to earn two more . ’
40025023	The master answered , ‘ You did well . You are a good and loyal servant . Because you were loyal with small things , I will let you care for much greater things . Come and share my joy with me . ’
40025024	“ Then the servant who had been given one bag of gold came to the master and said , ‘ Master , I knew that you were a hard man . You harvest things you did not plant . You gather crops where you did not sow any seed .
40025025	So I was afraid and went and hid your money in the ground . Here is your bag of gold . ’
40025026	The master answered , ‘ You are a wicked and lazy servant ! You say you knew that I harvest things I did not plant and that I gather crops where I did not sow any seed .
40025027	So you should have put my gold in the bank . Then , when I came home , I would have received my gold back with interest . ’
40025028	“ So the master told his other servants , ‘ Take the bag of gold from that servant and give it to the servant who has ten bags of gold .
40025029	Those who have much will get more , and they will have much more than they need . But those who do not have much will have everything taken away from them . ’
40025030	Then the master said , ‘ Throw that useless servant outside , into the darkness where people will cry and grind their teeth with pain . ’
40025031	“ The Son of Man will come again in his great glory , with all his angels . He will be King and sit on his great throne .
40025032	All the nations of the world will be gathered before him , and he will separate them into two groups as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats .
40025033	The Son of Man will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left .
40025034	“ Then the King will say to the people on his right , ‘ Come , my Father has given you his blessing . Receive the kingdom God has prepared for you since the world was made .
40025035	I was hungry , and you gave me food . I was thirsty , and you gave me something to drink . I was alone and away from home , and you invited me into your house .
40025036	I was without clothes , and you gave me something to wear . I was sick , and you cared for me . I was in prison , and you visited me . ’
40025037	“ Then the good people will answer , ‘ Lord , when did we see you hungry and give you food , or thirsty and give you something to drink ?
40025038	When did we see you alone and away from home and invite you into our house ? When did we see you without clothes and give you something to wear ?
40025039	When did we see you sick or in prison and care for you ? ’
40025040	“ Then the King will answer , ‘ I tell you the truth , anything you did for even the least of my people here , you also did for me . ’
40025041	“ Then the King will say to those on his left , ‘ Go away from me . You will be punished . Go into the fire that burns forever that was prepared for the devil and his angels .
40025042	I was hungry , and you gave me nothing to eat . I was thirsty , and you gave me nothing to drink .
40025043	I was alone and away from home , and you did not invite me into your house . I was without clothes , and you gave me nothing to wear . I was sick and in prison , and you did not care for me . ’
40025044	“ Then those people will answer , ‘ Lord , when did we see you hungry or thirsty or alone and away from home or without clothes or sick or in prison ? When did we see these things and not help you ? ’
40025045	“ Then the King will answer , ‘ I tell you the truth , anything you refused to do for even the least of my people here , you refused to do for me . ’
40025046	“ These people will go off to be punished forever , but the good people will go to live forever . ”
40026001	After Jesus finished saying all these things , he told his followers ,
40026002	“ You know that the day after tomorrow is the day of the Passover Feast . On that day the Son of Man will be given to his enemies to be crucified . ”
40026003	Then the leading priests and the elders had a meeting at the palace of the high priest , named Caiaphas .
40026004	At the meeting , they planned to set a trap to arrest Jesus and kill him .
40026005	But they said , “ We must not do it during the feast , because the people might cause a riot . ”
40026006	Jesus was in Bethany at the house of Simon , who had a skin disease .
40026007	While Jesus was there , a woman approached him with an alabaster jar filled with expensive perfume . She poured this perfume on Jesus’ head while he was eating .
40026008	His followers were upset when they saw the woman do this . They asked , “ Why waste that perfume ?
40026009	It could have been sold for a great deal of money and the money given to the poor . ”
40026010	Knowing what had happened , Jesus said , “ Why are you troubling this woman ? She did an excellent thing for me .
40026011	You will always have the poor with you , but you will not always have me .
40026012	This woman poured perfume on my body to prepare me for burial .
40026013	I tell you the truth , wherever the Good News is preached in all the world , what this woman has done will be told , and people will remember her . ”
40026014	Then one of the twelve apostles , Judas Iscariot , went to talk to the leading priests .
40026015	He said , “ What will you pay me for giving Jesus to you ? ” And they gave him thirty silver coins .
40026016	After that , Judas watched for the best time to turn Jesus in .
40026017	On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread , the followers came to Jesus . They said , “ Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover meal ? ”
40026018	Jesus answered , “ Go into the city to a certain man and tell him , ‘ The Teacher says : “ The chosen time is near . I will have the Passover with my followers at your house . ” ’ ”
40026019	The followers did what Jesus told them to do , and they prepared the Passover meal .
40026020	In the evening Jesus was sitting at the table with his twelve followers .
40026021	As they were eating , Jesus said , “ I tell you the truth , one of you will turn against me . ”
40026022	This made the followers very sad . Each one began to say to Jesus , “ Surely , Lord , I am not the one who will turn against you , am I ? ”
40026023	Jesus answered , “ The man who has dipped his hand with me into the bowl is the one who will turn against me .
40026024	The Son of Man will die , just as the Scriptures say . But how terrible it will be for the person who hands the Son of Man over to be killed . It would be better for him if he had never been born . ”
40026025	Then Judas , who would give Jesus to his enemies , said to Jesus , “ Teacher , surely I am not the one , am I ? ” Jesus answered , “ Yes , it is you . ”
40026026	While they were eating , Jesus took some bread and thanked God for it and broke it . Then he gave it to his followers and said , “ Take this bread and eat it ; this is my body . ”
40026027	Then Jesus took a cup and thanked God for it and gave it to the followers . He said , “ Every one of you drink this .
40026028	This is my blood which is the new agreement that God makes with his people . This blood is poured out for many to forgive their sins .
40026029	I tell you this : I will not drink of this fruit of the vine again until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom . ”
40026030	After singing a hymn , they went out to the Mount of Olives .
40026031	Jesus told his followers , “ Tonight you will all stumble in your faith on account of me , because it is written in the Scriptures : ‘ I will kill the shepherd , and the sheep will scatter . ’
40026032	But after I rise from the dead , I will go ahead of you into Galilee . ”
40026033	Peter said , “ Everyone else may stumble in their faith because of you , but I will not . ”
40026034	Jesus said , “ I tell you the truth , tonight before the rooster crows you will say three times that you don’t know me . ”
40026035	But Peter said , “ I will never say that I don’t know you ! I will even die with you ! ” And all the other followers said the same thing .
40026036	Then Jesus went with his followers to a place called Gethsemane . He said to them , “ Sit here while I go over there and pray . ”
40026037	He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with him , and he began to be very sad and troubled .
40026038	He said to them , “ My heart is full of sorrow , to the point of death . Stay here and watch with me . ”
40026039	After walking a little farther away from them , Jesus fell to the ground and prayed , “ My Father , if it is possible , do not give me this cup of suffering . But do what you want , not what I want . ”
40026040	Then Jesus went back to his followers and found them asleep . He said to Peter , “ You men could not stay awake with me for one hour ?
40026041	Stay awake and pray for strength against temptation . The spirit wants to do what is right , but the body is weak . ”
40026042	Then Jesus went away a second time and prayed , “ My Father , if it is not possible for this painful thing to be taken from me , and if I must do it , I pray that what you want will be done . ”
40026043	Then he went back to his followers , and again he found them asleep , because their eyes were heavy .
40026044	So Jesus left them and went away and prayed a third time , saying the same thing .
40026045	Then Jesus went back to his followers and said , “ Are you still sleeping and resting ? The time has come for the Son of Man to be handed over to sinful people .
40026046	Get up , we must go . Look , here comes the man who has turned against me . ”
40026047	While Jesus was still speaking , Judas , one of the twelve apostles , came up . With him were many people carrying swords and clubs who had been sent from the leading priests and the Jewish elders of the people .
40026048	Judas had planned to give them a signal , saying , “ The man I kiss is Jesus . Arrest him . ”
40026049	At once Judas went to Jesus and said , “ Greetings , Teacher ! ” and kissed him .
40026050	Jesus answered , “ Friend , do what you came to do . ” Then the people came and grabbed Jesus and arrested him .
40026051	When that happened , one of Jesus’ followers reached for his sword and pulled it out . He struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear .
40026052	Jesus said to the man , “ Put your sword back in its place . All who use swords will be killed with swords .
40026053	Surely you know I could ask my Father , and he would give me more than twelve armies of angels .
40026054	But it must happen this way to bring about what the Scriptures say . ”
40026055	Then Jesus said to the crowd , “ You came to get me with swords and clubs as if I were a criminal . Every day I sat in the Temple teaching , and you did not arrest me there .
40026056	But all these things have happened so that it will come about as the prophets wrote . ” Then all of Jesus’ followers left him and ran away .
40026057	Those people who arrested Jesus led him to the house of Caiaphas , the high priest , where the teachers of the law and the elders were gathered .
40026058	Peter followed far behind to the courtyard of the high priest’s house , and he sat down with the guards to see what would happen to Jesus .
40026059	The leading priests and the whole Jewish council tried to find something false against Jesus so they could kill him .
40026060	Many people came and told lies about him , but the council could find no real reason to kill him . Then two people came and said ,
40026061	“ This man said , ‘ I can destroy the Temple of God and build it again in three days . ’ ”
40026062	Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus , “ Aren’t you going to answer ? Don’t you have something to say about their charges against you ? ”
40026063	But Jesus said nothing . Again the high priest said to Jesus , “ I command you by the power of the living God : Tell us if you are the Christ , the Son of God . ”
40026064	Jesus answered , “ Those are your words . But I tell you , in the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of God , the Powerful One , and coming on clouds in the sky . ”
40026065	When the high priest heard this , he tore his clothes and said , “ This man has said things that are against God ! We don’t need any more witnesses ; you all heard him say these things against God .
40026066	What do you think ? ” The people answered , “ He should die . ”
40026067	Then the people there spat in Jesus’ face and beat him with their fists . Others slapped him .
40026068	They said , “ Prove to us that you are a prophet , you Christ ! Tell us who hit you ! ”
40026069	At that time , as Peter was sitting in the courtyard , a servant girl came to him and said , “ You also were with Jesus of Galilee . ”
40026070	But Peter said to all the people there that he was never with Jesus . He said , “ I don’t know what you are talking about . ”
40026071	When he left the courtyard and was at the gate , another girl saw him . She said to the people there , “ This man was with Jesus of Nazareth . ”
40026072	Again , Peter said he was never with him , saying , “ I swear I don’t know this man Jesus ! ”
40026073	A short time later , some people standing there went to Peter and said , “ Surely you are one of those who followed Jesus . The way you talk shows it . ”
40026074	Then Peter began to place a curse on himself and swear , “ I don’t know the man . ” At once , a rooster crowed .
40026075	And Peter remembered what Jesus had told him : “ Before the rooster crows , you will say three times that you don’t know me . ” Then Peter went outside and cried painfully .
40027001	Early the next morning , all the leading priests and elders of the people decided that Jesus should die .
40027002	They tied him , led him away , and turned him over to Pilate , the governor .
40027003	Judas , the one who had given Jesus to his enemies , saw that they had decided to kill Jesus . Then he was very sorry for what he had done . So he took the thirty silver coins back to the priests and the leaders ,
40027004	saying , “ I sinned ; I handed over to you an innocent man . ” The leaders answered , “ What is that to us ? That’s your problem , not ours . ”
40027005	So Judas threw the money into the Temple . Then he went off and hanged himself .
40027006	The leading priests picked up the silver coins in the Temple and said , “ Our law does not allow us to keep this money with the Temple money , because it has paid for a man’s death . ”
40027007	So they decided to use the coins to buy Potter’s Field as a place to bury strangers who died in Jerusalem .
40027008	That is why that field is still called the Field of Blood .
40027009	So what Jeremiah the prophet had said came true : “ They took thirty silver coins . That is how little the Israelites thought he was worth .
40027010	They used those thirty silver coins to buy the potter’s field , as the Lord commanded me . ”
40027011	Jesus stood before Pilate the governor , and Pilate asked him , “ Are you the king of the Jews ? ” Jesus answered , “ Those are your words . ”
40027012	When the leading priests and the elders accused Jesus , he said nothing .
40027013	So Pilate said to Jesus , “ Don’t you hear them accusing you of all these things ? ”
40027014	But Jesus said nothing in answer to Pilate , and Pilate was very surprised at this .
40027015	Every year at the time of Passover the governor would free one prisoner whom the people chose .
40027016	At that time there was a man in prison , named Barabbas , who was known to be very bad .
40027017	When the people gathered at Pilate’s house , Pilate said , “ Whom do you want me to set free : Barabbas or Jesus who is called the Christ ? ”
40027018	Pilate knew that they turned Jesus in to him because they were jealous .
40027019	While Pilate was sitting there on the judge’s seat , his wife sent this message to him : “ Don’t do anything to that man , because he is innocent . Today I had a dream about him , and it troubled me very much . ”
40027020	But the leading priests and elders convinced the crowd to ask for Barabbas to be freed and for Jesus to be killed .
40027021	Pilate said , “ I have Barabbas and Jesus . Which do you want me to set free for you ? ” The people answered , “ Barabbas . ”
40027022	Pilate asked , “ So what should I do with Jesus , the one called the Christ ? ” They all answered , “ Crucify him ! ”
40027023	Pilate asked , “ Why ? What wrong has he done ? ” But they shouted louder , “ Crucify him ! ”
40027024	When Pilate saw that he could do nothing about this and that a riot was starting , he took some water and washed his hands in front of the crowd . Then he said , “ I am not guilty of this man’s death . You are the ones who are causing it ! ”
40027025	All the people answered , “ We and our children will be responsible for his death . ”
40027026	Then he set Barabbas free . But Jesus was beaten with whips and handed over to the soldiers to be crucified .
40027027	The governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the governor’s palace , and they all gathered around him .
40027028	They took off his clothes and put a red robe on him .
40027029	Using thorny branches , they made a crown , put it on his head , and put a stick in his right hand . Then the soldiers bowed before Jesus and made fun of him , saying , “ Hail , King of the Jews ! ”
40027030	They spat on Jesus . Then they took his stick and began to beat him on the head .
40027031	After they finished , the soldiers took off the robe and put his own clothes on him again . Then they led him away to be crucified .
40027032	As the soldiers were going out of the city with Jesus , they forced a man from Cyrene , named Simon , to carry the cross for Jesus .
40027033	They all came to the place called Golgotha , which means the Place of the Skull .
40027034	The soldiers gave Jesus wine mixed with gall to drink . He tasted the wine but refused to drink it .
40027035	When the soldiers had crucified him , they threw lots to decide who would get his clothes .
40027036	The soldiers sat there and continued watching him .
40027037	They put a sign above Jesus’ head with a charge against him . It said : this is jesus , the king of the jews .
40027038	Two robbers were crucified beside Jesus , one on the right and the other on the left .
40027039	People walked by and insulted Jesus and shook their heads ,
40027040	saying , “ You said you could destroy the Temple and build it again in three days . So save yourself ! Come down from that cross if you are really the Son of God ! ”
40027041	The leading priests , the teachers of the law , and the Jewish elders were also making fun of Jesus .
40027042	They said , “ He saved others , but he can’t save himself ! He says he is the king of Israel ! If he is the king , let him come down now from the cross . Then we will believe in him .
40027043	He trusts in God , so let God save him now , if God really wants him . He himself said , ‘ I am the Son of God . ’ ”
40027044	And in the same way , the robbers who were being crucified beside Jesus also insulted him .
40027045	At noon the whole country became dark , and the darkness lasted for three hours .
40027046	About three o’clock Jesus cried out in a loud voice , “ Eli , Eli , lama sabachthani ? ” This means , “ My God , my God , why have you abandoned me ? ”
40027047	Some of the people standing there who heard this said , “ He is calling Elijah . ”
40027048	Quickly one of them ran and got a sponge and filled it with vinegar and tied it to a stick and gave it to Jesus to drink .
40027049	But the others said , “ Don’t bother him . We want to see if Elijah will come to save him . ”
40027050	But Jesus cried out again in a loud voice and died .
40027051	Then the curtain in the Temple was torn into two pieces , from the top to the bottom . Also , the earth shook and rocks broke apart .
40027052	The graves opened , and many of God’s people who had died were raised from the dead .
40027053	They came out of the graves after Jesus was raised from the dead and went into the holy city , where they appeared to many people .
40027054	When the army officer and the soldiers guarding Jesus saw this earthquake and everything else that happened , they were very frightened and said , “ He really was the Son of God ! ”
40027055	Many women who had followed Jesus from Galilee to help him were standing at a distance from the cross , watching .
40027056	Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James and Joseph , and the mother of James and John were there .
40027057	That evening a rich man named Joseph , a follower of Jesus from the town of Arimathea , came to Jerusalem .
40027058	Joseph went to Pilate and asked to have Jesus’ body . So Pilate gave orders for the soldiers to give it to Joseph .
40027059	Then Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth .
40027060	He put Jesus’ body in a new tomb that he had cut out of a wall of rock , and he rolled a very large stone to block the entrance of the tomb . Then Joseph went away .
40027061	Mary Magdalene and the other woman named Mary were sitting near the tomb .
40027062	The next day , the day after Preparation Day , the leading priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate .
40027063	They said , “ Sir , we remember that while that liar was still alive he said , ‘ After three days I will rise from the dead . ’
40027064	So give the order for the tomb to be guarded closely till the third day . Otherwise , his followers might come and steal the body and tell people that he has risen from the dead . That lie would be even worse than the first one . ”
40027065	Pilate said , “ Take some soldiers and go guard the tomb the best way you know . ”
40027066	So they all went to the tomb and made it safe from thieves by sealing the stone in the entrance and putting soldiers there to guard it .
40028001	The day after the Sabbath day was the first day of the week . At dawn on the first day , Mary Magdalene and another woman named Mary went to look at the tomb .
40028002	At that time there was a strong earthquake . An angel of the Lord came down from heaven , went to the tomb , and rolled the stone away from the entrance . Then he sat on the stone .
40028003	He was shining as bright as lightning , and his clothes were white as snow .
40028004	The soldiers guarding the tomb shook with fear because of the angel , and they became like dead men .
40028005	The angel said to the women , “ Don’t be afraid . I know that you are looking for Jesus , who has been crucified .
40028006	He is not here . He has risen from the dead as he said he would . Come and see the place where his body was .
40028007	And go quickly and tell his followers , ‘ Jesus has risen from the dead . He is going into Galilee ahead of you , and you will see him there . ’ ” Then the angel said , “ Now I have told you . ”
40028008	The women left the tomb quickly . They were afraid , but they were also very happy . They ran to tell Jesus’ followers what had happened .
40028009	Suddenly , Jesus met them and said , “ Greetings . ” The women came up to him , took hold of his feet , and worshiped him .
40028010	Then Jesus said to them , “ Don’t be afraid . Go and tell my followers to go on to Galilee , and they will see me there . ”
40028011	While the women went to tell Jesus’ followers , some of the soldiers who had been guarding the tomb went into the city to tell the leading priests everything that had happened .
40028012	Then the priests met with the elders and made a plan . They paid the soldiers a large amount of money
40028013	and said to them , “ Tell the people that Jesus’ followers came during the night and stole the body while you were asleep .
40028014	If the governor hears about this , we will satisfy him and save you from trouble . ”
40028015	So the soldiers kept the money and did as they were told . And that story is still spread among the people even today .
40028016	The eleven followers went to Galilee to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go .
40028017	On the mountain they saw Jesus and worshiped him , but some of them did not believe it was really Jesus .
40028018	Then Jesus came to them and said , “ All power in heaven and on earth is given to me .
40028019	So go and make followers of all people in the world . Baptize them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit .
40028020	Teach them to obey everything that I have taught you , and I will be with you always , even until the end of this age . ”
41001001	This is the beginning of the Good News about Jesus Christ , the Son of God ,
41001002	as the prophet Isaiah wrote : “ I will send my messenger ahead of you , who will prepare your way . ”
41001003	“ This is a voice of one who calls out in the desert : ‘ Prepare the way for the Lord . Make the road straight for him . ’ ”
41001004	John was baptizing people in the desert and preaching a baptism of changed hearts and lives for the forgiveness of sins .
41001005	All the people from Judea and Jerusalem were going out to him . They confessed their sins and were baptized by him in the Jordan River .
41001006	John wore clothes made from camel’s hair , had a leather belt around his waist , and ate locusts and wild honey .
41001007	This is what John preached to the people : “ There is one coming after me who is greater than I ; I am not good enough even to kneel down and untie his sandals .
41001008	I baptize you with water , but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit . ”
41001009	At that time Jesus came from the town of Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River .
41001010	Immediately , as Jesus was coming up out of the water , he saw heaven open . The Holy Spirit came down on him like a dove ,
41001011	and a voice came from heaven : “ You are my Son , whom I love , and I am very pleased with you . ”
41001012	Then the Spirit sent Jesus into the desert .
41001013	He was in the desert forty days and was tempted by Satan . He was with the wild animals , and the angels came and took care of him .
41001014	After John was put in prison , Jesus went into Galilee , preaching the Good News from God .
41001015	He said , “ The right time has come . The kingdom of God is near . Change your hearts and lives and believe the Good News ! ”
41001016	When Jesus was walking by Lake Galilee , he saw Simon and his brother Andrew throwing a net into the lake because they were fishermen .
41001017	Jesus said to them , “ Come follow me , and I will make you fish for people . ”
41001018	So Simon and Andrew immediately left their nets and followed him .
41001019	Going a little farther , Jesus saw two more brothers , James and John , the sons of Zebedee . They were in a boat , mending their nets .
41001020	Jesus immediately called them , and they left their father in the boat with the hired workers and followed Jesus .
41001021	Jesus and his followers went to Capernaum . On the Sabbath day He went to the synagogue and began to teach .
41001022	The people were amazed at his teaching , because he taught like a person who had authority , not like their teachers of the law .
41001023	Just then , a man was there in the synagogue who had an evil spirit in him . He shouted ,
41001024	“ Jesus of Nazareth ! What do you want with us ? Did you come to destroy us ? I know who you are — God’s Holy One ! ”
41001025	Jesus commanded the evil spirit , “ Be quiet ! Come out of the man ! ”
41001026	The evil spirit shook the man violently , gave a loud cry , and then came out of him .
41001027	The people were so amazed they asked each other , “ What is happening here ? This man is teaching something new , and with authority . He even gives commands to evil spirits , and they obey him . ”
41001028	And the news about Jesus spread quickly everywhere in the area of Galilee .
41001029	As soon as Jesus and his followers left the synagogue , they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew .
41001030	Simon’s mother-in-law was sick in bed with a fever , and the people told Jesus about her .
41001031	So Jesus went to her bed , took her hand , and helped her up . The fever left her , and she began serving them .
41001032	That evening , after the sun went down , the people brought to Jesus all who were sick and had demons in them .
41001033	The whole town gathered at the door .
41001034	Jesus healed many who had different kinds of sicknesses , and he forced many demons to leave people . But he would not allow the demons to speak , because they knew who he was .
41001035	Early the next morning , while it was still dark , Jesus woke and left the house . He went to a lonely place , where he prayed .
41001036	Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus .
41001037	When they found him , they said , “ Everyone is looking for you ! ”
41001038	Jesus answered , “ We should go to other towns around here so I can preach there too . That is the reason I came . ”
41001039	So he went everywhere in Galilee , preaching in the synagogues and forcing out demons .
41001040	A man with a skin disease came to Jesus . He fell to his knees and begged Jesus , “ You can heal me if you will . ”
41001041	Jesus felt sorry for the man , so he reached out his hand and touched him and said , “ I will . Be healed ! ”
41001042	Immediately the disease left the man , and he was healed .
41001043	Jesus told the man to go away at once , but he warned him strongly ,
41001044	“ Don’t tell anyone about this . But go and show yourself to the priest . And offer the gift Moses commanded for people who are made well . This will show the people what I have done . ”
41001045	The man left there , but he began to tell everyone that Jesus had healed him , and so he spread the news about Jesus . As a result , Jesus could not enter a town if people saw him . He stayed in places where nobody lived , but people came to him from everywhere .
41002001	A few days later , when Jesus came back to Capernaum , the news spread that he was at home .
41002002	Many people gathered together so that there was no room in the house , not even outside the door . And Jesus was teaching them God’s message .
41002003	Four people came , carrying a paralyzed man .
41002004	Since they could not get to Jesus because of the crowd , they dug a hole in the roof right above where he was speaking . When they got through , they lowered the mat with the paralyzed man on it .
41002005	When Jesus saw the faith of these people , he said to the paralyzed man , “ Young man , your sins are forgiven . ”
41002006	Some of the teachers of the law were sitting there , thinking to themselves ,
41002007	“ Why does this man say things like that ? He is speaking as if he were God . Only God can forgive sins . ”
41002008	Jesus knew immediately what these teachers of the law were thinking . So he said to them , “ Why are you thinking these things ?
41002009	Which is easier : to tell this paralyzed man , ‘ Your sins are forgiven , ’ or to tell him , ‘ Stand up . Take your mat and walk ’ ?
41002010	But I will prove to you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins . ” So Jesus said to the paralyzed man ,
41002011	“ I tell you , stand up , take your mat , and go home . ”
41002012	Immediately the paralyzed man stood up , took his mat , and walked out while everyone was watching him . The people were amazed and praised God . They said , “ We have never seen anything like this ! ”
41002013	Jesus went to the lake again . The whole crowd followed him there , and he taught them .
41002014	While he was walking along , he saw a man named Levi son of Alphaeus , sitting in the tax collector’s booth . Jesus said to him , “ Follow me , ” and he stood up and followed Jesus .
41002015	Later , as Jesus was having dinner at Levi’s house , many tax collectors and “ sinners ” were eating there with Jesus and his followers . Many people like this followed Jesus .
41002016	When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw Jesus eating with the tax collectors and “ sinners , ” they asked his followers , “ Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners ? ”
41002017	Jesus heard this and said to them , “ It is not the healthy people who need a doctor , but the sick . I did not come to invite good people but to invite sinners . ”
41002018	Now the followers of John and the Pharisees often fasted for a certain time . Some people came to Jesus and said , “ Why do John’s followers and the followers of the Pharisees often fast , but your followers don’t ? ”
41002019	Jesus answered , “ The friends of the bridegroom do not fast while the bridegroom is still with them . As long as the bridegroom is with them , they cannot fast .
41002020	But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them , and then they will fast .
41002021	“ No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth over a hole in an old coat . Otherwise , the patch will shrink and pull away — the new patch will pull away from the old coat . Then the hole will be worse .
41002022	Also , no one ever pours new wine into old leather bags . Otherwise , the new wine will break the bags , and the wine will be ruined along with the bags . But new wine should be put into new leather bags . ”
41002023	One Sabbath day , as Jesus was walking through some fields of grain , his followers began to pick some grain to eat .
41002024	The Pharisees said to Jesus , “ Why are your followers doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath day ? ”
41002025	Jesus answered , “ Have you never read what David did when he and those with him were hungry and needed food ?
41002026	During the time of Abiathar the high priest , David went into God’s house and ate the holy bread , which is lawful only for priests to eat . And David also gave some of the bread to those who were with him . ”
41002027	Then Jesus said to the Pharisees , “ The Sabbath day was made to help people ; they were not made to be ruled by the Sabbath day .
41002028	So then , the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath day . ”
41003001	Another time when Jesus went into a synagogue , a man with a crippled hand was there .
41003002	Some people watched Jesus closely to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath day so they could accuse him .
41003003	Jesus said to the man with the crippled hand , “ Stand up here in the middle of everyone . ”
41003004	Then Jesus asked the people , “ Which is lawful on the Sabbath day : to do good or to do evil , to save a life or to kill ? ” But they said nothing to answer him .
41003005	Jesus was angry as he looked at the people , and he felt very sad because they were stubborn . Then he said to the man , “ Hold out your hand . ” The man held out his hand and it was healed .
41003006	Then the Pharisees left and began making plans with the Herodians about a way to kill Jesus .
41003007	Jesus left with his followers for the lake , and a large crowd from Galilee followed him .
41003008	Also many people came from Judea , from Jerusalem , from Idumea , from the lands across the Jordan River , and from the area of Tyre and Sidon . When they heard what Jesus was doing , many people came to him .
41003009	When Jesus saw the crowds , he told his followers to get a boat ready for him to keep people from crowding against him .
41003010	He had healed many people , so all the sick were pushing toward him to touch him .
41003011	When evil spirits saw Jesus , they fell down before him and shouted , “ You are the Son of God ! ”
41003012	But Jesus strongly warned them not to tell who he was .
41003013	Then Jesus went up on a mountain and called to him those he wanted , and they came to him .
41003014	Jesus chose twelve and called them apostles . He wanted them to be with him , and he wanted to send them out to preach
41003015	and to have the authority to force demons out of people .
41003016	These are the twelve men he chose : Simon ( Jesus named him Peter ) ,
41003017	James and John , the sons of Zebedee ( Jesus named them Boanerges , which means “ Sons of Thunder ” ) ,
41003018	Andrew , Philip , Bartholomew , Matthew , Thomas , James the son of Alphaeus , Thaddaeus , Simon the Zealot ,
41003019	and Judas Iscariot , who later turned against Jesus .
41003020	Then Jesus went home , but again a crowd gathered . There were so many people that Jesus and his followers could not eat .
41003021	When his family heard this , they went to get him because they thought he was out of his mind .
41003022	But the teachers of the law from Jerusalem were saying , “ Beelzebul is living inside him ! He uses power from the ruler of demons to force demons out of people . ”
41003023	So Jesus called the people together and taught them with stories . He said , “ Satan will not force himself out of people .
41003024	A kingdom that is divided cannot continue ,
41003025	and a family that is divided cannot continue .
41003026	And if Satan is against himself and fights against his own people , he cannot continue ; that is the end of Satan .
41003027	No one can enter a strong person’s house and steal his things unless he first ties up the strong person . Then he can steal things from the house .
41003028	I tell you the truth , all sins that people do and all the things people say against God can be forgiven .
41003029	But anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven ; he is guilty of a sin that continues forever . ”
41003030	Jesus said this because the teachers of the law said that he had an evil spirit inside him .
41003031	Then Jesus’ mother and brothers arrived . Standing outside , they sent someone in to tell him to come out .
41003032	Many people were sitting around Jesus , and they said to him , “ Your mother and brothers are waiting for you outside . ”
41003033	Jesus asked , “ Who are my mother and my brothers ? ”
41003034	Then he looked at those sitting around him and said , “ Here are my mother and my brothers !
41003035	My true brother and sister and mother are those who do what God wants . ”
41004001	Again Jesus began teaching by the lake . A great crowd gathered around him , so he sat down in a boat near the shore . All the people stayed on the shore close to the water .
41004002	Jesus taught them many things , using stories . He said ,
41004003	“ Listen ! A farmer went out to plant his seed .
41004004	While he was planting , some seed fell by the road , and the birds came and ate it up .
41004005	Some seed fell on rocky ground where there wasn’t much dirt . That seed grew very fast , because the ground was not deep .
41004006	But when the sun rose , the plants dried up because they did not have deep roots .
41004007	Some other seed fell among thorny weeds , which grew and choked the good plants . So those plants did not produce a crop .
41004008	Some other seed fell on good ground and began to grow . It got taller and produced a crop . Some plants made thirty times more , some made sixty times more , and some made a hundred times more . ”
41004009	Then Jesus said , “ Let those with ears use them and listen ! ”
41004010	Later , when Jesus was alone , the twelve apostles and others around him asked him about the stories .
41004011	Jesus said , “ You can know the secret about the kingdom of God . But to other people I tell everything by using stories
41004012	so that : ‘ They will look and look , but they will not learn . They will listen and listen , but they will not understand . If they did learn and understand , they would come back to me and be forgiven . ’ ”
41004013	Then Jesus said to his followers , “ Don’t you understand this story ? If you don’t , how will you understand any story ?
41004014	The farmer is like a person who plants God’s message in people .
41004015	Sometimes the teaching falls on the road . This is like the people who hear the teaching of God , but Satan quickly comes and takes away the teaching that was planted in them .
41004016	Others are like the seed planted on rocky ground . They hear the teaching and quickly accept it with joy .
41004017	But since they don’t allow the teaching to go deep into their lives , they keep it only a short time . When trouble or persecution comes because of the teaching they accepted , they quickly give up .
41004018	Others are like the seed planted among the thorny weeds . They hear the teaching ,
41004019	but the worries of this life , the temptation of wealth , and many other evil desires keep the teaching from growing and producing fruit in their lives .
41004020	Others are like the seed planted in the good ground . They hear the teaching and accept it . Then they grow and produce fruit — sometimes thirty times more , sometimes sixty times more , and sometimes a hundred times more . ”
41004021	Then Jesus said to them , “ Do you hide a lamp under a bowl or under a bed ? No ! You put the lamp on a lampstand .
41004022	Everything that is hidden will be made clear and every secret thing will be made known .
41004023	Let those with ears use them and listen !
41004024	“ Think carefully about what you hear . The way you give to others is the way God will give to you , but God will give you even more .
41004025	Those who have understanding will be given more . But those who do not have understanding , even what they have will be taken away from them . ”
41004026	Then Jesus said , “ The kingdom of God is like someone who plants seed in the ground .
41004027	Night and day , whether the person is asleep or awake , the seed still grows , but the person does not know how it grows .
41004028	By itself the earth produces grain . First the plant grows , then the head , and then all the grain in the head .
41004029	When the grain is ready , the farmer cuts it , because this is the harvest time . ”
41004030	Then Jesus said , “ How can I show you what the kingdom of God is like ? What story can I use to explain it ?
41004031	The kingdom of God is like a mustard seed , the smallest seed you plant in the ground .
41004032	But when planted , this seed grows and becomes the largest of all garden plants . It produces large branches , and the wild birds can make nests in its shade . ”
41004033	Jesus used many stories like these to teach the crowd God’s message — as much as they could understand .
41004034	He always used stories to teach them . But when he and his followers were alone , Jesus explained everything to them .
41004035	That evening , Jesus said to his followers , “ Let’s go across the lake . ”
41004036	Leaving the crowd behind , they took him in the boat just as he was . There were also other boats with them .
41004037	A very strong wind came up on the lake . The waves came over the sides and into the boat so that it was already full of water .
41004038	Jesus was at the back of the boat , sleeping with his head on a cushion . His followers woke him and said , “ Teacher , don’t you care that we are drowning ! ”
41004039	Jesus stood up and commanded the wind and said to the waves , “ Quiet ! Be still ! ” Then the wind stopped , and it became completely calm .
41004040	Jesus said to his followers , “ Why are you afraid ? Do you still have no faith ? ”
41004041	The followers were very afraid and asked each other , “ Who is this ? Even the wind and the waves obey him ! ”
41005001	Jesus and his followers went to the other side of the lake to the area of the Gerasene people .
41005002	When Jesus got out of the boat , instantly a man with an evil spirit came to him from the burial caves .
41005003	This man lived in the caves , and no one could tie him up , not even with a chain .
41005004	Many times people had used chains to tie the man’s hands and feet , but he always broke them off . No one was strong enough to control him .
41005005	Day and night he would wander around the burial caves and on the hills , screaming and cutting himself with stones .
41005006	While Jesus was still far away , the man saw him , ran to him , and fell down before him .
41005007	The man shouted in a loud voice , “ What do you want with me , Jesus , Son of the Most High God ? I command you in God’s name not to torture me ! ”
41005008	He said this because Jesus was saying to him , “ You evil spirit , come out of the man . ”
41005009	Then Jesus asked him , “ What is your name ? ” He answered , “ My name is Legion , because we are many spirits . ”
41005010	He begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of that area .
41005011	A large herd of pigs was feeding on a hill near there .
41005012	The demons begged Jesus , “ Send us into the pigs ; let us go into them . ”
41005013	So Jesus allowed them to do this . The evil spirits left the man and went into the pigs . Then the herd of pigs — about two thousand of them — rushed down the hill into the lake and were drowned .
41005014	The herdsmen ran away and went to the town and to the countryside , telling everyone about this . So people went out to see what had happened .
41005015	They came to Jesus and saw the man who used to have the many evil spirits , sitting , clothed , and in his right mind . And they were frightened .
41005016	The people who saw this told the others what had happened to the man who had the demons living in him , and they told about the pigs .
41005017	Then the people began to beg Jesus to leave their area .
41005018	As Jesus was getting back into the boat , the man who was freed from the demons begged to go with him .
41005019	But Jesus would not let him . He said , “ Go home to your family and tell them how much the Lord has done for you and how he has had mercy on you . ”
41005020	So the man left and began to tell the people in the Ten Towns about what Jesus had done for him . And everyone was amazed .
41005021	When Jesus went in the boat back to the other side of the lake , a large crowd gathered around him there .
41005022	A leader of the synagogue , named Jairus , came there , saw Jesus , and fell at his feet .
41005023	He begged Jesus , saying again and again , “ My daughter is dying . Please come and put your hands on her so she will be healed and will live . ”
41005024	So Jesus went with him . A large crowd followed Jesus and pushed very close around him .
41005025	Among them was a woman who had been bleeding for twelve years .
41005026	She had suffered very much from many doctors and had spent all the money she had , but instead of improving , she was getting worse .
41005027	When the woman heard about Jesus , she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his coat .
41005028	She thought , “ If I can just touch his clothes , I will be healed . ”
41005029	Instantly her bleeding stopped , and she felt in her body that she was healed from her disease .
41005030	At once Jesus felt power go out from him . So he turned around in the crowd and asked , “ Who touched my clothes ? ”
41005031	His followers said , “ Look at how many people are pushing against you ! And you ask , ‘ Who touched me ? ’ ”
41005032	But Jesus continued looking around to see who had touched him .
41005033	The woman , knowing that she was healed , came and fell at Jesus’ feet . Shaking with fear , she told him the whole truth .
41005034	Jesus said to her , “ Dear woman , you are made well because you believed . Go in peace ; be healed of your disease . ”
41005035	While Jesus was still speaking , some people came from the house of the synagogue leader . They said , “ Your daughter is dead . There is no need to bother the teacher anymore . ”
41005036	But Jesus paid no attention to what they said . He told the synagogue leader , “ Don’t be afraid ; just believe . ”
41005037	Jesus let only Peter , James , and John the brother of James go with him .
41005038	When they came to the house of the synagogue leader , Jesus found many people there making lots of noise and crying loudly .
41005039	Jesus entered the house and said to them , “ Why are you crying and making so much noise ? The child is not dead , only asleep . ”
41005040	But they laughed at him . So , after throwing them out of the house , Jesus took the child’s father and mother and his three followers into the room where the child was .
41005041	Taking hold of the girl’s hand , he said to her , “ Talitha , koum ! ” ( This means , “ Young girl , I tell you to stand up ! ” )
41005042	At once the girl stood right up and began walking . ( She was twelve years old . ) Everyone was completely amazed .
41005043	Jesus gave them strict orders not to tell people about this . Then he told them to give the girl something to eat .
41006001	Jesus left there and went to his hometown , and his followers went with him .
41006002	On the Sabbath day he taught in the synagogue . Many people heard him and were amazed , saying , “ Where did this man get these teachings ? What is this wisdom that has been given to him ? And where did he get the power to do miracles ?
41006003	He is just the carpenter , the son of Mary and the brother of James , Joseph , Judas , and Simon . And his sisters are here with us . ” So the people were upset with Jesus .
41006004	Jesus said to them , “ A prophet is honored everywhere except in his hometown and with his own people and in his own home . ”
41006005	So Jesus was not able to work any miracles there except to heal a few sick people by putting his hands on them .
41006006	He was amazed at how many people had no faith . Then Jesus went to other villages in that area and taught .
41006007	He called his twelve followers together and got ready to send them out two by two and gave them authority over evil spirits .
41006008	This is what Jesus commanded them : “ Take nothing for your trip except a walking stick . Take no bread , no bag , and no money in your pockets .
41006009	Wear sandals , but take only the clothes you are wearing .
41006010	When you enter a house , stay there until you leave that town .
41006011	If the people in a certain place refuse to welcome you or listen to you , leave that place . Shake its dust off your feet as a warning to them . ”
41006012	So the followers went out and preached that people should change their hearts and lives .
41006013	They forced many demons out and put olive oil on many sick people and healed them .
41006014	King Herod heard about Jesus , because he was now well known . Some people said , “ He is John the Baptist , who has risen from the dead . That is why he can work these miracles . ”
41006015	Others said , “ He is Elijah . ” Other people said , “ Jesus is a prophet , like the prophets who lived long ago . ”
41006016	When Herod heard this , he said , “ I killed John by cutting off his head . Now he has risen from the dead ! ”
41006017	Herod himself had ordered his soldiers to arrest John and put him in prison in order to please his wife , Herodias . She had been the wife of Philip , Herod’s brother , but then Herod had married her .
41006018	John had been telling Herod , “ It is not lawful for you to be married to your brother’s wife . ”
41006019	So Herodias hated John and wanted to kill him . But she couldn’t ,
41006020	because Herod was afraid of John and protected him . He knew John was a good and holy man . Also , though John’s preaching always bothered him , he enjoyed listening to John .
41006021	Then the perfect time came for Herodias to cause John’s death . On Herod’s birthday , he gave a dinner party for the most important government leaders , the commanders of his army , and the most important people in Galilee .
41006022	When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced , she pleased Herod and the people eating with him . So King Herod said to the girl , “ Ask me for anything you want , and I will give it to you . ”
41006023	He promised her , “ Anything you ask for I will give to you — up to half of my kingdom . ”
41006024	The girl went to her mother and asked , “ What should I ask for ? ” Her mother answered , “ Ask for the head of John the Baptist . ”
41006025	At once the girl went back to the king and said to him , “ I want the head of John the Baptist right now on a platter . ”
41006026	Although the king was very sad , he had made a promise , and his dinner guests had heard it . So he did not want to refuse what she asked .
41006027	Immediately the king sent a soldier to bring John’s head . The soldier went and cut off John’s head in the prison
41006028	and brought it back on a platter . He gave it to the girl , and the girl gave it to her mother .
41006029	When John’s followers heard this , they came and got John’s body and put it in a tomb .
41006030	The apostles gathered around Jesus and told him about all the things they had done and taught .
41006031	Crowds of people were coming and going so that Jesus and his followers did not even have time to eat . He said to them , “ Come away by yourselves , and we will go to a lonely place to get some rest . ”
41006032	So they went in a boat by themselves to a lonely place .
41006033	But many people saw them leave and recognized them . So from all the towns they ran to the place where Jesus was going , and they got there before him .
41006034	When he arrived , he saw a great crowd waiting . He felt sorry for them , because they were like sheep without a shepherd . So he began to teach them many things .
41006035	When it was late in the day , his followers came to him and said , “ No one lives in this place , and it is already very late .
41006036	Send the people away so they can go to the countryside and towns around here to buy themselves something to eat . ”
41006037	But Jesus answered , “ You give them something to eat . ” They said to him , “ We would all have to work a month to earn enough money to buy that much bread ! ”
41006038	Jesus asked them , “ How many loaves of bread do you have ? Go and see . ” When they found out , they said , “ Five loaves and two fish . ”
41006039	Then Jesus told his followers to have the people sit in groups on the green grass .
41006040	So they sat in groups of fifty or a hundred .
41006041	Jesus took the five loaves and two fish and , looking up to heaven , he thanked God for the food . He divided the bread and gave it to his followers for them to give to the people . Then he divided the two fish among them all .
41006042	All the people ate and were satisfied .
41006043	The followers filled twelve baskets with the leftover pieces of bread and fish .
41006044	There were five thousand men who ate .
41006045	Immediately Jesus told his followers to get into the boat and go ahead of him to Bethsaida across the lake . He stayed there to send the people home .
41006046	After sending them away , he went into the hills to pray .
41006047	That night , the boat was in the middle of the lake , and Jesus was alone on the land .
41006048	He saw his followers struggling hard to row the boat , because the wind was blowing against them . Between three and six o’clock in the morning , Jesus came to them , walking on the water , and he wanted to walk past the boat .
41006049	But when they saw him walking on the water , they thought he was a ghost and cried out .
41006050	They all saw him and were afraid . But quickly Jesus spoke to them and said , “ Have courage ! It is I . Do not be afraid . ”
41006051	Then he got into the boat with them , and the wind became calm . The followers were greatly amazed .
41006052	They did not understand about the miracle of the five loaves , because their minds were closed .
41006053	When they had crossed the lake , they came to shore at Gennesaret and tied the boat there .
41006054	When they got out of the boat , people immediately recognized Jesus .
41006055	They ran everywhere in that area and began to bring sick people on mats wherever they heard he was .
41006056	And everywhere he went — into towns , cities , or countryside — the people brought the sick to the marketplaces . They begged him to let them touch just the edge of his coat , and all who touched it were healed .
41007001	When some Pharisees and some teachers of the law came from Jerusalem , they gathered around Jesus .
41007002	They saw that some of Jesus’ followers ate food with hands that were not clean , that is , they hadn’t washed them .
41007003	( The Pharisees and all the Jews never eat before washing their hands in the way required by their unwritten laws .
41007004	And when they buy something in the market , they never eat it until they wash themselves in a special way . They also follow many other unwritten laws , such as the washing of cups , pitchers , and pots . )
41007005	The Pharisees and the teachers of the law said to Jesus , “ Why don’t your followers obey the unwritten laws which have been handed down to us ? Why do your followers eat their food with hands that are not clean ? ”
41007006	Jesus answered , “ Isaiah was right when he spoke about you hypocrites . He wrote , ‘ These people show honor to me with words , but their hearts are far from me .
41007007	Their worship of me is worthless . The things they teach are nothing but human rules . ’
41007008	You have stopped following the commands of God , and you follow only human teachings . ”
41007009	Then Jesus said to them , “ You cleverly ignore the commands of God so you can follow your own teachings .
41007010	Moses said , ‘ Honor your father and your mother , ’ and ‘ Anyone who says cruel things to his father or mother must be put to death . ’
41007011	But you say a person can tell his father or mother , ‘ I have something I could use to help you , but it is Corban — a gift to God . ’
41007012	You no longer let that person use that money for his father or his mother .
41007013	By your own rules , which you teach people , you are rejecting what God said . And you do many things like that . ”
41007014	After Jesus called the crowd to him again , he said , “ Every person should listen to me and understand what I am saying .
41007015	There is nothing people put into their bodies that makes them unclean . People are made unclean by the things that come out of them . [
41007016	Let those with ears use them and listen . ] ”
41007017	When Jesus left the people and went into the house , his followers asked him about this story .
41007018	Jesus said , “ Do you still not understand ? Surely you know that nothing that enters someone from the outside can make that person unclean .
41007019	It does not go into the mind , but into the stomach . Then it goes out of the body . ” ( When Jesus said this , he meant that no longer was any food unclean for people to eat . )
41007020	And Jesus said , “ The things that come out of people are the things that make them unclean .
41007021	All these evil things begin inside people , in the mind : evil thoughts , sexual sins , stealing , murder , adultery ,
41007022	greed , evil actions , lying , doing sinful things , jealousy , speaking evil of others , pride , and foolish living .
41007023	All these evil things come from inside and make people unclean . ”
41007024	Jesus left that place and went to the area around Tyre . When he went into a house , he did not want anyone to know he was there , but he could not stay hidden .
41007025	A woman whose daughter had an evil spirit in her heard that he was there . So she quickly came to Jesus and fell at his feet .
41007026	She was Greek , born in Phoenicia , in Syria . She begged Jesus to force the demon out of her daughter .
41007027	Jesus told the woman , “ It is not right to take the children’s bread and give it to the dogs . First let the children eat all they want . ”
41007028	But she answered , “ Yes , Lord , but even the dogs under the table can eat the children’s crumbs . ”
41007029	Then Jesus said , “ Because of your answer , you may go . The demon has left your daughter . ”
41007030	The woman went home and found her daughter lying in bed ; the demon was gone .
41007031	Then Jesus left the area around Tyre and went through Sidon to Lake Galilee , to the area of the Ten Towns .
41007032	While he was there , some people brought a man to him who was deaf and could not talk plainly . The people begged Jesus to put his hand on the man to heal him .
41007033	Jesus led the man away from the crowd , by himself . He put his fingers in the man’s ears and then spit and touched the man’s tongue .
41007034	Looking up to heaven , he sighed and said to the man , “ Ephphatha ! ” ( This means , “ Be opened . ” )
41007035	Instantly the man was able to hear and to use his tongue so that he spoke clearly .
41007036	Jesus commanded the people not to tell anyone about what happened . But the more he commanded them , the more they told about it .
41007037	They were completely amazed and said , “ Jesus does everything well . He makes the deaf hear ! And those who can’t talk he makes able to speak . ”
41008001	Another time there was a great crowd with Jesus that had nothing to eat . So Jesus called his followers and said ,
41008002	“ I feel sorry for these people , because they have already been with me for three days , and they have nothing to eat .
41008003	If I send them home hungry , they will faint on the way . Some of them live a long way from here . ”
41008004	Jesus’ followers answered , “ How can we get enough bread to feed all these people ? We are far away from any town . ”
41008005	Jesus asked , “ How many loaves of bread do you have ? ” They answered , “ Seven . ”
41008006	Jesus told the people to sit on the ground . Then he took the seven loaves , gave thanks to God , and divided the bread . He gave the pieces to his followers to give to the people , and they did so .
41008007	The followers also had a few small fish . After Jesus gave thanks for the fish , he told his followers to give them to the people also .
41008008	All the people ate and were satisfied . Then his followers filled seven baskets with the leftover pieces of food .
41008009	There were about four thousand people who ate . After they had eaten , Jesus sent them home .
41008010	Then right away he got into a boat with his followers and went to the area of Dalmanutha .
41008011	The Pharisees came to Jesus and began to ask him questions . Hoping to trap him , they asked Jesus for a miracle from God .
41008012	Jesus sighed deeply and said , “ Why do you people ask for a miracle as a sign ? I tell you the truth , no sign will be given to you . ”
41008013	Then Jesus left the Pharisees and went in the boat to the other side of the lake .
41008014	His followers had only one loaf of bread with them in the boat ; they had forgotten to bring more .
41008015	Jesus warned them , “ Be careful ! Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod . ”
41008016	His followers discussed the meaning of this , saying , “ He said this because we have no bread . ”
41008017	Knowing what they were talking about , Jesus asked them , “ Why are you talking about not having bread ? Do you still not see or understand ? Are your minds closed ?
41008018	You have eyes , but you don’t really see . You have ears , but you don’t really listen . Remember when
41008019	I divided five loaves of bread for the five thousand ? How many baskets did you fill with leftover pieces of food ? ” They answered , “ Twelve . ”
41008020	“ And when I divided seven loaves of bread for the four thousand , how many baskets did you fill with leftover pieces of food ? ” They answered , “ Seven . ”
41008021	Then Jesus said to them , “ Don’t you understand yet ? ”
41008022	Jesus and his followers came to Bethsaida . There some people brought a blind man to Jesus and begged him to touch the man .
41008023	So Jesus took the blind man’s hand and led him out of the village . Then he spit on the man’s eyes and put his hands on the man and asked , “ Can you see now ? ”
41008024	The man looked up and said , “ Yes , I see people , but they look like trees walking around . ”
41008025	Again Jesus put his hands on the man’s eyes . Then the man opened his eyes wide and they were healed , and he was able to see everything clearly .
41008026	Jesus told him to go home , saying , “ Don’t go into the town . ”
41008027	Jesus and his followers went to the towns around Caesarea Philippi . While they were traveling , Jesus asked them , “ Who do people say I am ? ”
41008028	They answered , “ Some say you are John the Baptist . Others say you are Elijah , and others say you are one of the prophets . ”
41008029	Then Jesus asked , “ But who do you say I am ? ” Peter answered , “ You are the Christ . ”
41008030	Jesus warned his followers not to tell anyone who he was .
41008031	Then Jesus began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and that he would be rejected by the Jewish elders , the leading priests , and the teachers of the law . He told them that the Son of Man must be killed and then rise from the dead after three days .
41008032	Jesus told them plainly what would happen . Then Peter took Jesus aside and began to tell him not to talk like that .
41008033	But Jesus turned and looked at his followers . Then he told Peter not to talk that way . He said , “ Go away from me , Satan ! You don’t care about the things of God , but only about things people think are important . ”
41008034	Then Jesus called the crowd to him , along with his followers . He said , “ If people want to follow me , they must give up the things they want . They must be willing even to give up their lives to follow me .
41008035	Those who want to save their lives will give up true life . But those who give up their lives for me and for the Good News will have true life .
41008036	It is worthless to have the whole world if they lose their souls .
41008037	They could never pay enough to buy back their souls .
41008038	The people who live now are living in a sinful and evil time . If people are ashamed of me and my teaching , the Son of Man will be ashamed of them when he comes with his Father’s glory and with the holy angels . ”
41009001	Then Jesus said to the people , “ I tell you the truth , some people standing here will see the kingdom of God come with power before they die . ”
41009002	Six days later , Jesus took Peter , James , and John up on a high mountain by themselves . While they watched , Jesus’ appearance was changed .
41009003	His clothes became shining white , whiter than any person could make them .
41009004	Then Elijah and Moses appeared to them , talking with Jesus .
41009005	Peter said to Jesus , “ Teacher , it is good that we are here . Let us make three tents — one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . ”
41009006	Peter did not know what to say , because he and the others were so frightened .
41009007	Then a cloud came and covered them , and a voice came from the cloud , saying , “ This is my Son , whom I love . Listen to him ! ”
41009008	Suddenly Peter , James , and John looked around , but they saw only Jesus there alone with them .
41009009	As they were coming down the mountain , Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone about what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead .
41009010	So the followers obeyed Jesus , but they discussed what he meant about rising from the dead .
41009011	Then they asked Jesus , “ Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first ? ”
41009012	Jesus answered , “ They are right to say that Elijah must come first and make everything the way it should be . But why does the Scripture say that the Son of Man will suffer much and that people will treat him as if he were nothing ?
41009013	I tell you that Elijah has already come . And people did to him whatever they wanted to do , just as the Scriptures said it would happen . ”
41009014	When Jesus , Peter , James , and John came back to the other followers , they saw a great crowd around them and the teachers of the law arguing with them .
41009015	But as soon as the crowd saw Jesus , the people were surprised and ran to welcome him .
41009016	Jesus asked , “ What are you arguing about ? ”
41009017	A man answered , “ Teacher , I brought my son to you . He has an evil spirit in him that stops him from talking .
41009018	When the spirit attacks him , it throws him on the ground . Then my son foams at the mouth , grinds his teeth , and becomes very stiff . I asked your followers to force the evil spirit out , but they couldn’t . ”
41009019	Jesus answered , “ You people have no faith . How long must I stay with you ? How long must I put up with you ? Bring the boy to me . ”
41009020	So the followers brought him to Jesus . As soon as the evil spirit saw Jesus , it made the boy lose control of himself , and he fell down and rolled on the ground , foaming at the mouth .
41009021	Jesus asked the boy’s father , “ How long has this been happening ? ” The father answered , “ Since he was very young .
41009022	The spirit often throws him into a fire or into water to kill him . If you can do anything for him , please have pity on us and help us . ”
41009023	Jesus said to the father , “ You said , ‘ If you can ! ’ All things are possible for the one who believes . ”
41009024	Immediately the father cried out , “ I do believe ! Help me to believe more ! ”
41009025	When Jesus saw that a crowd was quickly gathering , he ordered the evil spirit , saying , “ You spirit that makes people unable to hear or speak , I command you to come out of this boy and never enter him again ! ”
41009026	The evil spirit screamed and caused the boy to fall on the ground again . Then the spirit came out . The boy looked as if he were dead , and many people said , “ He is dead ! ”
41009027	But Jesus took hold of the boy’s hand and helped him to stand up .
41009028	When Jesus went into the house , his followers began asking him privately , “ Why couldn’t we force that evil spirit out ? ”
41009029	Jesus answered , “ That kind of spirit can only be forced out by prayer . ”
41009030	Then Jesus and his followers left that place and went through Galilee . He didn’t want anyone to know where he was ,
41009031	because he was teaching his followers . He said to them , “ The Son of Man will be handed over to people , and they will kill him . After three days , he will rise from the dead . ”
41009032	But the followers did not understand what Jesus meant , and they were afraid to ask him .
41009033	Jesus and his followers went to Capernaum . When they went into a house there , he asked them , “ What were you arguing about on the road ? ”
41009034	But the followers did not answer , because their argument on the road was about which one of them was the greatest .
41009035	Jesus sat down and called the twelve apostles to him . He said , “ Whoever wants to be the most important must be last of all and servant of all . ”
41009036	Then Jesus took a small child and had him stand among them . Taking the child in his arms , he said ,
41009037	“ Whoever accepts a child like this in my name accepts me . And whoever accepts me accepts the One who sent me . ”
41009038	Then John said , “ Teacher , we saw someone using your name to force demons out of a person . We told him to stop , because he does not belong to our group . ”
41009039	But Jesus said , “ Don’t stop him , because anyone who uses my name to do powerful things will not easily say evil things about me .
41009040	Whoever is not against us is with us .
41009041	I tell you the truth , whoever gives you a drink of water because you belong to the Christ will truly get his reward .
41009042	“ If one of these little children believes in me , and someone causes that child to sin , it would be better for that person to have a large stone tied around his neck and be drowned in the sea .
41009043	If your hand causes you to sin , cut it off . It is better for you to lose part of your body and live forever than to have two hands and go to hell , where the fire never goes out . [
41009044	In hell the worm does not die ; the fire is never put out . ]
41009045	If your foot causes you to sin , cut it off . It is better for you to lose part of your body and to live forever than to have two feet and be thrown into hell . [
41009046	In hell the worm does not die ; the fire is never put out . ]
41009047	If your eye causes you to sin , take it out . It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with only one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell .
41009048	In hell the worm does not die ; the fire is never put out .
41009049	Every person will be salted with fire .
41009050	“ Salt is good , but if the salt loses its salty taste , you cannot make it salty again . So , be full of salt , and have peace with each other . ”
41010001	Then Jesus left that place and went into the area of Judea and across the Jordan River . Again , crowds came to him , and he taught them as he usually did .
41010002	Some Pharisees came to Jesus and tried to trick him . They asked , “ Is it right for a man to divorce his wife ? ”
41010003	Jesus answered , “ What did Moses command you to do ? ”
41010004	They said , “ Moses allowed a man to write out divorce papers and send her away . ”
41010005	Jesus said , “ Moses wrote that command for you because you were stubborn .
41010006	But when God made the world , ‘ he made them male and female . ’
41010007	‘ So a man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife ,
41010008	and the two will become one body . ’ So there are not two , but one .
41010009	God has joined the two together , so no one should separate them . ”
41010010	Later , in the house , his followers asked Jesus again about the question of divorce .
41010011	He answered , “ Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman is guilty of adultery against her .
41010012	And the woman who divorces her husband and marries another man is also guilty of adultery . ”
41010013	Some people brought their little children to Jesus so he could touch them , but his followers told them to stop .
41010014	When Jesus saw this , he was upset and said to them , “ Let the little children come to me . Don’t stop them , because the kingdom of God belongs to people who are like these children .
41010015	I tell you the truth , you must accept the kingdom of God as if you were a little child , or you will never enter it . ”
41010016	Then Jesus took the children in his arms , put his hands on them , and blessed them .
41010017	As Jesus started to leave , a man ran to him and fell on his knees before Jesus . The man asked , “ Good teacher , what must I do to have life forever ? ”
41010018	Jesus answered , “ Why do you call me good ? Only God is good .
41010019	You know the commands : ‘ You must not murder anyone . You must not be guilty of adultery . You must not steal . You must not tell lies about your neighbor . You must not cheat . Honor your father and mother . ’ ”
41010020	The man said , “ Teacher , I have obeyed all these things since I was a boy . ”
41010021	Jesus , looking at the man , loved him and said , “ There is one more thing you need to do . Go and sell everything you have , and give the money to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven . Then come and follow me . ”
41010022	He was very sad to hear Jesus say this , and he left sorrowfully , because he was rich .
41010023	Then Jesus looked at his followers and said , “ How hard it will be for the rich to enter the kingdom of God ! ”
41010024	The followers were amazed at what Jesus said . But he said again , “ My children , it is very hard to enter the kingdom of God !
41010025	It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God . ”
41010026	The followers were even more surprised and said to each other , “ Then who can be saved ? ”
41010027	Jesus looked at them and said , “ For people this is impossible , but for God all things are possible . ”
41010028	Peter said to Jesus , “ Look , we have left everything and followed you . ”
41010029	Jesus said , “ I tell you the truth , all those who have left houses , brothers , sisters , mother , father , children , or farms for me and for the Good News
41010030	will get more than they left . Here in this world they will have a hundred times more homes , brothers , sisters , mothers , children , and fields . And with those things , they will also suffer for their belief . But in this age they will have life forever .
41010031	Many who are first now will be last in the future . And many who are last now will be first in the future . ”
41010032	As Jesus and the people with him were on the road to Jerusalem , he was leading the way . His followers were amazed , but others in the crowd who followed were afraid . Again Jesus took the twelve apostles aside and began to tell them what was about to happen in Jerusalem .
41010033	He said , “ Look , we are going to Jerusalem . The Son of Man will be turned over to the leading priests and the teachers of the law . They will say that he must die , and they will turn him over to the non-Jewish people ,
41010034	who will laugh at him and spit on him . They will beat him with whips and crucify him . But on the third day , he will rise to life again . ”
41010035	Then James and John , sons of Zebedee , came to Jesus and said , “ Teacher , we want to ask you to do something for us . ”
41010036	Jesus asked , “ What do you want me to do for you ? ”
41010037	They answered , “ Let one of us sit at your right side and one of us sit at your left side in your glory in your kingdom . ”
41010038	Jesus said , “ You don’t understand what you are asking . Can you drink the cup that I must drink ? And can you be baptized with the same kind of baptism that I must go through ? ”
41010039	They answered , “ Yes , we can . ” Jesus said to them , “ You will drink the same cup that I will drink , and you will be baptized with the same baptism that I must go through .
41010040	But I cannot choose who will sit at my right or my left ; those places belong to those for whom they have been prepared . ”
41010041	When the other ten followers heard this , they began to be angry with James and John .
41010042	Jesus called them together and said , “ The other nations have rulers . You know that those rulers love to show their power over the people , and their important leaders love to use all their authority .
41010043	But it should not be that way among you . Whoever wants to become great among you must serve the rest of you like a servant .
41010044	Whoever wants to become the first among you must serve all of you like a slave .
41010045	In the same way , the Son of Man did not come to be served . He came to serve others and to give his life as a ransom for many people . ”
41010046	Then they came to the town of Jericho . As Jesus was leaving there with his followers and a great many people , a blind beggar named Bartimaeus son of Timaeus was sitting by the road .
41010047	When he heard that Jesus from Nazareth was walking by , he began to shout , “ Jesus , Son of David , have mercy on me ! ”
41010048	Many people warned the blind man to be quiet , but he shouted even more , “ Son of David , have mercy on me ! ”
41010049	Jesus stopped and said , “ Tell the man to come here . ” So they called the blind man , saying , “ Cheer up ! Get to your feet . Jesus is calling you . ”
41010050	The blind man jumped up , left his coat there , and went to Jesus .
41010051	Jesus asked him , “ What do you want me to do for you ? ” The blind man answered , “ Teacher , I want to see . ”
41010052	Jesus said , “ Go , you are healed because you believed . ” At once the man could see , and he followed Jesus on the road .
41011001	As Jesus and his followers were coming closer to Jerusalem , they came to the towns of Bethphage and Bethany near the Mount of Olives . From there Jesus sent two of his followers
41011002	and said to them , “ Go to the town you can see there . When you enter it , you will quickly find a colt tied , which no one has ever ridden . Untie it and bring it here to me .
41011003	If anyone asks you why you are doing this , tell him its Master needs the colt , and he will send it at once . ”
41011004	The followers went into the town , found a colt tied in the street near the door of a house , and untied it .
41011005	Some people were standing there and asked , “ What are you doing ? Why are you untying that colt ? ”
41011006	The followers answered the way Jesus told them to answer , and the people let them take the colt .
41011007	They brought the colt to Jesus and put their coats on it , and Jesus sat on it .
41011008	Many people spread their coats on the road . Others cut branches in the fields and spread them on the road .
41011009	The people were walking ahead of Jesus and behind him , shouting , “ Praise God ! God bless the One who comes in the name of the Lord !
41011010	God bless the kingdom of our father David ! That kingdom is coming ! Praise to God in heaven ! ”
41011011	Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the Temple . After he had looked at everything , since it was already late , he went out to Bethany with the twelve apostles .
41011012	The next day as Jesus was leaving Bethany , he became hungry .
41011013	Seeing a fig tree in leaf from far away , he went to see if it had any figs on it . But he found no figs , only leaves , because it was not the right season for figs .
41011014	So Jesus said to the tree , “ May no one ever eat fruit from you again . ” And Jesus’ followers heard him say this .
41011015	When Jesus returned to Jerusalem , he went into the Temple and began to throw out those who were buying and selling there . He turned over the tables of those who were exchanging different kinds of money , and he upset the benches of those who were selling doves .
41011016	Jesus refused to allow anyone to carry goods through the Temple courts .
41011017	Then he taught the people , saying , “ It is written in the Scriptures , ‘ My Temple will be called a house for prayer for people from all nations . ’ But you are changing God’s house into a ‘ hideout for robbers . ’ ”
41011018	The leading priests and the teachers of the law heard all this and began trying to find a way to kill Jesus . They were afraid of him , because all the people were amazed at his teaching .
41011019	That evening , Jesus and his followers left the city .
41011020	The next morning as Jesus was passing by with his followers , they saw the fig tree dry and dead , even to the roots .
41011021	Peter remembered the tree and said to Jesus , “ Teacher , look ! The fig tree you cursed is dry and dead ! ”
41011022	Jesus answered , “ Have faith in God .
41011023	I tell you the truth , you can say to this mountain , ‘ Go , fall into the sea . ’ And if you have no doubts in your mind and believe that what you say will happen , God will do it for you .
41011024	So I tell you to believe that you have received the things you ask for in prayer , and God will give them to you .
41011025	When you are praying , if you are angry with someone , forgive him so that your Father in heaven will also forgive your sins . [
41011026	But if you don’t forgive other people , then your Father in heaven will not forgive your sins . ] ”
41011027	Jesus and his followers went again to Jerusalem . As Jesus was walking in the Temple , the leading priests , the teachers of the law , and the elders came to him .
41011028	They said to him , “ What authority do you have to do these things ? Who gave you this authority ? ”
41011029	Jesus answered , “ I will ask you one question . If you answer me , I will tell you what authority I have to do these things .
41011030	Tell me : When John baptized people , was that authority from God or just from other people ? ”
41011031	They argued about Jesus’ question , saying , “ If we answer , ‘ John’s baptism was from God , ’ Jesus will say , ‘ Then why didn’t you believe him ? ’
41011032	But if we say , ‘ It was from other people , ’ the crowd will be against us . ” ( These leaders were afraid of the people , because all the people believed that John was a prophet . )
41011033	So they answered Jesus , “ We don’t know . ” Jesus said to them , “ Then I won’t tell you what authority I have to do these things . ”
41012001	Jesus began to use stories to teach the people . He said , “ A man planted a vineyard . He put a wall around it and dug a hole for a winepress and built a tower . Then he leased the land to some farmers and left for a trip .
41012002	When it was time for the grapes to be picked , he sent a servant to the farmers to get his share of the grapes .
41012003	But the farmers grabbed the servant and beat him and sent him away empty-handed .
41012004	Then the man sent another servant . They hit him on the head and showed no respect for him .
41012005	So the man sent another servant , whom they killed . The man sent many other servants ; the farmers beat some of them and killed others .
41012006	“ The man had one person left to send , his son whom he loved . He sent him last of all , saying , ‘ They will respect my son . ’
41012007	“ But the farmers said to each other , ‘ This son will inherit the vineyard . If we kill him , it will be ours . ’
41012008	So they took the son , killed him , and threw him out of the vineyard .
41012009	“ So what will the owner of the vineyard do ? He will come and kill those farmers and will give the vineyard to other farmers .
41012010	Surely you have read this Scripture : ‘ The stone that the builders rejected became the cornerstone .
41012011	The Lord did this , and it is wonderful to us . ’ ”
41012012	The Jewish leaders knew that the story was about them . So they wanted to find a way to arrest Jesus , but they were afraid of the people . So the leaders left him and went away .
41012013	Later , the Jewish leaders sent some Pharisees and Herodians to Jesus to trap him in saying something wrong .
41012014	They came to him and said , “ Teacher , we know that you are an honest man . You are not afraid of what other people think about you , because you pay no attention to who they are . And you teach the truth about God’s way . Tell us : Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not ?
41012015	Should we pay them , or not ? ” But knowing what these men were really trying to do , Jesus said to them , “ Why are you trying to trap me ? Bring me a coin to look at . ”
41012016	They gave Jesus a coin , and he asked , “ Whose image and name are on the coin ? ” They answered , “ Caesar’s . ”
41012017	Then Jesus said to them , “ Give to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s , and give to God the things that are God’s . ” The men were amazed at what Jesus said .
41012018	Then some Sadducees came to Jesus and asked him a question . ( Sadducees believed that people would not rise from the dead . )
41012019	They said , “ Teacher , Moses wrote that if a man’s brother dies , leaving a wife but no children , then that man must marry the widow and have children for his brother .
41012020	Once there were seven brothers . The first brother married and died , leaving no children .
41012021	So the second brother married the widow , but he also died and had no children . The same thing happened with the third brother .
41012022	All seven brothers married her and died , and none of the brothers had any children . Finally the woman died too .
41012023	Since all seven brothers had married her , when people rise from the dead , whose wife will she be ? ”
41012024	Jesus answered , “ Why don’t you understand ? Don’t you know what the Scriptures say , and don’t you know about the power of God ?
41012025	When people rise from the dead , they will not marry , nor will they be given to someone to marry . They will be like the angels in heaven .
41012026	Surely you have read what God said about people rising from the dead . In the book in which Moses wrote about the burning bush , it says that God told Moses , ‘ I am the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . ’
41012027	God is the God of the living , not the dead . You Sadducees are wrong ! ”
41012028	One of the teachers of the law came and heard Jesus arguing with the Sadducees . Seeing that Jesus gave good answers to their questions , he asked Jesus , “ Which of the commands is most important ? ”
41012029	Jesus answered , “ The most important command is this : ‘ Listen , people of Israel ! The Lord our God is the only Lord .
41012030	Love the Lord your God with all your heart , all your soul , all your mind , and all your strength . ’
41012031	The second command is this : ‘ Love your neighbor as you love yourself . ’ There are no commands more important than these . ”
41012032	The man answered , “ That was a good answer , Teacher . You were right when you said God is the only Lord and there is no other God besides him .
41012033	One must love God with all his heart , all his mind , and all his strength . And one must love his neighbor as he loves himself . These commands are more important than all the animals and sacrifices we offer to God . ”
41012034	When Jesus saw that the man answered him wisely , Jesus said to him , “ You are close to the kingdom of God . ” And after that , no one was brave enough to ask Jesus any more questions .
41012035	As Jesus was teaching in the Temple , he asked , “ Why do the teachers of the law say that the Christ is the son of David ?
41012036	David himself , speaking by the Holy Spirit , said : ‘ The Lord said to my Lord , “ Sit by me at my right side , until I put your enemies under your control . ” ’
41012037	David himself calls the Christ ‘ Lord , ’ so how can the Christ be his son ? ” The large crowd listened to Jesus with pleasure .
41012038	Jesus continued teaching and said , “ Beware of the teachers of the law . They like to walk around wearing fancy clothes , and they love for people to greet them with respect in the marketplaces .
41012039	They love to have the most important seats in the synagogues and at feasts .
41012040	But they cheat widows and steal their houses and then try to make themselves look good by saying long prayers . They will receive a greater punishment . ”
41012041	Jesus sat near the Temple money box and watched the people put in their money . Many rich people gave large sums of money .
41012042	Then a poor widow came and put in two small copper coins , which were only worth a few cents .
41012043	Calling his followers to him , Jesus said , “ I tell you the truth , this poor widow gave more than all those rich people .
41012044	They gave only what they did not need . This woman is very poor , but she gave all she had ; she gave all she had to live on . ”
41013001	As Jesus was leaving the Temple , one of his followers said to him , “ Look , Teacher ! How beautiful the buildings are ! How big the stones are ! ”
41013002	Jesus said , “ Do you see all these great buildings ? Not one stone will be left on another . Every stone will be thrown down to the ground . ”
41013003	Later , as Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives , opposite the Temple , he was alone with Peter , James , John , and Andrew . They asked Jesus ,
41013004	“ Tell us , when will these things happen ? And what will be the sign that they are going to happen ? ”
41013005	Jesus began to answer them , “ Be careful that no one fools you .
41013006	Many people will come in my name , saying , ‘ I am the One , ’ and they will fool many people .
41013007	When you hear about wars and stories of wars that are coming , don’t be afraid . These things must happen before the end comes .
41013008	Nations will fight against other nations , and kingdoms against other kingdoms . There will be earthquakes in different places , and there will be times when there is no food for people to eat . These things are like the first pains when something new is about to be born .
41013009	“ You must be careful . People will arrest you and take you to court and beat you in their synagogues . You will be forced to stand before kings and governors , to tell them about me . This will happen to you because you follow me .
41013010	But before these things happen , the Good News must be told to all people .
41013011	When you are arrested and judged , don’t worry ahead of time about what you should say . Say whatever is given you to say at that time , because it will not really be you speaking ; it will be the Holy Spirit .
41013012	“ Brothers will give their own brothers to be killed , and fathers will give their own children to be killed . Children will fight against their own parents and cause them to be put to death .
41013013	All people will hate you because you follow me , but those people who keep their faith until the end will be saved .
41013014	“ You will see ‘ a blasphemous object that brings destruction ’ standing where it should not be . ” ( You who read this should understand what it means . ) “ At that time , the people in Judea should run away to the mountains .
41013015	If people are on the roofs of their houses , they must not go down or go inside to get anything out of their houses .
41013016	If people are in the fields , they must not go back to get their coats .
41013017	At that time , how terrible it will be for women who are pregnant or have nursing babies !
41013018	Pray that these things will not happen in winter ,
41013019	because those days will be full of trouble . There will be more trouble than there has ever been since the beginning , when God made the world , until now , and nothing as bad will ever happen again .
41013020	God has decided to make that terrible time short . Otherwise , no one would go on living . But God will make that time short to help the people he has chosen .
41013021	At that time , someone might say to you , ‘ Look , there is the Christ ! ’ Or another person might say , ‘ There he is ! ’ But don’t believe them .
41013022	False Christs and false prophets will come and perform great wonders and miracles . They will try to fool even the people God has chosen , if that is possible .
41013023	So be careful . I have warned you about all this before it happens .
41013024	“ During the days after this trouble comes , ‘ the sun will grow dark , and the moon will not give its light .
41013025	The stars will fall from the sky . And the powers of the heavens will be shaken . ’
41013026	“ Then people will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory .
41013027	Then he will send his angels all around the earth to gather his chosen people from every part of the earth and from every part of heaven .
41013028	“ Learn a lesson from the fig tree : When its branches become green and soft and new leaves appear , you know summer is near .
41013029	In the same way , when you see these things happening , you will know that the time is near , ready to come .
41013030	I tell you the truth , all these things will happen while the people of this time are still living .
41013031	Earth and sky will be destroyed , but the words I have said will never be destroyed .
41013032	“ No one knows when that day or time will be , not the angels in heaven , not even the Son . Only the Father knows .
41013033	Be careful ! Always be ready , because you don’t know when that time will be .
41013034	It is like a man who goes on a trip . He leaves his house and lets his servants take care of it , giving each one a special job to do . The man tells the servant guarding the door always to be watchful .
41013035	So always be ready , because you don’t know when the owner of the house will come back . It might be in the evening , or at midnight , or in the morning while it is still dark , or when the sun rises .
41013036	Always be ready . Otherwise he might come back suddenly and find you sleeping .
41013037	I tell you this , and I say this to everyone : ‘ Be ready ! ’ ”
41014001	It was now only two days before the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread . The leading priests and teachers of the law were trying to find a trick to arrest Jesus and kill him .
41014002	But they said , “ We must not do it during the feast , because the people might cause a riot . ”
41014003	Jesus was in Bethany at the house of Simon , who had a skin disease . While Jesus was eating there , a woman approached him with an alabaster jar filled with very expensive perfume , made of pure nard . She opened the jar and poured the perfume on Jesus’ head .
41014004	Some who were there became upset and said to each other , “ Why waste that perfume ?
41014005	It was worth a full year’s work . It could have been sold and the money given to the poor . ” And they got very angry with the woman .
41014006	Jesus said , “ Leave her alone . Why are you troubling her ? She did an excellent thing for me .
41014007	You will always have the poor with you , and you can help them anytime you want . But you will not always have me .
41014008	This woman did the only thing she could do for me ; she poured perfume on my body to prepare me for burial .
41014009	I tell you the truth , wherever the Good News is preached in all the world , what this woman has done will be told , and people will remember her . ”
41014010	One of the twelve apostles , Judas Iscariot , went to talk to the leading priests to offer to hand Jesus over to them .
41014011	These priests were pleased about this and promised to pay Judas money . So he watched for the best time to turn Jesus in .
41014012	It was now the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread when the Passover lamb was sacrificed . Jesus’ followers said to him , “ Where do you want us to go and prepare for you to eat the Passover meal ? ”
41014013	Jesus sent two of his followers and said to them , “ Go into the city and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you . Follow him .
41014014	When he goes into a house , tell the owner of the house , ‘ The Teacher says : “ Where is my guest room in which I can eat the Passover meal with my followers ? ” ’
41014015	The owner will show you a large room upstairs that is furnished and ready . Prepare the food for us there . ”
41014016	So the followers left and went into the city . Everything happened as Jesus had said , so they prepared the Passover meal .
41014017	In the evening , Jesus went to that house with the twelve .
41014018	While they were all eating , Jesus said , “ I tell you the truth , one of you will turn against me — one of you eating with me now . ”
41014019	The followers were very sad to hear this . Each one began to say to Jesus , “ I am not the one , am I ? ”
41014020	Jesus answered , “ It is one of the twelve — the one who dips his bread into the bowl with me .
41014021	The Son of Man will die , just as the Scriptures say . But how terrible it will be for the person who hands the Son of Man over to be killed . It would be better for him if he had never been born . ”
41014022	While they were eating , Jesus took some bread and thanked God for it and broke it . Then he gave it to his followers and said , “ Take it ; this is my body . ”
41014023	Then Jesus took a cup and thanked God for it and gave it to the followers , and they all drank from the cup .
41014024	Then Jesus said , “ This is my blood which is the new agreement that God makes with his people . This blood is poured out for many .
41014025	I tell you the truth , I will not drink of this fruit of the vine again until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God . ”
41014026	After singing a hymn , they went out to the Mount of Olives .
41014027	Then Jesus told the followers , “ You will all stumble in your faith , because it is written in the Scriptures : ‘ I will kill the shepherd , and the sheep will scatter . ’
41014028	But after I rise from the dead , I will go ahead of you into Galilee . ”
41014029	Peter said , “ Everyone else may stumble in their faith , but I will not . ”
41014030	Jesus answered , “ I tell you the truth , tonight before the rooster crows twice you will say three times you don’t know me . ”
41014031	But Peter insisted , “ I will never say that I don’t know you ! I will even die with you ! ” And all the other followers said the same thing .
41014032	Jesus and his followers went to a place called Gethsemane . He said to them , “ Sit here while I pray . ”
41014033	Jesus took Peter , James , and John with him , and he began to be very sad and troubled .
41014034	He said to them , “ My heart is full of sorrow , to the point of death . Stay here and watch . ”
41014035	After walking a little farther away from them , Jesus fell to the ground and prayed that , if possible , he would not have this time of suffering .
41014036	He prayed , “ Abba , Father ! You can do all things . Take away this cup of suffering . But do what you want , not what I want . ”
41014037	Then Jesus went back to his followers and found them asleep . He said to Peter , “ Simon , are you sleeping ? Couldn’t you stay awake with me for one hour ?
41014038	Stay awake and pray for strength against temptation . The spirit wants to do what is right , but the body is weak . ”
41014039	Again Jesus went away and prayed the same thing .
41014040	Then he went back to his followers , and again he found them asleep , because their eyes were very heavy . And they did not know what to say to him .
41014041	After Jesus prayed a third time , he went back to his followers and said to them , “ Are you still sleeping and resting ? That’s enough . The time has come for the Son of Man to be handed over to sinful people .
41014042	Get up , we must go . Look , here comes the man who has turned against me . ”
41014043	At once , while Jesus was still speaking , Judas , one of the twelve apostles , came up . With him were many people carrying swords and clubs who had been sent from the leading priests , the teachers of the law , and the Jewish elders .
41014044	Judas had planned a signal for them , saying , “ The man I kiss is Jesus . Arrest him and guard him while you lead him away . ”
41014045	So Judas went straight to Jesus and said , “ Teacher ! ” and kissed him .
41014046	Then the people grabbed Jesus and arrested him .
41014047	One of his followers standing nearby pulled out his sword and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear .
41014048	Then Jesus said , “ You came to get me with swords and clubs as if I were a criminal .
41014049	Every day I was with you teaching in the Temple , and you did not arrest me there . But all these things have happened to make the Scriptures come true . ”
41014050	Then all of Jesus’ followers left him and ran away .
41014051	A young man , wearing only a linen cloth , was following Jesus , and the people also grabbed him .
41014052	But the cloth he was wearing came off , and he ran away naked .
41014053	The people who arrested Jesus led him to the house of the high priest , where all the leading priests , the elders , and the teachers of the law were gathered .
41014054	Peter followed far behind and entered the courtyard of the high priest’s house . There he sat with the guards , warming himself by the fire .
41014055	The leading priests and the whole Jewish council tried to find something that Jesus had done wrong so they could kill him . But the council could find no proof of anything .
41014056	Many people came and told false things about him , but all said different things — none of them agreed .
41014057	Then some people stood up and lied about Jesus , saying ,
41014058	“ We heard this man say , ‘ I will destroy this Temple that people made . And three days later , I will build another Temple not made by people . ’ ”
41014059	But even the things these people said did not agree .
41014060	Then the high priest stood before them and asked Jesus , “ Aren’t you going to answer ? Don’t you have something to say about their charges against you ? ”
41014061	But Jesus said nothing ; he did not answer . The high priest asked Jesus another question : “ Are you the Christ , the Son of the blessed God ? ”
41014062	Jesus answered , “ I am . And in the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of God , the Powerful One , and coming on clouds in the sky . ”
41014063	When the high priest heard this , he tore his clothes and said , “ We don’t need any more witnesses !
41014064	You all heard him say these things against God . What do you think ? ” They all said that Jesus was guilty and should die .
41014065	Some of the people there began to spit at Jesus . They blindfolded him and beat him with their fists and said , “ Prove you are a prophet ! ” Then the guards led Jesus away and beat him .
41014066	While Peter was in the courtyard , a servant girl of the high priest came there .
41014067	She saw Peter warming himself at the fire and looked closely at him . Then she said , “ You also were with Jesus , that man from Nazareth . ”
41014068	But Peter said that he was never with Jesus . He said , “ I don’t know or understand what you are talking about . ” Then Peter left and went toward the entrance of the courtyard . And the rooster crowed .
41014069	The servant girl saw Peter there , and again she said to the people who were standing nearby , “ This man is one of those who followed Jesus . ”
41014070	Again Peter said that it was not true . A short time later , some people were standing near Peter saying , “ Surely you are one of those who followed Jesus , because you are from Galilee , too . ”
41014071	Then Peter began to place a curse on himself and swear , “ I don’t know this man you’re talking about ! ”
41014072	At once , the rooster crowed the second time . Then Peter remembered what Jesus had told him : “ Before the rooster crows twice , you will say three times that you don’t know me . ” Then Peter lost control of himself and began to cry .
41015001	Very early in the morning , the leading priests , the elders , the teachers of the law , and all the Jewish council decided what to do with Jesus . They tied him , led him away , and turned him over to Pilate , the governor .
41015002	Pilate asked Jesus , “ Are you the king of the Jews ? ” Jesus answered , “ Those are your words . ”
41015003	The leading priests accused Jesus of many things .
41015004	So Pilate asked Jesus another question , “ You can see that they are accusing you of many things . Aren’t you going to answer ? ”
41015005	But Jesus still said nothing , so Pilate was very surprised .
41015006	Every year at the time of the Passover the governor would free one prisoner whom the people chose .
41015007	At that time , there was a man named Barabbas in prison who was a rebel and had committed murder during a riot .
41015008	The crowd came to Pilate and began to ask him to free a prisoner as he always did .
41015009	So Pilate asked them , “ Do you want me to free the king of the Jews ? ”
41015010	Pilate knew that the leading priests had turned Jesus in to him because they were jealous .
41015011	But the leading priests had persuaded the people to ask Pilate to free Barabbas , not Jesus .
41015012	Then Pilate asked the crowd again , “ So what should I do with this man you call the king of the Jews ? ”
41015013	They shouted , “ Crucify him ! ”
41015014	Pilate asked , “ Why ? What wrong has he done ? ” But they shouted even louder , “ Crucify him ! ”
41015015	Pilate wanted to please the crowd , so he freed Barabbas for them . After having Jesus beaten with whips , he handed Jesus over to the soldiers to be crucified .
41015016	The soldiers took Jesus into the governor’s palace ( called the Praetorium ) and called all the other soldiers together .
41015017	They put a purple robe on Jesus and used thorny branches to make a crown for his head .
41015018	They began to call out to him , “ Hail , King of the Jews ! ”
41015019	The soldiers beat Jesus on the head many times with a stick . They spit on him and made fun of him by bowing on their knees and worshiping him .
41015020	After they finished , the soldiers took off the purple robe and put his own clothes on him again . Then they led him out of the palace to be crucified .
41015021	A man named Simon from Cyrene , the father of Alexander and Rufus , was coming from the fields to the city . The soldiers forced Simon to carry the cross for Jesus .
41015022	They led Jesus to the place called Golgotha , which means the Place of the Skull .
41015023	The soldiers tried to give Jesus wine mixed with myrrh to drink , but he refused .
41015024	The soldiers crucified Jesus and divided his clothes among themselves , throwing lots to decide what each soldier would get .
41015025	It was nine o’clock in the morning when they crucified Jesus .
41015026	There was a sign with this charge against Jesus written on it : the king of the jews .
41015027	They also put two robbers on crosses beside Jesus , one on the right , and the other on the left . [
41015028	And the Scripture came true that says , “ They put him with criminals . ” ]
41015029	People walked by and insulted Jesus and shook their heads , saying , “ You said you could destroy the Temple and build it again in three days .
41015030	So save yourself ! Come down from that cross ! ”
41015031	The leading priests and the teachers of the law were also making fun of Jesus . They said to each other , “ He saved other people , but he can’t save himself .
41015032	If he is really the Christ , the king of Israel , let him come down now from the cross . When we see this , we will believe in him . ” The robbers who were being crucified beside Jesus also insulted him .
41015033	At noon the whole country became dark , and the darkness lasted for three hours .
41015034	At three o’clock Jesus cried in a loud voice , “ Eloi , Eloi , lama sabachthani . ” This means , “ My God , my God , why have you abandoned me ? ”
41015035	When some of the people standing there heard this , they said , “ Listen ! He is calling Elijah . ”
41015036	Someone there ran and got a sponge , filled it with vinegar , tied it to a stick , and gave it to Jesus to drink . He said , “ We want to see if Elijah will come to take him down from the cross . ”
41015037	Then Jesus cried in a loud voice and died .
41015038	The curtain in the Temple was torn into two pieces , from the top to the bottom .
41015039	When the army officer who was standing in front of the cross saw what happened when Jesus died , he said , “ This man really was the Son of God ! ”
41015040	Some women were standing at a distance from the cross , watching ; among them were Mary Magdalene , Salome , and Mary the mother of James and Joseph . ( James was her youngest son . )
41015041	These women had followed Jesus in Galilee and helped him . Many other women were also there who had come with Jesus to Jerusalem .
41015042	This was Preparation Day . ( That means the day before the Sabbath day . ) That evening ,
41015043	Joseph from Arimathea was brave enough to go to Pilate and ask for Jesus’ body . Joseph , an important member of the Jewish council , was one of the people who was waiting for the kingdom of God to come .
41015044	Pilate was amazed that Jesus would have already died , so he called the army officer who had guarded Jesus and asked him if Jesus had already died .
41015045	The officer told Pilate that he was dead , so Pilate told Joseph he could have the body .
41015046	Joseph bought some linen cloth , took the body down from the cross , and wrapped it in the linen . He put the body in a tomb that was cut out of a wall of rock . Then he rolled a very large stone to block the entrance of the tomb .
41015047	And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph saw the place where Jesus was laid .
41016001	The day after the Sabbath day , Mary Magdalene , Mary the mother of James , and Salome bought some sweet-smelling spices to put on Jesus’ body .
41016002	Very early on that day , the first day of the week , soon after sunrise , the women were on their way to the tomb .
41016003	They said to each other , “ Who will roll away for us the stone that covers the entrance of the tomb ? ”
41016004	Then the women looked and saw that the stone had already been rolled away , even though it was very large .
41016005	The women entered the tomb and saw a young man wearing a white robe and sitting on the right side , and they were afraid .
41016006	But the man said , “ Don’t be afraid . You are looking for Jesus from Nazareth , who has been crucified . He has risen from the dead ; he is not here . Look , here is the place they laid him .
41016007	Now go and tell his followers and Peter , ‘ Jesus is going into Galilee ahead of you , and you will see him there as he told you before . ’ ”
41016008	The women were confused and shaking with fear , so they left the tomb and ran away . They did not tell anyone about what happened , because they were afraid .
41016009	After Jesus rose from the dead early on the first day of the week , he showed himself first to Mary Magdalene . One time in the past , he had forced seven demons out of her .
41016010	After Mary saw Jesus , she went and told his followers , who were very sad and were crying .
41016011	But Mary told them that Jesus was alive . She said that she had seen him , but the followers did not believe her .
41016012	Later , Jesus showed himself to two of his followers while they were walking in the country , but he did not look the same as before .
41016013	These followers went back to the others and told them what had happened , but again , the followers did not believe them .
41016014	Later Jesus showed himself to the eleven apostles while they were eating , and he criticized them because they had no faith . They were stubborn and refused to believe those who had seen him after he had risen from the dead .
41016015	Jesus said to his followers , “ Go everywhere in the world , and tell the Good News to everyone .
41016016	Anyone who believes and is baptized will be saved , but anyone who does not believe will be punished .
41016017	And those who believe will be able to do these things as proof : They will use my name to force out demons . They will speak in new languages .
41016018	They will pick up snakes and drink poison without being hurt . They will touch the sick , and the sick will be healed . ”
41016019	After the Lord Jesus said these things to his followers , he was carried up into heaven , and he sat at the right side of God .
41016020	The followers went everywhere in the world and told the Good News to people , and the Lord helped them . The Lord proved that the Good News they told was true by giving them power to work miracles . ]
42001001	Many have tried to report on the things that happened among us .
42001002	They have written the same things that we learned from others — the people who saw those things from the beginning and served God by telling people his message .
42001003	Since I myself have studied everything carefully from the beginning , most excellent Theophilus , it seemed good for me to write it out for you . I arranged it in order ,
42001004	to help you know that what you have been taught is true .
42001005	During the time Herod ruled Judea , there was a priest named Zechariah who belonged to Abijah’s group . Zechariah’s wife , Elizabeth , came from the family of Aaron .
42001006	Zechariah and Elizabeth truly did what God said was good . They did everything the Lord commanded and were without fault in keeping his law .
42001007	But they had no children , because Elizabeth could not have a baby , and both of them were very old .
42001008	One day Zechariah was serving as a priest before God , because his group was on duty .
42001009	According to the custom of the priests , he was chosen by lot to go into the Temple of the Lord and burn incense .
42001010	There were a great many people outside praying at the time the incense was offered .
42001011	Then an angel of the Lord appeared to Zechariah , standing on the right side of the incense table .
42001012	When he saw the angel , Zechariah was startled and frightened .
42001013	But the angel said to him , “ Zechariah , don’t be afraid . God has heard your prayer . Your wife , Elizabeth , will give birth to a son , and you will name him John .
42001014	He will bring you joy and gladness , and many people will be happy because of his birth .
42001015	John will be a great man for the Lord . He will never drink wine or beer , and even from birth , he will be filled with the Holy Spirit .
42001016	He will help many people of Israel return to the Lord their God .
42001017	He will go before the Lord in spirit and power like Elijah . He will make peace between parents and their children and will bring those who are not obeying God back to the right way of thinking , to make a people ready for the coming of the Lord . ”
42001018	Zechariah said to the angel , “ How can I know that what you say is true ? I am an old man , and my wife is old , too . ”
42001019	The angel answered him , “ I am Gabriel . I stand before God , who sent me to talk to you and to tell you this good news .
42001020	Now , listen ! You will not be able to speak until the day these things happen , because you did not believe what I told you . But they will really happen . ”
42001021	Outside , the people were still waiting for Zechariah and were surprised that he was staying so long in the Temple .
42001022	When Zechariah came outside , he could not speak to them , and they knew he had seen a vision in the Temple . He could only make signs to them and remained unable to speak .
42001023	When his time of service at the Temple was finished , he went home .
42001024	Later , Zechariah’s wife , Elizabeth , became pregnant and did not go out of her house for five months . Elizabeth said ,
42001025	“ Look what the Lord has done for me ! My people were ashamed of me , but now the Lord has taken away that shame . ”
42001026	During Elizabeth’s sixth month of pregnancy , God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth , a town in Galilee ,
42001027	to a virgin . She was engaged to marry a man named Joseph from the family of David . Her name was Mary .
42001028	The angel came to her and said , “ Greetings ! The Lord has blessed you and is with you . ”
42001029	But Mary was very startled by what the angel said and wondered what this greeting might mean .
42001030	The angel said to her , “ Don’t be afraid , Mary ; God has shown you his grace .
42001031	Listen ! You will become pregnant and give birth to a son , and you will name him Jesus .
42001032	He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High . The Lord God will give him the throne of King David , his ancestor .
42001033	He will rule over the people of Jacob forever , and his kingdom will never end . ”
42001034	Mary said to the angel , “ How will this happen since I am a virgin ? ”
42001035	The angel said to Mary , “ The Holy Spirit will come upon you , and the power of the Most High will cover you . For this reason the baby will be holy and will be called the Son of God .
42001036	Now Elizabeth , your relative , is also pregnant with a son though she is very old . Everyone thought she could not have a baby , but she has been pregnant for six months .
42001037	God can do anything ! ”
42001038	Mary said , “ I am the servant of the Lord . Let this happen to me as you say ! ” Then the angel went away .
42001039	Mary got up and went quickly to a town in the hills of Judea .
42001040	She came to Zechariah’s house and greeted Elizabeth .
42001041	When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting , the unborn baby inside her jumped , and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit .
42001042	She cried out in a loud voice , “ God has blessed you more than any other woman , and he has blessed the baby to which you will give birth .
42001043	Why has this good thing happened to me , that the mother of my Lord comes to me ?
42001044	When I heard your voice , the baby inside me jumped with joy .
42001045	You are blessed because you believed that what the Lord said to you would really happen . ”
42001046	Then Mary said , “ My soul praises the Lord ;
42001047	my heart rejoices in God my Savior ,
42001048	because he has shown his concern for his humble servant girl . From now on , all people will say that I am blessed ,
42001049	because the Powerful One has done great things for me . His name is holy .
42001050	God will show his mercy forever and ever to those who worship and serve him .
42001051	He has done mighty deeds by his power . He has scattered the people who are proud and think great things about themselves .
42001052	He has brought down rulers from their thrones and raised up the humble .
42001053	He has filled the hungry with good things and sent the rich away with nothing .
42001054	He has helped his servant , the people of Israel , remembering to show them mercy
42001055	as he promised to our ancestors , to Abraham and to his children forever . ”
42001056	Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then returned home .
42001057	When it was time for Elizabeth to give birth , she had a boy .
42001058	Her neighbors and relatives heard how good the Lord was to her , and they rejoiced with her .
42001059	When the baby was eight days old , they came to circumcise him . They wanted to name him Zechariah because this was his father’s name ,
42001060	but his mother said , “ No ! He will be named John . ”
42001061	The people said to Elizabeth , “ But no one in your family has this name . ”
42001062	Then they made signs to his father to find out what he would like to name him .
42001063	Zechariah asked for a writing tablet and wrote , “ His name is John , ” and everyone was surprised .
42001064	Immediately Zechariah could talk again , and he began praising God .
42001065	All their neighbors became alarmed , and in all the mountains of Judea people continued talking about all these things .
42001066	The people who heard about them wondered , saying , “ What will this child be ? ” because the Lord was with him .
42001067	Then Zechariah , John’s father , was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied :
42001068	“ Let us praise the Lord , the God of Israel , because he has come to help his people and has given them freedom .
42001069	He has given us a powerful Savior from the family of God’s servant David .
42001070	He said that he would do this through his holy prophets who lived long ago :
42001071	He promised he would save us from our enemies and from the power of all those who hate us .
42001072	He said he would give mercy to our ancestors and that he would remember his holy promise .
42001073	God promised Abraham , our father ,
42001074	that he would save us from the power of our enemies so we could serve him without fear ,
42001075	being holy and good before God as long as we live .
42001076	“ Now you , child , will be called a prophet of the Most High God . You will go before the Lord to prepare his way .
42001077	You will make his people know that they will be saved by having their sins forgiven .
42001078	With the loving mercy of our God , a new day from heaven will dawn upon us .
42001079	It will shine on those who live in darkness , in the shadow of death . It will guide us into the path of peace . ”
42001080	And so the child grew up and became strong in spirit . John lived in the desert until the time when he came out to preach to Israel .
42002001	At that time , Augustus Caesar sent an order that all people in the countries under Roman rule must list their names in a register .
42002002	This was the first registration ; it was taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria .
42002003	And all went to their own towns to be registered .
42002004	So Joseph left Nazareth , a town in Galilee , and went to the town of Bethlehem in Judea , known as the town of David . Joseph went there because he was from the family of David .
42002005	Joseph registered with Mary , to whom he was engaged and who was now pregnant .
42002006	While they were in Bethlehem , the time came for Mary to have the baby ,
42002007	and she gave birth to her first son . Because there were no rooms left in the inn , she wrapped the baby with pieces of cloth and laid him in a feeding trough .
42002008	That night , some shepherds were in the fields nearby watching their sheep .
42002009	Then an angel of the Lord stood before them . The glory of the Lord was shining around them , and they became very frightened .
42002010	The angel said to them , “ Do not be afraid . I am bringing you good news that will be a great joy to all the people .
42002011	Today your Savior was born in the town of David . He is Christ , the Lord .
42002012	This is how you will know him : You will find a baby wrapped in pieces of cloth and lying in a feeding box . ”
42002013	Then a very large group of angels from heaven joined the first angel , praising God and saying :
42002014	“ Give glory to God in heaven , and on earth let there be peace among the people who please God . ”
42002015	When the angels left them and went back to heaven , the shepherds said to each other , “ Let’s go to Bethlehem . Let’s see this thing that has happened which the Lord has told us about . ”
42002016	So the shepherds went quickly and found Mary and Joseph and the baby , who was lying in a feeding trough .
42002017	When they had seen him , they told what the angels had said about this child .
42002018	Everyone was amazed at what the shepherds said to them .
42002019	But Mary treasured these things and continued to think about them .
42002020	Then the shepherds went back to their sheep , praising God and thanking him for everything they had seen and heard . It had been just as the angel had told them .
42002021	When the baby was eight days old , he was circumcised and was named Jesus , the name given by the angel before the baby began to grow inside Mary .
42002022	When the time came for Mary and Joseph to do what the law of Moses taught about being made pure , they took Jesus to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord .
42002023	( It is written in the law of the Lord : “ Every firstborn male shall be given to the Lord . ” )
42002024	Mary and Joseph also went to offer a sacrifice , as the law of the Lord says : “ You must sacrifice two doves or two young pigeons . ”
42002025	In Jerusalem lived a man named Simeon who was a good man and godly . He was waiting for the time when God would take away Israel’s sorrow , and the Holy Spirit was in him .
42002026	Simeon had been told by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he saw the Christ promised by the Lord .
42002027	The Spirit led Simeon to the Temple . When Mary and Joseph brought the baby Jesus to the Temple to do what the law said they must do ,
42002028	Simeon took the baby in his arms and thanked God :
42002029	“ Now , Lord , you can let me , your servant , die in peace as you said .
42002030	With my own eyes I have seen your salvation ,
42002031	which you prepared before all people .
42002032	It is a light for the non-Jewish people to see and an honor for your people , the Israelites . ”
42002033	Jesus’ father and mother were amazed at what Simeon had said about him .
42002034	Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary , “ God has chosen this child to cause the fall and rise of many in Israel . He will be a sign from God that many people will not accept
42002035	so that the thoughts of many will be made known . And the things that will happen will make your heart sad , too . ”
42002036	There was a prophetess , Anna , from the family of Phanuel in the tribe of Asher . Anna was very old . She had once been married for seven years .
42002037	Then her husband died , and she was a widow for eighty-four years . Anna never left the Temple but worshiped God , going without food and praying day and night .
42002038	Standing there at that time , she thanked God and spoke about Jesus to all who were waiting for God to free Jerusalem .
42002039	When Joseph and Mary had done everything the law of the Lord commanded , they went home to Nazareth , their own town in Galilee .
42002040	The little child grew and became strong . He was filled with wisdom , and God’s goodness was upon him .
42002041	Every year Jesus’ parents went to Jerusalem for the Passover Feast .
42002042	When he was twelve years old , they went to the feast as they always did .
42002043	After the feast days were over , they started home . The boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem , but his parents did not know it .
42002044	Thinking that Jesus was with them in the group , they traveled for a whole day . Then they began to look for him among their family and friends .
42002045	When they did not find him , they went back to Jerusalem to look for him there .
42002046	After three days they found Jesus sitting in the Temple with the teachers , listening to them and asking them questions .
42002047	All who heard him were amazed at his understanding and answers .
42002048	When Jesus’ parents saw him , they were astonished . His mother said to him , “ Son , why did you do this to us ? Your father and I were very worried about you and have been looking for you . ”
42002049	Jesus said to them , “ Why were you looking for me ? Didn’t you know that I must be in my Father’s house ? ”
42002050	But they did not understand the meaning of what he said .
42002051	Jesus went with them to Nazareth and was obedient to them . But his mother kept in her mind all that had happened .
42002052	Jesus became wiser and grew physically . People liked him , and he pleased God .
42003001	It was the fifteenth year of the rule of Tiberius Caesar . These men were under Caesar : Pontius Pilate , the ruler of Judea ; Herod , the ruler of Galilee ; Philip , Herod’s brother , the ruler of Iturea and Traconitis ; and Lysanias , the ruler of Abilene .
42003002	Annas and Caiaphas were the high priests . At this time , the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the desert .
42003003	He went all over the area around the Jordan River preaching a baptism of changed hearts and lives for the forgiveness of sins .
42003004	As it is written in the book of Isaiah the prophet : “ This is a voice of one who calls out in the desert : ‘ Prepare the way for the Lord . Make the road straight for him .
42003005	Every valley should be filled in , and every mountain and hill should be made flat . Roads with turns should be made straight , and rough roads should be made smooth .
42003006	And all people will know about the salvation of God ! ’ ”
42003007	To the crowds of people who came to be baptized by John , he said , “ You are all snakes ! Who warned you to run away from God’s coming punishment ?
42003008	Do the things that show you really have changed your hearts and lives . Don’t begin to say to yourselves , ‘ Abraham is our father . ’ I tell you that God could make children for Abraham from these rocks .
42003009	The ax is now ready to cut down the trees , and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire . ”
42003010	The people asked John , “ Then what should we do ? ”
42003011	John answered , “ If you have two shirts , share with the person who does not have one . If you have food , share that also . ”
42003012	Even tax collectors came to John to be baptized . They said to him , “ Teacher , what should we do ? ”
42003013	John said to them , “ Don’t take more taxes from people than you have been ordered to take . ”
42003014	The soldiers asked John , “ What about us ? What should we do ? ” John said to them , “ Don’t force people to give you money , and don’t lie about them . Be satisfied with the pay you get . ”
42003015	Since the people were hoping for the Christ to come , they wondered if John might be the one .
42003016	John answered everyone , “ I baptize you with water , but there is one coming who is greater than I am . I am not good enough to untie his sandals . He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire .
42003017	He will come ready to clean the grain , separating the good grain from the chaff . He will put the good part of the grain into his barn , but he will burn the chaff with a fire that cannot be put out . ”
42003018	And John continued to preach the Good News , saying many other things to encourage the people .
42003019	But John spoke against Herod , the governor , because of his sin with Herodias , the wife of Herod’s brother , and because of the many other evil things Herod did .
42003020	So Herod did something even worse : He put John in prison .
42003021	When all the people were being baptized by John , Jesus also was baptized . While Jesus was praying , heaven opened
42003022	and the Holy Spirit came down on him in the form of a dove . Then a voice came from heaven , saying , “ You are my Son , whom I love , and I am very pleased with you . ”

42004001	Jesus , filled with the Holy Spirit , returned from the Jordan River . The Spirit led Jesus into the desert
42004002	where the devil tempted Jesus for forty days . Jesus ate nothing during that time , and when those days were ended , he was very hungry .
42004003	The devil said to Jesus , “ If you are the Son of God , tell this rock to become bread . ”
42004004	Jesus answered , “ It is written in the Scriptures : ‘ A person does not live on bread alone . ’ ”
42004005	Then the devil took Jesus and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in an instant .
42004006	The devil said to Jesus , “ I will give you all these kingdoms and all their power and glory . It has all been given to me , and I can give it to anyone I wish .
42004007	If you worship me , then it will all be yours . ”
42004008	Jesus answered , “ It is written in the Scriptures : ‘ You must worship the Lord your God and serve only him . ’ ”
42004009	Then the devil led Jesus to Jerusalem and put him on a high place of the Temple . He said to Jesus , “ If you are the Son of God , jump down .
42004010	It is written in the Scriptures : ‘ He has put his angels in charge of you to watch over you . ’
42004011	It is also written : ‘ They will catch you in their hands so that you will not hit your foot on a rock . ’ ”
42004012	Jesus answered , “ But it also says in the Scriptures : ‘ Do not test the Lord your God . ’ ”
42004013	After the devil had tempted Jesus in every way , he left him to wait until a better time .
42004014	Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Holy Spirit , and stories about him spread all through the area .
42004015	He began to teach in their synagogues , and everyone praised him .
42004016	Jesus traveled to Nazareth , where he had grown up . On the Sabbath day he went to the synagogue , as he always did , and stood up to read .
42004017	The book of Isaiah the prophet was given to him . He opened the book and found the place where this is written :
42004018	“ The Lord has put his Spirit in me , because he appointed me to tell the Good News to the poor . He has sent me to tell the captives they are free and to tell the blind that they can see again . God sent me to free those who have been treated unfairly
42004019	and to announce the time when the Lord will show his kindness . ”
42004020	Jesus closed the book , gave it back to the assistant , and sat down . Everyone in the synagogue was watching Jesus closely .
42004021	He began to say to them , “ While you heard these words just now , they were coming true ! ”
42004022	All the people spoke well of Jesus and were amazed at the words of grace he spoke . They asked , “ Isn’t this Joseph’s son ? ”
42004023	Jesus said to them , “ I know that you will tell me the old saying : ‘ Doctor , heal yourself . ’ You want to say , ‘ We heard about the things you did in Capernaum . Do those things here in your own town ! ’ ”
42004024	Then Jesus said , “ I tell you the truth , a prophet is not accepted in his hometown .
42004025	But I tell you the truth , there were many widows in Israel during the time of Elijah . It did not rain in Israel for three and one-half years , and there was no food anywhere in the whole country .
42004026	But Elijah was sent to none of those widows , only to a widow in Zarephath , a town in Sidon .
42004027	And there were many with skin diseases living in Israel during the time of the prophet Elisha . But none of them were healed , only Naaman , who was from the country of Syria . ”
42004028	When all the people in the synagogue heard these things , they became very angry .
42004029	They got up , forced Jesus out of town , and took him to the edge of the cliff on which the town was built . They planned to throw him off the edge ,
42004030	but Jesus walked through the crowd and went on his way .
42004031	Jesus went to Capernaum , a city in Galilee , and on the Sabbath day , he taught the people .
42004032	They were amazed at his teaching , because he spoke with authority .
42004033	In the synagogue a man who had within him an evil spirit shouted in a loud voice ,
42004034	“ Jesus of Nazareth ! What do you want with us ? Did you come to destroy us ? I know who you are — God’s Holy One ! ”
42004035	Jesus commanded the evil spirit , “ Be quiet ! Come out of the man ! ” The evil spirit threw the man down to the ground before all the people and then left the man without hurting him .
42004036	The people were amazed and said to each other , “ What does this mean ? With authority and power he commands evil spirits , and they come out . ”
42004037	And so the news about Jesus spread to every place in the whole area .
42004038	Jesus left the synagogue and went to the home of Simon . Simon’s mother-in-law was sick with a high fever , and they asked Jesus to help her .
42004039	He came to her side and commanded the fever to leave . It left her , and immediately she got up and began serving them .
42004040	When the sun went down , the people brought those who were sick to Jesus . Putting his hands on each sick person , he healed every one of them .
42004041	Demons came out of many people , shouting , “ You are the Son of God . ” But Jesus commanded the demons and would not allow them to speak , because they knew Jesus was the Christ .
42004042	At daybreak , Jesus went to a lonely place , but the people looked for him . When they found him , they tried to keep him from leaving .
42004043	But Jesus said to them , “ I must preach about God’s kingdom to other towns , too . This is why I was sent . ”
42004044	Then he kept on preaching in the synagogues of Judea .
42005001	One day while Jesus was standing beside Lake Galilee , many people were pressing all around him to hear the word of God .
42005002	Jesus saw two boats at the shore of the lake . The fishermen had left them and were washing their nets .
42005003	Jesus got into one of the boats , the one that belonged to Simon , and asked him to push off a little from the land . Then Jesus sat down and continued to teach the people from the boat .
42005004	When Jesus had finished speaking , he said to Simon , “ Take the boat into deep water , and put your nets in the water to catch some fish . ”
42005005	Simon answered , “ Master , we worked hard all night trying to catch fish , and we caught nothing . But you say to put the nets in the water , so I will . ”
42005006	When the fishermen did as Jesus told them , they caught so many fish that the nets began to break .
42005007	They called to their partners in the other boat to come and help them . They came and filled both boats so full that they were almost sinking .
42005008	When Simon Peter saw what had happened , he bowed down before Jesus and said , “ Go away from me , Lord . I am a sinful man ! ”
42005009	He and the other fishermen were amazed at the many fish they caught , as were
42005010	James and John , the sons of Zebedee , Simon’s partners . Jesus said to Simon , “ Don’t be afraid . From now on you will fish for people . ”
42005011	When the men brought their boats to the shore , they left everything and followed Jesus .
42005012	When Jesus was in one of the towns , there was a man covered with a skin disease . When he saw Jesus , he bowed before him and begged him , “ Lord , you can heal me if you will . ”
42005013	Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man and said , “ I will . Be healed ! ” Immediately the disease disappeared .
42005014	Then Jesus said , “ Don’t tell anyone about this , but go and show yourself to the priest and offer a gift for your healing , as Moses commanded . This will show the people what I have done . ”
42005015	But the news about Jesus spread even more . Many people came to hear Jesus and to be healed of their sicknesses ,
42005016	but Jesus often slipped away to be alone so he could pray .
42005017	One day as Jesus was teaching the people , the Pharisees and teachers of the law from every town in Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem were there . The Lord was giving Jesus the power to heal people .
42005018	Just then , some men were carrying on a mat a man who was paralyzed . They tried to bring him in and put him down before Jesus .
42005019	But because there were so many people there , they could not find a way in . So they went up on the roof and lowered the man on his mat through the ceiling into the middle of the crowd right before Jesus .
42005020	Seeing their faith , Jesus said , “ Friend , your sins are forgiven . ”
42005021	The Jewish teachers of the law and the Pharisees thought to themselves , “ Who is this man who is speaking as if he were God ? Only God can forgive sins . ”
42005022	But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said , “ Why are you thinking these things ?
42005023	Which is easier : to say , ‘ Your sins are forgiven , ’ or to say , ‘ Stand up and walk ’ ?
42005024	But I will prove to you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins . ” So Jesus said to the paralyzed man , “ I tell you , stand up , take your mat , and go home . ”
42005025	At once the man stood up before them , picked up his mat , and went home , praising God .
42005026	All the people were fully amazed and began to praise God . They were filled with much respect and said , “ Today we have seen amazing things ! ”
42005027	After this , Jesus went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting in the tax collector’s booth . Jesus said to him , “ Follow me ! ”
42005028	So Levi got up , left everything , and followed him .
42005029	Then Levi gave a big dinner for Jesus at his house . Many tax collectors and other people were eating there , too .
42005030	But the Pharisees and the men who taught the law for the Pharisees began to complain to Jesus’ followers , “ Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners ? ”
42005031	Jesus answered them , “ It is not the healthy people who need a doctor , but the sick .
42005032	I have not come to invite good people but sinners to change their hearts and lives . ”
42005033	They said to Jesus , “ John’s followers often fast for a certain time and pray , just as the Pharisees do . But your followers eat and drink all the time . ”
42005034	Jesus said to them , “ You cannot make the friends of the bridegroom fast while he is still with them .
42005035	But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them , and then they will fast . ”
42005036	Jesus told them this story : “ No one takes cloth off a new coat to cover a hole in an old coat . Otherwise , he ruins the new coat , and the cloth from the new coat will not be the same as the old cloth .
42005037	Also , no one ever pours new wine into old leather bags . Otherwise , the new wine will break the bags , the wine will spill out , and the leather bags will be ruined .
42005038	New wine must be put into new leather bags .
42005039	No one after drinking old wine wants new wine , because he says , ‘ The old wine is better . ’ ”
42006001	One Sabbath day Jesus was walking through some fields of grain . His followers picked the heads of grain , rubbed them in their hands , and ate them .
42006002	Some Pharisees said , “ Why do you do what is not lawful on the Sabbath day ? ”
42006003	Jesus answered , “ Have you not read what David did when he and those with him were hungry ?
42006004	He went into God’s house and took and ate the holy bread , which is lawful only for priests to eat . And he gave some to the people who were with him . ”
42006005	Then Jesus said to the Pharisees , “ The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath day . ”
42006006	On another Sabbath day Jesus went into the synagogue and was teaching , and a man with a crippled right hand was there .
42006007	The teachers of the law and the Pharisees were watching closely to see if Jesus would heal on the Sabbath day so they could accuse him .
42006008	But he knew what they were thinking , and he said to the man with the crippled hand , “ Stand up here in the middle of everyone . ” The man got up and stood there .
42006009	Then Jesus said to them , “ I ask you , which is lawful on the Sabbath day : to do good or to do evil , to save a life or to destroy it ? ”
42006010	Jesus looked around at all of them and said to the man , “ Hold out your hand . ” The man held out his hand , and it was healed .
42006011	But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law were very angry and discussed with each other what they could do to Jesus .
42006012	At that time Jesus went off to a mountain to pray , and he spent the night praying to God .
42006013	The next morning , Jesus called his followers to him and chose twelve of them , whom he named apostles :
42006014	Simon ( Jesus named him Peter ) , his brother Andrew , James , John , Philip , Bartholomew ,
42006015	Matthew , Thomas , James son of Alphaeus , Simon ( called the Zealot ) ,
42006016	Judas son of James , and Judas Iscariot , who later turned Jesus over to his enemies .
42006017	Jesus and the apostles came down from the mountain , and he stood on level ground . A large group of his followers was there , as well as many people from all around Judea , Jerusalem , and the seacoast cities of Tyre and Sidon .
42006018	They all came to hear Jesus teach and to be healed of their sicknesses , and he healed those who were troubled by evil spirits .
42006019	All the people were trying to touch Jesus , because power was coming from him and healing them all .
42006020	Jesus looked at his followers and said , “ You people who are poor are blessed , because the kingdom of God belongs to you .
42006021	You people who are now hungry are blessed , because you will be satisfied . You people who are now crying are blessed , because you will laugh with joy .
42006022	“ People will hate you , shut you out , insult you , and say you are evil because you follow the Son of Man . But when they do , you will be blessed .
42006023	Be full of joy at that time , because you have a great reward in heaven . Their ancestors did the same things to the prophets .
42006024	“ But how terrible it will be for you who are rich , because you have had your easy life .
42006025	How terrible it will be for you who are full now , because you will be hungry . How terrible it will be for you who are laughing now , because you will be sad and cry .
42006026	“ How terrible when everyone says only good things about you , because their ancestors said the same things about the false prophets .
42006027	“ But I say to you who are listening , love your enemies . Do good to those who hate you ,
42006028	bless those who curse you , pray for those who are cruel to you .
42006029	If anyone slaps you on one cheek , offer him the other cheek , too . If someone takes your coat , do not stop him from taking your shirt .
42006030	Give to everyone who asks you , and when someone takes something that is yours , don’t ask for it back .
42006031	Do to others what you would want them to do to you .
42006032	If you love only the people who love you , what praise should you get ? Even sinners love the people who love them .
42006033	If you do good only to those who do good to you , what praise should you get ? Even sinners do that !
42006034	If you lend things to people , always hoping to get something back , what praise should you get ? Even sinners lend to other sinners so that they can get back the same amount !
42006035	But love your enemies , do good to them , and lend to them without hoping to get anything back . Then you will have a great reward , and you will be children of the Most High God , because he is kind even to people who are ungrateful and full of sin .
42006036	Show mercy , just as your Father shows mercy .
42006037	“ Don’t judge others , and you will not be judged . Don’t accuse others of being guilty , and you will not be accused of being guilty . Forgive , and you will be forgiven .
42006038	Give , and you will receive . You will be given much . Pressed down , shaken together , and running over , it will spill into your lap . The way you give to others is the way God will give to you . ”
42006039	Jesus told them this story : “ Can a blind person lead another blind person ? No ! Both of them will fall into a ditch .
42006040	A student is not better than the teacher , but the student who has been fully trained will be like the teacher .
42006041	“ Why do you notice the little piece of dust in your friend’s eye , but you don’t notice the big piece of wood in your own eye ?
42006042	How can you say to your friend , ‘ Friend , let me take that little piece of dust out of your eye ’ when you cannot see that big piece of wood in your own eye ! You hypocrite ! First , take the wood out of your own eye . Then you will see clearly to take the dust out of your friend’s eye .
42006043	“ A good tree does not produce bad fruit , nor does a bad tree produce good fruit .
42006044	Each tree is known by its own fruit . People don’t gather figs from thornbushes , and they don’t get grapes from bushes .
42006045	Good people bring good things out of the good they stored in their hearts . But evil people bring evil things out of the evil they stored in their hearts . People speak the things that are in their hearts .
42006046	“ Why do you call me , ‘ Lord , Lord , ’ but do not do what I say ?
42006047	I will show you what everyone is like who comes to me and hears my words and obeys .
42006048	That person is like a man building a house who dug deep and laid the foundation on rock . When the floods came , the water tried to wash the house away , but it could not shake it , because the house was built well .
42006049	But the one who hears my words and does not obey is like a man who built his house on the ground without a foundation . When the floods came , the house quickly fell and was completely destroyed . ”
42007001	When Jesus finished saying all these things to the people , he went to Capernaum .
42007002	There was an army officer who had a servant who was very important to him . The servant was so sick he was nearly dead .
42007003	When the officer heard about Jesus , he sent some Jewish elders to him to ask Jesus to come and heal his servant .
42007004	The men went to Jesus and begged him , saying , “ This officer is worthy of your help .
42007005	He loves our people , and he built us a synagogue . ”
42007006	So Jesus went with the men . He was getting near the officer’s house when the officer sent friends to say , “ Lord , don’t trouble yourself , because I am not worthy to have you come into my house .
42007007	That is why I did not come to you myself . But you only need to command it , and my servant will be healed .
42007008	I , too , am a man under the authority of others , and I have soldiers under my command . I tell one soldier , ‘ Go , ’ and he goes . I tell another soldier , ‘ Come , ’ and he comes . I say to my servant , ‘ Do this , ’ and my servant does it . ”
42007009	When Jesus heard this , he was amazed . Turning to the crowd that was following him , he said , “ I tell you , this is the greatest faith I have found anywhere , even in Israel . ”
42007010	Those who had been sent to Jesus went back to the house where they found the servant in good health .
42007011	Soon afterwards Jesus went to a town called Nain , and his followers and a large crowd traveled with him .
42007012	When he came near the town gate , he saw a funeral . A mother , who was a widow , had lost her only son . A large crowd from the town was with the mother while her son was being carried out .
42007013	When the Lord saw her , he felt very sorry for her and said , “ Don’t cry . ”
42007014	He went up and touched the coffin , and the people who were carrying it stopped . Jesus said , “ Young man , I tell you , get up ! ”
42007015	And the son sat up and began to talk . Then Jesus gave him back to his mother .
42007016	All the people were amazed and began praising God , saying , “ A great prophet has come to us ! God has come to help his people . ”
42007017	This news about Jesus spread through all Judea and into all the places around there .
42007018	John’s followers told him about all these things . He called for two of his followers
42007019	and sent them to the Lord to ask , “ Are you the One who is to come , or should we wait for someone else ? ”
42007020	When the men came to Jesus , they said , “ John the Baptist sent us to you with this question : ‘ Are you the One who is to come , or should we wait for someone else ? ’ ”
42007021	At that time , Jesus healed many people of their sicknesses , diseases , and evil spirits , and he gave sight to many blind people .
42007022	Then Jesus answered John’s followers , “ Go tell John what you saw and heard here . The blind can see , the crippled can walk , and people with skin diseases are healed . The deaf can hear , the dead are raised to life , and the Good News is preached to the poor .
42007023	Those who do not stumble in their faith because of me are blessed ! ”
42007024	When John’s followers left , Jesus began talking to the people about John : “ What did you go out into the desert to see ? A reed blown by the wind ?
42007025	What did you go out to see ? A man dressed in fine clothes ? No , people who have fine clothes and much wealth live in kings’ palaces .
42007026	But what did you go out to see ? A prophet ? Yes , and I tell you , John is more than a prophet .
42007027	This was written about him : ‘ I will send my messenger ahead of you , who will prepare the way for you . ’
42007028	I tell you , John is greater than any other person ever born , but even the least important person in the kingdom of God is greater than John . ”
42007029	( When the people , including the tax collectors , heard this , they all agreed that God’s teaching was good , because they had been baptized by John .
42007030	But the Pharisees and experts on the law refused to accept God’s plan for themselves ; they did not let John baptize them . )
42007031	Then Jesus said , “ What shall I say about the people of this time ? What are they like ?
42007032	They are like children sitting in the marketplace , calling to one another and saying , ‘ We played music for you , but you did not dance ; we sang a sad song , but you did not cry . ’
42007033	John the Baptist came and did not eat bread or drink wine , and you say , ‘ He has a demon in him . ’
42007034	The Son of Man came eating and drinking , and you say , ‘ Look at him ! He eats too much and drinks too much wine , and he is a friend of tax collectors and sinners ! ’
42007035	But wisdom is proved to be right by what it does . ”
42007036	One of the Pharisees asked Jesus to eat with him , so Jesus went into the Pharisee’s house and sat at the table .
42007037	A sinful woman in the town learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee’s house . So she brought an alabaster jar of perfume
42007038	and stood behind Jesus at his feet , crying . She began to wash his feet with her tears , and she dried them with her hair , kissing them many times and rubbing them with the perfume .
42007039	When the Pharisee who asked Jesus to come to his house saw this , he thought to himself , “ If Jesus were a prophet , he would know that the woman touching him is a sinner ! ”
42007040	Jesus said to the Pharisee , “ Simon , I have something to say to you . ” Simon said , “ Teacher , tell me . ”
42007041	Jesus said , “ Two people owed money to the same banker . One owed five hundred coins and the other owed fifty .
42007042	They had no money to pay what they owed , but the banker told both of them they did not have to pay him . Which person will love the banker more ? ”
42007043	Simon , the Pharisee , answered , “ I think it would be the one who owed him the most money . ” Jesus said to Simon , “ You are right . ”
42007044	Then Jesus turned toward the woman and said to Simon , “ Do you see this woman ? When I came into your house , you gave me no water for my feet , but she washed my feet with her tears and dried them with her hair .
42007045	You gave me no kiss of greeting , but she has been kissing my feet since I came in .
42007046	You did not put oil on my head , but she poured perfume on my feet .
42007047	I tell you that her many sins are forgiven , so she showed great love . But the person who is forgiven only a little will love only a little . ”
42007048	Then Jesus said to her , “ Your sins are forgiven . ”
42007049	The people sitting at the table began to say among themselves , “ Who is this who even forgives sins ? ”
42007050	Jesus said to the woman , “ Because you believed , you are saved from your sins . Go in peace . ”
42008001	After this , while Jesus was traveling through some cities and small towns , he preached and told the Good News about God’s kingdom . The twelve apostles were with him ,
42008002	and also some women who had been healed of sicknesses and evil spirits : Mary , called Magdalene , from whom seven demons had gone out ;
42008003	Joanna , the wife of Cuza ( the manager of Herod’s house ) ; Susanna ; and many others . These women used their own money to help Jesus and his apostles .
42008004	When a great crowd was gathered , and people were coming to Jesus from every town , he told them this story :
42008005	“ A farmer went out to plant his seed . While he was planting , some seed fell by the road . People walked on the seed , and the birds ate it up .
42008006	Some seed fell on rock , and when it began to grow , it died because it had no water .
42008007	Some seed fell among thorny weeds , but the weeds grew up with it and choked the good plants .
42008008	And some seed fell on good ground and grew and made a hundred times more . ” As Jesus finished the story , he called out , “ Let those with ears use them and listen ! ”
42008009	Jesus’ followers asked him what this story meant .
42008010	Jesus said , “ You have been chosen to know the secrets about the kingdom of God . But I use stories to speak to other people so that : ‘ They will look , but they may not see . They will listen , but they may not understand . ’
42008011	“ This is what the story means : The seed is God’s message .
42008012	The seed that fell beside the road is like the people who hear God’s teaching , but the devil comes and takes it away from them so they cannot believe it and be saved .
42008013	The seed that fell on rock is like those who hear God’s teaching and accept it gladly , but they don’t allow the teaching to go deep into their lives . They believe for a while , but when trouble comes , they give up .
42008014	The seed that fell among the thorny weeds is like those who hear God’s teaching , but they let the worries , riches , and pleasures of this life keep them from growing and producing good fruit .
42008015	And the seed that fell on the good ground is like those who hear God’s teaching with good , honest hearts and obey it and patiently produce good fruit .
42008016	“ No one after lighting a lamp covers it with a bowl or hides it under a bed . Instead , the person puts it on a lampstand so those who come in will see the light .
42008017	Everything that is hidden will become clear , and every secret thing will be made known .
42008018	So be careful how you listen . Those who have understanding will be given more . But those who do not have understanding , even what they think they have will be taken away from them . ”
42008019	Jesus’ mother and brothers came to see him , but there was such a crowd they could not get to him .
42008020	Someone said to Jesus , “ Your mother and your brothers are standing outside , wanting to see you . ”
42008021	Jesus answered them , “ My mother and my brothers are those who listen to God’s teaching and obey it ! ”
42008022	One day Jesus and his followers got into a boat , and he said to them , “ Let’s go across the lake . ” And so they started across .
42008023	While they were sailing , Jesus fell asleep . A very strong wind blew up on the lake , causing the boat to fill with water , and they were in danger .
42008024	The followers went to Jesus and woke him , saying , “ Master ! Master ! We will drown ! ” Jesus got up and gave a command to the wind and the waves . They stopped , and it became calm .
42008025	Jesus said to his followers , “ Where is your faith ? ” The followers were afraid and amazed and said to each other , “ Who is this that commands even the wind and the water , and they obey him ? ”
42008026	Jesus and his followers sailed across the lake from Galilee to the area of the Gerasene people .
42008027	When Jesus got out on the land , a man from the town who had demons inside him came to Jesus . For a long time he had worn no clothes and had lived in the burial caves , not in a house .
42008028	When he saw Jesus , he cried out and fell down before him . He said with a loud voice , “ What do you want with me , Jesus , Son of the Most High God ? I beg you , don’t torture me ! ”
42008029	He said this because Jesus was commanding the evil spirit to come out of the man . Many times it had taken hold of him . Though he had been kept under guard and chained hand and foot , he had broken his chains and had been forced by the demon out into a lonely place .
42008030	Jesus asked him , “ What is your name ? ” He answered , “ Legion , ” because many demons were in him .
42008031	The demons begged Jesus not to send them into eternal darkness .
42008032	A large herd of pigs was feeding on a hill , and the demons begged Jesus to allow them to go into the pigs . So Jesus allowed them to do this .
42008033	When the demons came out of the man , they went into the pigs , and the herd ran down the hill into the lake and was drowned .
42008034	When the herdsmen saw what had happened , they ran away and told about this in the town and the countryside .
42008035	And people went to see what had happened . When they came to Jesus , they found the man sitting at Jesus’ feet , clothed and in his right mind , because the demons were gone . But the people were frightened .
42008036	The people who saw this happen told the others how Jesus had made the man well .
42008037	All the people of the Gerasene country asked Jesus to leave , because they were all very afraid . So Jesus got into the boat and went back to Galilee .
42008038	The man whom Jesus had healed begged to go with him , but Jesus sent him away , saying ,
42008039	“ Go back home and tell people how much God has done for you . ” So the man went all over town telling how much Jesus had done for him .
42008040	When Jesus got back to Galilee , a crowd welcomed him , because everyone was waiting for him .
42008041	A man named Jairus , a leader of the synagogue , came to Jesus and fell at his feet , begging him to come to his house .
42008042	Jairus’ only daughter , about twelve years old , was dying . While Jesus was on his way to Jairus’ house , the people were crowding all around him .
42008043	A woman was in the crowd who had been bleeding for twelve years , but no one was able to heal her .
42008044	She came up behind Jesus and touched the edge of his coat , and instantly her bleeding stopped .
42008045	Then Jesus said , “ Who touched me ? ” When all the people said they had not touched him , Peter said , “ Master , the people are all around you and are pushing against you . ”
42008046	But Jesus said , “ Someone did touch me , because I felt power go out from me . ”
42008047	When the woman saw she could not hide , she came forward , shaking , and fell down before Jesus . While all the people listened , she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed .
42008048	Jesus said to her , “ Dear woman , you are made well because you believed . Go in peace . ”
42008049	While Jesus was still speaking , someone came from the house of the synagogue leader and said to him , “ Your daughter is dead . Don’t bother the teacher anymore . ”
42008050	When Jesus heard this , he said to Jairus , “ Don’t be afraid . Just believe , and your daughter will be well . ”
42008051	When Jesus went to the house , he let only Peter , John , James , and the girl’s father and mother go inside with him .
42008052	All the people were crying and feeling sad because the girl was dead , but Jesus said , “ Stop crying . She is not dead , only asleep . ”
42008053	The people laughed at Jesus because they knew the girl was dead .
42008054	But Jesus took hold of her hand and called to her , “ My child , stand up ! ”
42008055	Her spirit came back into her , and she stood up at once . Then Jesus ordered that she be given something to eat .
42008056	The girl’s parents were amazed , but Jesus told them not to tell anyone what had happened .
42009001	Jesus called the twelve apostles together and gave them power and authority over all demons and the ability to heal sicknesses .
42009002	He sent the apostles out to tell about God’s kingdom and to heal the sick .
42009003	He said to them , “ Take nothing for your trip , neither a walking stick , bag , bread , money , or extra clothes .
42009004	When you enter a house , stay there until it is time to leave .
42009005	If people do not welcome you , shake the dust off of your feet as you leave the town , as a warning to them . ”
42009006	So the apostles went out and traveled through all the towns , preaching the Good News and healing people everywhere .
42009007	Herod , the governor , heard about all the things that were happening and was confused , because some people said , “ John the Baptist has risen from the dead . ”
42009008	Others said , “ Elijah has come to us . ” And still others said , “ One of the prophets who lived long ago has risen from the dead . ”
42009009	Herod said , “ I cut off John’s head , so who is this man I hear such things about ? ” And Herod kept trying to see Jesus .
42009010	When the apostles returned , they told Jesus everything they had done . Then Jesus took them with him to a town called Bethsaida where they could be alone together .
42009011	But the people learned where Jesus went and followed him . He welcomed them and talked with them about God’s kingdom and healed those who needed to be healed .
42009012	Late in the afternoon , the twelve apostles came to Jesus and said , “ Send the people away . They need to go to the towns and countryside around here and find places to sleep and something to eat , because no one lives in this place . ”
42009013	But Jesus said to them , “ You give them something to eat . ” They said , “ We have only five loaves of bread and two fish , unless we go buy food for all these people . ”
42009014	( There were about five thousand men there . ) Jesus said to his followers , “ Tell the people to sit in groups of about fifty people . ”
42009015	So the followers did this , and all the people sat down .
42009016	Then Jesus took the five loaves of bread and two fish , and looking up to heaven , he thanked God for the food . Then he divided the food and gave it to the followers to give to the people .
42009017	They all ate and were satisfied , and what was left over was gathered up , filling twelve baskets .
42009018	One time when Jesus was praying alone , his followers were with him , and he asked them , “ Who do the people say I am ? ”
42009019	They answered , “ Some say you are John the Baptist . Others say you are Elijah . And others say you are one of the prophets from long ago who has come back to life . ”
42009020	Then Jesus asked , “ But who do you say I am ? ” Peter answered , “ You are the Christ from God . ”
42009021	Jesus warned them not to tell anyone , saying ,
42009022	“ The Son of Man must suffer many things . He will be rejected by the Jewish elders , the leading priests , and the teachers of the law . He will be killed and after three days will be raised from the dead . ”
42009023	Jesus said to all of them , “ If people want to follow me , they must give up the things they want . They must be willing to give up their lives daily to follow me .
42009024	Those who want to save their lives will give up true life . But those who give up their lives for me will have true life .
42009025	It is worthless to have the whole world if they themselves are destroyed or lost .
42009026	If people are ashamed of me and my teaching , then the Son of Man will be ashamed of them when he comes in his glory and with the glory of the Father and the holy angels .
42009027	I tell you the truth , some people standing here will see the kingdom of God before they die . ”
42009028	About eight days after Jesus said these things , he took Peter , John , and James and went up on a mountain to pray .
42009029	While Jesus was praying , the appearance of his face changed , and his clothes became shining white .
42009030	Then two men , Moses and Elijah , were talking with Jesus .
42009031	They appeared in heavenly glory , talking about his departure which he would soon bring about in Jerusalem .
42009032	Peter and the others were very sleepy , but when they awoke fully , they saw the glory of Jesus and the two men standing with him .
42009033	When Moses and Elijah were about to leave , Peter said to Jesus , “ Master , it is good that we are here . Let us make three tents — one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . ” ( Peter did not know what he was talking about . )
42009034	While he was saying these things , a cloud came and covered them , and they became afraid as the cloud covered them .
42009035	A voice came from the cloud , saying , “ This is my Son , whom I have chosen . Listen to him ! ”
42009036	When the voice finished speaking , only Jesus was there . Peter , John , and James said nothing and told no one at that time what they had seen .
42009037	The next day , when they came down from the mountain , a large crowd met Jesus .
42009038	A man in the crowd shouted to him , “ Teacher , please come and look at my son , because he is my only child .
42009039	An evil spirit seizes my son , and suddenly he screams . It causes him to lose control of himself and foam at the mouth . The evil spirit keeps on hurting him and almost never leaves him .
42009040	I begged your followers to force the evil spirit out , but they could not do it . ”
42009041	Jesus answered , “ You people have no faith , and your lives are all wrong . How long must I stay with you and put up with you ? Bring your son here . ”
42009042	While the boy was coming , the demon threw him on the ground and made him lose control of himself . But Jesus gave a strong command to the evil spirit and healed the boy and gave him back to his father .
42009043	All the people were amazed at the great power of God . While everyone was wondering about all that Jesus did , he said to his followers ,
42009044	“ Don’t forget what I tell you now : The Son of Man will be handed over to people . ”
42009045	But the followers did not understand what this meant ; the meaning was hidden from them so they could not understand . But they were afraid to ask Jesus about it .
42009046	Jesus’ followers began to have an argument about which one of them was the greatest .
42009047	Jesus knew what they were thinking , so he took a little child and stood the child beside him .
42009048	Then Jesus said , “ Whoever accepts this little child in my name accepts me . And whoever accepts me accepts the One who sent me , because whoever is least among you all is really the greatest . ”
42009049	John answered , “ Master , we saw someone using your name to force demons out of people . We told him to stop , because he does not belong to our group . ”
42009050	But Jesus said to him , “ Don’t stop him , because whoever is not against you is for you . ”
42009051	When the time was coming near for Jesus to depart , he was determined to go to Jerusalem .
42009052	He sent some messengers ahead of him , who went into a town in Samaria to make everything ready for him .
42009053	But the people there would not welcome him , because he was set on going to Jerusalem .
42009054	When James and John , followers of Jesus , saw this , they said , “ Lord , do you want us to call fire down from heaven and destroy those people ? ”
42009055	But Jesus turned and scolded them . [ And Jesus said , “ You don’t know what kind of spirit you belong to .
42009056	The Son of Man did not come to destroy the souls of people but to save them . ” ] Then they went to another town .
42009057	As they were going along the road , someone said to Jesus , “ I will follow you any place you go . ”
42009058	Jesus said to them , “ The foxes have holes to live in , and the birds have nests , but the Son of Man has no place to rest his head . ”
42009059	Jesus said to another man , “ Follow me ! ” But he said , “ Lord , first let me go and bury my father . ”
42009060	But Jesus said to him , “ Let the people who are dead bury their own dead . You must go and tell about the kingdom of God . ”
42009061	Another man said , “ I will follow you , Lord , but first let me go and say good-bye to my family . ”
42009062	Jesus said , “ Anyone who begins to plow a field but keeps looking back is of no use in the kingdom of God . ”
42010001	After this , the Lord chose seventy-two others and sent them out in pairs ahead of him into every town and place where he planned to go .
42010002	He said to them , “ There are a great many people to harvest , but there are only a few workers . So pray to God , who owns the harvest , that he will send more workers to help gather his harvest .
42010003	Go now , but listen ! I am sending you out like sheep among wolves .
42010004	Don’t carry a purse , a bag , or sandals , and don’t waste time talking with people on the road .
42010005	Before you go into a house , say , ‘ Peace be with this house . ’
42010006	If peace-loving people live there , your blessing of peace will stay with them , but if not , then your blessing will come back to you .
42010007	Stay in the same house , eating and drinking what the people there give you . A worker should be given his pay . Don’t move from house to house .
42010008	If you go into a town and the people welcome you , eat what they give you .
42010009	Heal the sick who live there , and tell them , ‘ The kingdom of God is near you . ’
42010010	But if you go into a town , and the people don’t welcome you , then go into the streets and say ,
42010011	‘ Even the dirt from your town that sticks to our feet we wipe off against you . But remember that the kingdom of God is near . ’
42010012	I tell you , on the Judgment Day it will be better for the people of Sodom than for the people of that town .
42010013	“ How terrible for you , Korazin ! How terrible for you , Bethsaida ! If the miracles I did in you had happened in Tyre and Sidon , those people would have changed their lives long ago . They would have worn rough cloth and put ashes on themselves to show they had changed .
42010014	But on the Judgment Day it will be better for Tyre and Sidon than for you .
42010015	And you , Capernaum , will you be lifted up to heaven ? No ! You will be thrown down to the depths !
42010016	“ Whoever listens to you listens to me , and whoever refuses to accept you refuses to accept me . And whoever refuses to accept me refuses to accept the One who sent me . ”
42010017	When the seventy-two came back , they were very happy and said , “ Lord , even the demons obeyed us when we used your name ! ”
42010018	Jesus said , “ I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven .
42010019	Listen , I have given you power to walk on snakes and scorpions , power that is greater than the enemy has . So nothing will hurt you .
42010020	But you should not be happy because the spirits obey you but because your names are written in heaven . ”
42010021	Then Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said , “ I praise you , Father , Lord of heaven and earth , because you have hidden these things from the people who are wise and smart . But you have shown them to those who are like little children . Yes , Father , this is what you really wanted .
42010022	“ My Father has given me all things . No one knows who the Son is , except the Father . And no one knows who the Father is , except the Son and those whom the Son chooses to tell . ”
42010023	Then Jesus turned to his followers and said privately , “ You are blessed to see what you now see .
42010024	I tell you , many prophets and kings wanted to see what you now see , but they did not , and they wanted to hear what you now hear , but they did not . ”
42010025	Then an expert on the law stood up to test Jesus , saying , “ Teacher , what must I do to get life forever ? ”
42010026	Jesus said , “ What is written in the law ? What do you read there ? ”
42010027	The man answered , “ Love the Lord your God with all your heart , all your soul , all your strength , and all your mind . ” Also , “ Love your neighbor as you love yourself . ”
42010028	Jesus said to him , “ Your answer is right . Do this and you will live . ”
42010029	But the man , wanting to show the importance of his question , said to Jesus , “ And who is my neighbor ? ”
42010030	Jesus answered , “ As a man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho , some robbers attacked him . They tore off his clothes , beat him , and left him lying there , almost dead .
42010031	It happened that a priest was going down that road . When he saw the man , he walked by on the other side .
42010032	Next , a Levite came there , and after he went over and looked at the man , he walked by on the other side of the road .
42010033	Then a Samaritan traveling down the road came to where the hurt man was . When he saw the man , he felt very sorry for him .
42010034	The Samaritan went to him , poured olive oil and wine on his wounds , and bandaged them . Then he put the hurt man on his own donkey and took him to an inn where he cared for him .
42010035	The next day , the Samaritan brought out two coins , gave them to the innkeeper , and said , ‘ Take care of this man . If you spend more money on him , I will pay it back to you when I come again . ’ ”
42010036	Then Jesus said , “ Which one of these three men do you think was a neighbor to the man who was attacked by the robbers ? ”
42010037	The expert on the law answered , “ The one who showed him mercy . ” Jesus said to him , “ Then go and do what he did . ”
42010038	While Jesus and his followers were traveling , Jesus went into a town . A woman named Martha let Jesus stay at her house .
42010039	Martha had a sister named Mary , who was sitting at Jesus’ feet and listening to him teach .
42010040	But Martha was busy with all the work to be done . She went in and said , “ Lord , don’t you care that my sister has left me alone to do all the work ? Tell her to help me . ”
42010041	But the Lord answered her , “ Martha , Martha , you are worried and upset about many things .
42010042	Only one thing is important . Mary has chosen the better thing , and it will never be taken away from her . ”
42011001	One time Jesus was praying in a certain place . When he finished , one of his followers said to him , “ Lord , teach us to pray as John taught his followers . ”
42011002	Jesus said to them , “ When you pray , say : ‘ Father , may your name always be kept holy . May your kingdom come .
42011003	Give us the food we need for each day .
42011004	Forgive us for our sins , because we forgive everyone who has done wrong to us . And do not cause us to be tempted . ’ ”
42011005	Then Jesus said to them , “ Suppose one of you went to your friend’s house at midnight and said to him , ‘ Friend , loan me three loaves of bread .
42011006	A friend of mine has come into town to visit me , but I have nothing for him to eat . ’
42011007	Your friend inside the house answers , ‘ Don’t bother me ! The door is already locked , and my children and I are in bed . I cannot get up and give you anything . ’
42011008	I tell you , if friendship is not enough to make him get up to give you the bread , your boldness will make him get up and give you whatever you need .
42011009	So I tell you , ask , and God will give to you . Search , and you will find . Knock , and the door will open for you .
42011010	Yes , everyone who asks will receive . The one who searches will find . And everyone who knocks will have the door opened .
42011011	If your children ask for a fish , which of you would give them a snake instead ?
42011012	Or , if your children ask for an egg , would you give them a scorpion ?
42011013	Even though you are bad , you know how to give good things to your children . How much more your heavenly Father will give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him ! ”
42011014	One time Jesus was sending out a demon who could not talk . When the demon came out , the man who had been unable to speak , then spoke . The people were amazed .
42011015	But some of them said , “ Jesus uses the power of Beelzebul , the ruler of demons , to force demons out of people . ”
42011016	Other people , wanting to test Jesus , asked him to give them a sign from heaven .
42011017	But knowing their thoughts , he said to them , “ Every kingdom that is divided against itself will be destroyed . And a family that is divided against itself will not continue .
42011018	So if Satan is divided against himself , his kingdom will not continue . You say that I use the power of Beelzebul to force out demons .
42011019	But if I use the power of Beelzebul to force out demons , what power do your people use to force demons out ? So they will be your judges .
42011020	But if I use the power of God to force out demons , then the kingdom of God has come to you .
42011021	“ When a strong person with many weapons guards his own house , his possessions are safe .
42011022	But when someone stronger comes and defeats him , the stronger one will take away the weapons the first man trusted and will give away the possessions .
42011023	“ Anyone who is not with me is against me , and anyone who does not work with me is working against me .
42011024	“ When an evil spirit comes out of a person , it travels through dry places , looking for a place to rest . But when it finds no place , it says , ‘ I will go back to the house I left . ’
42011025	And when it comes back , it finds that house swept clean and made neat .
42011026	Then the evil spirit goes out and brings seven other spirits more evil than it is , and they go in and live there . So the person has even more trouble than before . ”
42011027	As Jesus was saying these things , a woman in the crowd called out to Jesus , “ Blessed is the mother who gave birth to you and nursed you . ”
42011028	But Jesus said , “ No , blessed are those who hear the teaching of God and obey it . ”
42011029	As the crowd grew larger , Jesus said , “ The people who live today are evil . They want to see a miracle for a sign , but no sign will be given them , except the sign of Jonah .
42011030	As Jonah was a sign for those people who lived in Nineveh , the Son of Man will be a sign for the people of this time .
42011031	On the Judgment Day the Queen of the South will stand up with the people who live now . She will show they are guilty , because she came from far away to listen to Solomon’s wise teaching . And I tell you that someone greater than Solomon is here .
42011032	On the Judgment Day the people of Nineveh will stand up with the people who live now , and they will show that you are guilty . When Jonah preached to them , they were sorry and changed their lives . And I tell you that someone greater than Jonah is here .
42011033	“ No one lights a lamp and puts it in a secret place or under a bowl , but on a lampstand so the people who come in can see .
42011034	Your eye is a light for the body . When your eyes are good , your whole body will be full of light . But when your eyes are evil , your whole body will be full of darkness .
42011035	So be careful not to let the light in you become darkness .
42011036	If your whole body is full of light , and none of it is dark , then you will shine bright , as when a lamp shines on you . ”
42011037	After Jesus had finished speaking , a Pharisee asked Jesus to eat with him . So Jesus went in and sat at the table .
42011038	But the Pharisee was surprised when he saw that Jesus did not wash his hands before the meal .
42011039	The Lord said to him , “ You Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and the dish , but inside you are full of greed and evil .
42011040	You foolish people ! The same one who made what is outside also made what is inside .
42011041	So give what is in your dishes to the poor , and then you will be fully clean .
42011042	How terrible for you Pharisees ! You give God one-tenth of even your mint , your rue , and every other plant in your garden . But you fail to be fair to others and to love God . These are the things you should do while continuing to do those other things .
42011043	How terrible for you Pharisees , because you love to have the most important seats in the synagogues , and you love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces .
42011044	How terrible for you , because you are like hidden graves , which people walk on without knowing . ”
42011045	One of the experts on the law said to Jesus , “ Teacher , when you say these things , you are insulting us , too . ”
42011046	Jesus answered , “ How terrible for you , you experts on the law ! You make strict rules that are very hard for people to obey , but you yourselves don’t even try to follow those rules .
42011047	How terrible for you , because you build tombs for the prophets whom your ancestors killed !
42011048	And now you show that you approve of what your ancestors did . They killed the prophets , and you build tombs for them !
42011049	This is why in his wisdom God said , ‘ I will send prophets and apostles to them . They will kill some , and they will treat others cruelly . ’
42011050	So you who live now will be punished for the deaths of all the prophets who were killed since the beginning of the world —
42011051	from the killing of Abel to the killing of Zechariah , who died between the altar and the Temple . Yes , I tell you that you who are alive now will be punished for them all .
42011052	“ How terrible for you , you experts on the law . You have taken away the key to learning about God . You yourselves would not learn , and you stopped others from learning , too . ”
42011053	When Jesus left , the teachers of the law and the Pharisees began to give him trouble , asking him questions about many things ,
42011054	trying to catch him saying something wrong .
42012001	So many thousands of people had gathered that they were stepping on each other . Jesus spoke first to his followers , saying , “ Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees , because they are hypocrites .
42012002	Everything that is hidden will be shown , and everything that is secret will be made known .
42012003	What you have said in the dark will be heard in the light , and what you have whispered in an inner room will be shouted from the housetops .
42012004	“ I tell you , my friends , don’t be afraid of people who can kill the body but after that can do nothing more to hurt you .
42012005	I will show you the one to fear . Fear the one who has the power to kill you and also to throw you into hell . Yes , this is the one you should fear .
42012006	“ Five sparrows are sold for only two pennies , and God does not forget any of them .
42012007	But God even knows how many hairs you have on your head . Don’t be afraid . You are worth much more than many sparrows .
42012008	“ I tell you , all those who stand before others and say they believe in me , I , the Son of Man , will say before the angels of God that they belong to me .
42012009	But all who stand before others and say they do not believe in me , I will say before the angels of God that they do not belong to me .
42012010	“ Anyone who speaks against the Son of Man can be forgiven , but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven .
42012011	“ When you are brought into the synagogues before the leaders and other powerful people , don’t worry about how to defend yourself or what to say .
42012012	At that time the Holy Spirit will teach you what you must say . ”
42012013	Someone in the crowd said to Jesus , “ Teacher , tell my brother to divide with me the property our father left us . ”
42012014	But Jesus said to him , “ Who said I should judge or decide between you ? ”
42012015	Then Jesus said to them , “ Be careful and guard against all kinds of greed . Life is not measured by how much one owns . ”
42012016	Then Jesus told this story : “ There was a rich man who had some land , which grew a good crop .
42012017	He thought to himself , ‘ What will I do ? I have no place to keep all my crops . ’
42012018	Then he said , ‘ This is what I will do : I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones , and there I will store all my grain and other goods .
42012019	Then I can say to myself , “ I have enough good things stored to last for many years . Rest , eat , drink , and enjoy life ! ” ’
42012020	“ But God said to him , ‘ Foolish man ! Tonight your life will be taken from you . So who will get those things you have prepared for yourself ? ’
42012021	“ This is how it will be for those who store up things for themselves and are not rich toward God . ”
42012022	Jesus said to his followers , “ So I tell you , don’t worry about the food you need to live , or about the clothes you need for your body .
42012023	Life is more than food , and the body is more than clothes .
42012024	Look at the birds . They don’t plant or harvest , they don’t have storerooms or barns , but God feeds them . And you are worth much more than birds .
42012025	You cannot add any time to your life by worrying about it .
42012026	If you cannot do even the little things , then why worry about the big things ?
42012027	Consider how the lilies grow ; they don’t work or make clothes for themselves . But I tell you that even Solomon with his riches was not dressed as beautifully as one of these flowers .
42012028	God clothes the grass in the field , which is alive today but tomorrow is thrown into the fire . So how much more will God clothe you ? Don’t have so little faith !
42012029	Don’t always think about what you will eat or what you will drink , and don’t keep worrying .
42012030	All the people in the world are trying to get these things , and your Father knows you need them .
42012031	But seek God’s kingdom , and all your other needs will be met as well .
42012032	“ Don’t fear , little flock , because your Father wants to give you the kingdom .
42012033	Sell your possessions and give to the poor . Get for yourselves purses that will not wear out , the treasure in heaven that never runs out , where thieves can’t steal and moths can’t destroy .
42012034	Your heart will be where your treasure is .
42012035	“ Be dressed , ready for service , and have your lamps shining .
42012036	Be like servants who are waiting for their master to come home from a wedding party . When he comes and knocks , the servants immediately open the door for him .
42012037	They will be blessed when their master comes home , because he sees that they were watching for him . I tell you the truth , the master will dress himself to serve and tell the servants to sit at the table , and he will serve them .
42012038	Those servants will be blessed when he comes in and finds them still waiting , even if it is midnight or later .
42012039	“ Remember this : If the owner of the house knew what time a thief was coming , he would not allow the thief to enter his house .
42012040	So you also must be ready , because the Son of Man will come at a time when you don’t expect him ! ”
42012041	Peter said , “ Lord , did you tell this story to us or to all people ? ”
42012042	The Lord said , “ Who is the wise and trusted servant that the master trusts to give the other servants their food at the right time ?
42012043	When the master comes and finds the servant doing his work , the servant will be blessed .
42012044	I tell you the truth , the master will choose that servant to take care of everything he owns .
42012045	But suppose the servant thinks to himself , ‘ My master will not come back soon , ’ and he begins to beat the other servants , men and women , and to eat and drink and get drunk .
42012046	The master will come when that servant is not ready and is not expecting him . Then the master will cut him in pieces and send him away to be with the others who don’t obey .
42012047	“ The servant who knows what his master wants but is not ready , or who does not do what the master wants , will be beaten with many blows !
42012048	But the servant who does not know what his master wants and does things that should be punished will be beaten with few blows . From everyone who has been given much , much will be demanded . And from the one trusted with much , much more will be expected .
42012049	“ I came to set fire to the world , and I wish it were already burning !
42012050	I have a baptism to suffer through , and I feel very troubled until it is over .
42012051	Do you think I came to give peace to the earth ? No , I tell you , I came to divide it .
42012052	From now on , a family with five people will be divided , three against two , and two against three .
42012053	They will be divided : father against son and son against father , mother against daughter and daughter against mother , mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law . ”
42012054	Then Jesus said to the people , “ When you see clouds coming up in the west , you say , ‘ It’s going to rain , ’ and it happens .
42012055	When you feel the wind begin to blow from the south , you say , ‘ It will be a hot day , ’ and it happens .
42012056	Hypocrites ! You know how to understand the appearance of the earth and sky . Why don’t you understand what is happening now ?
42012057	“ Why can’t you decide for yourselves what is right ?
42012058	If your enemy is taking you to court , try hard to settle it on the way . If you don’t , your enemy might take you to the judge , and the judge might turn you over to the officer , and the officer might throw you into jail .
42012059	I tell you , you will not get out of there until you have paid everything you owe . ”
42013001	At that time some people were there who told Jesus that Pilate had killed some people from Galilee while they were worshiping . He mixed their blood with the blood of the animals they were sacrificing to God .
42013002	Jesus answered , “ Do you think this happened to them because they were more sinful than all others from Galilee ?
42013003	No , I tell you . But unless you change your hearts and lives , you will be destroyed as they were !
42013004	What about those eighteen people who died when the tower of Siloam fell on them ? Do you think they were more sinful than all the others who live in Jerusalem ?
42013005	No , I tell you . But unless you change your hearts and lives , you will all be destroyed too ! ”
42013006	Jesus told this story : “ A man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard . He came looking for some fruit on the tree , but he found none .
42013007	So the man said to his gardener , ‘ I have been looking for fruit on this tree for three years , but I never find any . Cut it down . Why should it waste the ground ? ’
42013008	But the servant answered , ‘ Master , let the tree have one more year to produce fruit . Let me dig up the dirt around it and put on some fertilizer .
42013009	If the tree produces fruit next year , good . But if not , you can cut it down . ’ ”
42013010	Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath day .
42013011	A woman was there who , for eighteen years , had an evil spirit in her that made her crippled . Her back was always bent ; she could not stand up straight .
42013012	When Jesus saw her , he called her over and said , “ Woman , you are free from your sickness . ”
42013013	Jesus put his hands on her , and immediately she was able to stand up straight and began praising God .
42013014	The synagogue leader was angry because Jesus healed on the Sabbath day . He said to the people , “ There are six days when one has to work . So come to be healed on one of those days , and not on the Sabbath day . ”
42013015	The Lord answered , “ You hypocrites ! Doesn’t each of you untie your work animals and lead them to drink water every day — even on the Sabbath day ?
42013016	This woman that I healed , a daughter of Abraham , has been held by Satan for eighteen years . Surely it is not wrong for her to be freed from her sickness on a Sabbath day ! ”
42013017	When Jesus said this , all of those who were criticizing him were ashamed , but the entire crowd rejoiced at all the wonderful things Jesus was doing .
42013018	Then Jesus said , “ What is God’s kingdom like ? What can I compare it with ?
42013019	It is like a mustard seed that a man plants in his garden . The seed grows and becomes a tree , and the wild birds build nests in its branches . ”
42013020	Jesus said again , “ What can I compare God’s kingdom with ?
42013021	It is like yeast that a woman took and hid in a large tub of flour until it made all the dough rise . ”
42013022	Jesus was teaching in every town and village as he traveled toward Jerusalem .
42013023	Someone said to Jesus , “ Lord , will only a few people be saved ? ” Jesus said ,
42013024	“ Try hard to enter through the narrow door , because many people will try to enter there , but they will not be able .
42013025	When the owner of the house gets up and closes the door , you can stand outside and knock on the door and say , ‘ Sir , open the door for us . ’ But he will answer , ‘ I don’t know you or where you come from . ’
42013026	Then you will say , ‘ We ate and drank with you , and you taught in the streets of our town . ’
42013027	But he will say to you , ‘ I don’t know you or where you come from . Go away from me , all you who do evil ! ’
42013028	You will cry and grind your teeth with pain when you see Abraham , Isaac , Jacob , and all the prophets in God’s kingdom , but you yourselves thrown outside .
42013029	People will come from the east , west , north , and south and will sit down at the table in the kingdom of God .
42013030	There are those who are last now who will be first in the future . And there are those who are first now who will be last in the future . ”
42013031	At that time some Pharisees came to Jesus and said , “ Go away from here ! Herod wants to kill you ! ”
42013032	Jesus said to them , “ Go tell that fox Herod , ‘ Today and tomorrow I am forcing demons out and healing people . Then , on the third day , I will reach my goal . ’
42013033	Yet I must be on my way today and tomorrow and the next day . Surely it cannot be right for a prophet to be killed anywhere except in Jerusalem .
42013034	“ Jerusalem , Jerusalem ! You kill the prophets and stone to death those who are sent to you . Many times I wanted to gather your people as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings , but you would not let me .
42013035	Now your house is left completely empty . I tell you , you will not see me until that time when you will say , ‘ God bless the One who comes in the name of the Lord . ’ ”
42014001	On a Sabbath day , when Jesus went to eat at the home of a leading Pharisee , the people were watching Jesus very closely .
42014002	And in front of him was a man with dropsy .
42014003	Jesus said to the Pharisees and experts on the law , “ Is it right or wrong to heal on the Sabbath day ? ”
42014004	But they would not answer his question . So Jesus took the man , healed him , and sent him away .
42014005	Jesus said to the Pharisees and teachers of the law , “ If your child or ox falls into a well on the Sabbath day , will you not pull him out quickly ? ”
42014006	And they could not answer him .
42014007	When Jesus noticed that some of the guests were choosing the best places to sit , he told this story :
42014008	“ When someone invites you to a wedding feast , don’t take the most important seat , because someone more important than you may have been invited .
42014009	The host , who invited both of you , will come to you and say , ‘ Give this person your seat . ’ Then you will be embarrassed and will have to move to the last place .
42014010	So when you are invited , go sit in a seat that is not important . When the host comes to you , he may say , ‘ Friend , move up here to a more important place . ’ Then all the other guests will respect you .
42014011	All who make themselves great will be made humble , but those who make themselves humble will be made great . ”
42014012	Then Jesus said to the man who had invited him , “ When you give a lunch or a dinner , don’t invite only your friends , your family , your other relatives , and your rich neighbors . At another time they will invite you to eat with them , and you will be repaid .
42014013	Instead , when you give a feast , invite the poor , the crippled , the lame , and the blind .
42014014	Then you will be blessed , because they have nothing and cannot pay you back . But you will be repaid when the good people rise from the dead . ”
42014015	One of those at the table with Jesus heard these things and said to him , “ Blessed are the people who will share in the meal in God’s kingdom . ”
42014016	Jesus said to him , “ A man gave a big banquet and invited many people .
42014017	When it was time to eat , the man sent his servant to tell the guests , ‘ Come . Everything is ready . ’
42014018	“ But all the guests made excuses . The first one said , ‘ I have just bought a field , and I must go look at it . Please excuse me . ’
42014019	Another said , ‘ I have just bought five pairs of oxen ; I must go and try them . Please excuse me . ’
42014020	A third person said , ‘ I just got married ; I can’t come . ’
42014021	So the servant returned and told his master what had happened . Then the master became angry and said , ‘ Go at once into the streets and alleys of the town , and bring in the poor , the crippled , the blind , and the lame . ’
42014022	Later the servant said to him , ‘ Master , I did what you commanded , but we still have room . ’
42014023	The master said to the servant , ‘ Go out to the roads and country lanes , and urge the people there to come so my house will be full .
42014024	I tell you , none of those whom I invited first will eat with me . ’ ”
42014025	Large crowds were traveling with Jesus , and he turned and said to them ,
42014026	“ If anyone comes to me but loves his father , mother , wife , children , brothers , or sisters — or even life — more than me , he cannot be my follower .
42014027	Whoever is not willing to carry his cross and follow me cannot be my follower .
42014028	If you want to build a tower , you first sit down and decide how much it will cost , to see if you have enough money to finish the job .
42014029	If you don’t , you might lay the foundation , but you would not be able to finish . Then all who would see it would make fun of you ,
42014030	saying , ‘ This person began to build but was not able to finish . ’
42014031	“ If a king is going to fight another king , first he will sit down and plan . He will decide if he and his ten thousand soldiers can defeat the other king who has twenty thousand soldiers .
42014032	If he can’t , then while the other king is still far away , he will send some people to speak to him and ask for peace .
42014033	In the same way , you must give up everything you have to be my follower .
42014034	“ Salt is good , but if it loses its salty taste , you cannot make it salty again .
42014035	It is no good for the soil or for manure ; it is thrown away . “ Let those with ears use them and listen . ”
42015001	The tax collectors and sinners all came to listen to Jesus .
42015002	But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law began to complain : “ Look , this man welcomes sinners and even eats with them . ”
42015003	Then Jesus told them this story :
42015004	“ Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep but loses one of them . Then he will leave the other ninety-nine sheep in the open field and go out and look for the lost sheep until he finds it .
42015005	And when he finds it , he happily puts it on his shoulders
42015006	and goes home . He calls to his friends and neighbors and says , ‘ Be happy with me because I found my lost sheep . ’
42015007	In the same way , I tell you there is more joy in heaven over one sinner who changes his heart and life , than over ninety-nine good people who don’t need to change .
42015008	“ Suppose a woman has ten silver coins , but loses one . She will light a lamp , sweep the house , and look carefully for the coin until she finds it .
42015009	And when she finds it , she will call her friends and neighbors and say , ‘ Be happy with me because I have found the coin that I lost . ’
42015010	In the same way , there is joy in the presence of the angels of God when one sinner changes his heart and life . ”
42015011	Then Jesus said , “ A man had two sons .
42015012	The younger son said to his father , ‘ Give me my share of the property . ’ So the father divided the property between his two sons .
42015013	Then the younger son gathered up all that was his and traveled far away to another country . There he wasted his money in foolish living .
42015014	After he had spent everything , a time came when there was no food anywhere in the country , and the son was poor and hungry .
42015015	So he got a job with one of the citizens there who sent the son into the fields to feed pigs .
42015016	The son was so hungry that he wanted to eat the pods the pigs were eating , but no one gave him anything .
42015017	When he realized what he was doing , he thought , ‘ All of my father’s servants have plenty of food . But I am here , almost dying with hunger .
42015018	I will leave and return to my father and say to him , “ Father , I have sinned against God and against you .
42015019	I am no longer worthy to be called your son , but let me be like one of your servants . ” ’
42015020	So the son left and went to his father . “ While the son was still a long way off , his father saw him and felt sorry for his son . So the father ran to him and hugged and kissed him .
42015021	The son said , ‘ Father , I have sinned against God and against you . I am no longer worthy to be called your son . ’
42015022	But the father said to his servants , ‘ Hurry ! Bring the best clothes and put them on him . Also , put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet .
42015023	And get our fat calf and kill it so we can have a feast and celebrate .
42015024	My son was dead , but now he is alive again ! He was lost , but now he is found ! ’ So they began to celebrate .
42015025	“ The older son was in the field , and as he came closer to the house , he heard the sound of music and dancing .
42015026	So he called to one of the servants and asked what all this meant .
42015027	The servant said , ‘ Your brother has come back , and your father killed the fat calf , because your brother came home safely . ’
42015028	The older son was angry and would not go in to the feast . So his father went out and begged him to come in .
42015029	But the older son said to his father , ‘ I have served you like a slave for many years and have always obeyed your commands . But you never gave me even a young goat to have at a feast with my friends .
42015030	But your other son , who wasted all your money on prostitutes , comes home , and you kill the fat calf for him ! ’
42015031	The father said to him , ‘ Son , you are always with me , and all that I have is yours .
42015032	We had to celebrate and be happy because your brother was dead , but now he is alive . He was lost , but now he is found . ’ ”
42016001	Jesus also said to his followers , “ Once there was a rich man who had a manager to take care of his business . This manager was accused of cheating him .
42016002	So he called the manager in and said to him , ‘ What is this I hear about you ? Give me a report of what you have done with my money , because you can’t be my manager any longer . ’
42016003	The manager thought to himself , ‘ What will I do since my master is taking my job away from me ? I am not strong enough to dig ditches , and I am ashamed to beg .
42016004	I know what I’ll do so that when I lose my job people will welcome me into their homes . ’
42016005	“ So the manager called in everyone who owed the master any money . He asked the first one , ‘ How much do you owe ? ’
42016006	He answered , ‘ Eight hundred gallons of olive oil . ’ The manager said to him , ‘ Take your bill , sit down quickly , and write four hundred gallons . ’
42016007	Then the manager asked another one , ‘ How much do you owe ? ’ He answered , ‘ One thousand bushels of wheat . ’ Then the manager said to him , ‘ Take your bill and write eight hundred bushels . ’
42016008	So , the master praised the dishonest manager for being clever . Yes , worldly people are more clever with their own kind than spiritual people are .
42016009	“ I tell you , make friends for yourselves using worldly riches so that when those riches are gone , you will be welcomed in those homes that continue forever .
42016010	Whoever can be trusted with a little can also be trusted with a lot , and whoever is dishonest with a little is dishonest with a lot .
42016011	If you cannot be trusted with worldly riches , then who will trust you with true riches ?
42016012	And if you cannot be trusted with things that belong to someone else , who will give you things of your own ?
42016013	“ No servant can serve two masters . The servant will hate one master and love the other , or will follow one master and refuse to follow the other . You cannot serve both God and worldly riches . ”
42016014	The Pharisees , who loved money , were listening to all these things and made fun of Jesus .
42016015	He said to them , “ You make yourselves look good in front of people , but God knows what is really in your hearts . What is important to people is hateful in God’s sight .
42016016	“ The law of Moses and the writings of the prophets were preached until John came . Since then the Good News about the kingdom of God is being told , and everyone tries to enter it by force .
42016017	It would be easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for the smallest part of a letter in the law to be changed .
42016018	“ If a man divorces his wife and marries another woman , he is guilty of adultery , and the man who marries a divorced woman is also guilty of adultery . ”
42016019	Jesus said , “ There was a rich man who always dressed in the finest clothes and lived in luxury every day .
42016020	And a very poor man named Lazarus , whose body was covered with sores , was laid at the rich man’s gate .
42016021	He wanted to eat only the small pieces of food that fell from the rich man’s table . And the dogs would come and lick his sores .
42016022	Later , Lazarus died , and the angels carried him to the arms of Abraham . The rich man died , too , and was buried .
42016023	In the place of the dead , he was in much pain . The rich man saw Abraham far away with Lazarus at his side .
42016024	He called , ‘ Father Abraham , have mercy on me ! Send Lazarus to dip his finger in water and cool my tongue , because I am suffering in this fire ! ’
42016025	But Abraham said , ‘ Child , remember when you were alive you had the good things in life , but bad things happened to Lazarus . Now he is comforted here , and you are suffering .
42016026	Besides , there is a big pit between you and us , so no one can cross over to you , and no one can leave there and come here . ’
42016027	The rich man said , ‘ Father , then please send Lazarus to my father’s house .
42016028	I have five brothers , and Lazarus could warn them so that they will not come to this place of pain . ’
42016029	But Abraham said , ‘ They have the law of Moses and the writings of the prophets ; let them learn from them . ’
42016030	The rich man said , ‘ No , father Abraham ! If someone goes to them from the dead , they would believe and change their hearts and lives . ’
42016031	But Abraham said to him , ‘ If they will not listen to Moses and the prophets , they will not listen to someone who comes back from the dead . ’ ”
42017001	Jesus said to his followers , “ Things that cause people to sin will happen , but how terrible for the person who causes them to happen !
42017002	It would be better for you to be thrown into the sea with a large stone around your neck than to cause one of these little ones to sin .
42017003	So be careful ! “ If another follower sins , warn him , and if he is sorry and stops sinning , forgive him .
42017004	If he sins against you seven times in one day and says that he is sorry each time , forgive him . ”
42017005	The apostles said to the Lord , “ Give us more faith ! ”
42017006	The Lord said , “ If your faith were the size of a mustard seed , you could say to this mulberry tree , ‘ Dig yourself up and plant yourself in the sea , ’ and it would obey you .
42017007	“ Suppose one of you has a servant who has been plowing the ground or caring for the sheep . When the servant comes in from working in the field , would you say , ‘ Come in and sit down to eat ’ ?
42017008	No , you would say to him , ‘ Prepare something for me to eat . Then get yourself ready and serve me . After I finish eating and drinking , you can eat . ’
42017009	The servant does not get any special thanks for doing what his master commanded .
42017010	It is the same with you . When you have done everything you are told to do , you should say , ‘ We are unworthy servants ; we have only done the work we should do . ’ ”
42017011	While Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem , he was going through the area between Samaria and Galilee .
42017012	As he came into a small town , ten men who had a skin disease met him there . They did not come close to Jesus
42017013	but called to him , “ Jesus ! Master ! Have mercy on us ! ”
42017014	When Jesus saw the men , he said , “ Go and show yourselves to the priests . ” As the ten men were going , they were healed .
42017015	When one of them saw that he was healed , he went back to Jesus , praising God in a loud voice .
42017016	Then he bowed down at Jesus’ feet and thanked him . ( And this man was a Samaritan . )
42017017	Jesus said , “ Weren’t ten men healed ? Where are the other nine ?
42017018	Is this Samaritan the only one who came back to thank God ? ”
42017019	Then Jesus said to him , “ Stand up and go on your way . You were healed because you believed . ”
42017020	Some of the Pharisees asked Jesus , “ When will the kingdom of God come ? ” Jesus answered , “ God’s kingdom is coming , but not in a way that you will be able to see with your eyes .
42017021	People will not say , ‘ Look , here it is ! ’ or , ‘ There it is ! ’ because God’s kingdom is within you . ”
42017022	Then Jesus said to his followers , “ The time will come when you will want very much to see one of the days of the Son of Man . But you will not see it .
42017023	People will say to you , ‘ Look , there he is ! ’ or , ‘ Look , here he is ! ’ Stay where you are ; don’t go away and search .
42017024	“ When the Son of Man comes again , he will shine like lightning , which flashes across the sky and lights it up from one side to the other .
42017025	But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by the people of this time .
42017026	When the Son of Man comes again , it will be as it was when Noah lived .
42017027	People were eating , drinking , marrying , and giving their children to be married until the day Noah entered the boat . Then the flood came and killed them all .
42017028	It will be the same as during the time of Lot . People were eating , drinking , buying , selling , planting , and building .
42017029	But the day Lot left Sodom , fire and sulfur rained down from the sky and killed them all .
42017030	This is how it will be when the Son of Man comes again .
42017031	“ On that day , a person who is on the roof and whose belongings are in the house should not go inside to get them . A person who is in the field should not go back home .
42017032	Remember Lot’s wife .
42017033	Those who try to keep their lives will lose them . But those who give up their lives will save them .
42017034	I tell you , on that night two people will be sleeping in one bed ; one will be taken and the other will be left .
42017035	There will be two women grinding grain together ; one will be taken , and the other will be left . [
42017036	Two people will be in the field . One will be taken , and the other will be left . ] ”
42017037	The followers asked Jesus , “ Where will this be , Lord ? ” Jesus answered , “ Where there is a dead body , there the vultures will gather . ”
42018001	Then Jesus used this story to teach his followers that they should always pray and never lose hope .
42018002	“ In a certain town there was a judge who did not respect God or care about people .
42018003	In that same town there was a widow who kept coming to this judge , saying , ‘ Give me my rights against my enemy . ’
42018004	For a while the judge refused to help her . But afterwards , he thought to himself , ‘ Even though I don’t respect God or care about people ,
42018005	I will see that she gets her rights . Otherwise she will continue to bother me until I am worn out . ’ ”
42018006	The Lord said , “ Listen to what the unfair judge said .
42018007	God will always give what is right to his people who cry to him night and day , and he will not be slow to answer them .
42018008	I tell you , God will help his people quickly . But when the Son of Man comes again , will he find those on earth who believe in him ? ”
42018009	Jesus told this story to some people who thought they were very good and looked down on everyone else :
42018010	“ A Pharisee and a tax collector both went to the Temple to pray .
42018011	The Pharisee stood alone and prayed , ‘ God , I thank you that I am not like other people who steal , cheat , or take part in adultery , or even like this tax collector .
42018012	I fast twice a week , and I give one-tenth of everything I get ! ’
42018013	“ The tax collector , standing at a distance , would not even look up to heaven . But he beat on his chest because he was so sad . He said , ‘ God , have mercy on me , a sinner . ’
42018014	I tell you , when this man went home , he was right with God , but the Pharisee was not . All who make themselves great will be made humble , but all who make themselves humble will be made great . ”
42018015	Some people brought even their babies to Jesus so he could touch them . When the followers saw this , they told them to stop .
42018016	But Jesus called for the children , saying , “ Let the little children come to me . Don’t stop them , because the kingdom of God belongs to people who are like these children .
42018017	I tell you the truth , you must accept the kingdom of God as if you were a child , or you will never enter it . ”
42018018	A certain leader asked Jesus , “ Good Teacher , what must I do to have life forever ? ”
42018019	Jesus said to him , “ Why do you call me good ? Only God is good .
42018020	You know the commands : ‘ You must not be guilty of adultery . You must not murder anyone . You must not steal . You must not tell lies about your neighbor . Honor your father and mother . ’ ”
42018021	But the leader said , “ I have obeyed all these commands since I was a boy . ”
42018022	When Jesus heard this , he said to him , “ There is still one more thing you need to do . Sell everything you have and give it to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven . Then come and follow me . ”
42018023	But when the man heard this , he became very sad , because he was very rich .
42018024	Jesus looked at him and said , “ It is very hard for rich people to enter the kingdom of God .
42018025	It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God . ”
42018026	When the people heard this , they asked , “ Then who can be saved ? ”
42018027	Jesus answered , “ The things impossible for people are possible for God . ”
42018028	Peter said , “ Look , we have left everything and followed you . ”
42018029	Jesus said , “ I tell you the truth , all those who have left houses , wives , brothers , parents , or children for the kingdom of God
42018030	will get much more in this life . And in the age that is coming , they will have life forever . ”
42018031	Then Jesus took the twelve apostles aside and said to them , “ We are going to Jerusalem . Everything the prophets wrote about the Son of Man will happen .
42018032	He will be turned over to those who are evil . They will laugh at him , insult him , spit on him ,
42018033	beat him with whips , and kill him . But on the third day , he will rise to life again . ”
42018034	The apostles did not understand this ; the meaning was hidden from them , and they did not realize what was said .
42018035	As Jesus came near the city of Jericho , a blind man was sitting beside the road , begging .
42018036	When he heard the people coming down the road , he asked , “ What is happening ? ”
42018037	They told him , “ Jesus , from Nazareth , is going by . ”
42018038	The blind man cried out , “ Jesus , Son of David , have mercy on me ! ”
42018039	The people leading the group warned the blind man to be quiet . But the blind man shouted even more , “ Son of David , have mercy on me ! ”
42018040	Jesus stopped and ordered the blind man to be brought to him . When he came near , Jesus asked him ,
42018041	“ What do you want me to do for you ? ” He said , “ Lord , I want to see . ”
42018042	Jesus said to him , “ Then see . You are healed because you believed . ”
42018043	At once the man was able to see , and he followed Jesus , thanking God . All the people who saw this praised God .
42019001	Jesus was going through the city of Jericho .
42019002	A man was there named Zacchaeus , who was a very important tax collector , and he was wealthy .
42019003	He wanted to see who Jesus was , but he was not able because he was too short to see above the crowd .
42019004	He ran ahead to a place where Jesus would come , and he climbed a sycamore tree so he could see him .
42019005	When Jesus came to that place , he looked up and said to him , “ Zacchaeus , hurry and come down ! I must stay at your house today . ”
42019006	Zacchaeus came down quickly and welcomed him gladly .
42019007	All the people saw this and began to complain , “ Jesus is staying with a sinner ! ”
42019008	But Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord , “ I will give half of my possessions to the poor . And if I have cheated anyone , I will pay back four times more . ”
42019009	Jesus said to him , “ Salvation has come to this house today , because this man also belongs to the family of Abraham .
42019010	The Son of Man came to find lost people and save them . ”
42019011	As the people were listening to this , Jesus told them a story because he was near Jerusalem and they thought God’s kingdom would appear immediately .
42019012	He said : “ A very important man went to a country far away to be made a king and then to return home .
42019013	So he called ten of his servants and gave a coin to each servant . He said , ‘ Do business with this money until I get back . ’
42019014	But the people in the kingdom hated the man . So they sent a group to follow him and say , ‘ We don’t want this man to be our king . ’
42019015	“ But the man became king . When he returned home , he said , ‘ Call those servants who have my money so I can know how much they earned with it . ’
42019016	“ The first servant came and said , ‘ Sir , I earned ten coins with the one you gave me . ’
42019017	The king said to the servant , ‘ Excellent ! You are a good servant . Since I can trust you with small things , I will let you rule over ten of my cities . ’
42019018	“ The second servant said , ‘ Sir , I earned five coins with your one . ’
42019019	The king said to this servant , ‘ You can rule over five cities . ’
42019020	“ Then another servant came in and said to the king , ‘ Sir , here is your coin which I wrapped in a piece of cloth and hid .
42019021	I was afraid of you , because you are a hard man . You even take money that you didn’t earn and gather food that you didn’t plant . ’
42019022	Then the king said to the servant , ‘ I will condemn you by your own words , you evil servant . You knew that I am a hard man , taking money that I didn’t earn and gathering food that I didn’t plant .
42019023	Why then didn’t you put my money in the bank ? Then when I came back , my money would have earned some interest . ’
42019024	“ The king said to the men who were standing by , ‘ Take the coin away from this servant and give it to the servant who earned ten coins . ’
42019025	They said , ‘ But sir , that servant already has ten coins . ’
42019026	The king said , ‘ Those who have will be given more , but those who do not have anything will have everything taken away from them .
42019027	Now where are my enemies who didn’t want me to be king ? Bring them here and kill them before me . ’ ”
42019028	After Jesus said this , he went on toward Jerusalem .
42019029	As Jesus came near Bethphage and Bethany , towns near the hill called the Mount of Olives , he sent out two of his followers .
42019030	He said , “ Go to the town you can see there . When you enter it , you will find a colt tied there , which no one has ever ridden . Untie it and bring it here to me .
42019031	If anyone asks you why you are untying it , say that the Master needs it . ”
42019032	The two followers went into town and found the colt just as Jesus had told them .
42019033	As they were untying it , its owners came out and asked the followers , “ Why are you untying our colt ? ”
42019034	The followers answered , “ The Master needs it . ”
42019035	So they brought it to Jesus , threw their coats on the colt’s back , and put Jesus on it .
42019036	As Jesus rode toward Jerusalem , others spread their coats on the road before him .
42019037	As he was coming close to Jerusalem , on the way down the Mount of Olives , the whole crowd of followers began joyfully shouting praise to God for all the miracles they had seen .
42019038	They said , “ God bless the king who comes in the name of the Lord ! There is peace in heaven and glory to God ! ”
42019039	Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus , “ Teacher , tell your followers not to say these things . ”
42019040	But Jesus answered , “ I tell you , if my followers didn’t say these things , then the stones would cry out . ”
42019041	As Jesus came near Jerusalem , he saw the city and cried for it ,
42019042	saying , “ I wish you knew today what would bring you peace . But now it is hidden from you .
42019043	The time is coming when your enemies will build a wall around you and will hold you in on all sides .
42019044	They will destroy you and all your people , and not one stone will be left on another . All this will happen because you did not recognize the time when God came to save you . ”
42019045	Jesus went into the Temple and began to throw out the people who were selling things there .
42019046	He said , “ It is written in the Scriptures , ‘ My Temple will be a house for prayer . ’ But you have changed it into a ‘ hideout for robbers’ ! ”
42019047	Jesus taught in the Temple every day . The leading priests , the experts on the law , and some of the leaders of the people wanted to kill Jesus .
42019048	But they did not know how they could do it , because all the people were listening closely to him .
42020001	One day Jesus was in the Temple , teaching the people and telling them the Good News . The leading priests , teachers of the law , and elders came up to talk with him ,
42020002	saying , “ Tell us what authority you have to do these things ? Who gave you this authority ? ”
42020003	Jesus answered , “ I will also ask you a question . Tell me :
42020004	When John baptized people , was that authority from God or just from other people ? ”
42020005	They argued about this , saying , “ If we answer , ‘ John’s baptism was from God , ’ Jesus will say , ‘ Then why did you not believe him ? ’
42020006	But if we say , ‘ It was from other people , ’ all the people will stone us to death , because they believe John was a prophet . ”
42020007	So they answered that they didn’t know where it came from .
42020008	Jesus said to them , “ Then I won’t tell you what authority I have to do these things . ”
42020009	Then Jesus told the people this story : “ A man planted a vineyard and leased it to some farmers . Then he went away for a long time .
42020010	When it was time for the grapes to be picked , he sent a servant to the farmers to get some of the grapes . But they beat the servant and sent him away empty-handed .
42020011	Then he sent another servant . They beat this servant also , and showed no respect for him , and sent him away empty-handed .
42020012	So the man sent a third servant . The farmers wounded him and threw him out .
42020013	The owner of the vineyard said , ‘ What will I do now ? I will send my son whom I love . Maybe they will respect him . ’
42020014	But when the farmers saw the son , they said to each other , ‘ This son will inherit the vineyard . If we kill him , it will be ours . ’
42020015	So the farmers threw the son out of the vineyard and killed him . “ What will the owner of this vineyard do to them ?
42020016	He will come and kill those farmers and will give the vineyard to other farmers . ” When the people heard this story , they said , “ Let this never happen ! ”
42020017	But Jesus looked at them and said , “ Then what does this verse mean : ‘ The stone that the builders rejected became the cornerstone ’ ?
42020018	Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken , and the person on whom it falls , that person will be crushed ! ”
42020019	The teachers of the law and the leading priests wanted to arrest Jesus at once , because they knew the story was about them . But they were afraid of what the people would do .
42020020	So they watched Jesus and sent some spies who acted as if they were sincere . They wanted to trap Jesus in saying something wrong so they could hand him over to the authority and power of the governor .
42020021	So the spies asked Jesus , “ Teacher , we know that what you say and teach is true . You pay no attention to who people are , and you always teach the truth about God’s way .
42020022	Tell us , is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not ? ”
42020023	But Jesus , knowing they were trying to trick him , said ,
42020024	“ Show me a coin . Whose image and name are on it ? ” They said , “ Caesar’s . ”
42020025	Jesus said to them , “ Then give to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s , and give to God the things that are God’s . ”
42020026	So they were not able to trap Jesus in anything he said in the presence of the people . And being amazed at his answer , they became silent .
42020027	Some Sadducees , who believed people would not rise from the dead , came to Jesus .
42020028	They asked , “ Teacher , Moses wrote that if a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife but no children , then that man must marry the widow and have children for his brother .
42020029	Once there were seven brothers . The first brother married and died , but had no children .
42020030	Then the second brother married the widow , and he died .
42020031	And the third brother married the widow , and he died . The same thing happened with all seven brothers ; they died and had no children .
42020032	Finally , the woman died also .
42020033	Since all seven brothers had married her , whose wife will she be when people rise from the dead ? ”
42020034	Jesus said to them , “ On earth , people marry and are given to someone to marry .
42020035	But those who will be worthy to be raised from the dead and live again will not marry , nor will they be given to someone to marry .
42020036	In that life they are like angels and cannot die . They are children of God , because they have been raised from the dead .
42020037	Even Moses clearly showed that the dead are raised to life . When he wrote about the burning bush , he said that the Lord is ‘ the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . ’
42020038	God is the God of the living , not the dead , because all people are alive to him . ”
42020039	Some of the teachers of the law said , “ Teacher , your answer was good . ”
42020040	No one was brave enough to ask him another question .
42020041	Then Jesus said , “ Why do people say that the Christ is the Son of David ?
42020042	In the book of Psalms , David himself says : ‘ The Lord said to my Lord , “ Sit by me at my right side ,
42020043	until I put your enemies under your control . ” ’
42020044	David calls the Christ ‘ Lord , ’ so how can the Christ be his son ? ”
42020045	While all the people were listening , Jesus said to his followers ,
42020046	“ Beware of the teachers of the law . They like to walk around wearing fancy clothes , and they love for people to greet them with respect in the marketplaces . They love to have the most important seats in the synagogues and at feasts .
42020047	But they cheat widows and steal their houses and then try to make themselves look good by saying long prayers . They will receive a greater punishment . ”
42021001	As Jesus looked up , he saw some rich people putting their gifts into the Temple money box .
42021002	Then he saw a poor widow putting two small copper coins into the box .
42021003	He said , “ I tell you the truth , this poor widow gave more than all those rich people .
42021004	They gave only what they did not need . This woman is very poor , but she gave all she had to live on . ”
42021005	Some people were talking about the Temple and how it was decorated with beautiful stones and gifts offered to God . But Jesus said ,
42021006	“ As for these things you are looking at , the time will come when not one stone will be left on another . Every stone will be thrown down . ”
42021007	They asked Jesus , “ Teacher , when will these things happen ? What will be the sign that they are about to take place ? ”
42021008	Jesus said , “ Be careful so you are not fooled . Many people will come in my name , saying , ‘ I am the One ’ and , ‘ The time has come ! ’ But don’t follow them .
42021009	When you hear about wars and riots , don’t be afraid , because these things must happen first , but the end will come later . ”
42021010	Then he said to them , “ Nations will fight against other nations , and kingdoms against other kingdoms .
42021011	In various places there will be great earthquakes , sicknesses , and a lack of food . Fearful events and great signs will come from heaven .
42021012	“ But before all these things happen , people will arrest you and treat you cruelly . They will judge you in their synagogues and put you in jail and force you to stand before kings and governors , because you follow me .
42021013	But this will give you an opportunity to tell about me .
42021014	Make up your minds not to worry ahead of time about what you will say .
42021015	I will give you the wisdom to say things that none of your enemies will be able to stand against or prove wrong .
42021016	Even your parents , brothers , relatives , and friends will turn against you , and they will kill some of you .
42021017	All people will hate you because you follow me .
42021018	But none of these things can really harm you .
42021019	By continuing to have faith you will save your lives .
42021020	“ When you see armies all around Jerusalem , you will know it will soon be destroyed .
42021021	At that time , the people in Judea should run away to the mountains . The people in Jerusalem must get out , and those who are near the city should not go in .
42021022	These are the days of punishment to bring about all that is written in the Scriptures .
42021023	How terrible it will be for women who are pregnant or have nursing babies ! Great trouble will come upon this land , and God will be angry with these people .
42021024	They will be killed by the sword and taken as prisoners to all nations . Jerusalem will be crushed by non-Jewish people until their time is over .
42021025	“ There will be signs in the sun , moon , and stars . On earth , nations will be afraid and confused because of the roar and fury of the sea .
42021026	People will be so afraid they will faint , wondering what is happening to the world , because the powers of the heavens will be shaken .
42021027	Then people will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory .
42021028	When these things begin to happen , look up and hold your heads high , because the time when God will free you is near ! ”
42021029	Then Jesus told this story : “ Look at the fig tree and all the other trees .
42021030	When their leaves appear , you know that summer is near .
42021031	In the same way , when you see these things happening , you will know that God’s kingdom is near .
42021032	“ I tell you the truth , all these things will happen while the people of this time are still living .
42021033	Earth and sky will be destroyed , but the words I have spoken will never be destroyed .
42021034	“ Be careful not to spend your time feasting , drinking , or worrying about worldly things . If you do , that day might come on you suddenly ,
42021035	like a trap on all people on earth .
42021036	So be ready all the time . Pray that you will be strong enough to escape all these things that will happen and that you will be able to stand before the Son of Man . ”
42021037	During the day , Jesus taught the people in the Temple , and at night he went out of the city and stayed on the Mount of Olives .
42021038	Every morning all the people got up early to go to the Temple to listen to him .
42022001	It was almost time for the Feast of Unleavened Bread , called the Passover Feast .
42022002	The leading priests and teachers of the law were trying to find a way to kill Jesus , because they were afraid of the people .
42022003	Satan entered Judas Iscariot , one of Jesus’ twelve apostles .
42022004	Judas went to the leading priests and some of the soldiers who guarded the Temple and talked to them about a way to hand Jesus over to them .
42022005	They were pleased and agreed to give Judas money .
42022006	He agreed and watched for the best time to hand Jesus over to them when he was away from the crowd .
42022007	The Day of Unleavened Bread came when the Passover lambs had to be sacrificed .
42022008	Jesus said to Peter and John , “ Go and prepare the Passover meal for us to eat . ”
42022009	They asked , “ Where do you want us to prepare it ? ”
42022010	Jesus said to them , “ After you go into the city , a man carrying a jar of water will meet you . Follow him into the house that he enters ,
42022011	and tell the owner of the house , ‘ The Teacher says : “ Where is the guest room in which I may eat the Passover meal with my followers ? ” ’
42022012	Then he will show you a large , furnished room upstairs . Prepare the Passover meal there . ”
42022013	So Peter and John left and found everything as Jesus had said . And they prepared the Passover meal .
42022014	When the time came , Jesus and the apostles were sitting at the table .
42022015	He said to them , “ I wanted very much to eat this Passover meal with you before I suffer .
42022016	I will not eat another Passover meal until it is given its true meaning in the kingdom of God . ”
42022017	Then Jesus took a cup , gave thanks , and said , “ Take this cup and share it among yourselves .
42022018	I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until God’s kingdom comes . ”
42022019	Then Jesus took some bread , gave thanks , broke it , and gave it to the apostles , saying , “ This is my body , which I am giving for you . Do this to remember me . ”
42022020	In the same way , after supper , Jesus took the cup and said , “ This cup is the new agreement that God makes with his people . This new agreement begins with my blood which is poured out for you .
42022021	“ But one of you will turn against me , and his hand is with mine on the table .
42022022	What God has planned for the Son of Man will happen , but how terrible it will be for that one who turns against the Son of Man . ”
42022023	Then the apostles asked each other which one of them would do that .
42022024	The apostles also began to argue about which one of them was the most important .
42022025	But Jesus said to them , “ The kings of the non-Jewish people rule over them , and those who have authority over others like to be called ‘ friends of the people . ’
42022026	But you must not be like that . Instead , the greatest among you should be like the youngest , and the leader should be like the servant .
42022027	Who is more important : the one sitting at the table or the one serving ? You think the one at the table is more important , but I am like a servant among you .
42022028	“ You have stayed with me through my struggles .
42022029	Just as my Father has given me a kingdom , I also give you a kingdom
42022030	so you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom . And you will sit on thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
42022031	“ Simon , Simon , Satan has asked to test all of you as a farmer sifts his wheat .
42022032	I have prayed that you will not lose your faith ! Help your brothers be stronger when you come back to me . ”
42022033	But Peter said to Jesus , “ Lord , I am ready to go with you to prison and even to die with you ! ”
42022034	But Jesus said , “ Peter , before the rooster crows this day , you will say three times that you don’t know me . ”
42022035	Then Jesus said to the apostles , “ When I sent you out without a purse , a bag , or sandals , did you need anything ? ” They said , “ No . ”
42022036	He said to them , “ But now if you have a purse or a bag , carry that with you . If you don’t have a sword , sell your coat and buy one .
42022037	The Scripture says , ‘ He was treated like a criminal , ’ and I tell you this scripture must have its full meaning . It was written about me , and it is happening now . ”
42022038	His followers said , “ Look , Lord , here are two swords . ” He said to them , “ That is enough . ”
42022039	Jesus left the city and went to the Mount of Olives , as he often did , and his followers went with him .
42022040	When he reached the place , he said to them , “ Pray for strength against temptation . ”
42022041	Then Jesus went about a stone’s throw away from them . He kneeled down and prayed ,
42022042	“ Father , if you are willing , take away this cup of suffering . But do what you want , not what I want . ”
42022043	Then an angel from heaven appeared to him to strengthen him .
42022044	Being full of pain , Jesus prayed even harder . His sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground .
42022045	When he finished praying , he went to his followers and found them asleep because of their sadness .
42022046	Jesus said to them , “ Why are you sleeping ? Get up and pray for strength against temptation . ”
42022047	While Jesus was speaking , a crowd came up , and Judas , one of the twelve apostles , was leading them . He came close to Jesus so he could kiss him .
42022048	But Jesus said to him , “ Judas , are you using the kiss to give the Son of Man to his enemies ? ”
42022049	When those who were standing around him saw what was happening , they said , “ Lord , should we strike them with our swords ? ”
42022050	And one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear .
42022051	Jesus said , “ Stop ! No more of this . ” Then he touched the servant’s ear and healed him .
42022052	Those who came to arrest Jesus were the leading priests , the soldiers who guarded the Temple , and the elders . Jesus said to them , “ You came out here with swords and clubs as though I were a criminal .
42022053	I was with you every day in the Temple , and you didn’t arrest me there . But this is your time — the time when darkness rules . ”
42022054	They arrested Jesus , and led him away , and brought him into the house of the high priest . Peter followed far behind them .
42022055	After the soldiers started a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat together , Peter sat with them .
42022056	A servant girl saw Peter sitting there in the firelight , and looking closely at him , she said , “ This man was also with him . ”
42022057	But Peter said this was not true ; he said , “ Woman , I don’t know him . ”
42022058	A short time later , another person saw Peter and said , “ You are also one of them . ” But Peter said , “ Man , I am not ! ”
42022059	About an hour later , another man insisted , “ Certainly this man was with him , because he is from Galilee , too . ”
42022060	But Peter said , “ Man , I don’t know what you are talking about ! ” At once , while Peter was still speaking , a rooster crowed .
42022061	Then the Lord turned and looked straight at Peter . And Peter remembered what the Lord had said : “ Before the rooster crows this day , you will say three times that you don’t know me . ”
42022062	Then Peter went outside and cried painfully .
42022063	The men who were guarding Jesus began making fun of him and beating him .
42022064	They blindfolded him and said , “ Prove that you are a prophet , and tell us who hit you . ”
42022065	They said many cruel things to Jesus .
42022066	When day came , the council of the elders of the people , both the leading priests and the teachers of the law , came together and led Jesus to their highest court .
42022067	They said , “ If you are the Christ , tell us . ” Jesus said to them , “ If I tell you , you will not believe me .
42022068	And if I ask you , you will not answer .
42022069	But from now on , the Son of Man will sit at the right hand of the powerful God . ”
42022070	They all said , “ Then are you the Son of God ? ” Jesus said to them , “ You say that I am . ”
42022071	They said , “ Why do we need witnesses now ? We ourselves heard him say this . ”
42023001	Then the whole group stood up and led Jesus to Pilate .
42023002	They began to accuse Jesus , saying , “ We caught this man telling things that mislead our people . He says that we should not pay taxes to Caesar , and he calls himself the Christ , a king . ”
42023003	Pilate asked Jesus , “ Are you the king of the Jews ? ” Jesus answered , “ Those are your words . ”
42023004	Pilate said to the leading priests and the people , “ I find nothing against this man . ”
42023005	They were insisting , saying , “ But Jesus makes trouble with the people , teaching all around Judea . He began in Galilee , and now he is here . ”
42023006	Pilate heard this and asked if Jesus was from Galilee .
42023007	Since Jesus was under Herod’s authority , Pilate sent Jesus to Herod , who was in Jerusalem at that time .
42023008	When Herod saw Jesus , he was very glad , because he had heard about Jesus and had wanted to meet him for a long time . He was hoping to see Jesus work a miracle .
42023009	Herod asked Jesus many questions , but Jesus said nothing .
42023010	The leading priests and teachers of the law were standing there , strongly accusing Jesus .
42023011	After Herod and his soldiers had made fun of Jesus , they dressed him in a kingly robe and sent him back to Pilate .
42023012	In the past , Pilate and Herod had always been enemies , but on that day they became friends .
42023013	Pilate called the people together with the leading priests and the rulers .
42023014	He said to them , “ You brought this man to me , saying he makes trouble among the people . But I have questioned him before you all , and I have not found him guilty of what you say .
42023015	Also , Herod found nothing wrong with him ; he sent him back to us . Look , he has done nothing for which he should die .
42023016	So , after I punish him , I will let him go free . ” [
42023017	Every year at the Passover Feast , Pilate had to release one prisoner to the people . ]
42023018	But the people shouted together , “ Take this man away ! Let Barabbas go free ! ”
42023019	( Barabbas was a man who was in prison for his part in a riot in the city and for murder . )
42023020	Pilate wanted to let Jesus go free and told this to the crowd .
42023021	But they shouted again , “ Crucify him ! Crucify him ! ”
42023022	A third time Pilate said to them , “ Why ? What wrong has he done ? I can find no reason to kill him . So I will have him punished and set him free . ”
42023023	But they continued to shout , demanding that Jesus be crucified . Their yelling became so loud that
42023024	Pilate decided to give them what they wanted .
42023025	He set free the man who was in jail for rioting and murder , and he handed Jesus over to them to do with him as they wished .
42023026	As they led Jesus away , Simon , a man from Cyrene , was coming in from the fields . They forced him to carry Jesus’ cross and to walk behind him .
42023027	A large crowd of people was following Jesus , including some women who were sad and crying for him .
42023028	But Jesus turned and said to them , “ Women of Jerusalem , don’t cry for me . Cry for yourselves and for your children .
42023029	The time is coming when people will say , ‘ Blessed are the women who cannot have children and who have no babies to nurse . ’
42023030	Then people will say to the mountains , ‘ Fall on us ! ’ And they will say to the hills , ‘ Cover us ! ’
42023031	If they act like this now when life is good , what will happen when bad times come ? ”
42023032	There were also two criminals led out with Jesus to be put to death .
42023033	When they came to a place called the Skull , the soldiers crucified Jesus and the criminals — one on his right and the other on his left .
42023034	Jesus said , “ Father , forgive them , because they don’t know what they are doing . ” The soldiers threw lots to decide who would get his clothes .
42023035	The people stood there watching . And the leaders made fun of Jesus , saying , “ He saved others . Let him save himself if he is God’s Chosen One , the Christ . ”
42023036	The soldiers also made fun of him , coming to Jesus and offering him some vinegar .
42023037	They said , “ If you are the king of the Jews , save yourself ! ”
42023038	At the top of the cross these words were written : this is the king of the jews .
42023039	One of the criminals on a cross began to shout insults at Jesus : “ Aren’t you the Christ ? Then save yourself and us . ”
42023040	But the other criminal stopped him and said , “ You should fear God ! You are getting the same punishment he is .
42023041	We are punished justly , getting what we deserve for what we did . But this man has done nothing wrong . ”
42023042	Then he said , “ Jesus , remember me when you come into your kingdom . ”
42023043	Jesus said to him , “ I tell you the truth , today you will be with me in paradise . ”
42023044	It was about noon , and the whole land became dark until three o’clock in the afternoon ,
42023045	because the sun did not shine . The curtain in the Temple was torn in two .
42023046	Jesus cried out in a loud voice , “ Father , I give you my life . ” After Jesus said this , he died .
42023047	When the army officer there saw what happened , he praised God , saying , “ Surely this was a good man ! ”
42023048	When all the people who had gathered there to watch saw what happened , they returned home , beating their chests because they were so sad .
42023049	But those who were close friends of Jesus , including the women who had followed him from Galilee , stood at a distance and watched .
42023050	There was a good and religious man named Joseph who was a member of the council .
42023051	But he had not agreed to the other leaders’ plans and actions against Jesus . He was from the town of Arimathea and was waiting for the kingdom of God to come .
42023052	Joseph went to Pilate to ask for the body of Jesus .
42023053	He took the body down from the cross , wrapped it in cloth , and put it in a tomb that was cut out of a wall of rock . This tomb had never been used before .
42023054	This was late on Preparation Day , and when the sun went down , the Sabbath day would begin .
42023055	The women who had come from Galilee with Jesus followed Joseph and saw the tomb and how Jesus’ body was laid .
42023056	Then the women left to prepare spices and perfumes . On the Sabbath day they rested , as the law of Moses commanded .
42024001	Very early on the first day of the week , at dawn , the women came to the tomb , bringing the spices they had prepared .
42024002	They found the stone rolled away from the entrance of the tomb ,
42024003	but when they went in , they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus .
42024004	While they were wondering about this , two men in shining clothes suddenly stood beside them .
42024005	The women were very afraid and bowed their heads to the ground . The men said to them , “ Why are you looking for a living person in this place for the dead ?
42024006	He is not here ; he has risen from the dead . Do you remember what he told you in Galilee ?
42024007	He said the Son of Man must be handed over to sinful people , be crucified , and rise from the dead on the third day . ”
42024008	Then the women remembered what Jesus had said .
42024009	The women left the tomb and told all these things to the eleven apostles and the other followers .
42024010	It was Mary Magdalene , Joanna , Mary the mother of James , and some other women who told the apostles everything that had happened at the tomb .
42024011	But they did not believe the women , because it sounded like nonsense .
42024012	But Peter got up and ran to the tomb . Bending down and looking in , he saw only the cloth that Jesus’ body had been wrapped in . Peter went away to his home , wondering about what had happened .
42024013	That same day two of Jesus’ followers were going to a town named Emmaus , about seven miles from Jerusalem .
42024014	They were talking about everything that had happened .
42024015	While they were talking and discussing , Jesus himself came near and began walking with them ,
42024016	but they were kept from recognizing him .
42024017	Then he said , “ What are these things you are talking about while you walk ? ” The two followers stopped , looking very sad .
42024018	The one named Cleopas answered , “ Are you the only visitor in Jerusalem who does not know what just happened there ? ”
42024019	Jesus said to them , “ What are you talking about ? ” They said , “ About Jesus of Nazareth . He was a prophet who said and did many powerful things before God and all the people .
42024020	Our leaders and the leading priests handed him over to be sentenced to death , and they crucified him .
42024021	But we were hoping that he would free Israel . Besides this , it is now the third day since this happened .
42024022	And today some women among us amazed us . Early this morning they went to the tomb ,
42024023	but they did not find his body there . They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels who said that Jesus was alive !
42024024	So some of our group went to the tomb , too . They found it just as the women said , but they did not see Jesus . ”
42024025	Then Jesus said to them , “ You are foolish and slow to believe everything the prophets said .
42024026	They said that the Christ must suffer these things before he enters his glory . ”
42024027	Then starting with what Moses and all the prophets had said about him , Jesus began to explain everything that had been written about himself in the Scriptures .
42024028	They came near the town of Emmaus , and Jesus acted as if he were going farther .
42024029	But they begged him , “ Stay with us , because it is late ; it is almost night . ” So he went in to stay with them .
42024030	When Jesus was at the table with them , he took some bread , gave thanks , divided it , and gave it to them .
42024031	And then , they were allowed to recognize Jesus . But when they saw who he was , he disappeared .
42024032	They said to each other , “ It felt like a fire burning in us when Jesus talked to us on the road and explained the Scriptures to us . ”
42024033	So the two followers got up at once and went back to Jerusalem . There they found the eleven apostles and others gathered .
42024034	They were saying , “ The Lord really has risen from the dead ! He showed himself to Simon . ”
42024035	Then the two followers told what had happened on the road and how they recognized Jesus when he divided the bread .
42024036	While the two followers were telling this , Jesus himself stood right in the middle of them and said , “ Peace be with you . ”
42024037	They were fearful and terrified and thought they were seeing a ghost .
42024038	But Jesus said , “ Why are you troubled ? Why do you doubt what you see ?
42024039	Look at my hands and my feet . It is I myself ! Touch me and see , because a ghost does not have a living body as you see I have . ”
42024040	After Jesus said this , he showed them his hands and feet .
42024041	While they still could not believe it because they were amazed and happy , Jesus said to them , “ Do you have any food here ? ”
42024042	They gave him a piece of broiled fish .
42024043	While the followers watched , Jesus took the fish and ate it .
42024044	He said to them , “ Remember when I was with you before ? I said that everything written about me must happen — everything in the law of Moses , the books of the prophets , and the Psalms . ”
42024045	Then Jesus opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures .
42024046	He said to them , “ It is written that the Christ would suffer and rise from the dead on the third day
42024047	and that a change of hearts and lives and forgiveness of sins would be preached in his name to all nations , starting at Jerusalem .
42024048	You are witnesses of these things .
42024049	I will send you what my Father has promised , but you must stay in Jerusalem until you have received that power from heaven . ”
42024050	Jesus led his followers as far as Bethany , and he raised his hands and blessed them .
42024051	While he was blessing them , he was separated from them and carried into heaven .
42024052	They worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem very happy .
42024053	They stayed in the Temple all the time , praising God .
43001001	In the beginning there was the Word . The Word was with God , and the Word was God .
43001002	He was with God in the beginning .
43001003	All things were made by him , and nothing was made without him .
43001004	In him there was life , and that life was the light of all people .
43001005	The Light shines in the darkness , and the darkness has not overpowered it .
43001006	There was a man named John who was sent by God .
43001007	He came to tell people the truth about the Light so that through him all people could hear about the Light and believe .
43001008	John was not the Light , but he came to tell people the truth about the Light .
43001009	The true Light that gives light to all was coming into the world !
43001010	The Word was in the world , and the world was made by him , but the world did not know him .
43001011	He came to the world that was his own , but his own people did not accept him .
43001012	But to all who did accept him and believe in him he gave the right to become children of God .
43001013	They did not become his children in any human way — by any human parents or human desire . They were born of God .
43001014	The Word became a human and lived among us . We saw his glory — the glory that belongs to the only Son of the Father — and he was full of grace and truth .
43001015	John tells the truth about him and cries out , saying , “ This is the One I told you about : ‘ The One who comes after me is greater than I am , because he was living before me . ’ ”
43001016	Because he was full of grace and truth , from him we all received one gift after another .
43001017	The law was given through Moses , but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ .
43001018	No one has ever seen God . But God the only Son is very close to the Father , and he has shown us what God is like .
43001019	Here is the truth John told when the leaders in Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him , “ Who are you ? ”
43001020	John spoke freely and did not refuse to answer . He said , “ I am not the Christ . ”
43001021	So they asked him , “ Then who are you ? Are you Elijah ? ” He answered , “ No , I am not . ” “ Are you the Prophet ? ” they asked . He answered , “ No . ”
43001022	Then they said , “ Who are you ? Give us an answer to tell those who sent us . What do you say about yourself ? ”
43001023	John told them in the words of the prophet Isaiah : “ I am the voice of one calling out in the desert : ‘ Make the road straight for the Lord . ’ ”
43001024	Some Pharisees who had been sent asked John :
43001025	“ If you are not the Christ or Elijah or the Prophet , why do you baptize people ? ”
43001026	John answered , “ I baptize with water , but there is one here with you that you don’t know about .
43001027	He is the One who comes after me . I am not good enough to untie the strings of his sandals . ”
43001028	This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan River , where John was baptizing people .
43001029	The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him . John said , “ Look , the Lamb of God , who takes away the sin of the world !
43001030	This is the One I was talking about when I said , ‘ A man will come after me , but he is greater than I am , because he was living before me . ’
43001031	Even I did not know who he was , although I came baptizing with water so that the people of Israel would know who he is . ”
43001034	I have seen this happen , and I tell you the truth : This man is the Son of God . ”
43001035	The next day John was there again with two of his followers .
43001036	When he saw Jesus walking by , he said , “ Look , the Lamb of God ! ”
43001037	The two followers heard John say this , so they followed Jesus .
43001038	When Jesus turned and saw them following him , he asked , “ What are you looking for ? ” They said , “ Rabbi , where are you staying ? ” ( “ Rabbi ” means “ Teacher . ” )
43001039	He answered , “ Come and see . ” So the two men went with Jesus and saw where he was staying and stayed there with him that day . It was about four o’clock in the afternoon .
43001040	One of the two men who followed Jesus after they heard John speak about him was Andrew , Simon Peter’s brother .
43001041	The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and say to him , “ We have found the Messiah . ” ( “ Messiah ” means “ Christ . ” )
43001042	Then Andrew took Simon to Jesus . Jesus looked at him and said , “ You are Simon son of John . You will be called Cephas . ” ( “ Cephas ” means “ Peter . ” )
43001043	The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee . He found Philip and said to him , “ Follow me . ”
43001044	Philip was from the town of Bethsaida , where Andrew and Peter lived .
43001045	Philip found Nathanael and told him , “ We have found the man that Moses wrote about in the law , and the prophets also wrote about him . He is Jesus , the son of Joseph , from Nazareth . ”
43001046	But Nathanael said to Philip , “ Can anything good come from Nazareth ? ” Philip answered , “ Come and see . ”
43001047	As Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him , he said , “ Here is truly an Israelite . There is nothing false in him . ”
43001048	Nathanael asked , “ How do you know me ? ” Jesus answered , “ I saw you when you were under the fig tree , before Philip told you about me . ”
43001049	Then Nathanael said to Jesus , “ Teacher , you are the Son of God ; you are the King of Israel . ”
43001050	Jesus said to Nathanael , “ Do you believe simply because I told you I saw you under the fig tree ? You will see greater things than that . ”
43001051	And Jesus said to them , “ I tell you the truth , you will all see heaven open and ‘ angels of God going up and coming down ’ on the Son of Man . ”
43002001	Two days later there was a wedding in the town of Cana in Galilee . Jesus’ mother was there ,
43002002	and Jesus and his followers were also invited to the wedding .
43002003	When all the wine was gone , Jesus’ mother said to him , “ They have no more wine . ”
43002004	Jesus answered , “ Dear woman , why come to me ? My time has not yet come . ”
43002005	His mother said to the servants , “ Do whatever he tells you to do . ”
43002006	In that place there were six stone water jars that the Jews used in their washing ceremony . Each jar held about twenty or thirty gallons .
43002007	Jesus said to the servants , “ Fill the jars with water . ” So they filled the jars to the top .
43002008	Then he said to them , “ Now take some out and give it to the master of the feast . ” So they took the water to the master .
43002009	When he tasted it , the water had become wine . He did not know where the wine came from , but the servants who had brought the water knew . The master of the wedding called the bridegroom
43002010	and said to him , “ People always serve the best wine first . Later , after the guests have been drinking awhile , they serve the cheaper wine . But you have saved the best wine till now . ”
43002011	So in Cana of Galilee Jesus did his first miracle . There he showed his glory , and his followers believed in him .
43002012	After this , Jesus went to the town of Capernaum with his mother , brothers , and followers . They stayed there for just a few days .
43002013	When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover Feast , Jesus went to Jerusalem .
43002014	In the Temple he found people selling cattle , sheep , and doves . He saw others sitting at tables , exchanging different kinds of money .
43002015	Jesus made a whip out of cords and forced all of them , both the sheep and cattle , to leave the Temple . He turned over the tables and scattered the money of those who were exchanging it .
43002016	Then he said to those who were selling pigeons , “ Take these things out of here ! Don’t make my Father’s house a place for buying and selling ! ”
43002017	When this happened , the followers remembered what was written in the Scriptures : “ My strong love for your Temple completely controls me . ”
43002018	Some of his people said to Jesus , “ Show us a miracle to prove you have the right to do these things . ”
43002019	Jesus answered them , “ Destroy this temple , and I will build it again in three days . ”
43002020	They answered , “ It took forty-six years to build this Temple ! Do you really believe you can build it again in three days ? ”
43002021	( But the temple Jesus meant was his own body .
43002022	After Jesus was raised from the dead , his followers remembered that Jesus had said this . Then they believed the Scripture and the words Jesus had said . )
43002023	When Jesus was in Jerusalem for the Passover Feast , many people believed in him because they saw the miracles he did .
43002024	But Jesus did not believe in them because he knew them all .
43002025	He did not need anyone to tell him about people , because he knew what was in people’s minds .
43003001	There was a man named Nicodemus who was one of the Pharisees and an important Jewish leader .
43003002	One night Nicodemus came to Jesus and said , “ Teacher , we know you are a teacher sent from God , because no one can do the miracles you do unless God is with him . ”
43003003	Jesus answered , “ I tell you the truth , unless you are born again , you cannot be in God’s kingdom . ”
43003004	Nicodemus said , “ But if a person is already old , how can he be born again ? He cannot enter his mother’s womb again . So how can a person be born a second time ? ”
43003005	But Jesus answered , “ I tell you the truth , unless you are born from water and the Spirit , you cannot enter God’s kingdom .
43003006	Human life comes from human parents , but spiritual life comes from the Spirit .
43003007	Don’t be surprised when I tell you , ‘ You must all be born again . ’
43003008	The wind blows where it wants to and you hear the sound of it , but you don’t know where the wind comes from or where it is going . It is the same with every person who is born from the Spirit . ”
43003009	Nicodemus asked , “ How can this happen ? ”
43003010	Jesus said , “ You are an important teacher in Israel , and you don’t understand these things ?
43003011	I tell you the truth , we talk about what we know , and we tell about what we have seen , but you don’t accept what we tell you .
43003012	I have told you about things here on earth , and you do not believe me . So you will not believe me if I tell you about things of heaven .
43003013	The only one who has ever gone up to heaven is the One who came down from heaven — the Son of Man .
43003014	“ Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert , the Son of Man must also be lifted up .
43003015	So that everyone who believes can have eternal life in him .
43003016	“ God loved the world so much that he gave his one and only Son so that whoever believes in him may not be lost , but have eternal life .
43003017	God did not send his Son into the world to judge the world guilty , but to save the world through him .
43003018	People who believe in God’s Son are not judged guilty . Those who do not believe have already been judged guilty , because they have not believed in God’s one and only Son .
43003019	They are judged by this fact : The Light has come into the world , but they did not want light . They wanted darkness , because they were doing evil things .
43003020	All who do evil hate the light and will not come to the light , because it will show all the evil things they do .
43003021	But those who follow the true way come to the light , and it shows that the things they do were done through God . ”
43003022	After this , Jesus and his followers went into the area of Judea , where he stayed with his followers and baptized people .
43003023	John was also baptizing in Aenon , near Salim , because there was plenty of water there . People were going there to be baptized .
43003024	( This was before John was put into prison . )
43003025	Some of John’s followers had an argument with a Jew about religious washing .
43003026	So they came to John and said , “ Teacher , remember the man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan River , the one you spoke about so much ? He is baptizing , and everyone is going to him . ”
43003027	John answered , “ A man can get only what God gives him .
43003028	You yourselves heard me say , ‘ I am not the Christ , but I am the one sent to prepare the way for him . ’
43003029	The bride belongs only to the bridegroom . But the friend who helps the bridegroom stands by and listens to him . He is thrilled that he gets to hear the bridegroom’s voice . In the same way , I am really happy .
43003030	He must become greater , and I must become less important .
43003031	“ The One who comes from above is greater than all . The one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and talks about things on the earth . But the One who comes from heaven is greater than all .
43003032	He tells what he has seen and heard , but no one accepts what he says .
43003033	Whoever accepts what he says has proven that God is true .
43003034	The One whom God sent speaks the words of God , because God gives him the Spirit fully .
43003035	The Father loves the Son and has given him power over everything .
43003036	Those who believe in the Son have eternal life , but those who do not obey the Son will never have life . God’s anger stays on them . ”
43004001	The Pharisees heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more followers than John ,
43004002	although Jesus himself did not baptize people , but his followers did .
43004003	Jesus knew that the Pharisees had heard about him , so he left Judea and went back to Galilee .
43004004	But on the way he had to go through the country of Samaria .
43004005	In Samaria Jesus came to the town called Sychar , which is near the field Jacob gave to his son Joseph .
43004006	Jacob’s well was there . Jesus was tired from his long trip , so he sat down beside the well . It was about twelve o’clock noon .
43004007	When a Samaritan woman came to the well to get some water , Jesus said to her , “ Please give me a drink . ”
43004008	( This happened while Jesus’ followers were in town buying some food . )
43004009	The woman said , “ I am surprised that you ask me for a drink , since you are a Jewish man and I am a Samaritan woman . ” ( Jewish people are not friends with Samaritans . )
43004010	Jesus said , “ If you only knew the free gift of God and who it is that is asking you for water , you would have asked him , and he would have given you living water . ”
43004011	The woman said , “ Sir , where will you get this living water ? The well is very deep , and you have nothing to get water with .
43004012	Are you greater than Jacob , our father , who gave us this well and drank from it himself along with his sons and flocks ? ”
43004013	Jesus answered , “ Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again ,
43004014	but whoever drinks the water I give will never be thirsty . The water I give will become a spring of water gushing up inside that person , giving eternal life . ”
43004015	The woman said to him , “ Sir , give me this water so I will never be thirsty again and will not have to come back here to get more water . ”
43004016	Jesus told her , “ Go get your husband and come back here . ”
43004017	The woman answered , “ I have no husband . ” Jesus said to her , “ You are right to say you have no husband .
43004018	Really you have had five husbands , and the man you live with now is not your husband . You told the truth . ”
43004019	The woman said , “ Sir , I can see that you are a prophet .
43004020	Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain , but you say that Jerusalem is the place where people must worship . ”
43004021	Jesus said , “ Believe me , woman . The time is coming when neither in Jerusalem nor on this mountain will you actually worship the Father .
43004022	You Samaritans worship something you don’t understand . We understand what we worship , because salvation comes from the Jews .
43004023	The time is coming when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth , and that time is here already . You see , the Father too is actively seeking such people to worship him .
43004024	God is spirit , and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth . ”
43004025	The woman said , “ I know that the Messiah is coming . ” ( Messiah is the One called Christ . ) “ When the Messiah comes , he will explain everything to us . ”
43004026	Then Jesus said , “ I am he — I , the one talking to you . ”
43004027	Just then his followers came back from town and were surprised to see him talking with a woman . But none of them asked , “ What do you want ? ” or “ Why are you talking with her ? ”
43004028	Then the woman left her water jar and went back to town . She said to the people ,
43004029	“ Come and see a man who told me everything I ever did . Do you think he might be the Christ ? ”
43004030	So the people left the town and went to see Jesus .
43004031	Meanwhile , his followers were begging him , “ Teacher , eat something . ”
43004032	But Jesus answered , “ I have food to eat that you know nothing about . ”
43004033	So the followers asked themselves , “ Did somebody already bring him food ? ”
43004034	Jesus said , “ My food is to do what the One who sent me wants me to do and to finish his work .
43004035	You have a saying , ‘ Four more months till harvest . ’ But I tell you , open your eyes and look at the fields ready for harvest now .
43004036	Already , the one who harvests is being paid and is gathering crops for eternal life . So the one who plants and the one who harvests celebrate at the same time .
43004037	Here the saying is true , ‘ One person plants , and another harvests . ’
43004038	I sent you to harvest a crop that you did not work on . Others did the work , and you get to finish up their work . ”
43004039	Many of the Samaritans in that town believed in Jesus because of what the woman said : “ He told me everything I ever did . ”
43004040	When the Samaritans came to Jesus , they begged him to stay with them , so he stayed there two more days .
43004041	And many more believed because of the things he said .
43004042	They said to the woman , “ First we believed in Jesus because of what you said , but now we believe because we heard him ourselves . We know that this man really is the Savior of the world . ”
43004043	Two days later , Jesus left and went to Galilee .
43004044	( Jesus had said before that a prophet is not respected in his own country . )
43004045	When Jesus arrived in Galilee , the people there welcomed him . They had seen all the things he did at the Passover Feast in Jerusalem , because they had been there , too .
43004046	Jesus went again to visit Cana in Galilee where he had changed the water into wine . One of the king’s important officers lived in the city of Capernaum , and his son was sick .
43004047	When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee , he went to Jesus and begged him to come to Capernaum and heal his son , because his son was almost dead .
43004048	Jesus said to him , “ You people must see signs and miracles before you will believe in me . ”
43004049	The officer said , “ Sir , come before my child dies . ”
43004050	Jesus answered , “ Go . Your son will live . ” The man believed what Jesus told him and went home .
43004051	On the way the man’s servants came and met him and told him , “ Your son is alive . ”
43004052	The man asked , “ What time did my son begin to get well ? ” They answered , “ Yesterday at one o’clock the fever left him . ”
43004053	The father knew that one o’clock was the exact time that Jesus had said , “ Your son will live . ” So the man and all the people who lived in his house believed in Jesus .
43004054	That was the second miracle Jesus did after coming from Judea to Galilee .
43005001	Later Jesus went to Jerusalem for a special feast .
43005002	In Jerusalem there is a pool with five covered porches , which is called Bethesda in the Hebrew language . This pool is near the Sheep Gate .
43005003	Many sick people were lying on the porches beside the pool . Some were blind , some were crippled , and some were paralyzed [ , and they waited for the water to move .
43005004	Sometimes an angel of the Lord came down to the pool and stirred up the water . After the angel did this , the first person to go into the pool was healed from any sickness he had ] .
43005005	A man was lying there who had been sick for thirty-eight years .
43005006	When Jesus saw the man and knew that he had been sick for such a long time , Jesus asked him , “ Do you want to be well ? ”
43005007	The sick man answered , “ Sir , there is no one to help me get into the pool when the water starts moving . While I am coming to the water , someone else always gets in before me . ”
43005008	Then Jesus said , “ Stand up . Pick up your mat and walk . ”
43005009	And immediately the man was well ; he picked up his mat and began to walk . The day this happened was a Sabbath day .
43005010	So the Jews said to the man who had been healed , “ Today is the Sabbath . It is against our law for you to carry your mat on the Sabbath day . ”
43005011	But he answered , “ The man who made me well told me , ‘ Pick up your mat and walk . ’ ”
43005012	Then they asked him , “ Who is the man who told you to pick up your mat and walk ? ”
43005013	But the man who had been healed did not know who it was , because there were many people in that place , and Jesus had left .
43005014	Later , Jesus found the man at the Temple and said to him , “ See , you are well now . Stop sinning so that something worse does not happen to you . ”
43005015	Then the man left and told his people that Jesus was the one who had made him well .
43005016	Because Jesus was doing this on the Sabbath day , some evil people began to persecute him .
43005017	But Jesus said to them , “ My Father never stops working , and so I keep working , too . ”
43005018	This made them try still harder to kill him . They said , “ First Jesus was breaking the law about the Sabbath day . Now he says that God is his own Father , making himself equal with God ! ”
43005019	But Jesus said , “ I tell you the truth , the Son can do nothing alone . The Son does only what he sees the Father doing , because the Son does whatever the Father does .
43005020	The Father loves the Son and shows the Son all the things he himself does . But the Father will show the Son even greater things than this so that you can all be amazed .
43005021	Just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life , so also the Son gives life to those he wants to .
43005022	In fact , the Father judges no one , but he has given the Son power to do all the judging
43005023	so that all people will honor the Son as much as they honor the Father . Anyone who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him .
43005024	“ I tell you the truth , whoever hears what I say and believes in the One who sent me has eternal life . That person will not be judged guilty but has already left death and entered life .
43005025	I tell you the truth , the time is coming and is already here when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God , and those who hear will have life .
43005026	Life comes from the Father himself , and he has allowed the Son to have life in himself as well .
43005027	And the Father has given the Son the approval to judge , because he is the Son of Man .
43005028	Don’t be surprised at this : A time is coming when all who are dead and in their graves will hear his voice .
43005029	Then they will come out of their graves . Those who did good will rise and have life forever , but those who did evil will rise to be judged guilty .
43005030	“ I can do nothing alone . I judge only the way I am told , so my judgment is fair . I don’t try to please myself , but I try to please the One who sent me .
43005031	“ If only I tell people about myself , what I say is not true .
43005032	But there is another who tells about me , and I know that the things he says about me are true .
43005033	“ You have sent people to John , and he has told you the truth .
43005034	It is not that I need what humans say ; I tell you this so you can be saved .
43005035	John was like a burning and shining lamp , and you were happy to enjoy his light for a while .
43005036	“ But I have a proof about myself that is greater than that of John . The things I do , which are the things my Father gave me to do , prove that the Father sent me .
43005037	And the Father himself who sent me has given proof about me . You have never heard his voice or seen what he looks like .
43005038	His teaching does not live in you , because you don’t believe in the One the Father sent .
43005039	You carefully study the Scriptures because you think they give you eternal life . They do in fact tell about me ,
43005040	but you refuse to come to me to have that life .
43005041	“ I don’t need praise from people .
43005042	But I know you — I know that you don’t have God’s love in you .
43005043	I have come from my Father and speak for him , but you don’t accept me . But when another person comes , speaking only for himself , you will accept him .
43005044	You try to get praise from each other , but you do not try to get the praise that comes from the only God . So how can you believe ?
43005045	Don’t think that I will stand before the Father and say you are wrong . The one who says you are wrong is Moses , the one you hoped would save you .
43005046	If you really believed Moses , you would believe me , because Moses wrote about me .
43005047	But if you don’t believe what Moses wrote , how can you believe what I say ? ”
43006001	After this , Jesus went across Lake Galilee ( or , Lake Tiberias ) .
43006002	Many people followed him because they saw the miracles he did to heal the sick .
43006003	Jesus went up on a hill and sat down there with his followers .
43006004	It was almost the time for the Jewish Passover Feast .
43006005	When Jesus looked up and saw a large crowd coming toward him , he said to Philip , “ Where can we buy enough bread for all these people to eat ? ”
43006006	( Jesus asked Philip this question to test him , because Jesus already knew what he planned to do . )
43006007	Philip answered , “ Someone would have to work almost a year to buy enough bread for each person to have only a little piece . ”
43006008	Another one of his followers , Andrew , Simon Peter’s brother , said ,
43006009	“ Here is a boy with five loaves of barley bread and two little fish , but that is not enough for so many people . ”
43006010	Jesus said , “ Tell the people to sit down . ” There was plenty of grass there , and about five thousand men sat down there .
43006011	Then Jesus took the loaves of bread , thanked God for them , and gave them to the people who were sitting there . He did the same with the fish , giving as much as the people wanted .
43006012	When they had all had enough to eat , Jesus said to his followers , “ Gather the leftover pieces of fish and bread so that nothing is wasted . ”
43006013	So they gathered up the pieces and filled twelve baskets with the pieces left from the five barley loaves .
43006014	When the people saw this miracle that Jesus did , they said , “ He must truly be the Prophet who is coming into the world . ”
43006015	Jesus knew that the people planned to come and take him by force and make him their king , so he left and went into the hills alone .
43006016	That evening Jesus’ followers went down to Lake Galilee .
43006017	It was dark now , and Jesus had not yet come to them . The followers got into a boat and started across the lake to Capernaum .
43006018	By now a strong wind was blowing , and the waves on the lake were getting bigger .
43006019	When they had rowed the boat about three or four miles , they saw Jesus walking on the water , coming toward the boat . The followers were afraid ,
43006020	but Jesus said to them , “ It is I . Do not be afraid . ”
43006021	Then they were glad to take him into the boat . At once the boat came to land at the place where they wanted to go .
43006022	The next day the people who had stayed on the other side of the lake knew that Jesus had not gone in the boat with his followers but that they had left without him . And they knew that only one boat had been there .
43006023	But then some boats came from Tiberias and landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks .
43006024	When the people saw that Jesus and his followers were not there now , they got into boats and went to Capernaum to find Jesus .
43006025	When the people found Jesus on the other side of the lake , they asked him , “ Teacher , when did you come here ? ”
43006026	Jesus answered , “ I tell you the truth , you aren’t looking for me because you saw me do miracles . You are looking for me because you ate the bread and were satisfied .
43006027	Don’t work for the food that spoils . Work for the food that stays good always and gives eternal life . The Son of Man will give you this food , because on him God the Father has put his power . ”
43006028	The people asked Jesus , “ What are the things God wants us to do ? ”
43006029	Jesus answered , “ The work God wants you to do is this : Believe the One he sent . ”
43006030	So the people asked , “ What miracle will you do ? If we see a miracle , we will believe you . What will you do ?
43006031	Our ancestors ate the manna in the desert . This is written in the Scriptures : ‘ He gave them bread from heaven to eat . ’ ”
43006032	Jesus said , “ I tell you the truth , it was not Moses who gave you bread from heaven ; it is my Father who is giving you the true bread from heaven .
43006033	God’s bread is the One who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world . ”
43006034	The people said , “ Sir , give us this bread always . ”
43006035	Then Jesus said , “ I am the bread that gives life . Whoever comes to me will never be hungry , and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty .
43006036	But as I told you before , you have seen me and still don’t believe .
43006037	The Father gives me the people who are mine . Every one of them will come to me , and I will always accept them .
43006038	I came down from heaven to do what God wants me to do , not what I want to do .
43006039	Here is what the One who sent me wants me to do : I must not lose even one whom God gave me , but I must raise them all on the last day .
43006040	Those who see the Son and believe in him have eternal life , and I will raise them on the last day . This is what my Father wants . ”
43006041	Some people began to complain about Jesus because he said , “ I am the bread that comes down from heaven . ”
43006042	They said , “ This is Jesus , the son of Joseph . We know his father and mother . How can he say , ‘ I came down from heaven ’ ? ”
43006043	But Jesus answered , “ Stop complaining to each other .
43006044	The Father is the One who sent me . No one can come to me unless the Father draws him to me , and I will raise that person up on the last day .
43006045	It is written in the prophets , ‘ They will all be taught by God . ’ Everyone who listens to the Father and learns from him comes to me .
43006046	No one has seen the Father except the One who is from God ; only he has seen the Father .
43006047	I tell you the truth , whoever believes has eternal life .
43006048	I am the bread that gives life .
43006049	Your ancestors ate the manna in the desert , but still they died .
43006050	Here is the bread that comes down from heaven . Anyone who eats this bread will never die .
43006051	I am the living bread that came down from heaven . Anyone who eats this bread will live forever . This bread is my flesh , which I will give up so that the world may have life . ”
43006052	Then the evil people began to argue among themselves , saying , “ How can this man give us his flesh to eat ? ”
43006053	Jesus said , “ I tell you the truth , you must eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood . Otherwise , you won’t have real life in you .
43006054	Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood have eternal life , and I will raise them up on the last day .
43006055	My flesh is true food , and my blood is true drink .
43006056	Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood live in me , and I live in them .
43006057	The living Father sent me , and I live because of the Father . So whoever eats me will live because of me .
43006058	I am not like the bread your ancestors ate . They ate that bread and still died . I am the bread that came down from heaven , and whoever eats this bread will live forever . ”
43006059	Jesus said all these things while he was teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum .
43006060	When the followers of Jesus heard this , many of them said , “ This teaching is hard . Who can accept it ? ”
43006061	Knowing that his followers were complaining about this , Jesus said , “ Does this teaching bother you ?
43006062	Then will it also bother you to see the Son of Man going back to the place where he came from ?
43006063	It is the Spirit that gives life . The flesh doesn’t give life . The words I told you are spirit , and they give life .
43006064	But some of you don’t believe . ” ( Jesus knew from the beginning who did not believe and who would turn against him . )
43006065	Jesus said , “ That is the reason I said , ‘ If the Father does not bring a person to me , that one cannot come . ’ ”
43006066	After Jesus said this , many of his followers left him and stopped following him .
43006067	Jesus asked the twelve followers , “ Do you want to leave , too ? ”
43006068	Simon Peter answered him , “ Lord , who would we go to ? You have the words that give eternal life .
43006069	We believe and know that you are the Holy One from God . ”
43006070	Then Jesus answered , “ I chose all twelve of you , but one of you is a devil . ”
43006071	Jesus was talking about Judas , the son of Simon Iscariot . Judas was one of the twelve , but later he was going to turn against Jesus .
43007001	After this , Jesus traveled around Galilee . He did not want to travel in Judea , because some evil people there wanted to kill him .
43007002	It was time for the Feast of Shelters .
43007003	So Jesus’ brothers said to him , “ You should leave here and go to Judea so your followers there can see the miracles you do .
43007004	Anyone who wants to be well known does not hide what he does . If you are doing these things , show yourself to the world . ”
43007005	( Even Jesus’ brothers did not believe in him . )
43007006	Jesus said to his brothers , “ The right time for me has not yet come , but any time is right for you .
43007007	The world cannot hate you , but it hates me , because I tell it the evil things it does .
43007008	So you go to the feast . I will not go yet to this feast , because the right time for me has not yet come . ”
43007009	After saying this , Jesus stayed in Galilee .
43007010	But after Jesus’ brothers had gone to the feast , Jesus went also . But he did not let people see him .
43007011	At the feast some people were looking for him and saying , “ Where is that man ? ”
43007012	Within the large crowd there , many people were whispering to each other about Jesus . Some said , “ He is a good man . ” Others said , “ No , he fools the people . ”
43007013	But no one was brave enough to talk about Jesus openly , because they were afraid of the elders .
43007014	When the feast was about half over , Jesus went to the Temple and began to teach .
43007015	The people were amazed and said , “ This man has never studied in school . How did he learn so much ? ”
43007016	Jesus answered , “ The things I teach are not my own , but they come from him who sent me .
43007017	If people choose to do what God wants , they will know that my teaching comes from God and not from me .
43007018	Those who teach their own ideas are trying to get honor for themselves . But those who try to bring honor to the one who sent them speak the truth , and there is nothing false in them .
43007019	Moses gave you the law , but none of you obeys that law . Why are you trying to kill me ? ”
43007020	The people answered , “ A demon has come into you . We are not trying to kill you . ”
43007021	Jesus said to them , “ I did one miracle , and you are all amazed .
43007022	Moses gave you the law about circumcision . ( But really Moses did not give you circumcision ; it came from our ancestors . ) And yet you circumcise a baby boy on a Sabbath day .
43007023	If a baby boy can be circumcised on a Sabbath day to obey the law of Moses , why are you angry at me for healing a person’s whole body on the Sabbath day ?
43007024	Stop judging by the way things look , but judge by what is really right . ”
43007025	Then some of the people who lived in Jerusalem said , “ This is the man they are trying to kill .
43007026	But he is teaching where everyone can see and hear him , and no one is trying to stop him . Maybe the leaders have decided he really is the Christ .
43007027	But we know where this man is from . Yet when the real Christ comes , no one will know where he comes from . ”
43007028	Jesus , teaching in the Temple , cried out , “ Yes , you know me , and you know where I am from . But I have not come by my own authority . I was sent by the One who is true , whom you don’t know .
43007029	But I know him , because I am from him , and he sent me . ”
43007030	When Jesus said this , they tried to seize him . But no one was able to touch him , because it was not yet the right time .
43007031	But many of the people believed in Jesus . They said , “ When the Christ comes , will he do more miracles than this man has done ? ”
43007032	The Pharisees heard the crowd whispering these things about Jesus . So the leading priests and the Pharisees sent some Temple guards to arrest him .
43007033	Jesus said , “ I will be with you a little while longer . Then I will go back to the One who sent me .
43007034	You will look for me , but you will not find me . And you cannot come where I am . ”
43007035	Some people said to each other , “ Where will this man go so we cannot find him ? Will he go to the Greek cities where our people live and teach the Greek people there ?
43007036	What did he mean when he said , ‘ You will look for me , but you will not find me , ’ and ‘ You cannot come where I am ’ ? ”
43007037	On the last and most important day of the feast Jesus stood up and said in a loud voice , “ Let anyone who is thirsty come to me and drink .
43007038	If anyone believes in me , rivers of living water will flow out from that person’s heart , as the Scripture says . ”
43007039	Jesus was talking about the Holy Spirit . The Spirit had not yet been given , because Jesus had not yet been raised to glory . But later , those who believed in Jesus would receive the Spirit .
43007040	When the people heard Jesus’ words , some of them said , “ This man really is the Prophet . ”
43007041	Others said , “ He is the Christ . ” Still others said , “ The Christ will not come from Galilee .
43007042	The Scripture says that the Christ will come from David’s family and from Bethlehem , the town where David lived . ”
43007043	So the people did not agree with each other about Jesus .
43007044	Some of them wanted to arrest him , but no one was able to touch him .
43007045	The Temple guards went back to the leading priests and the Pharisees , who asked , “ Why didn’t you bring Jesus ? ”
43007046	The guards answered , “ The words he says are greater than the words of any other person who has ever spoken ! ”
43007047	The Pharisees answered , “ So Jesus has fooled you also !
43007048	Have any of the leaders or the Pharisees believed in him ? No !
43007049	But these people , who know nothing about the law , are under God’s curse . ”
43007050	Nicodemus , who had gone to see Jesus before , was in that group . He said ,
43007051	“ Our law does not judge a person without hearing him and knowing what he has done . ”
43007052	They answered , “ Are you from Galilee , too ? Study the Scriptures , and you will learn that no prophet comes from Galilee . ”
43007053	And everyone left and went home .
43008001	Jesus went to the Mount of Olives .
43008002	But early in the morning he went back to the Temple , and all the people came to him , and he sat and taught them .
43008003	The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery . They forced her to stand before the people .
43008004	They said to Jesus , “ Teacher , this woman was caught having sexual relations with a man who is not her husband .
43008005	The law of Moses commands that we stone to death every woman who does this . What do you say we should do ? ”
43008006	They were asking this to trick Jesus so that they could have some charge against him . But Jesus bent over and started writing on the ground with his finger .
43008007	When they continued to ask Jesus their question , he raised up and said , “ Anyone here who has never sinned can throw the first stone at her . ”
43008008	Then Jesus bent over again and wrote on the ground .
43008009	Those who heard Jesus began to leave one by one , first the older men and then the others . Jesus was left there alone with the woman standing before him .
43008010	Jesus raised up again and asked her , “ Woman , where are they ? Has no one judged you guilty ? ”
43008011	She answered , “ No one , sir . ” Then Jesus said , “ I also don’t judge you guilty . You may go now , but don’t sin anymore . ” ] _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
43008012	Later , Jesus talked to the people again , saying , “ I am the light of the world . The person who follows me will never live in darkness but will have the light that gives life . ”
43008013	The Pharisees said to Jesus , “ When you talk about yourself , you are the only one to say these things are true . We cannot accept what you say . ”
43008014	Jesus answered , “ Yes , I am saying these things about myself , but they are true . I know where I came from and where I am going . But you don’t know where I came from or where I am going .
43008015	You judge by human standards . I am not judging anyone .
43008016	But when I do judge , I judge truthfully , because I am not alone . The Father who sent me is with me .
43008017	Your own law says that when two witnesses say the same thing , you must accept what they say .
43008018	I am one of the witnesses who speaks about myself , and the Father who sent me is the other witness . ”
43008019	They asked , “ Where is your father ? ” Jesus answered , “ You don’t know me or my Father . If you knew me , you would know my Father , too . ”
43008020	Jesus said these things while he was teaching in the Temple , near where the money is kept . But no one arrested him , because the right time for him had not yet come .
43008021	Again , Jesus said to the people , “ I will leave you , and you will look for me , but you will die in your sins . You cannot come where I am going . ”
43008022	So the Jews asked , “ Will he kill himself ? Is that why he said , ‘ You cannot come where I am going ’ ? ”
43008023	Jesus said , “ You people are from here below , but I am from above . You belong to this world , but I don’t belong to this world .
43008024	So I told you that you would die in your sins . Yes , you will die in your sins if you don’t believe that I am he . ”
43008025	They asked , “ Then who are you ? ” Jesus answered , “ I am what I have told you from the beginning .
43008026	I have many things to say and decide about you . But I tell people only the things I have heard from the One who sent me , and he speaks the truth . ”
43008027	The people did not understand that he was talking to them about the Father .
43008028	So Jesus said to them , “ When you lift up the Son of Man , you will know that I am he . You will know that these things I do are not by my own authority but that I say only what the Father has taught me .
43008029	The One who sent me is with me . I always do what is pleasing to him , so he has not left me alone . ”
43008030	While Jesus was saying these things , many people believed in him .
43008031	So Jesus said to the Jews who believed in him , “ If you continue to obey my teaching , you are truly my followers .
43008032	Then you will know the truth , and the truth will make you free . ”
43008033	They answered , “ We are Abraham’s children , and we have never been anyone’s slaves . So why do you say we will be free ? ”
43008034	Jesus answered , “ I tell you the truth , everyone who lives in sin is a slave to sin .
43008035	A slave does not stay with a family forever , but a son belongs to the family forever .
43008036	So if the Son makes you free , you will be truly free .
43008037	I know you are Abraham’s children , but you want to kill me because you don’t accept my teaching .
43008038	I am telling you what my Father has shown me , but you do what your father has told you . ”
43008039	They answered , “ Our father is Abraham . ” Jesus said , “ If you were really Abraham’s children , you would do the things Abraham did .
43008040	I am a man who has told you the truth which I heard from God , but you are trying to kill me . Abraham did nothing like that .
43008041	So you are doing the things your own father did . ” But they said , “ We are not like children who never knew who their father was . God is our Father ; he is the only Father we have . ”
43008042	Jesus said to them , “ If God were really your Father , you would love me , because I came from God and now I am here . I did not come by my own authority ; God sent me .
43008043	You don’t understand what I say , because you cannot accept my teaching .
43008044	You belong to your father the devil , and you want to do what he wants . He was a murderer from the beginning and was against the truth , because there is no truth in him . When he tells a lie , he shows what he is really like , because he is a liar and the father of lies .
43008045	But because I speak the truth , you don’t believe me .
43008046	Can any of you prove that I am guilty of sin ? If I am telling the truth , why don’t you believe me ?
43008047	The person who belongs to God accepts what God says . But you don’t accept what God says , because you don’t belong to God . ”
43008048	They answered , “ We say you are a Samaritan and have a demon in you . Are we not right ? ”
43008049	Jesus answered , “ I have no demon in me . I give honor to my Father , but you dishonor me .
43008050	I am not trying to get honor for myself . There is One who wants this honor for me , and he is the judge .
43008051	I tell you the truth , whoever obeys my teaching will never die . ”
43008052	They said to Jesus , “ Now we know that you have a demon in you ! Even Abraham and the prophets died . But you say , ‘ Whoever obeys my teaching will never die . ’
43008053	Do you think you are greater than our father Abraham , who died ? And the prophets died , too . Who do you think you are ? ”
43008054	Jesus answered , “ If I give honor to myself , that honor is worth nothing . The One who gives me honor is my Father , and you say he is your God .
43008055	You don’t really know him , but I know him . If I said I did not know him , I would be a liar like you . But I do know him , and I obey what he says .
43008056	Your father Abraham was very happy that he would see my day . He saw that day and was glad . ”
43008057	They said to him , “ You have never seen Abraham ! You are not even fifty years old . ”
43008058	Jesus answered , “ I tell you the truth , before Abraham was even born , I am ! ”
43008059	When Jesus said this , the people picked up stones to throw at him . But Jesus hid himself , and then he left the Temple .
43009001	As Jesus was walking along , he saw a man who had been born blind .
43009002	His followers asked him , “ Teacher , whose sin caused this man to be born blind — his own sin or his parents’ sin ? ”
43009003	Jesus answered , “ It is not this man’s sin or his parents’ sin that made him blind . This man was born blind so that God’s power could be shown in him .
43009004	While it is daytime , we must continue doing the work of the One who sent me . Night is coming , when no one can work .
43009005	While I am in the world , I am the light of the world . ”
43009006	After Jesus said this , he spit on the ground and made some mud with it and put the mud on the man’s eyes .
43009007	Then he told the man , “ Go and wash in the Pool of Siloam . ” ( Siloam means Sent . ) So the man went , washed , and came back seeing .
43009008	The neighbors and some people who had earlier seen this man begging said , “ Isn’t this the same man who used to sit and beg ? ”
43009009	Some said , “ He is the one , ” but others said , “ No , he only looks like him . ” The man himself said , “ I am the man . ”
43009010	They asked , “ How did you get your sight ? ”
43009011	He answered , “ The man named Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes . Then he told me to go to Siloam and wash . So I went and washed , and then I could see . ”
43009012	They asked him , “ Where is this man ? ” “ I don’t know , ” he answered .
43009013	Then the people took to the Pharisees the man who had been blind .
43009014	The day Jesus had made mud and healed his eyes was a Sabbath day .
43009015	So now the Pharisees asked the man , “ How did you get your sight ? ” He answered , “ He put mud on my eyes , I washed , and now I see . ”
43009016	So some of the Pharisees were saying , “ This man does not keep the Sabbath day , so he is not from God . ” But others said , “ A man who is a sinner can’t do miracles like these . ” So they could not agree with each other .
43009017	They asked the man again , “ What do you say about him since it was your eyes he opened ? ” The man answered , “ He is a prophet . ”
43009018	These leaders did not believe that he had been blind and could now see again . So they sent for the man’s parents
43009019	and asked them , “ Is this your son who you say was born blind ? Then how does he now see ? ”
43009020	His parents answered , “ We know that this is our son and that he was born blind .
43009021	But we don’t know how he can now see . We don’t know who opened his eyes . Ask him . He is old enough to speak for himself . ”
43009022	His parents said this because they were afraid of the elders , who had already decided that anyone who said Jesus was the Christ would be avoided .
43009023	That is why his parents said , “ He is old enough . Ask him . ”
43009024	So for the second time , they called the man who had been blind . They said , “ You should give God the glory by telling the truth . We know that this man is a sinner . ”
43009025	He answered , “ I don’t know if he is a sinner . One thing I do know : I was blind , and now I see . ”
43009026	They asked , “ What did he do to you ? How did he make you see again ? ”
43009027	He answered , “ I already told you , and you didn’t listen . Why do you want to hear it again ? Do you want to become his followers , too ? ”
43009028	Then they insulted him and said , “ You are his follower , but we are followers of Moses .
43009029	We know that God spoke to Moses , but we don’t even know where this man comes from . ”
43009030	The man answered , “ This is a very strange thing . You don’t know where he comes from , and yet he opened my eyes .
43009031	We all know that God does not listen to sinners , but he listens to anyone who worships and obeys him .
43009032	Nobody has ever heard of anyone giving sight to a man born blind .
43009033	If this man were not from God , he could do nothing . ”
43009034	They answered , “ You were born full of sin ! Are you trying to teach us ? ” And they threw him out .
43009035	When Jesus heard that they had thrown him out , Jesus found him and said , “ Do you believe in the Son of Man ? ”
43009036	He asked , “ Who is the Son of Man , sir , so that I can believe in him ? ”
43009037	Jesus said to him , “ You have seen him . The Son of Man is the one talking with you . ”
43009038	He said , “ Lord , I believe ! ” Then the man worshiped Jesus .
43009039	Jesus said , “ I came into this world so that the world could be judged . I came so that the blind would see and so that those who see will become blind . ”
43009040	Some of the Pharisees who were nearby heard Jesus say this and asked , “ Are you saying we are blind , too ? ”
43009041	Jesus said , “ If you were blind , you would not be guilty of sin . But since you keep saying you see , your guilt remains . ”
43010001	Jesus said , “ I tell you the truth , the person who does not enter the sheepfold by the door , but climbs in some other way , is a thief and a robber .
43010002	The one who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep .
43010003	The one who guards the door opens it for him . And the sheep listen to the voice of the shepherd . He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out .
43010004	When he brings all his sheep out , he goes ahead of them , and they follow him because they know his voice .
43010005	But they will never follow a stranger . They will run away from him because they don’t know his voice . ”
43010006	Jesus told the people this story , but they did not understand what it meant .
43010007	So Jesus said again , “ I tell you the truth , I am the door for the sheep .
43010008	All the people who came before me were thieves and robbers . The sheep did not listen to them .
43010009	I am the door , and the person who enters through me will be saved and will be able to come in and go out and find pasture .
43010010	A thief comes to steal and kill and destroy , but I came to give life — life in all its fullness .
43010011	“ I am the good shepherd . The good shepherd gives his life for the sheep .
43010012	The worker who is paid to keep the sheep is different from the shepherd who owns them . When the worker sees a wolf coming , he runs away and leaves the sheep alone . Then the wolf attacks the sheep and scatters them .
43010013	The man runs away because he is only a paid worker and does not really care about the sheep .
43010014	“ I am the good shepherd . I know my sheep , and my sheep know me ,
43010015	just as the Father knows me , and I know the Father . I give my life for the sheep .
43010016	I have other sheep that are not in this flock , and I must bring them also . They will listen to my voice , and there will be one flock and one shepherd .
43010017	The Father loves me because I give my life so that I can take it back again .
43010018	No one takes it away from me ; I give my own life freely . I have the right to give my life , and I have the right to take it back . This is what my Father commanded me to do . ”
43010019	Again the leaders did not agree with each other because of these words of Jesus .
43010020	Many of them said , “ A demon has come into him and made him crazy . Why listen to him ? ”
43010021	But others said , “ A man who is crazy with a demon does not say things like this . Can a demon open the eyes of the blind ? ”
43010022	The time came for the Feast of Dedication at Jerusalem . It was winter ,
43010023	and Jesus was walking in the Temple in Solomon’s Porch .
43010024	Some people gathered around him and said , “ How long will you make us wonder about you ? If you are the Christ , tell us plainly . ”
43010025	Jesus answered , “ I told you already , but you did not believe . The miracles I do in my Father’s name show who I am .
43010026	But you don’t believe , because you are not my sheep .
43010027	My sheep listen to my voice ; I know them , and they follow me .
43010028	I give them eternal life , and they will never die , and no one can steal them out of my hand .
43010029	My Father gave my sheep to me . He is greater than all , and no person can steal my sheep out of my Father’s hand .
43010030	The Father and I are one . ”
43010031	Again some of the people picked up stones to kill Jesus .
43010032	But he said to them , “ I have done many good works from the Father . Which of these good works are you killing me for ? ”
43010033	They answered , “ We are not killing you because of any good work you did , but because you speak against God . You are only a human , but you say you are the same as God ! ”
43010034	Jesus answered , “ It is written in your law that God said , ‘ I said , you are gods . ’
43010035	This Scripture called those people gods who received God’s message , and Scripture is always true .
43010036	So why do you say that I speak against God because I said , ‘ I am God’s Son ’ ? I am the one God chose and sent into the world .
43010037	If I don’t do what my Father does , then don’t believe me .
43010038	But if I do what my Father does , even though you don’t believe in me , believe what I do . Then you will know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father . ”
43010039	They tried to take Jesus again , but he escaped from them .
43010040	Then he went back across the Jordan River to the place where John had first baptized . Jesus stayed there ,
43010041	and many people came to him and said , “ John never did a miracle , but everything John said about this man is true . ”
43010042	And in that place many believed in Jesus .
43011001	A man named Lazarus was sick . He lived in the town of Bethany , where Mary and her sister Martha lived .
43011002	Mary was the woman who later put perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair . Mary’s brother was Lazarus , the man who was now sick .
43011003	So Mary and Martha sent someone to tell Jesus , “ Lord , the one you love is sick . ”
43011004	When Jesus heard this , he said , “ This sickness will not end in death . It is for the glory of God , to bring glory to the Son of God . ”
43011005	Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus .
43011006	But when he heard that Lazarus was sick , he stayed where he was for two more days .
43011007	Then Jesus said to his followers , “ Let’s go back to Judea . ”
43011008	The followers said , “ But Teacher , some people there tried to stone you to death only a short time ago . Now you want to go back there ? ”
43011009	Jesus answered , “ Are there not twelve hours in the day ? If anyone walks in the daylight , he will not stumble , because he can see by this world’s light .
43011010	But if anyone walks at night , he stumbles because there is no light to help him see . ”
43011011	After Jesus said this , he added , “ Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep , but I am going there to wake him . ”
43011012	The followers said , “ But Lord , if he is only asleep , he will be all right . ”
43011013	Jesus meant that Lazarus was dead , but his followers thought he meant Lazarus was really sleeping .
43011014	So then Jesus said plainly , “ Lazarus is dead .
43011015	And I am glad for your sakes I was not there so that you may believe . But let’s go to him now . ”
43011016	Then Thomas ( the one called Didymus ) said to the other followers , “ Let us also go so that we can die with him . ”
43011017	When Jesus arrived , he learned that Lazarus had already been dead and in the tomb for four days .
43011018	Bethany was about two miles from Jerusalem .
43011019	Many of the Jews had come there to comfort Martha and Mary about their brother .
43011020	When Martha heard that Jesus was coming , she went out to meet him , but Mary stayed home .
43011021	Martha said to Jesus , “ Lord , if you had been here , my brother would not have died .
43011022	But I know that even now God will give you anything you ask . ”
43011023	Jesus said , “ Your brother will rise and live again . ”
43011024	Martha answered , “ I know that he will rise and live again in the resurrection on the last day . ”
43011025	Jesus said to her , “ I am the resurrection and the life . Those who believe in me will have life even if they die .
43011026	And everyone who lives and believes in me will never die . Martha , do you believe this ? ”
43011027	Martha answered , “ Yes , Lord . I believe that you are the Christ , the Son of God , the One coming to the world . ”
43011028	After Martha said this , she went back and talked to her sister Mary alone . Martha said , “ The Teacher is here and he is asking for you . ”
43011029	When Mary heard this , she got up quickly and went to Jesus .
43011030	Jesus had not yet come into the town but was still at the place where Martha had met him .
43011031	The Jews were with Mary in the house , comforting her . When they saw her stand and leave quickly , they followed her , thinking she was going to the tomb to cry there .
43011032	But Mary went to the place where Jesus was . When she saw him , she fell at his feet and said , “ Lord , if you had been here , my brother would not have died . ”
43011033	When Jesus saw Mary crying and the Jews who came with her also crying , he was upset and was deeply troubled .
43011034	He asked , “ Where did you bury him ? ” “ Come and see , Lord , ” they said .
43011035	Jesus cried .
43011036	So the Jews said , “ See how much he loved him . ”
43011037	But some of them said , “ If Jesus opened the eyes of the blind man , why couldn’t he keep Lazarus from dying ? ”
43011038	Again feeling very upset , Jesus came to the tomb . It was a cave with a large stone covering the entrance .
43011039	Jesus said , “ Move the stone away . ” Martha , the sister of the dead man , said , “ But , Lord , it has been four days since he died . There will be a bad smell . ”
43011040	Then Jesus said to her , “ Didn’t I tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of God ? ”
43011041	So they moved the stone away from the entrance . Then Jesus looked up and said , “ Father , I thank you that you heard me .
43011042	I know that you always hear me , but I said these things because of the people here around me . I want them to believe that you sent me . ”
43011043	After Jesus said this , he cried out in a loud voice , “ Lazarus , come out ! ”
43011044	The dead man came out , his hands and feet wrapped with pieces of cloth , and a cloth around his face . Jesus said to them , “ Take the cloth off of him and let him go . ”
43011045	Many of the people , who had come to visit Mary and saw what Jesus did , believed in him .
43011046	But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done .
43011047	Then the leading priests and Pharisees called a meeting of the council . They asked , “ What should we do ? This man is doing many miracles .
43011048	If we let him continue doing these things , everyone will believe in him . Then the Romans will come and take away our Temple and our nation . ”
43011049	One of the men there was Caiaphas , the high priest that year . He said , “ You people know nothing !
43011050	You don’t realize that it is better for one man to die for the people than for the whole nation to be destroyed . ”
43011051	Caiaphas did not think of this himself . As high priest that year , he was really prophesying that Jesus would die for their nation
43011052	and for God’s scattered children to bring them all together and make them one .
43011053	That day they started planning to kill Jesus .
43011054	So Jesus no longer traveled openly among the people . He left there and went to a place near the desert , to a town called Ephraim and stayed there with his followers .
43011055	It was almost time for the Passover Feast . Many from the country went up to Jerusalem before the Passover to do the special things to make themselves pure .
43011056	The people looked for Jesus and stood in the Temple asking each other , “ Is he coming to the Feast ? What do you think ? ”
43011057	But the leading priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where Jesus was , he must tell them . Then they could arrest him .
43012001	Six days before the Passover Feast , Jesus went to Bethany , where Lazarus lived . ( Lazarus is the man Jesus raised from the dead . )
43012002	There they had a dinner for Jesus . Martha served the food , and Lazarus was one of the people eating with Jesus .
43012003	Mary brought in a pint of very expensive perfume made from pure nard . She poured the perfume on Jesus’ feet , and then she wiped his feet with her hair . And the sweet smell from the perfume filled the whole house .
43012004	Judas Iscariot , one of Jesus’ followers who would later turn against him , was there . Judas said ,
43012005	“ This perfume was worth an entire year’s wages . Why wasn’t it sold and the money given to the poor ? ”
43012006	But Judas did not really care about the poor ; he said this because he was a thief . He was the one who kept the money box , and he often stole from it .
43012007	Jesus answered , “ Leave her alone . It was right for her to save this perfume for today , the day for me to be prepared for burial .
43012008	You will always have the poor with you , but you will not always have me . ”
43012009	A large crowd of people heard that Jesus was in Bethany . So they went there to see not only Jesus but Lazarus , whom Jesus raised from the dead .
43012010	So the leading priests made plans to kill Lazarus , too .
43012011	Because of Lazarus many of the Jews were leaving them and believing in Jesus .
43012012	The next day a great crowd who had come to Jerusalem for the Passover Feast heard that Jesus was coming there .
43012013	So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet Jesus , shouting , “ Praise God ! God bless the One who comes in the name of the Lord ! God bless the King of Israel ! ”
43012014	Jesus found a colt and sat on it . This was as the Scripture says ,
43012015	“ Don’t be afraid , people of Jerusalem ! Your king is coming , sitting on the colt of a donkey . ”
43012016	The followers of Jesus did not understand this at first . But after Jesus was raised to glory , they remembered that this had been written about him and that they had done these things to him .
43012017	There had been many people with Jesus when he raised Lazarus from the dead and told him to come out of the tomb . Now they were telling others about what Jesus did .
43012018	Many people went out to meet Jesus , because they had heard about this miracle .
43012019	So the Pharisees said to each other , “ You can see that nothing is going right for us . Look ! The whole world is following him . ”
43012020	There were some Greek people , too , who came to Jerusalem to worship at the Passover Feast .
43012021	They went to Philip , who was from Bethsaida in Galilee , and said , “ Sir , we would like to see Jesus . ”
43012022	Philip told Andrew , and then Andrew and Philip told Jesus .
43012023	Jesus said to them , “ The time has come for the Son of Man to receive his glory .
43012024	I tell you the truth , a grain of wheat must fall to the ground and die to make many seeds . But if it never dies , it remains only a single seed .
43012025	Those who love their lives will lose them , but those who hate their lives in this world will keep true life forever .
43012026	Whoever serves me must follow me . Then my servant will be with me everywhere I am . My Father will honor anyone who serves me .
43012027	“ Now I am very troubled . Should I say , ‘ Father , save me from this time ’ ? No , I came to this time so I could suffer .
43012028	Father , bring glory to your name ! ” Then a voice came from heaven , “ I have brought glory to it , and I will do it again . ”
43012029	The crowd standing there , who heard the voice , said it was thunder . But others said , “ An angel has spoken to him . ”
43012030	Jesus said , “ That voice was for your sake , not mine .
43012031	Now is the time for the world to be judged ; now the ruler of this world will be thrown down .
43012032	If I am lifted up from the earth , I will draw all people toward me . ”
43012033	Jesus said this to show how he would die .
43012034	The crowd said , “ We have heard from the law that the Christ will live forever . So why do you say , ‘ The Son of Man must be lifted up ’ ? Who is this ‘ Son of Man ’ ? ”
43012035	Then Jesus said , “ The light will be with you for a little longer , so walk while you have the light . Then the darkness will not catch you . If you walk in the darkness , you will not know where you are going .
43012036	Believe in the light while you still have it so that you will become children of light . ” When Jesus had said this , he left and hid himself from them .
43012037	Though Jesus had done many miracles in front of the people , they still did not believe in him .
43012038	This was to bring about what Isaiah the prophet had said : “ Lord , who believed what we told them ? Who saw the Lord’s power in this ? ”
43012039	This is why the people could not believe : Isaiah also had said ,
43012040	“ He has blinded their eyes , and he has closed their minds . Otherwise they would see with their eyes and understand in their minds and come back to me and be healed . ”
43012041	Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus’ glory and spoke about him .
43012042	But many believed in Jesus , even many of the leaders . But because of the Pharisees , they did not say they believed in him for fear they would be put out of the synagogue .
43012043	They loved praise from people more than praise from God .
43012044	Then Jesus cried out , “ Whoever believes in me is really believing in the One who sent me .
43012045	Whoever sees me sees the One who sent me .
43012046	I have come as light into the world so that whoever believes in me would not stay in darkness .
43012047	“ Anyone who hears my words and does not obey them , I do not judge , because I did not come to judge the world , but to save the world .
43012048	There is a judge for those who refuse to believe in me and do not accept my words . The word I have taught will be their judge on the last day .
43012049	The things I taught were not from myself . The Father who sent me told me what to say and what to teach .
43012050	And I know that eternal life comes from what the Father commands . So whatever I say is what the Father told me to say . ”
43013001	It was almost time for the Passover Feast . Jesus knew that it was time for him to leave this world and go back to the Father . He had always loved those who were his own in the world , and he loved them all the way to the end .
43013002	Jesus and his followers were at the evening meal . The devil had already persuaded Judas Iscariot , the son of Simon , to turn against Jesus .
43013003	Jesus knew that the Father had given him power over everything and that he had come from God and was going back to God .
43013004	So during the meal Jesus stood up and took off his outer clothing . Taking a towel , he wrapped it around his waist .
43013005	Then he poured water into a bowl and began to wash the followers’ feet , drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him .
43013006	Jesus came to Simon Peter , who said to him , “ Lord , are you going to wash my feet ? ”
43013007	Jesus answered , “ You don’t understand now what I am doing , but you will understand later . ”
43013008	Peter said , “ No , you will never wash my feet . ” Jesus answered , “ If I don’t wash your feet , you are not one of my people . ”
43013009	Simon Peter answered , “ Lord , then wash not only my feet , but wash my hands and my head , too ! ”
43013010	Jesus said , “ After a person has had a bath , his whole body is clean . He needs only to wash his feet . And you men are clean , but not all of you . ”
43013011	Jesus knew who would turn against him , and that is why he said , “ Not all of you are clean . ”
43013012	When he had finished washing their feet , he put on his clothes and sat down again . He asked , “ Do you understand what I have just done for you ?
43013013	You call me ‘ Teacher ’ and ‘ Lord , ’ and you are right , because that is what I am .
43013014	If I , your Lord and Teacher , have washed your feet , you also should wash each other’s feet .
43013015	I did this as an example so that you should do as I have done for you .
43013016	I tell you the truth , a servant is not greater than his master . A messenger is not greater than the one who sent him .
43013017	If you know these things , you will be blessed if you do them .
43013018	“ I am not talking about all of you . I know those I have chosen . But this is to bring about what the Scripture said : ‘ The man who ate at my table has turned against me . ’
43013019	I am telling you this now before it happens so that when it happens , you will believe that I am he .
43013020	I tell you the truth , whoever accepts anyone I send also accepts me . And whoever accepts me also accepts the One who sent me . ”
43013021	After Jesus said this , he was very troubled . He said openly , “ I tell you the truth , one of you will turn against me . ”
43013022	The followers all looked at each other , because they did not know whom Jesus was talking about .
43013023	One of the followers sitting next to Jesus was the follower Jesus loved .
43013024	Simon Peter motioned to him to ask Jesus whom he was talking about .
43013025	That follower leaned closer to Jesus and asked , “ Lord , who is it ? ”
43013026	Jesus answered , “ I will dip this bread into the dish . The man I give it to is the man who will turn against me . ” So Jesus took a piece of bread , dipped it , and gave it to Judas Iscariot , the son of Simon .
43013027	As soon as Judas took the bread , Satan entered him . Jesus said to him , “ The thing that you will do — do it quickly . ”
43013028	No one at the table understood why Jesus said this to Judas .
43013029	Since he was the one who kept the money box , some of the followers thought Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the feast or to give something to the poor .
43013030	Judas took the bread Jesus gave him and immediately went out . It was night .
43013031	When Judas was gone , Jesus said , “ Now the Son of Man receives his glory , and God receives glory through him .
43013032	If God receives glory through him , then God will give glory to the Son through himself . And God will give him glory quickly . ”
43013033	Jesus said , “ My children , I will be with you only a little longer . You will look for me , and what I told the Jews , I tell you now : Where I am going you cannot come .
43013034	“ I give you a new command : Love each other . You must love each other as I have loved you .
43013035	All people will know that you are my followers if you love each other . ”
43013036	Simon Peter asked Jesus , “ Lord , where are you going ? ” Jesus answered , “ Where I am going you cannot follow now , but you will follow later . ”
43013037	Peter asked , “ Lord , why can’t I follow you now ? I am ready to die for you ! ”
43013038	Jesus answered , “ Are you ready to die for me ? I tell you the truth , before the rooster crows , you will say three times that you don’t know me . ”
43014001	Jesus said , “ Don’t let your hearts be troubled . Trust in God , and trust in me .
43014002	There are many rooms in my Father’s house ; I would not tell you this if it were not true . I am going there to prepare a place for you .
43014003	After I go and prepare a place for you , I will come back and take you to be with me so that you may be where I am .
43014004	You know the way to the place where I am going . ”
43014005	Thomas said to Jesus , “ Lord , we don’t know where you are going . So how can we know the way ? ”
43014006	Jesus answered , “ I am the way , and the truth , and the life . The only way to the Father is through me .
43014007	If you really knew me , you would know my Father , too . But now you do know him , and you have seen him . ”
43014008	Philip said to him , “ Lord , show us the Father . That is all we need . ”
43014009	Jesus answered , “ I have been with you a long time now . Do you still not know me , Philip ? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father . So why do you say , ‘ Show us the Father ’ ?
43014010	Don’t you believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me ? The words I say to you don’t come from me , but the Father lives in me and does his own work .
43014011	Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me . Or believe because of the miracles I have done .
43014012	I tell you the truth , whoever believes in me will do the same things that I do . Those who believe will do even greater things than these , because I am going to the Father .
43014013	And if you ask for anything in my name , I will do it for you so that the Father’s glory will be shown through the Son .
43014014	If you ask me for anything in my name , I will do it .
43014015	“ If you love me , you will obey my commands .
43014016	I will ask the Father , and he will give you another Helper to be with you forever —
43014017	the Spirit of truth . The world cannot accept him , because it does not see him or know him . But you know him , because he lives with you and he will be in you .
43014018	“ I will not leave you all alone like orphans ; I will come back to you .
43014019	In a little while the world will not see me anymore , but you will see me . Because I live , you will live , too .
43014020	On that day you will know that I am in my Father , and that you are in me and I am in you .
43014021	Those who know my commands and obey them are the ones who love me , and my Father will love those who love me . I will love them and will show myself to them . ”
43014022	Then Judas ( not Judas Iscariot ) said , “ But , Lord , why do you plan to show yourself to us and not to the rest of the world ? ”
43014023	Jesus answered , “ If people love me , they will obey my teaching . My Father will love them , and we will come to them and make our home with them .
43014024	Those who do not love me do not obey my teaching . This teaching that you hear is not really mine ; it is from my Father , who sent me .
43014025	“ I have told you all these things while I am with you .
43014026	But the Helper will teach you everything and will cause you to remember all that I told you . This Helper is the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in my name .
43014027	“ I leave you peace ; my peace I give you . I do not give it to you as the world does . So don’t let your hearts be troubled or afraid .
43014028	You heard me say to you , ‘ I am going , but I am coming back to you . ’ If you loved me , you should be happy that I am going back to the Father , because he is greater than I am .
43014029	I have told you this now , before it happens , so that when it happens , you will believe .
43014030	I will not talk with you much longer , because the ruler of this world is coming . He has no power over me ,
43014031	but the world must know that I love the Father , so I do exactly what the Father told me to do . “ Come now , let us go .
43015001	“ I am the true vine ; my Father is the gardener .
43015002	He cuts off every branch of mine that does not produce fruit . And he trims and cleans every branch that produces fruit so that it will produce even more fruit .
43015003	You are already clean because of the words I have spoken to you .
43015004	Remain in me , and I will remain in you . A branch cannot produce fruit alone but must remain in the vine . In the same way , you cannot produce fruit alone but must remain in me .
43015005	“ I am the vine , and you are the branches . If any remain in me and I remain in them , they produce much fruit . But without me they can do nothing .
43015006	If any do not remain in me , they are like a branch that is thrown away and then dies . People pick up dead branches , throw them into the fire , and burn them .
43015007	If you remain in me and follow my teachings , you can ask anything you want , and it will be given to you .
43015008	You should produce much fruit and show that you are my followers , which brings glory to my Father .
43015009	I loved you as the Father loved me . Now remain in my love .
43015010	I have obeyed my Father’s commands , and I remain in his love . In the same way , if you obey my commands , you will remain in my love .
43015011	I have told you these things so that you can have the same joy I have and so that your joy will be the fullest possible joy .
43015012	“ This is my command : Love each other as I have loved you .
43015013	The greatest love a person can show is to die for his friends .
43015014	You are my friends if you do what I command you .
43015015	I no longer call you servants , because a servant does not know what his master is doing . But I call you friends , because I have made known to you everything I heard from my Father .
43015016	You did not choose me ; I chose you . And I gave you this work : to go and produce fruit , fruit that will last . Then the Father will give you anything you ask for in my name .
43015017	This is my command : Love each other .
43015018	“ If the world hates you , remember that it hated me first .
43015019	If you belonged to the world , it would love you as it loves its own . But I have chosen you out of the world , so you don’t belong to it . That is why the world hates you .
43015020	Remember what I told you : A servant is not greater than his master . If people did wrong to me , they will do wrong to you , too . And if they obeyed my teaching , they will obey yours , too .
43015021	They will do all this to you on account of me , because they do not know the One who sent me .
43015022	If I had not come and spoken to them , they would not be guilty of sin , but now they have no excuse for their sin .
43015023	Whoever hates me also hates my Father .
43015024	I did works among them that no one else has ever done . If I had not done these works , they would not be guilty of sin . But now they have seen what I have done , and yet they have hated both me and my Father .
43015025	But this happened so that what is written in their law would be true : ‘ They hated me for no reason . ’
43015026	“ I will send you the Helper from the Father ; he is the Spirit of truth who comes from the Father . When he comes , he will tell about me ,
43015027	and you also must tell people about me , because you have been with me from the beginning .
43016001	“ I have told you these things to keep you from giving up .
43016002	People will put you out of their synagogues . Yes , the time is coming when those who kill you will think they are offering service to God .
43016003	They will do this because they have not known the Father and they have not known me .
43016004	I have told you these things now so that when the time comes you will remember that I warned you . “ I did not tell you these things at the beginning , because I was with you then .
43016005	Now I am going back to the One who sent me . But none of you asks me , ‘ Where are you going ? ’
43016006	Your hearts are filled with sadness because I have told you these things .
43016007	But I tell you the truth , it is better for you that I go away . When I go away , I will send the Helper to you . If I do not go away , the Helper will not come .
43016008	When the Helper comes , he will prove to the people of the world the truth about sin , about being right with God , and about judgment .
43016009	He will prove to them that sin is not believing in me .
43016010	He will prove to them that being right with God comes from my going to the Father and not being seen anymore .
43016011	And the Helper will prove to them that judgment happened when the ruler of this world was judged .
43016012	“ I have many more things to say to you , but they are too much for you now .
43016013	But when the Spirit of truth comes , he will lead you into all truth . He will not speak his own words , but he will speak only what he hears , and he will tell you what is to come .
43016014	The Spirit of truth will bring glory to me , because he will take what I have to say and tell it to you .
43016015	All that the Father has is mine . That is why I said that the Spirit will take what I have to say and tell it to you .
43016016	“ After a little while you will not see me , and then after a little while you will see me again . ”
43016017	Some of the followers said to each other , “ What does Jesus mean when he says , ‘ After a little while you will not see me , and then after a little while you will see me again ’ ? And what does he mean when he says , ‘ Because I am going to the Father ’ ? ”
43016018	They also asked , “ What does he mean by ‘ a little while ’ ? We don’t understand what he is saying . ”
43016019	Jesus saw that the followers wanted to ask him about this , so he said to them , “ Are you asking each other what I meant when I said , ‘ After a little while you will not see me , and then after a little while you will see me again ’ ?
43016020	I tell you the truth , you will cry and be sad , but the world will be happy . You will be sad , but your sadness will become joy .
43016021	When a woman gives birth to a baby , she has pain , because her time has come . But when her baby is born , she forgets the pain , because she is so happy that a child has been born into the world .
43016022	It is the same with you . Now you are sad , but I will see you again and you will be happy , and no one will take away your joy .
43016023	In that day you will not ask me for anything . I tell you the truth , my Father will give you anything you ask for in my name .
43016024	Until now you have not asked for anything in my name . Ask and you will receive , so that your joy will be the fullest possible joy .
43016025	“ I have told you these things indirectly in stories . But the time will come when I will not use stories like that to tell you things ; I will speak to you in plain words about the Father .
43016026	In that day you will ask the Father for things in my name . I mean , I will not need to ask the Father for you .
43016027	The Father himself loves you . He loves you because you loved me and believed that I came from God .
43016028	I came from the Father into the world . Now I am leaving the world and going back to the Father . ”
43016029	Then the followers of Jesus said , “ You are speaking clearly to us now and are not using stories that are hard to understand .
43016030	We can see now that you know all things . You can answer a person’s question even before it is asked . This makes us believe you came from God . ”
43016031	Jesus answered , “ So now you believe ?
43016032	Listen to me ; a time is coming when you will be scattered , each to your own home . That time is now here . You will leave me alone , but I am never really alone , because the Father is with me .
43016033	“ I told you these things so that you can have peace in me . In this world you will have trouble , but be brave ! I have defeated the world . ”
43017001	After Jesus said these things , he looked toward heaven and prayed , “ Father , the time has come . Give glory to your Son so that the Son can give glory to you .
43017002	You gave the Son power over all people so that the Son could give eternal life to all those you gave him .
43017003	And this is eternal life : that people know you , the only true God , and that they know Jesus Christ , the One you sent .
43017004	Having finished the work you gave me to do , I brought you glory on earth .
43017005	And now , Father , give me glory with you ; give me the glory I had with you before the world was made .
43017006	“ I showed what you are like to those you gave me from the world . They belonged to you , and you gave them to me , and they have obeyed your teaching .
43017007	Now they know that everything you gave me comes from you .
43017008	I gave them the teachings you gave me , and they accepted them . They knew that I truly came from you , and they believed that you sent me .
43017009	I am praying for them . I am not praying for people in the world but for those you gave me , because they are yours .
43017010	All I have is yours , and all you have is mine . And my glory is shown through them .
43017011	I am coming to you ; I will not stay in the world any longer . But they are still in the world . Holy Father , keep them safe by the power of your name , the name you gave me , so that they will be one , just as you and I are one .
43017012	While I was with them , I kept them safe by the power of your name , the name you gave me . I protected them , and only one of them , the one worthy of destruction , was lost so that the Scripture would come true .
43017013	“ I am coming to you now . But I pray these things while I am still in the world so that these followers can have all of my joy in them .
43017014	I have given them your teaching . And the world has hated them , because they don’t belong to the world , just as I don’t belong to the world .
43017015	I am not asking you to take them out of the world but to keep them safe from the Evil One .
43017016	They don’t belong to the world , just as I don’t belong to the world .
43017017	Make them ready for your service through your truth ; your teaching is truth .
43017018	I have sent them into the world , just as you sent me into the world .
43017019	For their sake , I am making myself ready to serve so that they can be ready for their service of the truth .
43017020	“ I pray for these followers , but I am also praying for all those who will believe in me because of their teaching .
43017021	Father , I pray that they can be one . As you are in me and I am in you , I pray that they can also be one in us . Then the world will believe that you sent me .
43017022	I have given these people the glory that you gave me so that they can be one , just as you and I are one .
43017023	I will be in them and you will be in me so that they will be completely one . Then the world will know that you sent me and that you loved them just as much as you loved me .
43017024	“ Father , I want these people that you gave me to be with me where I am . I want them to see my glory , which you gave me because you loved me before the world was made .
43017025	Father , you are the One who is good . The world does not know you , but I know you , and these people know you sent me .
43017026	I showed them what you are like , and I will show them again . Then they will have the same love that you have for me , and I will live in them . ”
43018001	When Jesus finished praying , he went with his followers across the Kidron Valley . On the other side there was a garden , and Jesus and his followers went into it .
43018002	Judas knew where this place was , because Jesus met there often with his followers . Judas was the one who turned against Jesus .
43018003	So Judas came there with a group of soldiers and some guards from the leading priests and the Pharisees . They were carrying torches , lanterns , and weapons .
43018004	Knowing everything that would happen to him , Jesus went out and asked , “ Who is it you are looking for ? ”
43018005	They answered , “ Jesus from Nazareth . ” “ I am he , ” Jesus said . ( Judas , the one who turned against Jesus , was standing there with them . )
43018006	When Jesus said , “ I am he , ” they moved back and fell to the ground .
43018007	Jesus asked them again , “ Who is it you are looking for ? ” They said , “ Jesus of Nazareth . ”
43018008	“ I told you that I am he , ” Jesus said . “ So if you are looking for me , let the others go . ”
43018009	This happened so that the words Jesus said before would come true : “ I have not lost any of the ones you gave me . ”
43018010	Simon Peter , who had a sword , pulled it out and struck the servant of the high priest , cutting off his right ear . ( The servant’s name was Malchus . )
43018011	Jesus said to Peter , “ Put your sword back . Shouldn’t I drink the cup the Father gave me ? ”
43018012	Then the soldiers with their commander and the guards arrested Jesus . They tied him
43018013	and led him first to Annas , the father-in-law of Caiaphas , the high priest that year .
43018014	Caiaphas was the one who told the Jews that it would be better if one man died for all the people .
43018015	Simon Peter and another one of Jesus’ followers went along after Jesus . This follower knew the high priest , so he went with Jesus into the high priest’s courtyard .
43018016	But Peter waited outside near the door . The follower who knew the high priest came back outside , spoke to the girl at the door , and brought Peter inside .
43018017	The girl at the door said to Peter , “ Aren’t you also one of that man’s followers ? ” Peter answered , “ No , I am not ! ”
43018018	It was cold , so the servants and guards had built a fire and were standing around it , warming themselves . Peter also was standing with them , warming himself .
43018019	The high priest asked Jesus questions about his followers and his teaching .
43018020	Jesus answered , “ I have spoken openly to everyone . I have always taught in synagogues and in the Temple , where all the Jews come together . I never said anything in secret .
43018021	So why do you question me ? Ask the people who heard my teaching . They know what I said . ”
43018022	When Jesus said this , one of the guards standing there hit him . The guard said , “ Is that the way you answer the high priest ? ”
43018023	Jesus answered him , “ If I said something wrong , then show what it was . But if what I said is true , why do you hit me ? ”
43018024	Then Annas sent Jesus , who was still tied , to Caiaphas the high priest .
43018025	As Simon Peter was standing and warming himself , they said to him , “ Aren’t you one of that man’s followers ? ” Peter said it was not true ; he said , “ No , I am not . ”
43018026	One of the servants of the high priest was there . This servant was a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off . The servant said , “ Didn’t I see you with him in the garden ? ”
43018027	Again Peter said it wasn’t true . At once a rooster crowed .
43018028	Early in the morning they led Jesus from Caiaphas’s house to the Roman governor’s palace . They would not go inside the palace , because they did not want to make themselves unclean ; they wanted to eat the Passover meal .
43018029	So Pilate went outside to them and asked , “ What charges do you bring against this man ? ”
43018030	They answered , “ If he were not a criminal , we wouldn’t have brought him to you . ”
43018031	Pilate said to them , “ Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law . ” “ But we are not allowed to put anyone to death , ” the Jews answered .
43018032	( This happened so that what Jesus said about how he would die would come true . )
43018033	Then Pilate went back inside the palace and called Jesus to him and asked , “ Are you the king of the Jews ? ”
43018034	Jesus said , “ Is that your own question , or did others tell you about me ? ”
43018035	Pilate answered , “ I am not one of you . It was your own people and their leading priests who handed you over to me . What have you done wrong ? ”
43018036	Jesus answered , “ My kingdom does not belong to this world . If it belonged to this world , my servants would have fought to keep me from being given over to the Jewish leaders . But my kingdom is from another place . ”
43018037	Pilate said , “ So you are a king ! ” Jesus answered , “ You are the one saying I am a king . This is why I was born and came into the world : to tell people the truth . And everyone who belongs to the truth listens to me . ”
43018038	Pilate said , “ What is truth ? ” After he said this , he went out to the crowd again and said to them , “ I find nothing against this man .
43018039	But it is your custom that I free one prisoner to you at Passover time . Do you want me to free the ‘ king of the Jews’ ? ”
43018040	They shouted back , “ No , not him ! Let Barabbas go free ! ” ( Barabbas was a robber . )
43019001	Then Pilate ordered that Jesus be taken away and whipped .
43019002	The soldiers made a crown from some thorny branches and put it on Jesus’ head and put a purple robe around him .
43019003	Then they came to him many times and said , “ Hail , King of the Jews ! ” and hit him in the face .
43019004	Again Pilate came out and said to them , “ Look , I am bringing Jesus out to you . I want you to know that I find nothing against him . ”
43019005	So Jesus came out , wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe . Pilate said to them , “ Here is the man ! ”
43019006	When the leading priests and the guards saw Jesus , they shouted , “ Crucify him ! Crucify him ! ” But Pilate answered , “ Crucify him yourselves , because I find nothing against him . ”
43019007	The leaders answered , “ We have a law that says he should die , because he said he is the Son of God . ”
43019008	When Pilate heard this , he was even more afraid .
43019009	He went back inside the palace and asked Jesus , “ Where do you come from ? ” But Jesus did not answer him .
43019010	Pilate said , “ You refuse to speak to me ? Don’t you know I have power to set you free and power to have you crucified ? ”
43019011	Jesus answered , “ The only power you have over me is the power given to you by God . The man who turned me in to you is guilty of a greater sin . ”
43019012	After this , Pilate tried to let Jesus go . But some in the crowd cried out , “ Anyone who makes himself king is against Caesar . If you let this man go , you are no friend of Caesar . ”
43019013	When Pilate heard what they were saying , he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge’s seat at the place called The Stone Pavement . ( In the Hebrew language the name is Gabbatha . )
43019014	It was about noon on Preparation Day of Passover week . Pilate said to the crowd , “ Here is your king ! ”
43019015	They shouted , “ Take him away ! Take him away ! Crucify him ! ” Pilate asked them , “ Do you want me to crucify your king ? ” The leading priests answered , “ The only king we have is Caesar . ”
43019016	So Pilate handed Jesus over to them to be crucified . The soldiers took charge of Jesus .
43019017	Carrying his own cross , Jesus went out to a place called The Place of the Skull , which in the Hebrew language is called Golgotha .
43019018	There they crucified Jesus . They also crucified two other men , one on each side , with Jesus in the middle .
43019019	Pilate wrote a sign and put it on the cross . It read : jesus of nazareth , the king of the jews .
43019020	The sign was written in Hebrew , in Latin , and in Greek . Many of the people read the sign , because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city .
43019021	The leading priests said to Pilate , “ Don’t write , ‘ The King of the Jews . ’ But write , ‘ This man said , “ I am the King of the Jews . ” ’ ”
43019022	Pilate answered , “ What I have written , I have written . ”
43019023	After the soldiers crucified Jesus , they took his clothes and divided them into four parts , with each soldier getting one part . They also took his long shirt , which was all one piece of cloth , woven from top to bottom .
43019024	So the soldiers said to each other , “ We should not tear this into parts . Let’s throw lots to see who will get it . ” This happened so that this Scripture would come true : “ They divided my clothes among them , and they threw lots for my clothing . ” So the soldiers did this .
43019025	Standing near his cross were Jesus’ mother , his mother’s sister , Mary the wife of Clopas , and Mary Magdalene .
43019026	When Jesus saw his mother and the follower he loved standing nearby , he said to his mother , “ Dear woman , here is your son . ”
43019027	Then he said to the follower , “ Here is your mother . ” From that time on , the follower took her to live in his home .
43019028	After this , Jesus knew that everything had been done . So that the Scripture would come true , he said , “ I am thirsty . ”
43019029	There was a jar full of vinegar there , so the soldiers soaked a sponge in it , put the sponge on a branch of a hyssop plant , and lifted it to Jesus’ mouth .
43019030	When Jesus tasted the vinegar , he said , “ It is finished . ” Then he bowed his head and died .
43019031	This day was Preparation Day , and the next day was a special Sabbath day . Since the religious leaders did not want the bodies to stay on the cross on the Sabbath day , they asked Pilate to order that the legs of the men be broken and the bodies be taken away .
43019032	So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man on the cross beside Jesus . Then they broke the legs of the man on the other cross beside Jesus .
43019033	But when the soldiers came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead , they did not break his legs .
43019034	But one of the soldiers stuck his spear into Jesus’ side , and at once blood and water came out .
43019035	( The one who saw this happen is the one who told us this , and whatever he says is true . And he knows that he tells the truth , and he tells it so that you might believe . )
43019036	These things happened to make the Scripture come true : “ Not one of his bones will be broken . ”
43019037	And another Scripture says , “ They will look at the one they stabbed . ”
43019038	Later , Joseph from Arimathea asked Pilate if he could take the body of Jesus . ( Joseph was a secret follower of Jesus , because he was afraid of some of the leaders . ) Pilate gave his permission , so Joseph came and took Jesus’ body away .
43019039	Nicodemus , who earlier had come to Jesus at night , went with Joseph . He brought about seventy-five pounds of myrrh and aloes .
43019040	These two men took Jesus’ body and wrapped it with the spices in pieces of linen cloth , which is how they bury the dead .
43019041	In the place where Jesus was crucified , there was a garden . In the garden was a new tomb that had never been used before .
43019042	The men laid Jesus in that tomb because it was nearby , and they were preparing to start their Sabbath day .
43020001	Early on the first day of the week , Mary Magdalene went to the tomb while it was still dark . When she saw that the large stone had been moved away from the tomb ,
43020002	she ran to Simon Peter and the follower whom Jesus loved . Mary said , “ They have taken the Lord out of the tomb , and we don’t know where they have put him . ”
43020003	So Peter and the other follower started for the tomb .
43020004	They were both running , but the other follower ran faster than Peter and reached the tomb first .
43020005	He bent down and looked in and saw the strips of linen cloth lying there , but he did not go in .
43020006	Then following him , Simon Peter arrived and went into the tomb and saw the strips of linen lying there .
43020007	He also saw the cloth that had been around Jesus’ head , which was folded up and laid in a different place from the strips of linen .
43020008	Then the other follower , who had reached the tomb first , also went in . He saw and believed .
43020009	( They did not yet understand from the Scriptures that Jesus must rise from the dead . )
43020010	Then the followers went back home .
43020011	But Mary stood outside the tomb , crying . As she was crying , she bent down and looked inside the tomb .
43020012	She saw two angels dressed in white , sitting where Jesus’ body had been , one at the head and one at the feet .
43020013	They asked her , “ Woman , why are you crying ? ” She answered , “ They have taken away my Lord , and I don’t know where they have put him . ”
43020014	When Mary said this , she turned around and saw Jesus standing there , but she did not know it was Jesus .
43020015	Jesus asked her , “ Woman , why are you crying ? Whom are you looking for ? ” Thinking he was the gardener , she said to him , “ Did you take him away , sir ? Tell me where you put him , and I will get him . ”
43020016	Jesus said to her , “ Mary . ” Mary turned toward Jesus and said in the Hebrew language , “ Rabboni . ” ( This means “ Teacher . ” )
43020017	Jesus said to her , “ Don’t hold on to me , because I have not yet gone up to the Father . But go to my brothers and tell them , ‘ I am going back to my Father and your Father , to my God and your God . ’ ”
43020018	Mary Magdalene went and said to the followers , “ I saw the Lord ! ” And she told them what Jesus had said to her .
43020019	When it was evening on the first day of the week , Jesus’ followers were together . The doors were locked , because they were afraid of the elders . Then Jesus came and stood right in the middle of them and said , “ Peace be with you . ”
43020020	After he said this , he showed them his hands and his side . His followers were thrilled when they saw the Lord .
43020021	Then Jesus said again , “ Peace be with you . As the Father sent me , I now send you . ”
43020022	After he said this , he breathed on them and said , “ Receive the Holy Spirit .
43020023	If you forgive anyone his sins , they are forgiven . If you don’t forgive them , they are not forgiven . ”
43020024	Thomas ( called Didymus ) , who was one of the twelve , was not with them when Jesus came .
43020025	The other followers kept telling Thomas , “ We saw the Lord . ” But Thomas said , “ I will not believe it until I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were and put my hand into his side . ”
43020026	A week later the followers were in the house again , and Thomas was with them . The doors were locked , but Jesus came in and stood right in the middle of them . He said , “ Peace be with you . ”
43020027	Then he said to Thomas , “ Put your finger here , and look at my hands . Put your hand here in my side . Stop being an unbeliever and believe . ”
43020028	Thomas said to him , “ My Lord and my God ! ”
43020029	Then Jesus told him , “ You believe because you see me . Those who believe without seeing me will be truly blessed . ”
43020030	Jesus did many other miracles in the presence of his followers that are not written in this book .
43020031	But these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ , the Son of God . Then , by believing , you may have life through his name .
43021001	Later , Jesus showed himself to his followers again — this time at Lake Galilee . This is how he showed himself :
43021002	Some of the followers were together : Simon Peter , Thomas ( called Didymus ) , Nathanael from Cana in Galilee , the two sons of Zebedee , and two other followers .
43021003	Simon Peter said , “ I am going out to fish . ” The others said , “ We will go with you . ” So they went out and got into the boat . They fished that night but caught nothing .
43021004	Early the next morning Jesus stood on the shore , but the followers did not know it was Jesus .
43021005	Then he said to them , “ Friends , did you catch any fish ? ” They answered , “ No . ”
43021006	He said , “ Throw your net on the right side of the boat , and you will find some . ” So they did , and they caught so many fish they could not pull the net back into the boat .
43021007	The follower whom Jesus loved said to Peter , “ It is the Lord ! ” When Peter heard him say this , he wrapped his coat around himself . ( Peter had taken his clothes off . ) Then he jumped into the water .
43021008	The other followers went to shore in the boat , dragging the net full of fish . They were not very far from shore , only about a hundred yards .
43021009	When the followers stepped out of the boat and onto the shore , they saw a fire of hot coals . There were fish on the fire , and there was bread .
43021010	Then Jesus said , “ Bring some of the fish you just caught . ”
43021011	Simon Peter went into the boat and pulled the net to the shore . It was full of big fish , one hundred fifty-three in all , but even though there were so many , the net did not tear .
43021012	Jesus said to them , “ Come and eat . ” None of the followers dared ask him , “ Who are you ? ” because they knew it was the Lord .
43021013	Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them , along with the fish .
43021014	This was now the third time Jesus showed himself to his followers after he was raised from the dead .
43021015	When they finished eating , Jesus said to Simon Peter , “ Simon son of John , do you love me more than these ? ” He answered , “ Yes , Lord , you know that I love you . ” Jesus said , “ Feed my lambs . ”
43021016	Again Jesus said , “ Simon son of John , do you love me ? ” He answered , “ Yes , Lord , you know that I love you . ” Jesus said , “ Take care of my sheep . ”
43021017	A third time he said , “ Simon son of John , do you love me ? ” Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time , “ Do you love me ? ” Peter said , “ Lord , you know everything ; you know that I love you ! ” He said to him , “ Feed my sheep .
43021018	I tell you the truth , when you were younger , you tied your own belt and went where you wanted . But when you are old , you will put out your hands and someone else will tie you and take you where you don’t want to go . ”
43021019	( Jesus said this to show how Peter would die to give glory to God . ) Then Jesus said to Peter , “ Follow me ! ”
43021020	Peter turned and saw that the follower Jesus loved was walking behind them . ( This was the follower who had leaned against Jesus at the supper and had said , “ Lord , who will turn against you ? ” )
43021021	When Peter saw him behind them , he asked Jesus , “ Lord , what about him ? ”
43021022	Jesus answered , “ If I want him to live until I come back , that is not your business . You follow me . ”
43021023	So a story spread among the followers that this one would not die . But Jesus did not say he would not die . He only said , “ If I want him to live until I come back , that is not your business . ”
43021024	That follower is the one who is telling these things and who has now written them down . We know that what he says is true .
43021025	There are many other things Jesus did . If every one of them were written down , I suppose the whole world would not be big enough for all the books that would be written .
44001001	To Theophilus . The first book I wrote was about everything Jesus began to do and teach
44001002	until the day he was taken up into heaven . Before this , with the help of the Holy Spirit , Jesus told the apostles he had chosen what they should do .
44001003	After his death , he showed himself to them and proved in many ways that he was alive . The apostles saw Jesus during the forty days after he was raised from the dead , and he spoke to them about the kingdom of God .
44001004	Once when he was eating with them , he told them not to leave Jerusalem . He said , “ Wait here to receive the promise from the Father which I told you about .
44001005	John baptized people with water , but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit . ”
44001006	When the apostles were all together , they asked Jesus , “ Lord , are you now going to give the kingdom back to Israel ? ”
44001007	Jesus said to them , “ The Father is the only One who has the authority to decide dates and times . These things are not for you to know .
44001008	But when the Holy Spirit comes to you , you will receive power . You will be my witnesses — in Jerusalem , in all of Judea , in Samaria , and in every part of the world . ”
44001009	After he said this , as they were watching , he was lifted up , and a cloud hid him from their sight .
44001010	As he was going , they were looking into the sky . Suddenly , two men wearing white clothes stood beside them .
44001011	They said , “ Men of Galilee , why are you standing here looking into the sky ? Jesus , whom you saw taken up from you into heaven , will come back in the same way you saw him go . ”
44001012	Then they went back to Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives . ( This mountain is about half a mile from Jerusalem . )
44001013	When they entered the city , they went to the upstairs room where they were staying . Peter , John , James , Andrew , Philip , Thomas , Bartholomew , Matthew , James son of Alphaeus , Simon ( known as the Zealot ) , and Judas son of James were there .
44001014	They all continued praying together with some women , including Mary the mother of Jesus , and Jesus’ brothers .
44001015	During this time there was a meeting of the believers ( about one hundred twenty of them ) . Peter stood up and said ,
44001018	( Judas bought a field with the money he got for his evil act . But he fell to his death , his body burst open , and all his intestines poured out .
44001019	Everyone in Jerusalem learned about this so they named this place Akeldama . In their language Akeldama means “ Field of Blood . ” )
44001020	“ In the Book of Psalms , ” Peter said , “ this is written : ‘ May his place be empty ; leave no one to live in it . ’ And it is also written : ‘ Let another man replace him as leader . ’
44001023	They put the names of two men before the group . One was Joseph Barsabbas , who was also called Justus . The other was Matthias .
44001026	Then they used lots to choose between them , and the lots showed that Matthias was the one . So he became an apostle with the other eleven .
44002001	When the day of Pentecost came , they were all together in one place .
44002002	Suddenly a noise like a strong , blowing wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting .
44002003	They saw something like flames of fire that were separated and stood over each person there .
44002004	They were all filled with the Holy Spirit , and they began to speak different languages by the power the Holy Spirit was giving them .
44002005	There were some religious Jews staying in Jerusalem who were from every country in the world .
44002006	When they heard this noise , a crowd came together . They were all surprised , because each one heard them speaking in his own language .
44002007	They were completely amazed at this . They said , “ Look ! Aren’t all these people that we hear speaking from Galilee ?
44002008	Then how is it possible that we each hear them in our own languages ? We are from different places :
44002009	Parthia , Media , Elam , Mesopotamia , Judea , Cappadocia , Pontus , Asia ,
44002010	Phrygia , Pamphylia , Egypt , the areas of Libya near Cyrene , Rome
44002011	( both Jews and those who had become Jews ) , Crete , and Arabia . But we hear them telling in our own languages about the great things God has done ! ”
44002012	They were all amazed and confused , asking each other , “ What does this mean ? ”
44002013	But others were making fun of them , saying , “ They have had too much wine . ”
44002014	But Peter stood up with the eleven apostles , and in a loud voice he spoke to the crowd : “ My fellow Jews , and all of you who are in Jerusalem , listen to me . Pay attention to what I have to say .
44002015	These people are not drunk , as you think ; it is only nine o’clock in the morning !
44002016	But Joel the prophet wrote about what is happening here today :
44002017	‘ God says : In the last days I will pour out my Spirit on all kinds of people . Your sons and daughters will prophesy . Your young men will see visions , and your old men will dream dreams .
44002018	At that time I will pour out my Spirit also on my male slaves and female slaves , and they will prophesy .
44002019	I will show miracles in the sky and on the earth : blood , fire , and thick smoke .
44002020	The sun will become dark , the moon red as blood , before the overwhelming and glorious day of the Lord will come .
44002021	Then anyone who calls on the Lord will be saved . ’
44002022	“ People of Israel , listen to these words : Jesus from Nazareth was a very special man . God clearly showed this to you by the miracles , wonders , and signs he did through Jesus . You all know this , because it happened right here among you .
44002023	Jesus was given to you , and with the help of those who don’t know the law , you put him to death by nailing him to a cross . But this was God’s plan which he had made long ago ; he knew all this would happen .
44002024	God raised Jesus from the dead and set him free from the pain of death , because death could not hold him .
44002025	For David said this about him : ‘ I keep the Lord before me always . Because he is close by my side , I will not be hurt .
44002026	So I am glad , and I rejoice . Even my body has hope ,
44002027	because you will not leave me in the grave . You will not let your Holy One rot .
44002028	You will teach me how to live a holy life . Being with you will fill me with joy . ’
44002029	“ Brothers and sisters , I can tell you truly that David , our ancestor , died and was buried . His grave is still here with us today .
44002030	He was a prophet and knew God had promised him that he would make a person from David’s family a king just as he was .
44002031	Knowing this before it happened , David talked about the Christ rising from the dead . He said : ‘ He was not left in the grave . His body did not rot . ’
44002032	So Jesus is the One whom God raised from the dead . And we are all witnesses to this .
44002033	Jesus was lifted up to heaven and is now at God’s right side . The Father has given the Holy Spirit to Jesus as he promised . So Jesus has poured out that Spirit , and this is what you now see and hear .
44002034	David was not the one who was lifted up to heaven , but he said : ‘ The Lord said to my Lord , “ Sit by me at my right side ,
44002035	until I put your enemies under your control . ” ’
44002036	“ So , all the people of Israel should know this truly : God has made Jesus — the man you nailed to the cross — both Lord and Christ . ”
44002037	When the people heard this , they felt guilty and asked Peter and the other apostles , “ What shall we do ? ”
44002038	Peter said to them , “ Change your hearts and lives and be baptized , each one of you , in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins . And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit .
44002039	This promise is for you , for your children , and for all who are far away . It is for everyone the Lord our God calls to himself . ”
44002040	Peter warned them with many other words . He begged them , “ Save yourselves from the evil of today’s people ! ”
44002041	Then those people who accepted what Peter said were baptized . About three thousand people were added to the number of believers that day .
44002042	They spent their time learning the apostles’ teaching , sharing , breaking bread , and praying together .
44002043	The apostles were doing many miracles and signs , and everyone felt great respect for God .
44002044	All the believers were together and shared everything .
44002045	They would sell their land and the things they owned and then divide the money and give it to anyone who needed it .
44002046	The believers met together in the Temple every day . They ate together in their homes , happy to share their food with joyful hearts .
44002047	They praised God and were liked by all the people . Every day the Lord added those who were being saved to the group of believers .
44003001	One day Peter and John went to the Temple at three o’clock , the time set each day for the afternoon prayer service .
44003002	There , at the Temple gate called Beautiful Gate , was a man who had been crippled all his life . Every day he was carried to this gate to beg for money from the people going into the Temple .
44003003	The man saw Peter and John going into the Temple and asked them for money .
44003004	Peter and John looked straight at him and said , “ Look at us ! ”
44003005	The man looked at them , thinking they were going to give him some money .
44003006	But Peter said , “ I don’t have any silver or gold , but I do have something else I can give you . By the power of Jesus Christ from Nazareth , stand up and walk ! ”
44003007	Then Peter took the man’s right hand and lifted him up . Immediately the man’s feet and ankles became strong .
44003008	He jumped up , stood on his feet , and began to walk . He went into the Temple with them , walking and jumping and praising God .
44003011	While the man was holding on to Peter and John , all the people were amazed and ran to them at Solomon’s Porch .
44003012	When Peter saw this , he said to them , “ People of Israel , why are you surprised ? You are looking at us as if it were our own power or goodness that made this man walk .
44003013	The God of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , the God of our ancestors , gave glory to Jesus , his servant . But you handed him over to be killed . Pilate decided to let him go free , but you told Pilate you did not want Jesus .
44003014	You did not want the One who is holy and good but asked Pilate to give you a murderer instead .
44003015	And so you killed the One who gives life , but God raised him from the dead . We are witnesses to this .
44003016	It was faith in Jesus that made this crippled man well . You can see this man , and you know him . He was made completely well because of trust in Jesus , and you all saw it happen !
44003017	“ Brothers and sisters , I know you did those things to Jesus because neither you nor your leaders understood what you were doing .
44003018	God said through the prophets that his Christ would suffer and die . And now God has made these things come true in this way .
44003019	So you must change your hearts and lives ! Come back to God , and he will forgive your sins . Then the Lord will send the time of rest .
44003020	And he will send Jesus , the One he chose to be the Christ .
44003021	But Jesus must stay in heaven until the time comes when all things will be made right again . God told about this time long ago when he spoke through his holy prophets .
44003022	Moses said , ‘ The Lord your God will give you a prophet like me , who is one of your own people . You must listen to everything he tells you .
44003023	Anyone who does not listen to that prophet will die , cut off from God’s people . ’
44003024	Samuel , and all the other prophets who spoke for God after Samuel , told about this time now .
44003025	You are descendants of the prophets . You have received the agreement God made with your ancestors . He said to your father Abraham , ‘ Through your descendants all the nations on the earth will be blessed . ’
44003026	God has raised up his servant Jesus and sent him to you first to bless you by turning each of you away from doing evil . ”
44004001	While Peter and John were speaking to the people , priests , the captain of the soldiers that guarded the Temple , and Sadducees came up to them .
44004002	They were upset because the two apostles were teaching the people and were preaching that people will rise from the dead through the power of Jesus .
44004003	The older leaders grabbed Peter and John and put them in jail . Since it was already night , they kept them in jail until the next day .
44004004	But many of those who had heard Peter and John preach believed the things they said . There were now about five thousand in the group of believers .
44004005	The next day the rulers , the elders , and the teachers of the law met in Jerusalem .
44004006	Annas the high priest , Caiaphas , John , and Alexander were there , as well as everyone from the high priest’s family .
44004007	They made Peter and John stand before them and then asked them , “ By what power or authority did you do this ? ”
44004008	Then Peter , filled with the Holy Spirit , said to them , “ Rulers of the people and you elders ,
44004009	are you questioning us about a good thing that was done to a crippled man ? Are you asking us who made him well ?
44004010	We want all of you and all the people to know that this man was made well by the power of Jesus Christ from Nazareth . You crucified him , but God raised him from the dead . This man was crippled , but he is now well and able to stand here before you because of the power of Jesus .
44004011	Jesus is ‘ the stone that you builders rejected , which has become the cornerstone . ’
44004012	Jesus is the only One who can save people . No one else in the world is able to save us . ”
44004013	The leaders saw that Peter and John were not afraid to speak , and they understood that these men had no special training or education . So they were amazed . Then they realized that Peter and John had been with Jesus .
44004014	Because they saw the healed man standing there beside the two apostles , they could say nothing against them .
44004015	After the leaders ordered them to leave the meeting , they began to talk to each other .
44004016	They said , “ What shall we do with these men ? Everyone in Jerusalem knows they have done a great miracle , and we cannot say it is not true .
44004017	But to keep it from spreading among the people , we must warn them not to talk to people anymore using that name . ”
44004018	So they called Peter and John in again and told them not to speak or to teach at all in the name of Jesus .
44004019	But Peter and John answered them , “ You decide what God would want . Should we obey you or God ?
44004020	We cannot keep quiet . We must speak about what we have seen and heard . ”
44004021	The leaders warned the apostles again and let them go free . They could not find a way to punish them , because all the people were praising God for what had been done .
44004022	The man who received the miracle of healing was more than forty years old .
44004023	After Peter and John left the meeting of leaders , they went to their own group and told them everything the leading priests and the elders had said to them .
44004024	When the believers heard this , they prayed to God together , “ Lord , you are the One who made the sky , the earth , the sea , and everything in them .
44004025	By the Holy Spirit , through our father David your servant , you said : ‘ Why are the nations so angry ? Why are the people making useless plans ?
44004026	The kings of the earth prepare to fight , and their leaders make plans together against the Lord and his Christ . ’
44004027	These things really happened when Herod , Pontius Pilate , and some Jews and non-Jews all came together against Jesus here in Jerusalem . Jesus is your holy servant , the One you made to be the Christ .
44004028	These people made your plan happen because of your power and your will .
44004029	And now , Lord , listen to their threats . Lord , help us , your servants , to speak your word without fear .
44004030	Show us your power to heal . Give proofs and make miracles happen by the power of Jesus , your holy servant . ”
44004031	After they had prayed , the place where they were meeting was shaken . They were all filled with the Holy Spirit , and they spoke God’s word without fear .
44004032	The group of believers were united in their hearts and spirit . All those in the group acted as though their private property belonged to everyone in the group . In fact , they shared everything .
44004033	With great power the apostles were telling people that the Lord Jesus was truly raised from the dead . And God blessed all the believers very much .
44004034	There were no needy people among them . From time to time those who owned fields or houses sold them , brought the money ,
44004035	and gave it to the apostles . Then the money was given to anyone who needed it .
44004036	One of the believers was named Joseph , a Levite born in Cyprus . The apostles called him Barnabas ( which means “ one who encourages ” ) .
44004037	Joseph owned a field , sold it , brought the money , and gave it to the apostles .
44005001	But a man named Ananias and his wife Sapphira sold some land .
44005002	He kept back part of the money for himself ; his wife knew about this and agreed to it . But he brought the rest of the money and gave it to the apostles .
44005003	Peter said , “ Ananias , why did you let Satan rule your thoughts to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep for yourself part of the money you received for the land ?
44005004	Before you sold the land , it belonged to you . And even after you sold it , you could have used the money any way you wanted . Why did you think of doing this ? You lied to God , not to us ! ”
44005007	About three hours later his wife came in , but she did not know what had happened .
44005008	Peter said to her , “ Tell me , was the money you got for your field this much ? ” Sapphira answered , “ Yes , that was the price . ”
44005009	Peter said to her , “ Why did you and your husband agree to test the Spirit of the Lord ? Look ! The men who buried your husband are at the door , and they will carry you out . ”
44005010	At that moment Sapphira fell down by his feet and died . When the young men came in and saw that she was dead , they carried her out and buried her beside her husband .
44005011	The whole church and all the others who heard about these things were filled with fear .
44005012	The apostles did many signs and miracles among the people . And they would all meet together on Solomon’s Porch .
44005013	None of the others dared to join them , but all the people respected them .
44005014	More and more men and women believed in the Lord and were added to the group of believers .
44005015	The people placed their sick on beds and mats in the streets , hoping that when Peter passed by at least his shadow might fall on them .
44005016	Crowds came from all the towns around Jerusalem , bringing their sick and those who were bothered by evil spirits , and all of them were healed .
44005017	The high priest and all his friends ( a group called the Sadducees ) became very jealous .
44005018	They took the apostles and put them in jail .
44005019	But during the night , an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the jail and led the apostles outside . The angel said ,
44005020	“ Go stand in the Temple and tell the people everything about this new life . ”
44005021	When the apostles heard this , they obeyed and went into the Temple early in the morning and continued teaching . When the high priest and his friends arrived , they called a meeting of the leaders and all the important elders . They sent some men to the jail to bring the apostles to them .
44005022	But , upon arriving , the officers could not find the apostles . So they went back and reported to the leaders .
44005023	They said , “ The jail was closed and locked , and the guards were standing at the doors . But when we opened the doors , the jail was empty ! ”
44005024	Hearing this , the captain of the Temple guards and the leading priests were confused and wondered what was happening .
44005025	Then someone came and told them , “ Listen ! The men you put in jail are standing in the Temple teaching the people . ”
44005026	Then the captain and his men went out and brought the apostles back . But the soldiers did not use force , because they were afraid the people would stone them to death .
44005027	The soldiers brought the apostles to the meeting and made them stand before the leaders . The high priest questioned them ,
44005028	saying , “ We gave you strict orders not to continue teaching in that name . But look , you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are trying to make us responsible for this man’s death . ”
44005029	Peter and the other apostles answered , “ We must obey God , not human authority !
44005030	You killed Jesus by hanging him on a cross . But God , the God of our ancestors , raised Jesus up from the dead !
44005031	Jesus is the One whom God raised to be on his right side , as Leader and Savior . Through him , all people could change their hearts and lives and have their sins forgiven .
44005032	We saw all these things happen . The Holy Spirit , whom God has given to all who obey him , also proves these things are true . ”
44005033	When the leaders heard this , they became angry and wanted to kill them .
44005034	But a Pharisee named Gamaliel stood up in the meeting . He was a teacher of the law , and all the people respected him . He ordered the apostles to leave the meeting for a little while .
44005035	Then he said , “ People of Israel , be careful what you are planning to do to these men .
44005036	Remember when Theudas appeared ? He said he was a great man , and about four hundred men joined him . But he was killed , and all his followers were scattered ; they were able to do nothing .
44005037	Later , a man named Judas came from Galilee at the time of the registration . He also led a group of followers and was killed , and all his followers were scattered .
44005038	And so now I tell you : Stay away from these men , and leave them alone . If their plan comes from human authority , it will fail .
44005039	But if it is from God , you will not be able to stop them . You might even be fighting against God himself ! ” The leaders agreed with what Gamaliel said .
44005040	They called the apostles in , beat them , and told them not to speak in the name of Jesus again . Then they let them go free .
44005041	The apostles left the meeting full of joy because they were given the honor of suffering disgrace for Jesus .
44005042	Every day in the Temple and in people’s homes they continued teaching the people and telling the Good News — that Jesus is the Christ .
44006001	The number of followers was growing . But during this same time , the Greek-speaking followers had an argument with the other followers . The Greek-speaking widows were not getting their share of the food that was given out every day .
44006002	The twelve apostles called the whole group of followers together and said , “ It is not right for us to stop our work of teaching God’s word in order to serve tables .
44006003	So , brothers and sisters , choose seven of your own men who are good , full of the Spirit and full of wisdom . We will put them in charge of this work .
44006004	Then we can continue to pray and to teach the word of God . ”
44006005	The whole group liked the idea , so they chose these seven men : Stephen ( a man with great faith and full of the Holy Spirit ) , Philip , Procorus , Nicanor , Timon , Parmenas , and Nicolas ( a man from Antioch who had become a follower of the Jewish religion ) .
44006006	Then they put these men before the apostles , who prayed and laid their hands on them .
44006007	The word of God was continuing to spread . The group of followers in Jerusalem increased , and a great number of the Jewish priests believed and obeyed .
44006008	Stephen was richly blessed by God who gave him the power to do great miracles and signs among the people .
44006009	But some people were against him . They belonged to the synagogue of Free Men ( as it was called ) , which included people from Cyrene , Alexandria , Cilicia , and Asia . They all came and argued with Stephen .
44006010	But the Spirit was helping him to speak with wisdom , and his words were so strong that they could not argue with him .
44006011	So they secretly urged some men to say , “ We heard Stephen speak against Moses and against God . ”
44006012	This upset the people , the elders , and the teachers of the law . They came and grabbed Stephen and brought him to a meeting of the leaders .
44006013	They brought in some people to tell lies about Stephen , saying , “ This man is always speaking against this holy place and the law of Moses .
44006014	We heard him say that Jesus from Nazareth will destroy this place and that Jesus will change the customs Moses gave us . ”
44006015	All the people in the meeting were watching Stephen closely and saw that his face looked like the face of an angel .
44007001	The high priest said to Stephen , “ Are these things true ? ”
44007002	Stephen answered , “ Brothers and fathers , listen to me . Our glorious God appeared to Abraham , our ancestor , in Mesopotamia before he lived in Haran .
44007003	God said to Abraham , ‘ Leave your country and your relatives , and go to the land I will show you . ’
44007004	So Abraham left the country of Chaldea and went to live in Haran . After Abraham’s father died , God sent him to this place where you now live .
44007005	God did not give Abraham any of this land , not even a foot of it . But God promised that he would give this land to him and his descendants , even before Abraham had a child .
44007006	This is what God said to him : ‘ Your descendants will be strangers in a land they don’t own . The people there will make them slaves and will mistreat them for four hundred years .
44007007	But I will punish the nation where they are slaves . Then your descendants will leave that land and will worship me in this place . ’
44007008	God made an agreement with Abraham , the sign of which was circumcision . And so when Abraham had his son Isaac , Abraham circumcised him when he was eight days old . Isaac also circumcised his son Jacob , and Jacob did the same for his sons , the twelve ancestors of our people .
44007009	“ Jacob’s sons became jealous of Joseph and sold him to be a slave in Egypt . But God was with him
44007010	and saved him from all his troubles . The king of Egypt liked Joseph and respected him because of the wisdom God gave him . The king made him governor of Egypt and put him in charge of all the people in his palace .
44007011	“ Then all the land of Egypt and Canaan became so dry that nothing would grow , and the people suffered very much . Jacob’s sons , our ancestors , could not find anything to eat .
44007012	But when Jacob heard there was grain in Egypt , he sent his sons there . This was their first trip to Egypt .
44007013	When they went there a second time , Joseph told his brothers who he was , and the king learned about Joseph’s family .
44007014	Then Joseph sent messengers to invite Jacob , his father , to come to Egypt along with all his relatives ( seventy-five persons altogether ) .
44007015	So Jacob went down to Egypt , where he and his sons died .
44007016	Later their bodies were moved to Shechem and put in a grave there . ( It was the same grave Abraham had bought for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor in Shechem . )
44007017	“ The promise God made to Abraham was soon to come true , and the number of people in Egypt grew large .
44007018	Then a new king , who did not know who Joseph was , began to rule Egypt .
44007019	This king tricked our people and was cruel to our ancestors , forcing them to leave their babies outside to die .
44007020	At this time Moses was born , and he was very beautiful . For three months Moses was cared for in his father’s house .
44007021	When they put Moses outside , the king’s daughter adopted him and raised him as if he were her own son .
44007022	The Egyptians taught Moses everything they knew , and he was a powerful man in what he said and did .
44007023	“ When Moses was about forty years old , he thought it would be good to visit his own people , the people of Israel .
44007024	Moses saw an Egyptian mistreating one of his people , so he defended the Israelite and punished the Egyptian by killing him .
44007025	Moses thought his own people would understand that God was using him to save them , but they did not .
44007026	The next day when Moses saw two men of Israel fighting , he tried to make peace between them . He said , ‘ Men , you are brothers . Why are you hurting each other ? ’
44007027	The man who was hurting the other pushed Moses away and said , ‘ Who made you our ruler and judge ?
44007028	Are you going to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday ? ’
44007029	When Moses heard him say this , he left Egypt and went to live in the land of Midian where he was a stranger . While Moses lived in Midian , he had two sons .
44007030	“ Forty years later an angel appeared to Moses in the flames of a burning bush as he was in the desert near Mount Sinai .
44007031	When Moses saw this , he was amazed and went near to look closer . Moses heard the Lord’s voice say ,
44007032	‘ I am the God of your ancestors , the God of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . ’ Moses began to shake with fear and was afraid to look .
44007033	The Lord said to him , ‘ Take off your sandals , because you are standing on holy ground .
44007034	I have seen the troubles my people have suffered in Egypt . I have heard their cries and have come down to save them . And now , Moses , I am sending you back to Egypt . ’
44007035	“ This Moses was the same man the two men of Israel rejected , saying , ‘ Who made you a ruler and judge ? ’ Moses is the same man God sent to be a ruler and savior , with the help of the angel that Moses saw in the burning bush .
44007036	So Moses led the people out of Egypt . He worked miracles and signs in Egypt , at the Red Sea , and then in the desert for forty years .
44007037	This is the same Moses that said to the people of Israel , ‘ God will give you a prophet like me , who is one of your own people . ’
44007038	This is the Moses who was with the gathering of the Israelites in the desert . He was with the angel that spoke to him at Mount Sinai , and he was with our ancestors . He received commands from God that give life , and he gave those commands to us .
44007039	“ But our ancestors did not want to obey Moses . They rejected him and wanted to go back to Egypt .
44007040	They said to Aaron , ‘ Make us gods who will lead us . Moses led us out of Egypt , but we don’t know what has happened to him . ’
44007041	So the people made an idol that looked like a calf . Then they brought sacrifices to it and were proud of what they had made with their own hands .
44007042	But God turned against them and did not try to stop them from worshiping the sun , moon , and stars . This is what is written in the book of the prophets : God says , ‘ People of Israel , you did not bring me sacrifices and offerings while you traveled in the desert for forty years .
44007043	You have carried with you the tent to worship Molech and the idols of the star god Rephan that you made to worship . So I will send you away beyond Babylon . ’
44007044	“ The Holy Tent where God spoke to our ancestors was with them in the desert . God told Moses how to make this Tent , and he made it like the plan God showed him .
44007045	Later , Joshua led our ancestors to capture the lands of the other nations . Our people went in , and God forced the other people out . When our people went into this new land , they took with them this same Tent they had received from their ancestors . They kept it until the time of David ,
44007046	who pleased God and asked God to let him build a house for him , the God of Jacob .
44007047	But Solomon was the one who built the Temple .
44007048	“ But the Most High does not live in houses that people build with their hands . As the prophet says :
44007049	‘ Heaven is my throne , and the earth is my footstool . So do you think you can build a house for me ? says the Lord . Do I need a place to rest ?
44007050	Remember , my hand made all these things ! ’ ”
44007051	Stephen continued speaking : “ You stubborn people ! You have not given your hearts to God , nor will you listen to him ! You are always against what the Holy Spirit is trying to tell you , just as your ancestors were .
44007052	Your ancestors tried to hurt every prophet who ever lived . Those prophets said long ago that the One who is good would come , but your ancestors killed them . And now you have turned against and killed the One who is good .
44007053	You received the law of Moses , which God gave you through his angels , but you haven’t obeyed it . ”
44007054	When the leaders heard this , they became furious . They were so mad they were grinding their teeth at Stephen .
44007055	But Stephen was full of the Holy Spirit . He looked up to heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at God’s right side .
44007056	He said , “ Look ! I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at God’s right side . ”
44007057	Then they shouted loudly and covered their ears and all ran at Stephen .
44007058	They took him out of the city and began to throw stones at him to kill him . And those who told lies against Stephen left their coats with a young man named Saul .
44007059	While they were throwing stones , Stephen prayed , “ Lord Jesus , receive my spirit . ”
44007060	He fell on his knees and cried in a loud voice , “ Lord , do not hold this sin against them . ” After Stephen said this , he died .
44008001	Saul agreed that the killing of Stephen was good . On that day the church of Jerusalem began to be persecuted , and all the believers , except the apostles , were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria .
44008002	And some religious people buried Stephen and cried loudly for him .
44008003	Saul was also trying to destroy the church , going from house to house , dragging out men and women and putting them in jail .
44008004	And wherever they were scattered , they told people the Good News .
44008005	Philip went to the city of Samaria and preached about the Christ .
44008006	When the people there heard Philip and saw the miracles he was doing , they all listened carefully to what he said .
44008007	Many of these people had evil spirits in them , but Philip made the evil spirits leave . The spirits made a loud noise when they came out . Philip also healed many weak and crippled people there .
44008008	So the people in that city were very happy .
44008009	But there was a man named Simon in that city . Before Philip came there , Simon had practiced magic and amazed all the people of Samaria . He bragged and called himself a great man .
44008010	All the people — the least important and the most important — paid attention to Simon , saying , “ This man has the power of God , called ‘ the Great Power ’ ! ”
44008011	Simon had amazed them with his magic so long that the people became his followers .
44008012	But when Philip told them the Good News about the kingdom of God and the power of Jesus Christ , men and women believed Philip and were baptized .
44008013	Simon himself believed , and after he was baptized , he stayed very close to Philip . When he saw the miracles and the powerful things Philip did , Simon was amazed .
44008014	When the apostles who were still in Jerusalem heard that the people of Samaria had accepted the word of God , they sent Peter and John to them .
44008015	When Peter and John arrived , they prayed that the Samaritan believers might receive the Holy Spirit .
44008016	These people had been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus , but the Holy Spirit had not yet come upon any of them .
44008017	Then , when the two apostles began laying their hands on the people , they received the Holy Spirit .
44008018	Simon saw that the Spirit was given to people when the apostles laid their hands on them . So he offered the apostles money ,
44008019	saying , “ Give me also this power so that anyone on whom I lay my hands will receive the Holy Spirit . ”
44008020	Peter said to him , “ You and your money should both be destroyed , because you thought you could buy God’s gift with money .
44008021	You cannot share with us in this work since your heart is not right before God .
44008022	Change your heart ! Turn away from this evil thing you have done , and pray to the Lord . Maybe he will forgive you for thinking this .
44008023	I see that you are full of bitter jealousy and ruled by sin . ”
44008024	Simon answered , “ Both of you pray for me to the Lord so the things you have said will not happen to me . ”
44008025	After Peter and John told the people what they had seen Jesus do and after they had spoken the message of the Lord , they went back to Jerusalem . On the way , they went through many Samaritan towns and preached the Good News to the people .
44008026	An angel of the Lord said to Philip , “ Get ready and go south to the road that leads down to Gaza from Jerusalem — the desert road . ”
44008027	So Philip got ready and went . On the road he saw a man from Ethiopia , a eunuch . He was an important officer in the service of Candace , the queen of the Ethiopians ; he was responsible for taking care of all her money . He had gone to Jerusalem to worship .
44008028	Now , as he was on his way home , he was sitting in his chariot reading from the Book of Isaiah , the prophet .
44008029	The Spirit said to Philip , “ Go to that chariot and stay near it . ”
44008030	So when Philip ran toward the chariot , he heard the man reading from Isaiah the prophet . Philip asked , “ Do you understand what you are reading ? ”
44008031	He answered , “ How can I understand unless someone explains it to me ? ” Then he invited Philip to climb in and sit with him .
44008032	The portion of Scripture he was reading was this : “ He was like a sheep being led to be killed . He was quiet , as a lamb is quiet while its wool is being cut ; he never opened his mouth .
44008033	He was shamed and was treated unfairly . He died without children to continue his family . His life on earth has ended . ”
44008034	The officer said to Philip , “ Please tell me , who is the prophet talking about — himself or someone else ? ”
44008035	Philip began to speak , and starting with this same Scripture , he told the man the Good News about Jesus .
44008036	While they were traveling down the road , they came to some water . The officer said , “ Look , here is water . What is stopping me from being baptized ? ” [
44008037	Philip answered , “ If you believe with all your heart , you can . ” The officer said , “ I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God . ” ]
44008038	Then the officer commanded the chariot to stop . Both Philip and the officer went down into the water , and Philip baptized him .
44008039	When they came up out of the water , the Spirit of the Lord took Philip away ; the officer never saw him again . And the officer continued on his way home , full of joy .
44008040	But Philip appeared in a city called Azotus and preached the Good News in all the towns on the way from Azotus to Caesarea .
44009001	In Jerusalem Saul was still threatening the followers of the Lord by saying he would kill them . So he went to the high priest
44009002	and asked him to write letters to the synagogues in the city of Damascus . Then if Saul found any followers of Christ’s Way , men or women , he would arrest them and bring them back to Jerusalem .
44009003	So Saul headed toward Damascus . As he came near the city , a bright light from heaven suddenly flashed around him .
44009004	Saul fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him , “ Saul , Saul ! Why are you persecuting me ? ”
44009005	Saul said , “ Who are you , Lord ? ” The voice answered , “ I am Jesus , whom you are persecuting .
44009006	Get up now and go into the city . Someone there will tell you what you must do . ”
44009007	The people traveling with Saul stood there but said nothing . They heard the voice , but they saw no one .
44009008	Saul got up from the ground and opened his eyes , but he could not see . So those with Saul took his hand and led him into Damascus .
44009009	For three days Saul could not see and did not eat or drink .
44009010	There was a follower of Jesus in Damascus named Ananias . The Lord spoke to Ananias in a vision , “ Ananias ! ” Ananias answered , “ Here I am , Lord . ”
44009011	The Lord said to him , “ Get up and go to Straight Street . Find the house of Judas , and ask for a man named Saul from the city of Tarsus . He is there now , praying .
44009012	Saul has seen a vision in which a man named Ananias comes to him and lays his hands on him . Then he is able to see again . ”
44009013	But Ananias answered , “ Lord , many people have told me about this man and the terrible things he did to your holy people in Jerusalem .
44009014	Now he has come here to Damascus , and the leading priests have given him the power to arrest everyone who worships you . ”
44009015	But the Lord said to Ananias , “ Go ! I have chosen Saul for an important work . He must tell about me to those who are not Jews , to kings , and to the people of Israel .
44009016	I will show him how much he must suffer for my name . ”
44009017	So Ananias went to the house of Judas . He laid his hands on Saul and said , “ Brother Saul , the Lord Jesus sent me . He is the one you saw on the road on your way here . He sent me so that you can see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit . ”
44009018	Immediately , something that looked like fish scales fell from Saul’s eyes , and he was able to see again ! Then Saul got up and was baptized .
44009019	After he ate some food , his strength returned . Saul stayed with the followers of Jesus in Damascus for a few days .
44009020	Soon he began to preach about Jesus in the synagogues , saying , “ Jesus is the Son of God . ”
44009021	All the people who heard him were amazed . They said , “ This is the man who was in Jerusalem trying to destroy those who trust in this name ! He came here to arrest the followers of Jesus and take them back to the leading priests . ”
44009022	But Saul grew more powerful . His proofs that Jesus is the Christ were so strong that his own people in Damascus could not argue with him .
44009023	After many days , they made plans to kill Saul .
44009024	They were watching the city gates day and night , but Saul learned about their plan .
44009025	One night some followers of Saul helped him leave the city by lowering him in a basket through an opening in the city wall .
44009026	When Saul went to Jerusalem , he tried to join the group of followers , but they were all afraid of him . They did not believe he was really a follower .
44009027	But Barnabas accepted Saul and took him to the apostles . Barnabas explained to them that Saul had seen the Lord on the road and the Lord had spoken to Saul . Then he told them how boldly Saul had preached in the name of Jesus in Damascus .
44009028	And so Saul stayed with the followers , going everywhere in Jerusalem , preaching boldly in the name of the Lord .
44009029	He would often talk and argue with the Jewish people who spoke Greek , but they were trying to kill him .
44009030	When the followers learned about this , they took Saul to Caesarea and from there sent him to Tarsus .
44009031	The church everywhere in Judea , Galilee , and Samaria had a time of peace and became stronger . Respecting the Lord by the way they lived , and being encouraged by the Holy Spirit , the group of believers continued to grow .
44009032	As Peter was traveling through all the area , he visited God’s people who lived in Lydda .
44009033	There he met a man named Aeneas , who was paralyzed and had not been able to leave his bed for the past eight years .
44009034	Peter said to him , “ Aeneas , Jesus Christ heals you . Stand up and make your bed . ” Aeneas stood up immediately .
44009035	All the people living in Lydda and on the Plain of Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord .
44009036	In the city of Joppa there was a follower named Tabitha ( whose Greek name was Dorcas ) . She was always doing good deeds and kind acts .
44009037	While Peter was in Lydda , Tabitha became sick and died . Her body was washed and put in a room upstairs .
44009038	Since Lydda is near Joppa and the followers in Joppa heard that Peter was in Lydda , they sent two messengers to Peter . They begged him , “ Hurry , please come to us ! ”
44009039	So Peter got ready and went with them . When he arrived , they took him to the upstairs room where all the widows stood around Peter , crying . They showed him the shirts and coats Tabitha had made when she was still alive .
44009040	Peter sent everyone out of the room and kneeled and prayed . Then he turned to the body and said , “ Tabitha , stand up . ” She opened her eyes , and when she saw Peter , she sat up .
44009041	He gave her his hand and helped her up . Then he called the saints and the widows into the room and showed them that Tabitha was alive .
44009042	People everywhere in Joppa learned about this , and many believed in the Lord .
44009043	Peter stayed in Joppa for many days with a man named Simon who was a tanner .
44010001	At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius , an officer in the Italian group of the Roman army .
44010002	Cornelius was a religious man . He and all the other people who lived in his house worshiped the true God . He gave much of his money to the poor and prayed to God often .
44010003	One afternoon about three o’clock , Cornelius clearly saw a vision . An angel of God came to him and said , “ Cornelius ! ”
44010004	Cornelius stared at the angel . He became afraid and said , “ What do you want , Lord ? ” The angel said , “ God has heard your prayers . He has seen that you give to the poor , and he remembers you .
44010005	Send some men now to Joppa to bring back a man named Simon who is also called Peter .
44010006	He is staying with a man , also named Simon , who is a tanner and has a house beside the sea . ”
44010007	When the angel who spoke to Cornelius left , Cornelius called two of his servants and a soldier , a religious man who worked for him .
44010008	Cornelius explained everything to them and sent them to Joppa .
44010009	About noon the next day as they came near Joppa , Peter was going up to the roof to pray .
44010010	He was hungry and wanted to eat , but while the food was being prepared , he had a vision .
44010011	He saw heaven opened and something coming down that looked like a big sheet being lowered to earth by its four corners .
44010012	In it were all kinds of animals , reptiles , and birds .
44010013	Then a voice said to Peter , “ Get up , Peter ; kill and eat . ”
44010014	But Peter said , “ No , Lord ! I have never eaten food that is unholy or unclean . ”
44010015	But the voice said to him again , “ God has made these things clean , so don’t call them unholy ! ”
44010016	This happened three times , and at once the sheet was taken back to heaven .
44010017	While Peter was wondering what this vision meant , the men Cornelius sent had found Simon’s house and were standing at the gate .
44010018	They asked , “ Is Simon Peter staying here ? ”
44010019	While Peter was still thinking about the vision , the Spirit said to him , “ Listen , three men are looking for you .
44010020	Get up and go downstairs . Go with them without doubting , because I have sent them to you . ”
44010021	So Peter went down to the men and said , “ I am the one you are looking for . Why did you come here ? ”
44010022	They said , “ A holy angel spoke to Cornelius , an army officer and a good man ; he worships God . All the people respect him . The angel told Cornelius to ask you to come to his house so that he can hear what you have to say . ”
44010023	So Peter asked the men to come in and spend the night . The next day Peter got ready and went with them , and some of the followers from Joppa joined him .
44010024	On the following day they came to Caesarea . Cornelius was waiting for them and had called together his relatives and close friends .
44010025	When Peter entered , Cornelius met him , fell at his feet , and worshiped him .
44010026	But Peter helped him up , saying , “ Stand up . I too am only a human . ”
44010027	As he talked with Cornelius , Peter went inside where he saw many people gathered .
44010028	He said , “ You people understand that it is against our law for Jewish people to associate with or visit anyone who is not Jewish . But God has shown me that I should not call any person ‘ unholy ’ or ‘ unclean . ’
44010029	That is why I did not argue when I was asked to come here . Now , please tell me why you sent for me . ”
44010030	Cornelius said , “ Four days ago , I was praying in my house at this same time — three o’clock in the afternoon . Suddenly , there was a man standing before me wearing shining clothes .
44010031	He said , ‘ Cornelius , God has heard your prayer and has seen that you give to the poor and remembers you .
44010032	So send some men to Joppa and ask Simon Peter to come . Peter is staying in the house of a man , also named Simon , who is a tanner and has a house beside the sea . ’
44010033	So I sent for you immediately , and it was very good of you to come . Now we are all here before God to hear everything the Lord has commanded you to tell us . ”
44010034	Peter began to speak : “ I really understand now that to God every person is the same .
44010035	In every country God accepts anyone who worships him and does what is right .
44010036	You know the message that God has sent to the people of Israel is the Good News that peace has come through Jesus Christ . Jesus is the Lord of all people !
44010037	You know what has happened all over Judea , beginning in Galilee after John preached to the people about baptism .
44010038	You know about Jesus from Nazareth , that God gave him the Holy Spirit and power . You know how Jesus went everywhere doing good and healing those who were ruled by the devil , because God was with him .
44010039	We saw what Jesus did in Judea and in Jerusalem , but the Jews in Jerusalem killed him by hanging him on a cross .
44010040	Yet , on the third day , God raised Jesus to life and caused him to be seen ,
44010041	not by all the people , but only by the witnesses God had already chosen . And we are those witnesses who ate and drank with him after he was raised from the dead .
44010042	He told us to preach to the people and to tell them that he is the one whom God chose to be the judge of the living and the dead .
44010043	All the prophets say it is true that all who believe in Jesus will be forgiven of their sins through Jesus’ name . ”
44010044	While Peter was still saying this , the Holy Spirit came down on all those who were listening .
44010045	The Jewish believers who came with Peter were amazed that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been given even to the nations .
44010046	These believers heard them speaking in different languages and praising God . Then Peter said ,
44010047	“ Can anyone keep these people from being baptized with water ? They have received the Holy Spirit just as we did ! ”
44010048	So Peter ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ . Then they asked Peter to stay with them for a few days .
44011001	The apostles and the believers in Judea heard that some who were not Jewish had accepted God’s teaching too .
44011002	But when Peter came to Jerusalem , some people argued with him .
44011003	They said , “ You went into the homes of people who are not circumcised and ate with them ! ”
44011004	So Peter explained the whole story to them .
44011005	He said , “ I was in the city of Joppa , and while I was praying , I had a vision . I saw something that looked like a big sheet being lowered from heaven by its four corners . It came very close to me .
44011006	I looked inside it and saw animals , wild beasts , reptiles , and birds .
44011007	I heard a voice say to me , ‘ Get up , Peter . Kill and eat . ’
44011008	But I said , ‘ No , Lord ! I have never eaten anything that is unholy or unclean . ’
44011009	But the voice from heaven spoke again , ‘ God has made these things clean , so don’t call them unholy . ’
44011010	This happened three times . Then the whole thing was taken back to heaven .
44011011	Right then three men who were sent to me from Caesarea came to the house where I was staying .
44011012	The Spirit told me to go with them without doubting . These six believers here also went with me , and we entered the house of Cornelius .
44011013	He told us about the angel he saw standing in his house . The angel said to him , ‘ Send some men to Joppa and invite Simon Peter to come .
44011014	By the words he will say to you , you and all your family will be saved . ’
44011015	When I began my speech , the Holy Spirit came on them just as he came on us at the beginning .
44011016	Then I remembered the words of the Lord . He said , ‘ John baptized with water , but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit . ’
44011017	Since God gave them the same gift he gave us who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ , how could I stop the work of God ? ”
44011018	When the believers heard this , they stopped arguing . They praised God and said , “ So God is allowing even other nations to turn to him and live . ”
44011019	Many of the believers were scattered when they were persecuted after Stephen was killed . Some of them went as far as Phoenicia , Cyprus , and Antioch telling the message to others , but only to Jews .
44011020	Some of these believers were people from Cyprus and Cyrene . When they came to Antioch , they spoke also to Greeks , telling them the Good News about the Lord Jesus .
44011021	The Lord was helping the believers , and a large group of people believed and turned to the Lord .
44011022	The church in Jerusalem heard about all of this , so they sent Barnabas to Antioch .
44011025	Then Barnabas went to the city of Tarsus to look for Saul ,
44011026	and when he found Saul , he brought him to Antioch . For a whole year Saul and Barnabas met with the church and taught many people there . In Antioch the followers were called Christians for the first time .
44011027	About that time some prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch .
44011028	One of them , named Agabus , stood up and spoke with the help of the Holy Spirit . He said , “ A very hard time is coming to the whole world . There will be no food to eat . ” ( This happened when Claudius ruled . )
44011029	The followers all decided to help the believers who lived in Judea , as much as each one could .
44011030	They gathered the money and gave it to Barnabas and Saul , who brought it to the elders in Judea .
44012001	During that same time King Herod began to mistreat some who belonged to the church .
44012002	He ordered James , the brother of John , to be killed by the sword .
44012003	Herod saw that some of the people liked this , so he decided to arrest Peter , too . ( This happened during the time of the Feast of Unleavened Bread . )
44012004	After Herod arrested Peter , he put him in jail and handed him over to be guarded by sixteen soldiers . Herod planned to bring Peter before the people for trial after the Passover Feast .
44012005	So Peter was kept in jail , but the church prayed earnestly to God for him .
44012006	The night before Herod was to bring him to trial , Peter was sleeping between two soldiers , bound with two chains . Other soldiers were guarding the door of the jail .
44012007	Suddenly , an angel of the Lord stood there , and a light shined in the cell . The angel struck Peter on the side and woke him up . “ Hurry ! Get up ! ” the angel said . And the chains fell off Peter’s hands .
44012008	Then the angel told him , “ Get dressed and put on your sandals . ” And Peter did . Then the angel said , “ Put on your coat and follow me . ”
44012009	So Peter followed him out , but he did not know if what the angel was doing was real ; he thought he might be seeing a vision .
44012010	They went past the first and second guards and came to the iron gate that separated them from the city . The gate opened by itself for them , and they went through it . When they had walked down one street , the angel suddenly left him .
44012011	Then Peter realized what had happened . He thought , “ Now I know that the Lord really sent his angel to me . He rescued me from Herod and from all the things the people thought would happen . ”
44012012	When he considered this , he went to the home of Mary , the mother of John Mark . Many people were gathered there , praying .
44012013	Peter knocked on the outside door , and a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer it .
44012014	When she recognized Peter’s voice , she was so happy she forgot to open the door . Instead , she ran inside and told the group , “ Peter is at the door ! ”
44012015	They said to her , “ You are crazy ! ” But she kept on saying it was true , so they said , “ It must be Peter’s angel . ”
44012016	Peter continued to knock , and when they opened the door , they saw him and were amazed .
44012017	Peter made a sign with his hand to tell them to be quiet . He explained how the Lord led him out of the jail , and he said , “ Tell James and the other believers what happened . ” Then he left to go to another place .
44012018	The next day the soldiers were very upset and wondered what had happened to Peter .
44012019	Herod looked everywhere for him but could not find him . So he questioned the guards and ordered that they be killed . Later Herod moved from Judea and went to the city of Caesarea , where he stayed .
44012020	Herod was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon , but the people of those cities all came in a group to him . After convincing Blastus , the king’s personal servant , to be on their side , they asked Herod for peace , because their country got its food from his country .
44012021	On a chosen day Herod put on his royal robes , sat on his throne , and made a speech to the people .
44012022	They shouted , “ This is the voice of a god , not a human ! ”
44012023	Because Herod did not give the glory to God , an angel of the Lord immediately caused him to become sick , and he was eaten by worms and died .
44012024	God’s message continued to spread and reach people .
44012025	After Barnabas and Saul finished their task in Jerusalem , they returned to Antioch , taking John Mark with them .
44013001	In the church at Antioch there were these prophets and teachers : Barnabas , Simeon ( also called Niger ) , Lucius ( from the city of Cyrene ) , Manaen ( who had grown up with Herod , the ruler ) , and Saul .
44013002	They were all worshiping the Lord and fasting for a certain time . During this time the Holy Spirit said to them , “ Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul to do a special work for which I have chosen them . ”
44013003	So after they fasted and prayed , they laid their hands on Barnabas and Saul and sent them out .
44013004	Barnabas and Saul , sent out by the Holy Spirit , went to the city of Seleucia . From there they sailed to the island of Cyprus .
44013005	When they came to Salamis , they preached the Good News of God in the synagogues . John Mark was with them to help .
44013006	They went across the whole island to Paphos where they met a magician named Bar-Jesus . He was a false prophet
44013007	who always stayed close to Sergius Paulus , the governor and a smart man . He asked Barnabas and Saul to come to him , because he wanted to hear the message of God .
44013008	But Elymas , the magician , was against them . ( Elymas is the name for Bar-Jesus in the Greek language . ) He tried to stop the governor from believing in Jesus .
44013009	But Saul , who was also called Paul , was filled with the Holy Spirit . He looked straight at Elymas
44013010	and said , “ You son of the devil ! You are an enemy of everything that is right ! You are full of evil tricks and lies , always trying to change the Lord’s truths into lies .
44013011	Now the Lord will touch you , and you will be blind . For a time you will not be able to see anything — not even the light from the sun . ” Then everything became dark for Elymas , and he walked around , trying to find someone to lead him by the hand .
44013012	When the governor saw this , he believed because he was amazed at the teaching about the Lord .
44013013	Paul and those with him sailed from Paphos and came to Perga , in Pamphylia . There John Mark left them to return to Jerusalem .
44013014	They continued their trip from Perga and went to Antioch , a city in Pisidia . On the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down .
44013015	After the law of Moses and the writings of the prophets were read , the leaders of the synagogue sent a message to Paul and Barnabas : “ Brothers , if you have any message that will encourage the people , please speak . ”
44013016	Paul stood up , raised his hand , and said , “ You Israelites and you who worship God , please listen !
44013017	The God of the Israelites chose our ancestors . He made the people great during the time they lived in Egypt , and he brought them out of that country with great power .
44013018	And he was patient with them for forty years in the desert .
44013019	God destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan and gave the land to his people .
44013020	All this happened in about four hundred fifty years . “ After this , God gave them judges until the time of Samuel the prophet .
44013021	Then the people asked for a king , so God gave them Saul son of Kish . Saul was from the tribe of Benjamin and was king for forty years .
44013022	After God took him away , God made David their king . God said about him : ‘ I have found in David son of Jesse the kind of man I want . He will do all I want him to do . ’
44013023	So God has brought Jesus , one of David’s descendants , to Israel to be its Savior , as he promised .
44013024	Before Jesus came , John preached to all the people of Israel about a baptism of changed hearts and lives .
44013025	When he was finishing his work , he said , ‘ Who do you think I am ? I am not the Christ . He is coming later , and I am not worthy to untie his sandals . ’
44013026	“ Brothers , sons of the family of Abraham , and others who worship God , listen ! The news about this salvation has been sent to us .
44013027	Those who live in Jerusalem and their leaders did not realize that Jesus was the Savior . They did not understand the words that the prophets wrote , which are read every Sabbath day . But they made them come true when they said Jesus was guilty .
44013028	They could not find any real reason for Jesus to be put to death , but they asked Pilate to have him killed .
44013029	When they had done to him all that the Scriptures had said , they took him down from the cross and laid him in a tomb .
44013030	But God raised him up from the dead !
44013031	After this , for many days , those who had gone with Jesus from Galilee to Jerusalem saw him . They are now his witnesses to the people .
44013032	We tell you the Good News about the promise God made to our ancestors .
44013033	God has made this promise come true for us , his children , by raising Jesus from the dead .
44013034	God raised Jesus from the dead , and he will never go back to the grave and become dust . So God said : ‘ I will give you the holy and sure blessings that I promised to David . ’
44013035	But in another place God says : ‘ You will not let your Holy One rot . ’
44013036	David did God’s will during his lifetime . Then he died and was buried beside his ancestors , and his body did rot in the grave .
44013037	But the One God raised from the dead did not rot in the grave .
44013040	Be careful ! Don’t let what the prophets said happen to you :
44013041	‘ Listen , you people who doubt ! You can wonder , and then die . I will do something in your lifetime that you won’t believe even when you are told about it ! ’ ”
44013042	While Paul and Barnabas were leaving the synagogue , the people asked them to tell them more about these things on the next Sabbath .
44013043	When the meeting was over , many people with those who had changed to worship God followed Paul and Barnabas from that place . Paul and Barnabas were persuading them to continue trusting in God’s grace .
44013044	On the next Sabbath day , almost everyone in the city came to hear the word of the Lord .
44013045	Seeing the crowd , the Jewish people became very jealous and said insulting things and argued against what Paul said .
44013046	But Paul and Barnabas spoke very boldly , saying , “ We must speak the message of God to you first . But you refuse to listen . You are judging yourselves not worthy of having eternal life ! So we will now go to the people of other nations .
44013047	This is what the Lord told us to do , saying : ‘ I have made you a light for the nations ; you will show people all over the world the way to be saved . ’ ”
44013048	When those who were not Jewish heard Paul say this , they were happy and gave honor to the message of the Lord . And the people who were chosen to have life forever believed the message .
44013049	So the message of the Lord was spreading through the whole country .
44013050	But the Jewish people stirred up some of the important religious women and the leaders of the city . They started trouble against Paul and Barnabas and forced them out of their area .
44013051	So Paul and Barnabas shook the dust off their feet and went to Iconium .
44013052	But the followers were filled with joy and the Holy Spirit .
44014001	In Iconium , Paul and Barnabas went as usual to the synagogue . They spoke so well that a great many Jews and Greeks believed .
44014002	But some people who did not believe excited the others and turned them against the believers .
44014003	Paul and Barnabas stayed in Iconium a long time and spoke bravely for the Lord . He showed that their message about his grace was true by giving them the power to work miracles and signs .
44014004	But the city was divided . Some of the people agreed with the Jews , and others believed the apostles .
44014005	Some who were not Jews , some Jews , and some of their rulers wanted to mistreat Paul and Barnabas and to stone them to death .
44014006	When Paul and Barnabas learned about this , they ran away to Lystra and Derbe , cities in Lycaonia , and to the areas around those cities .
44014007	They announced the Good News there , too .
44014008	In Lystra there sat a man who had been born crippled ; he had never walked .
44014009	As this man was listening to Paul speak , Paul looked straight at him and saw that he believed God could heal him .
44014010	So he cried out , “ Stand up on your feet ! ” The man jumped up and began walking around .
44014011	When the crowds saw what Paul did , they shouted in the Lycaonian language , “ The gods have become like humans and have come down to us ! ”
44014012	Then the people began to call Barnabas “ Zeus ” and Paul “ Hermes , ” because he was the main speaker .
44014013	The priest in the temple of Zeus , which was near the city , brought some bulls and flowers to the city gates . He and the people wanted to offer a sacrifice to Paul and Barnabas .
44014014	But when the apostles , Barnabas and Paul , heard about it , they tore their clothes . They ran in among the people , shouting ,
44014015	“ Friends , why are you doing these things ? We are only human beings like you . We are bringing you the Good News and are telling you to turn away from these worthless things and turn to the living God . He is the One who made the sky , the earth , the sea , and everything in them .
44014016	In the past , God let all the nations do what they wanted .
44014017	Yet he proved he is real by showing kindness , by giving you rain from heaven and crops at the right times , by giving you food and filling your hearts with joy . ”
44014018	Even with these words , they were barely able to keep the crowd from offering sacrifices to them .
44014019	Then some evil people came from Antioch and Iconium and persuaded the people to turn against Paul . So they threw stones at him and dragged him out of town , thinking they had killed him .
44014020	But the followers gathered around him , and he got up and went back into the town . The next day he and Barnabas left and went to the city of Derbe .
44014021	Paul and Barnabas told the Good News in Derbe , and many became followers . Paul and Barnabas returned to Lystra , Iconium , and Antioch ,
44014022	making the followers of Jesus stronger and helping them stay in the faith . They said , “ We must suffer many things to enter God’s kingdom . ”
44014023	They chose elders for each church , by praying and fasting for a certain time . These elders had trusted the Lord , so Paul and Barnabas put them in the Lord’s care .
44014024	Then they went through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia .
44014025	When they had preached the message in Perga , they went down to Attalia .
44014026	And from there they sailed away to Antioch where the believers had put them into God’s care and had sent them out to do this work . Now they had finished .
44014027	When they arrived in Antioch , Paul and Barnabas gathered the church together . They told the church all about what God had done with them and how God had made it possible for those who were not Jewish to believe .
44014028	And they stayed there a long time with the followers .
44015001	Then some people came to Antioch from Judea and began teaching the non-Jewish believers : “ You cannot be saved if you are not circumcised as Moses taught us . ”
44015002	Paul and Barnabas were against this teaching and argued with them about it . So the church decided to send Paul , Barnabas , and some others to Jerusalem where they could talk more about this with the apostles and elders .
44015003	The church helped them leave on the trip , and they went through the countries of Phoenicia and Samaria , telling all about how the other nations had turned to God . This made all the believers very happy .
44015004	When they arrived in Jerusalem , they were welcomed by the apostles , the elders , and the church . Paul , Barnabas , and the others told about everything God had done with them .
44015005	But some of the believers who belonged to the Pharisee group came forward and said , “ The non-Jewish believers must be circumcised . They must be told to obey the law of Moses . ”
44015006	The apostles and the elders gathered to consider this problem .
44015007	After a long debate , Peter stood up and said to them , “ Brothers , you know that in the early days God chose me from among you to preach the Good News to the nations . They heard the Good News from me , and they believed .
44015008	God , who knows the thoughts of everyone , accepted them . He showed this to us by giving them the Holy Spirit , just as he did to us .
44015009	To God , those people are not different from us . When they believed , he made their hearts pure .
44015010	So now why are you testing God by putting a heavy load around the necks of the non-Jewish believers ? It is a load that neither we nor our ancestors were able to carry .
44015011	But we believe that we and they too will be saved by the grace of the Lord Jesus . ”
44015012	Then the whole group became quiet . They listened to Paul and Barnabas tell about all the miracles and signs that God did through them among the people .
44015013	After they finished speaking , James said , “ Brothers , listen to me .
44015014	Simon has told us how God showed his love for those people . For the first time he is accepting from among them a people to be his own .
44015015	The words of the prophets agree with this too :
44015016	‘ After these things I will return . The kingdom of David is like a fallen tent . But I will rebuild its ruins , and I will set it up .
44015017	Then those people who are left alive may ask the Lord for help , and the other nations that belong to me , says the Lord , who will make it happen .
44015018	And these things have been known for a long time . ’
44015019	“ So I think we should not bother the other people who are turning to God .
44015020	Instead , we should write a letter to them telling them these things : Stay away from food that has been offered to idols ( which makes it unclean ) , any kind of sexual sin , eating animals that have been strangled , and blood .
44015021	They should do these things , because for a long time in every city the law of Moses has been taught . And it is still read in the synagogue every Sabbath day . ”
44015022	The apostles , the elders , and the whole church decided to send some of their men with Paul and Barnabas to Antioch . They chose Judas Barsabbas and Silas , who were respected by the believers .
44015023	They sent the following letter with them : From the apostles and elders , your brothers . To all the non-Jewish believers in Antioch , Syria , and Cilicia : Greetings !
44015024	We have heard that some of our group have come to you and said things that trouble and upset you . But we did not tell them to do this .
44015025	We have all agreed to choose some messengers and send them to you with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul —
44015026	people who have given their lives to serve our Lord Jesus Christ .
44015027	So we are sending Judas and Silas , who will tell you the same things .
44015028	It has pleased the Holy Spirit that you should not have a heavy load to carry , and we agree . You need to do only these things :
44015029	Stay away from any food that has been offered to idols , eating any animals that have been strangled , and blood , and any kind of sexual sin . If you stay away from these things , you will do well . Good-bye .
44015030	So they left Jerusalem and went to Antioch where they gathered the church and gave them the letter .
44015031	When they read it , they were very happy because of the encouraging message .
44015032	Judas and Silas , who were also prophets , said many things to encourage the believers and make them stronger .
44015033	After some time Judas and Silas were sent off in peace by the believers , and they went back to those who had sent them [ ,
44015034	but Silas decided to remain there ] .
44015035	But Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch and , along with many others , preached the Good News and taught the people the message of the Lord .
44015036	After some time , Paul said to Barnabas , “ We should go back to all those towns where we preached the message of the Lord . Let’s visit the believers and see how they are doing . ”
44015037	Barnabas wanted to take John Mark with them ,
44015038	but he had left them at Pamphylia ; he did not continue with them in the work . So Paul did not think it was a good idea to take him .
44015039	Paul and Barnabas had such a serious argument about this that they separated and went different ways . Barnabas took Mark and sailed to Cyprus ,
44015040	but Paul chose Silas and left . The believers in Antioch put Paul into the Lord’s care ,
44015041	and he went through Syria and Cilicia , giving strength to the churches .
44016001	Paul came to Derbe and Lystra , where a follower named Timothy lived . Timothy’s mother was Jewish and a believer , but his father was a Greek .
44016002	The believers in Lystra and Iconium respected Timothy and said good things about him .
44016003	Paul wanted Timothy to travel with him , but all the people living in that area knew that Timothy’s father was Greek . So Paul circumcised Timothy to please his mother’s people .
44016004	Paul and those with him traveled from town to town and gave the decisions made by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem for the people to obey .
44016005	So the churches became stronger in the faith and grew larger every day .
44016006	Paul and those with him went through the areas of Phrygia and Galatia since the Holy Spirit did not let them preach the Good News in Asia .
44016007	When they came near the country of Mysia , they tried to go into Bithynia , but the Spirit of Jesus did not let them .
44016008	So they passed by Mysia and went to Troas .
44016009	That night Paul saw in a vision a man from Macedonia . The man stood and begged , “ Come over to Macedonia and help us . ”
44016010	After Paul had seen the vision , we immediately prepared to leave for Macedonia , understanding that God had called us to tell the Good News to those people .
44016011	We left Troas and sailed straight to the island of Samothrace . The next day we sailed to Neapolis .
44016012	Then we went by land to Philippi , a Roman colony and the leading city in that part of Macedonia . We stayed there for several days .
44016013	On the Sabbath day we went outside the city gate to the river where we thought we would find a special place for prayer . Some women had gathered there , so we sat down and talked with them .
44016014	One of the listeners was a woman named Lydia from the city of Thyatira whose job was selling purple cloth . She worshiped God , and he opened her mind to pay attention to what Paul was saying .
44016015	She and all the people in her house were baptized . Then she invited us to her home , saying , “ If you think I am truly a believer in the Lord , then come stay in my house . ” And she persuaded us to stay with her .
44016016	Once , while we were going to the place for prayer , a servant girl met us . She had a special spirit in her , and she earned a lot of money for her owners by telling fortunes .
44016017	This girl followed Paul and us , shouting , “ These men are servants of the Most High God . They are telling you how you can be saved . ”
44016018	She kept this up for many days . This bothered Paul , so he turned and said to the spirit , “ By the power of Jesus Christ , I command you to come out of her ! ” Immediately , the spirit came out .
44016019	When the owners of the servant girl saw this , they knew that now they could not use her to make money . So they grabbed Paul and Silas and dragged them before the city rulers in the marketplace .
44016020	They brought Paul and Silas to the Roman rulers and said , “ These men are Jews and are making trouble in our city .
44016021	They are teaching things that are not right for us as Romans to do . ”
44016022	The crowd joined the attack against them . The Roman officers tore the clothes of Paul and Silas and had them beaten with rods .
44016023	Then Paul and Silas were thrown into jail , and the jailer was ordered to guard them carefully .
44016024	When he heard this order , he put them far inside the jail and pinned their feet down between large blocks of wood .
44016025	About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing songs to God as the other prisoners listened .
44016026	Suddenly , there was a strong earthquake that shook the foundation of the jail . Then all the doors of the jail broke open , and all the prisoners were freed from their chains .
44016027	The jailer woke up and saw that the jail doors were open . Thinking that the prisoners had already escaped , he got his sword and was about to kill himself .
44016028	But Paul shouted , “ Don’t hurt yourself ! We are all here . ”
44016029	The jailer told someone to bring a light . Then he ran inside and , shaking with fear , fell down before Paul and Silas .
44016030	He brought them outside and said , “ Men , what must I do to be saved ? ”
44016031	They said to him , “ Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved — you and all the people in your house . ”
44016032	So Paul and Silas told the message of the Lord to the jailer and all the people in his house .
44016033	At that hour of the night the jailer took Paul and Silas and washed their wounds . Then he and all his people were baptized immediately .
44016034	After this the jailer took Paul and Silas home and gave them food . He and his family were very happy because they now believed in God .
44016035	The next morning , the Roman officers sent the police to tell the jailer , “ Let these men go free . ”
44016036	The jailer said to Paul , “ The officers have sent an order to let you go free . You can leave now . Go in peace . ”
44016037	But Paul said to the police , “ They beat us in public without a trial , even though we are Roman citizens . And they threw us in jail . Now they want to make us go away quietly . No ! Let them come themselves and bring us out . ”
44016038	The police told the Roman officers what Paul said . When the officers heard that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens , they were afraid .
44016039	So they came and told Paul and Silas they were sorry and took them out of jail and asked them to leave the city .
44016040	So when they came out of the jail , they went to Lydia’s house where they saw some of the believers and encouraged them . Then they left .
44017001	Paul and Silas traveled through Amphipolis and Apollonia and came to Thessalonica where there was a synagogue .
44017002	Paul went into the synagogue as he always did , and on each Sabbath day for three weeks , he talked with his fellow Jews about the Scriptures .
44017003	He explained and proved that the Christ must die and then rise from the dead . He said , “ This Jesus I am telling you about is the Christ . ”
44017004	Some of them were convinced and joined Paul and Silas , along with many of the Greeks who worshiped God and many of the important women .
44017005	But some others became jealous . So they got some evil men from the marketplace , formed a mob , and started a riot . They ran to Jason’s house , looking for Paul and Silas , wanting to bring them out to the people .
44017006	But when they did not find them , they dragged Jason and some other believers to the leaders of the city . The people were yelling , “ These people have made trouble everywhere in the world , and now they have come here too !
44017007	Jason is keeping them in his house . All of them do things against the laws of Caesar , saying there is another king , called Jesus . ”
44017008	When the people and the leaders of the city heard these things , they became very upset .
44017009	They made Jason and the others put up a sum of money . Then they let the believers go free .
44017010	That same night the believers sent Paul and Silas to Berea where they went to the synagogue .
44017011	These people were more willing to listen than the people in Thessalonica . The Bereans were eager to hear what Paul and Silas said and studied the Scriptures every day to find out if these things were true .
44017012	So , many of them believed , as well as many important Greek women and men .
44017013	But the people in Thessalonica learned that Paul was preaching the word of God in Berea , too . So they came there , upsetting the people and making trouble .
44017014	The believers quickly sent Paul away to the coast , but Silas and Timothy stayed in Berea .
44017015	The people leading Paul went with him to Athens . Then they carried a message from Paul back to Silas and Timothy for them to come to him as soon as they could .
44017016	While Paul was waiting for Silas and Timothy in Athens , he was troubled because he saw that the city was full of idols .
44017017	In the synagogue , he talked with the Jews and the Greeks who worshiped God . He also talked every day with people in the marketplace .
44017018	Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers argued with him , saying , “ This man doesn’t know what he is talking about . What is he trying to say ? ” Others said , “ He seems to be telling us about some other gods , ” because Paul was telling them about Jesus and his rising from the dead .
44017019	They got Paul and took him to a meeting of the Areopagus , where they said , “ Please explain to us this new idea you have been teaching .
44017020	The things you are saying are new to us , and we want to know what this teaching means . ”
44017021	( All the people of Athens and those from other countries who lived there always used their time to talk about the newest ideas . )
44017022	Then Paul stood before the meeting of the Areopagus and said , “ People of Athens , I can see you are very religious in all things .
44017023	As I was going through your city , I saw the objects you worship . I found an altar that had these words written on it : to a god who is not known . You worship a god that you don’t know , and this is the God I am telling you about !
44017024	The God who made the whole world and everything in it is the Lord of the land and the sky . He does not live in temples built by human hands .
44017025	This God is the One who gives life , breath , and everything else to people . He does not need any help from them ; he has everything he needs .
44017026	God began by making one person , and from him came all the different people who live everywhere in the world . God decided exactly when and where they must live .
44017027	God wanted them to look for him and perhaps search all around for him and find him , though he is not far from any of us :
44017028	‘ By his power we live and move and exist . ’ Some of your own poets have said : ‘ For we are his children . ’
44017029	Since we are God’s children , you must not think that God is like something that people imagine or make from gold , silver , or rock .
44017030	In the past , people did not understand God , and he ignored this . But now , God tells all people in the world to change their hearts and lives .
44017031	God has set a day that he will judge all the world with fairness , by the man he chose long ago . And God has proved this to everyone by raising that man from the dead ! ”
44017032	When the people heard about Jesus being raised from the dead , some of them laughed . But others said , “ We will hear more about this from you later . ”
44017033	So Paul went away from them .
44017034	But some of the people believed Paul and joined him . Among those who believed was Dionysius , a member of the Areopagus , a woman named Damaris , and some others .
44018001	Later Paul left Athens and went to Corinth .
44018002	Here he met a Jew named Aquila who had been born in the country of Pontus . But Aquila and his wife , Priscilla , had recently moved to Corinth from Italy , because Claudius commanded that all Jews must leave Rome . Paul went to visit Aquila and Priscilla .
44018003	Because they were tentmakers , just as he was , he stayed with them and worked with them .
44018004	Every Sabbath day he talked with the Jews and Greeks in the synagogue , trying to persuade them to believe in Jesus .
44018005	Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia and joined Paul in Corinth . After this , Paul spent all his time telling people the Good News , showing them that Jesus is the Christ .
44018006	But they would not accept Paul’s teaching and said some evil things . So he shook off the dust from his clothes and said to them , “ If you are not saved , it will be your own fault ! I have done all I can do ! After this , I will go to other nations . ”
44018007	Paul left the synagogue and moved into the home of Titius Justus , next to the synagogue . This man worshiped God .
44018008	Crispus was the leader of that synagogue , and he and all the people living in his house believed in the Lord . Many others in Corinth also listened to Paul and believed and were baptized .
44018009	During the night , the Lord told Paul in a vision : “ Don’t be afraid . Continue talking to people and don’t be quiet .
44018010	I am with you , and no one will hurt you because many of my people are in this city . ”
44018011	Paul stayed there for a year and a half , teaching God’s word to the people .
44018012	When Gallio was the governor of the country of Southern Greece , some people came together against Paul and took him to the court .
44018013	They said , “ This man is teaching people to worship God in a way that is against our law . ”
44018014	Paul was about to say something , but Gallio spoke , saying , “ I would listen to you if you were complaining about a crime or some wrong .
44018015	But the things you are saying are only questions about words and names — arguments about your own law . So you must solve this problem yourselves . I don’t want to be a judge of these things . ”
44018016	And Gallio made them leave the court .
44018017	Then they all grabbed Sosthenes , the leader of the synagogue , and beat him there before the court . But this did not bother Gallio .
44018018	Paul stayed with the believers for many more days . Then he left and sailed for Syria , with Priscilla and Aquila . At Cenchrea Paul cut off his hair , because he had made a promise to God .
44018019	Then they went to Ephesus , where Paul left Priscilla and Aquila . While Paul was there , he went into the synagogue and talked with the people .
44018020	When they asked him to stay with them longer , he refused .
44018021	But as he left , he said , “ I will come back to you again if God wants me to . ” And so he sailed away from Ephesus .
44018022	When Paul landed at Caesarea , he went and gave greetings to the church in Jerusalem . After that , Paul went to Antioch .
44018023	He stayed there for a while and then left and went through the regions of Galatia and Phrygia . He traveled from town to town in these regions , giving strength to all the followers .
44018024	A Jew named Apollos came to Ephesus . He was born in the city of Alexandria and was a good speaker who knew the Scriptures well .
44018025	He had been taught about the way of the Lord and was always very excited when he spoke and taught the truth about Jesus . But the only baptism Apollos knew about was the baptism that John taught .
44018026	Apollos began to speak very boldly in the synagogue , and when Priscilla and Aquila heard him , they took him to their home and helped him better understand the way of God .
44018027	Now Apollos wanted to go to the country of Southern Greece . So the believers helped him and wrote a letter to the followers there , asking them to accept him . These followers had believed in Jesus because of God’s grace , and when Apollos arrived , he helped them very much .
44018028	He argued very strongly with the Jews before all the people , clearly proving with the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ .
44019001	While Apollos was in Corinth , Paul was visiting some places on the way to Ephesus . There he found some followers
44019002	and asked them , “ Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed ? ” They said , “ We have never even heard of a Holy Spirit . ”
44019003	So he asked , “ What kind of baptism did you have ? ” They said , “ It was the baptism that John taught . ”
44019004	Paul said , “ John’s baptism was a baptism of changed hearts and lives . He told people to believe in the one who would come after him , and that one is Jesus . ”
44019005	When they heard this , they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus .
44019006	Then Paul laid his hands on them , and the Holy Spirit came upon them . They began speaking different languages and prophesying .
44019007	There were about twelve people in this group .
44019008	Paul went into the synagogue and spoke out boldly for three months . He talked with the people and persuaded them to accept the things he said about the kingdom of God .
44019009	But some of them became stubborn . They refused to believe and said evil things about the Way of Jesus before all the people . So Paul left them , and taking the followers with him , he went to the school of a man named Tyrannus . There Paul talked with people every day
44019010	for two years . Because of his work , every Jew and Greek in Asia heard the word of the Lord .
44019011	God used Paul to do some very special miracles .
44019012	Some people took handkerchiefs and clothes that Paul had used and put them on the sick . When they did this , the sick were healed and evil spirits left them .
44019013	But some people also were traveling around and making evil spirits go out of people . They tried to use the name of the Lord Jesus to force the evil spirits out . They would say , “ By the same Jesus that Paul talks about , I order you to come out ! ”
44019014	Seven sons of Sceva , a leading priest , were doing this .
44019015	But one time an evil spirit said to them , “ I know Jesus , and I know about Paul , but who are you ? ”
44019016	Then the man who had the evil spirit jumped on them . Because he was so much stronger than all of them , they ran away from the house naked and hurt .
44019017	All the people in Ephesus — Jews and Greeks — learned about this and were filled with fear and gave great honor to the Lord Jesus .
44019018	Many of the believers began to confess openly and tell all the evil things they had done .
44019019	Some of them who had used magic brought their magic books and burned them before everyone . Those books were worth about fifty thousand silver coins .
44019020	So in a powerful way the word of the Lord kept spreading and growing .
44019021	After these things , Paul decided to go to Jerusalem , planning to go through the countries of Macedonia and Southern Greece and then on to Jerusalem . He said , “ After I have been to Jerusalem , I must also visit Rome . ”
44019022	Paul sent Timothy and Erastus , two of his helpers , ahead to Macedonia , but he himself stayed in Asia for a while .
44019023	And during that time , there was some serious trouble in Ephesus about the Way of Jesus .
44019024	A man named Demetrius , who worked with silver , made little silver models that looked like the temple of the goddess Artemis . Those who did this work made much money .
44019025	Demetrius had a meeting with them and some others who did the same kind of work . He told them , “ Men , you know that we make a lot of money from our business .
44019026	But look at what this man Paul is doing . He has convinced and turned away many people in Ephesus and in almost all of Asia ! He says the gods made by human hands are not real .
44019027	There is a danger that our business will lose its good name , but there is also another danger : People will begin to think that the temple of the great goddess Artemis is not important . Her greatness will be destroyed , and Artemis is the goddess that everyone in Asia and the whole world worships . ”
44019028	When the others heard this , they became very angry and shouted , “ Artemis , the goddess of Ephesus , is great ! ”
44019029	The whole city became confused . The people grabbed Gaius and Aristarchus , who were from Macedonia and were traveling with Paul , and ran to the theater .
44019030	Paul wanted to go in and talk to the crowd , but the followers did not let him .
44019031	Also , some leaders of Asia who were friends of Paul sent him a message , begging him not to go into the theater .
44019032	Some people were shouting one thing , and some were shouting another . The meeting was completely confused ; most of them did not know why they had come together .
44019033	They put a man named Alexander in front of the people , and some of them told him what to do . Alexander waved his hand so he could explain things to the people .
44019034	But when they saw that Alexander was a Jew , they all shouted the same thing for two hours : “ Great is Artemis of Ephesus ! ”
44019035	Then the city clerk made the crowd be quiet . He said , “ People of Ephesus , everyone knows that Ephesus is the city that keeps the temple of the great goddess Artemis and her holy stone that fell from heaven .
44019036	Since no one can say this is not true , you should be quiet . Stop and think before you do anything .
44019037	You brought these men here , but they have not said anything evil against our goddess or stolen anything from her temple .
44019038	If Demetrius and those who work with him have a charge against anyone they should go to the courts and judges where they can argue with each other .
44019039	If there is something else you want to talk about , it can be decided at the regular town meeting of the people .
44019040	I say this because some people might see this trouble today and say that we are rioting . We could not explain this , because there is no real reason for this meeting . ”
44019041	After the city clerk said these things , he told the people to go home .
44020001	When the trouble stopped , Paul sent for the followers to come to him . After he encouraged them and then told them good-bye , he left and went to the country of Macedonia .
44020002	He said many things to strengthen the followers in the different places on his way through Macedonia . Then he went to Greece ,
44020003	where he stayed for three months . He was ready to sail for Syria , but some evil people were planning something against him . So Paul decided to go back through Macedonia to Syria .
44020004	The men who went with him were Sopater son of Pyrrhus , from the city of Berea ; Aristarchus and Secundus , from the city of Thessalonica ; Gaius , from Derbe ; Timothy ; and Tychicus and Trophimus , two men from Asia .
44020005	These men went on ahead and waited for us at Troas .
44020006	We sailed from Philippi after the Feast of Unleavened Bread . Five days later we met them in Troas , where we stayed for seven days .
44020007	On the first day of the week , we all met together to break bread , and Paul spoke to the group . Because he was planning to leave the next day , he kept on talking until midnight .
44020008	We were all together in a room upstairs , and there were many lamps in the room .
44020009	A young man named Eutychus was sitting in the window . As Paul continued talking , Eutychus was falling into a deep sleep . Finally , he went sound asleep and fell to the ground from the third floor . When they picked him up , he was dead .
44020010	Paul went down to Eutychus , knelt down , and put his arms around him . He said , “ Don’t worry . He is alive now . ”
44020011	Then Paul went upstairs again , broke bread , and ate . He spoke to them a long time , until it was early morning , and then he left .
44020012	They took the young man home alive and were greatly comforted .
44020013	We went on ahead of Paul and sailed for the city of Assos , where he wanted to join us on the ship . Paul planned it this way because he wanted to go to Assos by land .
44020014	When he met us there , we took him aboard and went to Mitylene .
44020015	We sailed from Mitylene and the next day came to a place near Kios . The following day we sailed to Samos , and the next day we reached Miletus .
44020016	Paul had already decided not to stop at Ephesus , because he did not want to stay too long in Asia . He was hurrying to be in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost , if that were possible .
44020017	Now from Miletus Paul sent to Ephesus and called for the elders of the church .
44020018	When they came to him , he said , “ You know about my life from the first day I came to Asia . You know the way I lived all the time I was with you .
44020019	The evil people made plans against me , which troubled me very much . But you know I always served the Lord unselfishly , and I often cried .
44020020	You know I preached to you and did not hold back anything that would help you . You know that I taught you in public and in your homes .
44020021	I warned both Jews and Greeks to change their lives and turn to God and believe in our Lord Jesus .
44020022	But now I must obey the Holy Spirit and go to Jerusalem . I don’t know what will happen to me there .
44020023	I know only that in every city the Holy Spirit tells me that troubles and even jail wait for me .
44020024	I don’t care about my own life . The most important thing is that I complete my mission , the work that the Lord Jesus gave me — to tell people the Good News about God’s grace .
44020025	“ And now , I know that none of you among whom I was preaching the kingdom of God will ever see me again .
44020026	So today I tell you that if any of you should be lost , I am not responsible ,
44020027	because I have told you everything God wants you to know .
44020028	Be careful for yourselves and for all the people the Holy Spirit has given to you to oversee . You must be like shepherds to the church of God , which he bought with the death of his own son .
44020029	I know that after I leave , some people will come like wild wolves and try to destroy the flock .
44020030	Also , some from your own group will rise up and twist the truth and will lead away followers after them .
44020031	So be careful ! Always remember that for three years , day and night , I never stopped warning each of you , and I often cried over you .
44020032	“ Now I am putting you in the care of God and the message about his grace . It is able to give you strength , and it will give you the blessings God has for all his holy people .
44020033	When I was with you , I never wanted anyone’s money or fine clothes .
44020034	You know I always worked to take care of my own needs and the needs of those who were with me .
44020035	I showed you in all things that you should work as I did and help the weak . I taught you to remember the words Jesus said : ‘ It is more blessed to give than to receive . ’ ”
44020036	When Paul had said this , he knelt down with all of them and prayed .
44021001	After we all said good-bye to them , we sailed straight to the island of Cos . The next day we reached Rhodes , and from there we went to Patara .
44021002	There we found a ship going to Phoenicia , so we went aboard and sailed away .
44021003	We sailed near the island of Cyprus , seeing it to the north , but we sailed on to Syria . We stopped at Tyre because the ship needed to unload its cargo there .
44021004	We found some followers in Tyre and stayed with them for seven days . Through the Holy Spirit they warned Paul not to go to Jerusalem .
44021005	When we finished our visit , we left and continued our trip . All the followers , even the women and children , came outside the city with us . After we all knelt on the beach and prayed ,
44021006	we said good-bye and got on the ship , and the followers went back home .
44021007	We continued our trip from Tyre and arrived at Ptolemais , where we greeted the believers and stayed with them for a day .
44021008	The next day we left Ptolemais and went to the city of Caesarea . There we went into the home of Philip the preacher , one of the seven helpers , and stayed with him .
44021009	He had four unmarried daughters who had the gift of prophesying .
44021010	After we had been there for some time , a prophet named Agabus arrived from Judea .
44021011	He came to us and borrowed Paul’s belt and used it to tie his own hands and feet . He said , “ The Holy Spirit says , ‘ This is how evil people in Jerusalem will tie up the man who wears this belt . Then they will give him to the older leaders . ’ ”
44021012	When we all heard this , we and the people there begged Paul not to go to Jerusalem .
44021013	But he said , “ Why are you crying and making me so sad ? I am not only ready to be tied up in Jerusalem , I am ready to die for the Lord Jesus ! ”
44021014	We could not persuade him to stay away from Jerusalem . So we stopped begging him and said , “ We pray that what the Lord wants will be done . ”
44021015	After this , we got ready and started on our way to Jerusalem .
44021016	Some of the followers from Caesarea went with us and took us to the home of Mnason , where we would stay . He was from Cyprus and was one of the first followers .
44021017	In Jerusalem the believers were glad to see us .
44021018	The next day Paul went with us to visit James , and all the elders were there .
44021019	Paul greeted them and told them everything God had done among the other nations through him .
44021020	When they heard this , they praised God . Then they said to Paul , “ Brother , you can see that many thousands of our people have become believers . And they think it is very important to obey the law of Moses .
44021021	They have heard about your teaching , that you tell our people who live among the nations to leave the law of Moses . They have heard that you tell them not to circumcise their children and not to obey customs .
44021022	What should we do ? They will learn that you have come .
44021023	So we will tell you what to do : Four of our men have made a promise to God .
44021024	Take these men with you and share in their cleansing ceremony . Pay their expenses so they can shave their heads . Then it will prove to everyone that what they have heard about you is not true and that you follow the law of Moses in your own life .
44021025	We have already sent a letter to the non-Jewish believers . The letter said : ‘ Do not eat food that has been offered to idols , or blood , or animals that have been strangled . Do not take part in sexual sin . ’ ”
44021026	The next day Paul took the four men and shared in the cleansing ceremony with them . Then he went to the Temple and announced the time when the days of the cleansing ceremony would be finished . On the last day an offering would be given for each of the men .
44021027	When the seven days were almost over , some of his people from Asia saw Paul at the Temple . They caused all the people to be upset and grabbed Paul .
44021028	They shouted , “ People of Israel , help us ! This is the man who goes everywhere teaching against the law of Moses , against our people , and against this Temple . Now he has brought some Greeks into the Temple and has made this holy place unclean ! ”
44021029	( They said this because they had seen Trophimus , a man from Ephesus , with Paul in Jerusalem . They thought that Paul had brought him into the Temple . )
44021030	All the people in Jerusalem became upset . Together they ran , took Paul , and dragged him out of the Temple . The Temple doors were closed immediately .
44021031	While they were trying to kill Paul , the commander of the Roman army in Jerusalem learned that there was trouble in the whole city .
44021032	Immediately he took some officers and soldiers and ran to the place where the crowd was gathered . When the people saw them , they stopped beating Paul .
44021033	The commander went to Paul and arrested him . He told his soldiers to tie Paul with two chains . Then he asked who he was and what he had done wrong .
44021034	Some in the crowd were yelling one thing , and some were yelling another . Because of all this confusion and shouting , the commander could not learn what had happened . So he ordered the soldiers to take Paul to the army building .
44021035	When Paul came to the steps , the soldiers had to carry him because the people were ready to hurt him .
44021036	The whole mob was following them , shouting , “ Kill him ! ”
44021037	As the soldiers were about to take Paul into the army building , he spoke to the commander , “ May I say something to you ? ” The commander said , “ Do you speak Greek ?
44021038	I thought you were the Egyptian who started some trouble against the government not long ago and led four thousand killers out to the desert . ”
44021039	Paul said , “ No , I am a Jew from Tarsus in the country of Cilicia . I am a citizen of that important city . Please , let me speak to the people . ”
44021040	The commander gave permission , so Paul stood on the steps and waved his hand to quiet the people . When there was silence , he spoke to them in the Hebrew language .
44022001	Paul said , “ Brothers and fathers , listen to my defense to you . ”
44022002	When they heard him speaking the Hebrew language , they became very quiet . Paul said ,
44022003	“ I am a Jew , born in Tarsus in the country of Cilicia , but I grew up in this city . I was a student of Gamaliel , who carefully taught me everything about the law of our ancestors . I was very serious about serving God , just as are all of you here today .
44022004	I persecuted the people who followed the Way of Jesus , and some of them were even killed . I arrested men and women and put them in jail .
44022005	The high priest and the whole council of elders can tell you this is true . They gave me letters to the brothers in Damascus . So I was going there to arrest these people and bring them back to Jerusalem to be punished .
44022006	“ About noon when I came near Damascus , a bright light from heaven suddenly flashed all around me .
44022007	I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying , ‘ Saul , Saul , why are you persecuting me ? ’
44022008	I asked , ‘ Who are you , Lord ? ’ The voice said , ‘ I am Jesus from Nazareth whom you are persecuting . ’
44022009	Those who were with me did not understand the voice , but they saw the light .
44022010	I said , ‘ What shall I do , Lord ? ’ The Lord answered , ‘ Get up and go to Damascus . There you will be told about all the things I have planned for you to do . ’
44022011	I could not see , because the bright light had made me blind . So my companions led me into Damascus .
44022012	“ There a man named Ananias came to me . He was a religious man ; he obeyed the law of Moses , and all the Jews who lived there respected him .
44022013	He stood by me and said , ‘ Brother Saul , see again ! ’ Immediately I was able to see him .
44022014	He said , ‘ The God of our ancestors chose you long ago to know his plan , to see the Righteous One , and to hear words from him .
44022015	You will be his witness to all people , telling them about what you have seen and heard .
44022016	Now , why wait any longer ? Get up , be baptized , and wash your sins away , trusting in him to save you . ’
44022017	“ Later , when I returned to Jerusalem , I was praying in the Temple , and I saw a vision .
44022018	I saw the Lord saying to me , ‘ Hurry ! Leave Jerusalem now ! The people here will not accept the truth about me . ’
44022019	But I said , ‘ Lord , they know that in every synagogue I put the believers in jail and beat them .
44022020	They also know I was there when Stephen , your witness , was killed . I stood there agreeing and holding the coats of those who were killing him ! ’
44022021	But the Lord said to me , ‘ Leave now . I will send you far away to the other nations . ’ ”
44022022	The crowd listened to Paul until he said this . Then they began shouting , “ Get rid of him ! He doesn’t deserve to live ! ”
44022023	They shouted , threw off their coats , and threw dust into the air .
44022024	Then the commander ordered the soldiers to take Paul into the army building and beat him . He wanted to make Paul tell why the people were shouting against him like this .
44022025	But as the soldiers were tying him up , preparing to beat him , Paul said to an officer nearby , “ Do you have the right to beat a Roman citizen who has not been proven guilty ? ”
44022026	When the officer heard this , he went to the commander and reported it . The officer said , “ Do you know what you are doing ? This man is a Roman citizen . ”
44022027	The commander came to Paul and said , “ Tell me , are you really a Roman citizen ? ” He answered , “ Yes . ”
44022028	The commander said , “ I paid a lot of money to become a Roman citizen . ” But Paul said , “ I was born a citizen . ”
44022029	The men who were preparing to question Paul moved away from him immediately . The commander was frightened because he had already tied Paul , and Paul was a Roman citizen .
44022030	The next day the commander decided to learn why the Jews were accusing Paul . So he ordered the leading priests and the council to meet . The commander took Paul’s chains off . Then he brought Paul out and stood him before their meeting .
44023001	Paul looked at the council and said , “ Brothers , I have lived my life without guilt feelings before God up to this day . ”
44023002	Ananias , the high priest , heard this and told the men who were standing near Paul to hit him on the mouth .
44023003	Paul said to Ananias , “ God will hit you , too ! You are like a wall that has been painted white . You sit there and judge me , using the law of Moses , but you are telling them to hit me , and that is against the law . ”
44023004	The men standing near Paul said to him , “ You cannot insult God’s high priest like that ! ”
44023005	Paul said , “ Brothers , I did not know this man was the high priest . It is written in the Scriptures , ‘ You must not curse a leader of your people . ’ ”
44023006	Some of the men in the meeting were Sadducees , and others were Pharisees . Knowing this , Paul shouted to them , “ My brothers , I am a Pharisee , and my father was a Pharisee . I am on trial here because I believe that people will rise from the dead . ”
44023007	When Paul said this , there was an argument between the Pharisees and the Sadducees , and the group was divided .
44023008	( The Sadducees do not believe in angels or spirits or that people will rise from the dead . But the Pharisees believe in them all . )
44023009	So there was a great uproar . Some of the teachers of the law , who were Pharisees , stood up and argued , “ We find nothing wrong with this man . Maybe an angel or a spirit did speak to him . ”
44023010	The argument was beginning to turn into such a fight that the commander was afraid some evil people would tear Paul to pieces . So he told the soldiers to go down and take Paul away and put him in the army building .
44023011	The next night the Lord came and stood by Paul . He said , “ Be brave ! You have told people in Jerusalem about me . You must do the same in Rome . ”
44023012	In the morning some evil people made a plan to kill Paul , and they took an oath not to eat or drink anything until they had killed him .
44023013	There were more than forty men who made this plan .
44023014	They went to the leading priests and the elders and said , “ We have taken an oath not to eat or drink until we have killed Paul .
44023015	So this is what we want you to do : Send a message to the commander to bring Paul out to you as though you want to ask him more questions . We will be waiting to kill him while he is on the way here . ”
44023016	But Paul’s nephew heard about this plan and went to the army building and told Paul .
44023017	Then Paul called one of the officers and said , “ Take this young man to the commander . He has a message for him . ”
44023018	So the officer brought Paul’s nephew to the commander and said , “ The prisoner , Paul , asked me to bring this young man to you . He wants to tell you something . ”
44023019	The commander took the young man’s hand and led him to a place where they could be alone . He asked , “ What do you want to tell me ? ”
44023020	The young man said , “ The Jews have decided to ask you to bring Paul down to their council meeting tomorrow . They want you to think they are going to ask him more questions .
44023021	But don’t believe them ! More than forty men are hiding and waiting to kill Paul . They have all taken an oath not to eat or drink until they have killed him . Now they are waiting for you to agree . ”
44023022	The commander sent the young man away , ordering him , “ Don’t tell anyone that you have told me about their plan . ”
44023023	Then the commander called two officers and said , “ I need some men to go to Caesarea . Get two hundred soldiers , seventy horsemen , and two hundred men with spears ready to leave at nine o’clock tonight .
44023024	Get some horses for Paul to ride so he can be taken to Governor Felix safely . ”
44023025	And he wrote a letter that said :
44023026	From Claudius Lysias . To the Most Excellent Governor Felix : Greetings .
44023027	Some of the Jews had taken this man and planned to kill him . But I learned that he is a Roman citizen , so I went with my soldiers and saved him .
44023028	I wanted to know why they were accusing him , so I brought him before their council meeting .
44023029	I learned that these people said Paul did some things that were wrong by their own laws , but no charge was worthy of jail or death .
44023030	When I was told that some of them were planning to kill Paul , I sent him to you at once . I also told them to tell you what they have against him .
44023031	So the soldiers did what they were told and took Paul and brought him to the city of Antipatris that night .
44023032	The next day the horsemen went with Paul to Caesarea , but the other soldiers went back to the army building in Jerusalem .
44023033	When the horsemen came to Caesarea and gave the letter to the governor , they turned Paul over to him .
44023034	The governor read the letter and asked Paul , “ What area are you from ? ” When he learned that Paul was from Cilicia ,
44023035	he said , “ I will hear your case when those who are against you come here , too . ” Then the governor gave orders for Paul to be kept under guard in Herod’s palace .
44024001	Five days later Ananias , the high priest , went to the city of Caesarea with some of the elders and a lawyer named Tertullus . They had come to make charges against Paul before the governor .
44024002	Paul was called into the meeting , and Tertullus began to accuse him , saying , “ Most Excellent Felix ! Our people enjoy much peace because of you , and many wrong things in our country are being made right through your wise help .
44024003	We accept these things always and in every place , and we are thankful for them .
44024004	But not wanting to take any more of your time , I beg you to be kind and listen to our few words .
44024005	We have found this man to be a troublemaker , stirring up his people everywhere in the world . He is a leader of the Nazarene group .
44024006	Also , he was trying to make the Temple unclean , but we stopped him . [ And we wanted to judge him by our own law .
44024007	But the officer Lysias came and used much force to take him from us .
44024008	And Lysias commanded those who wanted to accuse Paul to come to you . ] By asking him questions yourself , you can decide if all these things are true . ”
44024009	The others agreed and said that all of this was true .
44024010	When the governor made a sign for Paul to speak , Paul said , “ Governor Felix , I know you have been a judge over this nation for a long time . So I am happy to defend myself before you .
44024011	You can learn for yourself that I went to worship in Jerusalem only twelve days ago .
44024012	Those who are accusing me did not find me arguing with anyone in the Temple or stirring up the people in the synagogues or in the city .
44024013	They cannot prove the things they are saying against me now .
44024014	But I will tell you this : I worship the God of our ancestors as a follower of the Way of Jesus . The others say that the Way of Jesus is not the right way . But I believe everything that is taught in the law of Moses and that is written in the books of the Prophets .
44024015	I have the same hope in God that they have — the hope that all people , good and bad , will surely be raised from the dead .
44024016	This is why I always try to do what I believe is right before God and people .
44024017	“ After being away from Jerusalem for several years , I went back to bring money to my people and to offer sacrifices .
44024018	I was doing this when they found me in the Temple . I had finished the cleansing ceremony and had not made any trouble ; no people were gathering around me .
44024019	But there were some people from Asia who should be here , standing before you . If I have really done anything wrong , they are the ones who should accuse me .
44024020	Or ask these people here if they found any wrong in me when I stood before the council in Jerusalem .
44024021	But I did shout one thing when I stood before them : ‘ You are judging me today because I believe that people will rise from the dead ! ’ ”
44024022	Felix already understood much about the Way of Jesus . He stopped the trial and said , “ When commander Lysias comes here , I will decide your case . ”
44024023	Felix told the officer to keep Paul guarded but to give him some freedom and to let his friends bring what he needed .
44024024	After some days Felix came with his wife , Drusilla , who was Jewish , and asked for Paul to be brought to him . He listened to Paul talk about believing in Christ Jesus .
44024025	But Felix became afraid when Paul spoke about living right , self-control , and the time when God will judge the world . He said , “ Go away now . When I have more time , I will call for you . ”
44024026	At the same time Felix hoped that Paul would give him some money , so he often sent for Paul and talked with him .
44024027	But after two years , Felix was replaced by Porcius Festus as governor . But Felix had left Paul in prison to please the Jews .
44025001	Three days after Festus became governor , he went from Caesarea to Jerusalem .
44025002	There the leading priests and the important leaders made charges against Paul before Festus .
44025003	They asked Festus to do them a favor . They wanted him to send Paul back to Jerusalem , because they had a plan to kill him on the way .
44025004	But Festus answered that Paul would be kept in Caesarea and that he himself was returning there soon .
44025005	He said , “ Some of your leaders should go with me . They can accuse the man there in Caesarea , if he has really done something wrong . ”
44025006	Festus stayed in Jerusalem another eight or ten days and then went back to Caesarea . The next day he told the soldiers to bring Paul before him . Festus was seated on the judge’s seat
44025007	when Paul came into the room . The people who had come from Jerusalem stood around him , making serious charges against him , which they could not prove .
44025008	This is what Paul said to defend himself : “ I have done nothing wrong against the law , against the Temple , or against Caesar . ”
44025009	But Festus wanted to please the people . So he asked Paul , “ Do you want to go to Jerusalem for me to judge you there on these charges ? ”
44025010	Paul said , “ I am standing at Caesar’s judgment seat now , where I should be judged . I have done nothing wrong to them ; you know this is true .
44025011	If I have done something wrong and the law says I must die , I do not ask to be saved from death . But if these charges are not true , then no one can give me to them . I want Caesar to hear my case ! ”
44025012	Festus talked about this with his advisers . Then he said , “ You have asked to see Caesar , so you will go to Caesar ! ”
44025013	A few days later King Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to visit Festus .
44025014	They stayed there for some time , and Festus told the king about Paul’s case . Festus said , “ There is a man that Felix left in prison .
44025015	When I went to Jerusalem , the leading priests and the elders there made charges against him , asking me to sentence him to death .
44025016	But I answered , ‘ When a man is accused of a crime , Romans do not hand him over until he has been allowed to face his accusers and defend himself against their charges . ’
44025017	So when these people came here to Caesarea for the trial , I did not waste time . The next day I sat on the judge’s seat and commanded that the man be brought in .
44025018	They stood up and accused him , but not of any serious crime as I thought they would .
44025019	The things they said were about their own religion and about a man named Jesus who died . But Paul said that he is still alive .
44025020	Not knowing how to find out about these questions , I asked Paul , ‘ Do you want to go to Jerusalem and be judged there ? ’
44025021	But he asked to be kept in Caesarea . He wants a decision from the emperor . So I ordered that he be held until I could send him to Caesar . ”
44025022	Agrippa said to Festus , “ I would also like to hear this man myself . ” Festus said , “ Tomorrow you will hear him . ”
44025023	The next day Agrippa and Bernice appeared with great show , acting like very important people . They went into the judgment room with the army leaders and the important men of Caesarea . Then Festus ordered the soldiers to bring Paul in .
44025024	Festus said , “ King Agrippa and all who are gathered here with us , you see this man . All the people , here and in Jerusalem , have complained to me about him , shouting that he should not live any longer .
44025025	When I judged him , I found no reason to order his death . But since he asked to be judged by Caesar , I decided to send him .
44025026	But I have nothing definite to write the emperor about him . So I have brought him before all of you — especially you , King Agrippa . I hope you can question him and give me something to write .
44025027	I think it is foolish to send a prisoner to Caesar without telling what charges are against him . ”
44026001	Agrippa said to Paul , “ You may now speak to defend yourself . ” Then Paul raised his hand and began to speak .
44026002	He said , “ King Agrippa , I am very blessed to stand before you and will answer all the charges the evil people make against me .
44026003	You know so much about all the customs and the things they argue about , so please listen to me patiently .
44026004	“ All my people know about my whole life , how I lived from the beginning in my own country and later in Jerusalem .
44026005	They have known me for a long time . If they want to , they can tell you that I was a good Pharisee . And the Pharisees obey the laws of my tradition more carefully than any other group .
44026006	Now I am on trial because I hope for the promise that God made to our ancestors .
44026007	This is the promise that the twelve tribes of our people hope to receive as they serve God day and night . My king , they have accused me because I hope for this same promise !
44026008	Why do any of you people think it is impossible for God to raise people from the dead ?
44026009	“ I , too , thought I ought to do many things against Jesus from Nazareth .
44026010	And that is what I did in Jerusalem . The leading priests gave me the power to put many of God’s people in jail , and when they were being killed , I agreed it was a good thing .
44026011	In every synagogue , I often punished them and tried to make them speak against Jesus . I was so angry against them I even went to other cities to find them and punish them .
44026012	“ One time the leading priests gave me permission and the power to go to Damascus .
44026013	On the way there , at noon , I saw a light from heaven . It was brighter than the sun and flashed all around me and those who were traveling with me .
44026014	We all fell to the ground . Then I heard a voice speaking to me in the Hebrew language , saying , ‘ Saul , Saul , why are you persecuting me ? You are only hurting yourself by fighting me . ’
44026015	I said , ‘ Who are you , Lord ? ’ The Lord said , ‘ I am Jesus , the one you are persecuting .
44026016	Stand up ! I have chosen you to be my servant and my witness — you will tell people the things that you have seen and the things that I will show you . This is why I have come to you today .
44026017	I will keep you safe from your own people and also from the others . I am sending you to them
44026018	to open their eyes so that they may turn away from darkness to the light , away from the power of Satan and to God . Then their sins can be forgiven , and they can have a place with those people who have been made holy by believing in me . ’
44026019	“ King Agrippa , after I had this vision from heaven , I obeyed it .
44026020	I began telling people that they should change their hearts and lives and turn to God and do things to show they really had changed . I told this first to those in Damascus , then in Jerusalem , and in every part of Judea , and also to the other people .
44026021	This is why the Jews took me and were trying to kill me in the Temple .
44026022	But God has helped me , and so I stand here today , telling all people , small and great , what I have seen . But I am saying only what Moses and the prophets said would happen —
44026023	that the Christ would die , and as the first to rise from the dead , he would bring light to all people . ”
44026024	While Paul was saying these things to defend himself , Festus said loudly , “ Paul , you are out of your mind ! Too much study has driven you crazy ! ”
44026025	Paul said , “ Most excellent Festus , I am not crazy . My words are true and sensible .
44026026	King Agrippa knows about these things , and I can speak freely to him . I know he has heard about all of these things , because they did not happen off in a corner .
44026027	King Agrippa , do you believe what the prophets wrote ? I know you believe . ”
44026028	King Agrippa said to Paul , “ Do you think you can persuade me to become a Christian in such a short time ? ”
44026029	Paul said , “ Whether it is a short or a long time , I pray to God that not only you but every person listening to me today would be saved and be like me — except for these chains I have . ”
44026030	Then King Agrippa , Governor Festus , Bernice , and all the people sitting with them stood up
44026031	and left the room . Talking to each other , they said , “ There is no reason why this man should die or be put in jail . ”
44026032	And Agrippa said to Festus , “ We could let this man go free , but he has asked Caesar to hear his case . ”
44027001	It was decided that we would sail for Italy . An officer named Julius , who served in the emperor’s army , guarded Paul and some other prisoners .
44027002	We got on a ship that was from the city of Adramyttium and was about to sail to different ports in Asia . Aristarchus , a man from the city of Thessalonica in Macedonia , went with us .
44027003	The next day we came to Sidon . Julius was very good to Paul and gave him freedom to go visit his friends , who took care of his needs .
44027004	We left Sidon and sailed close to the island of Cyprus , because the wind was blowing against us .
44027005	We went across the sea by Cilicia and Pamphylia and landed at the city of Myra , in Lycia .
44027006	There the officer found a ship from Alexandria that was going to Italy , so he put us on it .
44027007	We sailed slowly for many days . We had a hard time reaching Cnidus because the wind was blowing against us , and we could not go any farther . So we sailed by the south side of the island of Crete near Salmone .
44027008	Sailing past it was hard . Then we came to a place called Fair Havens , near the city of Lasea .
44027009	We had lost much time , and it was now dangerous to sail , because it was already after the Day of Cleansing . So Paul warned them ,
44027010	“ Men , I can see there will be a lot of trouble on this trip . The ship , the cargo , and even our lives may be lost . ”
44027011	But the captain and the owner of the ship did not agree with Paul , and the officer believed what the captain and owner of the ship said .
44027012	Since that harbor was not a good place for the ship to stay for the winter , most of the men decided that the ship should leave . They hoped we could go to Phoenix and stay there for the winter . Phoenix , a city on the island of Crete , had a harbor which faced southwest and northwest .
44027013	When a good wind began to blow from the south , the men on the ship thought , “ This is the wind we wanted , and now we have it . ” So they pulled up the anchor , and we sailed very close to the island of Crete .
44027014	But then a very strong wind named the “ northeaster ” came from the island .
44027015	The ship was caught in it and could not sail against it . So we stopped trying and let the wind carry us .
44027016	When we went below a small island named Cauda , we were barely able to bring in the lifeboat .
44027017	After the men took the lifeboat in , they tied ropes around the ship to hold it together . The men were afraid that the ship would hit the sandbanks of Syrtis , so they lowered the sail and let the wind carry the ship .
44027018	The next day the storm was blowing us so hard that the men threw out some of the cargo .
44027019	A day later with their own hands they threw out the ship’s equipment .
44027020	When we could not see the sun or the stars for many days , and the storm was very bad , we lost all hope of being saved .
44027021	After the men had gone without food for a long time , Paul stood up before them and said , “ Men , you should have listened to me . You should not have sailed from Crete . Then you would not have all this trouble and loss .
44027022	But now I tell you to cheer up because none of you will die . Only the ship will be lost .
44027023	Last night an angel came to me from the God I belong to and worship .
44027024	The angel said , ‘ Paul , do not be afraid . You must stand before Caesar . And God has promised you that he will save the lives of everyone sailing with you . ’
44027025	So men , have courage . I trust in God that everything will happen as his angel told me .
44027026	But we will crash on an island . ”
44027027	On the fourteenth night we were still being carried around in the Adriatic Sea . About midnight the sailors thought we were close to land ,
44027028	so they lowered a rope with a weight on the end of it into the water . They found that the water was one hundred twenty feet deep . They went a little farther and lowered the rope again . It was ninety feet deep .
44027029	The sailors were afraid that we would hit the rocks , so they threw four anchors into the water and prayed for daylight to come .
44027030	Some of the sailors wanted to leave the ship , and they lowered the lifeboat , pretending they were throwing more anchors from the front of the ship .
44027031	But Paul told the officer and the other soldiers , “ If these men do not stay in the ship , your lives cannot be saved . ”
44027032	So the soldiers cut the ropes and let the lifeboat fall into the water .
44027033	Just before dawn Paul began persuading all the people to eat something . He said , “ For the past fourteen days you have been waiting and watching and not eating .
44027034	Now I beg you to eat something . You need it to stay alive . None of you will lose even one hair off your heads . ”
44027035	After he said this , Paul took some bread and thanked God for it before all of them . He broke off a piece and began eating .
44027036	They all felt better and started eating , too .
44027037	There were two hundred seventy-six people on the ship .
44027038	When they had eaten all they wanted , they began making the ship lighter by throwing the grain into the sea .
44027039	When daylight came , the sailors saw land . They did not know what land it was , but they saw a bay with a beach and wanted to sail the ship to the beach if they could .
44027040	So they cut the ropes to the anchors and left the anchors in the sea . At the same time , they untied the ropes that were holding the rudders . Then they raised the front sail into the wind and sailed toward the beach .
44027041	But the ship hit a sandbank . The front of the ship stuck there and could not move , but the back of the ship began to break up from the big waves .
44027042	The soldiers decided to kill the prisoners so none of them could swim away and escape .
44027043	But Julius , the officer , wanted to let Paul live and did not allow the soldiers to kill the prisoners . Instead he ordered everyone who could swim to jump into the water first and swim to land .
44027044	The rest were to follow using wooden boards or pieces of the ship . And this is how all the people made it safely to land .
44028001	When we were safe on land , we learned that the island was called Malta .
44028002	The people who lived there were very good to us . Because it was raining and very cold , they made a fire and welcomed all of us .
44028003	Paul gathered a pile of sticks and was putting them on the fire when a poisonous snake came out because of the heat and bit him on the hand .
44028004	The people living on the island saw the snake hanging from Paul’s hand and said to each other , “ This man must be a murderer ! He did not die in the sea , but Justice does not want him to live . ”
44028005	But Paul shook the snake off into the fire and was not hurt .
44028006	The people thought that Paul would swell up or fall down dead . They waited and watched him for a long time , but nothing bad happened to him . So they changed their minds and said , “ He is a god ! ”
44028007	There were some fields around there owned by Publius , an important man on the island . He welcomed us into his home and was very good to us for three days .
44028008	Publius’ father was sick with a fever and dysentery . Paul went to him , prayed , and put his hands on the man and healed him .
44028009	After this , all the other sick people on the island came to Paul , and he healed them , too .
44028012	We stopped at Syracuse for three days .
44028013	From there we sailed to Rhegium . The next day a wind began to blow from the south , and a day later we came to Puteoli .
44028014	We found some believers there who asked us to stay with them for a week . Finally , we came to Rome .
44028015	The believers in Rome heard that we were there and came out as far as the Market of Appius and the Three Inns to meet us . When Paul saw them , he was encouraged and thanked God .
44028016	When we arrived at Rome , Paul was allowed to live alone , with the soldier who guarded him .
44028017	Three days later Paul sent for the leaders there . When they came together , he said , “ Brothers , I have done nothing against our people or the customs of our ancestors . But I was arrested in Jerusalem and given to the Romans .
44028018	After they asked me many questions , they could find no reason why I should be killed . They wanted to let me go free ,
44028019	but the evil people there argued against that . So I had to ask to come to Rome to have my trial before Caesar . But I have no charge to bring against my own people .
44028020	That is why I wanted to see you and talk with you . I am bound with this chain because I believe in the hope of Israel . ”
44028021	They answered Paul , “ We have received no letters from Judea about you . None of our Jewish brothers who have come from there brought news or told us anything bad about you .
44028022	But we want to hear your ideas , because we know that people everywhere are speaking against this religious group . ”
44028023	Paul and the people chose a day for a meeting and on that day many more of the Jews met with Paul at the place he was staying . He spoke to them all day long . Using the law of Moses and the prophets’ writings , he explained the kingdom of God , and he tried to persuade them to believe these things about Jesus .
44028024	Some believed what Paul said , but others did not .
44028025	So they argued and began leaving after Paul said one more thing to them : “ The Holy Spirit spoke the truth to your ancestors through Isaiah the prophet , saying ,
44028026	‘ Go to this people and say : You will listen and listen , but you will not understand . You will look and look , but you will not learn ,
44028027	because these people have become stubborn . They don’t hear with their ears , and they have closed their eyes . Otherwise , they might really understand what they see with their eyes and hear with their ears . They might really understand in their minds and come back to me and be healed . ’
44028028	“ I want you to know that God has also sent his salvation to all nations , and they will listen ! ” [
44028029	After Paul said this , the Jews left . They were arguing very much with each other . ]
44028030	Paul stayed two full years in his own rented house and welcomed all people who came to visit him .
44028031	He boldly preached about the kingdom of God and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ , and no one stopped him .
45001001	From Paul , a servant of Christ Jesus . God called me to be an apostle and chose me to tell the Good News .
45001002	God promised this Good News long ago through his prophets , as it is written in the Holy Scriptures .
45001005	Through Christ , God gave me the special work of an apostle , which was to lead people of all nations to believe and obey . I do this work for him .
45001006	And you who are in Rome are also called to belong to Jesus Christ .
45001007	To all of you in Rome whom God loves and has called to be his holy people : Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
45001008	First I want to say that I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you , because people everywhere in the world are talking about your faith .
45001009	God , whom I serve with my whole heart by telling the Good News about his Son , knows that I always mention you
45001010	every time I pray . I pray that I will be allowed to come to you , and this will happen if God wants it .
45001011	I want very much to see you , to give you some spiritual gift to make you strong .
45001012	I mean that I want us to help each other with the faith we have . Your faith will help me , and my faith will help you .
45001013	Brothers and sisters , I want you to know that I planned many times to come to you , but this has not been possible . I wanted to come so that I could help you grow spiritually as I have helped the other non-Jewish people .
45001014	I have a duty to all people — Greeks and those who are not Greeks , the wise and the foolish .
45001015	That is why I want so much to preach the Good News to you in Rome .
45001016	I am not ashamed of the Good News , because it is the power God uses to save everyone who believes — to save the Jews first , and then to save non-Jews .
45001017	The Good News shows how God makes people right with himself — that it begins and ends with faith . As the Scripture says , “ But those who are right with God will live by faith . ”
45001018	God’s anger is shown from heaven against all the evil and wrong things people do . By their own evil lives they hide the truth .
45001019	God shows his anger because some knowledge of him has been made clear to them . Yes , God has shown himself to them .
45001020	There are things about him that people cannot see — his eternal power and all the things that make him God . But since the beginning of the world those things have been easy to understand by what God has made . So people have no excuse for the bad things they do .
45001021	They knew God , but they did not give glory to God or thank him . Their thinking became useless . Their foolish minds were filled with darkness .
45001022	They said they were wise , but they became fools .
45001023	They traded the glory of God who lives forever for the worship of idols made to look like earthly people , birds , animals , and snakes .
45001024	Because they did these things , God left them and let them go their sinful way , wanting only to do evil . As a result , they became full of sexual sin , using their bodies wrongly with each other .
45001025	They traded the truth of God for a lie . They worshiped and served what had been created instead of the God who created those things , who should be praised forever . Amen .
45001026	Because people did those things , God left them and let them do the shameful things they wanted to do . Women stopped having natural sex and started having sex with other women .
45001027	In the same way , men stopped having natural sex and began wanting each other . Men did shameful things with other men , and in their bodies they received the punishment for those wrongs .
45001028	People did not think it was important to have a true knowledge of God . So God left them and allowed them to have their own worthless thinking and to do things they should not do .
45001029	They are filled with every kind of sin , evil , selfishness , and hatred . They are full of jealousy , murder , fighting , lying , and thinking the worst about each other . They gossip
45001030	and say evil things about each other . They hate God . They are rude and conceited and brag about themselves . They invent ways of doing evil . They do not obey their parents .
45001031	They are foolish , they do not keep their promises , and they show no kindness or mercy to others .
45001032	They know God’s law says that those who live like this should die . But they themselves not only continue to do these evil things , they applaud others who do them .
45002001	If you think you can judge others , you are wrong . When you judge them , you are really judging yourself guilty , because you do the same things they do .
45002002	God judges those who do wrong things , and we know that his judging is right .
45002003	You judge those who do wrong , but you do wrong yourselves . Do you think you will be able to escape the judgment of God ?
45002004	He has been very kind and patient , waiting for you to change , but you think nothing of his kindness . Perhaps you do not understand that God is kind to you so you will change your hearts and lives .
45002005	But you are stubborn and refuse to change , so you are making your own punishment even greater on the day he shows his anger . On that day everyone will see God’s right judgments .
45002006	God will reward or punish every person for what that person has done .
45002007	Some people , by always continuing to do good , live for God’s glory , for honor , and for life that has no end . God will give them life forever .
45002008	But other people are selfish . They refuse to follow truth and , instead , follow evil . God will give them his punishment and anger .
45002009	He will give trouble and suffering to everyone who does evil — to the Jews first and also to those who are not Jews .
45002010	But he will give glory , honor , and peace to everyone who does good — to the Jews first and also to those who are not Jews .
45002011	For God judges all people in the same way .
45002012	People who do not have the law and who are sinners will be lost , although they do not have the law . And , in the same way , those who have the law and are sinners will be judged by the law .
45002013	Hearing the law does not make people right with God . It is those who obey the law who will be right with him .
45002014	( Those who are not Jews do not have the law , but when they freely do what the law commands , they are the law for themselves . This is true even though they do not have the law .
45002015	They show that in their hearts they know what is right and wrong , just as the law commands . And they show this by their consciences . Sometimes their thoughts tell them they did wrong , and sometimes their thoughts tell them they did right . )
45002016	All these things will happen on the day when God , through Christ Jesus , will judge people’s secret thoughts . The Good News that I preach says this .
45002017	What about you ? You call yourself a Jew . You trust in the law of Moses and brag that you are close to God .
45002018	You know what he wants you to do and what is important , because you have learned the law .
45002019	You think you are a guide for the blind and a light for those who are in darkness .
45002020	You think you can show foolish people what is right and teach those who know nothing . You have the law ; so you think you know everything and have all truth .
45002021	You teach others , so why don’t you teach yourself ? You tell others not to steal , but you steal .
45002022	You say that others must not take part in adultery , but you are guilty of that sin . You hate idols , but you steal from temples .
45002023	You brag about having God’s law , but you bring shame to God by breaking his law ,
45002024	just as the Scriptures say : “ Those who are not Jews speak against God’s name because of you . ”
45002025	If you follow the law , your circumcision has meaning . But if you break the law , it is as if you were never circumcised .
45002026	People who are not Jews are not circumcised , but if they do what the law says , it is as if they were circumcised .
45002027	You Jews have the written law and circumcision , but you break the law . So those who are not circumcised in their bodies , but still obey the law , will show that you are guilty .
45002028	They can do this because a person is not a true Jew if he is only a Jew in his physical body ; true circumcision is not only on the outside of the body .
45002029	A person is a Jew only if he is a Jew inside ; true circumcision is done in the heart by the Spirit , not by the written law . Such a person gets praise from God rather than from people .
45003001	So , do Jews have anything that other people do not have ? Is there anything special about being circumcised ?
45003002	Yes , of course , there is in every way . The most important thing is this : God trusted the Jews with his teachings .
45003003	If some Jews were not faithful to him , will that stop God from doing what he promised ?
45003004	No ! God will continue to be true even when every person is false . As the Scriptures say : “ So you will be shown to be right when you speak , and you will win your case . ”
45003005	When we do wrong , that shows more clearly that God is right . So can we say that God is wrong to punish us ? ( I am talking as people might talk . )
45003006	No ! If God could not punish us , he could not judge the world .
45003007	A person might say , “ When I lie , it really gives him glory , because my lie shows God’s truth . So why am I judged a sinner ? ”
45003008	It would be the same to say , “ We should do evil so that good will come . ” Some people find fault with us and say we teach this , but they are wrong and deserve the punishment they will receive .
45003009	So are we Jews better than others ? No ! We have already said that Jews and those who are not Jews are all guilty of sin .
45003010	As the Scriptures say : “ There is no one who always does what is right , not even one .
45003011	There is no one who understands . There is no one who looks to God for help .
45003012	All have turned away . Together , everyone has become useless . There is no one who does anything good ; there is not even one . ”
45003013	“ Their throats are like open graves ; they use their tongues for telling lies . ” “ Their words are like snake poison . ”
45003014	“ Their mouths are full of cursing and hate . ”
45003015	“ They are always ready to kill people .
45003016	Everywhere they go they cause ruin and misery .
45003017	They don’t know how to live in peace . ”
45003018	“ They have no fear of God . ”
45003019	We know that the law’s commands are for those who have the law . This stops all excuses and brings the whole world under God’s judgment ,
45003020	because no one can be made right with God by following the law . The law only shows us our sin .
45003021	But God has a way to make people right with him without the law , and he has now shown us that way which the law and the prophets told us about .
45003022	God makes people right with himself through their faith in Jesus Christ . This is true for all who believe in Christ , because all people are the same :
45003023	Everyone has sinned and fallen short of God’s glorious standard ,
45003024	and all need to be made right with God by his grace , which is a free gift . They need to be made free from sin through Jesus Christ .
45003025	God sent him to die in our place to take away our sins . We receive forgiveness through faith in the blood of Jesus’ death . This showed that God always does what is right and fair , as in the past when he was patient and did not punish people for their sins .
45003026	And God gave Jesus to show today that he does what is right . God did this so he could judge rightly and so he could make right any person who has faith in Jesus .
45003027	So do we have a reason to brag about ourselves ? No ! And why not ? It is the way of faith that stops all bragging , not the way of trying to obey the law .
45003028	A person is made right with God through faith , not through obeying the law .
45003029	Is God only the God of the Jews ? Is he not also the God of those who are not Jews ?
45003030	Of course he is , because there is only one God . He will make Jews right with him by their faith , and he will also make those who are not Jews right with him through their faith .
45003031	So do we destroy the law by following the way of faith ? No ! Faith causes us to be what the law truly wants .
45004001	So what can we say that Abraham , the father of our people , learned about faith ?
45004002	If Abraham was made right by the things he did , he had a reason to brag . But this is not God’s view ,
45004003	because the Scripture says , “ Abraham believed God , and God accepted Abraham’s faith , and that faith made him right with God . ”
45004004	When people work , their pay is not given as a gift , but as something earned .
45004005	But people cannot do any work that will make them right with God . So they must trust in him , who makes even evil people right in his sight . Then God accepts their faith , and that makes them right with him .
45004006	David said the same thing . He said that people are truly blessed when God , without paying attention to their deeds , makes people right with himself .
45004007	“ Blessed are they whose sins are forgiven , whose wrongs are pardoned .
45004008	Blessed is the person whom the Lord does not consider guilty . ”
45004009	Is this blessing only for those who are circumcised or also for those who are not circumcised ? We have already said that God accepted Abraham’s faith and that faith made him right with God .
45004010	So how did this happen ? Did God accept Abraham before or after he was circumcised ? It was before his circumcision .
45004011	Abraham was circumcised to show that he was right with God through faith before he was circumcised . So Abraham is the father of all those who believe but are not circumcised ; he is the father of all believers who are accepted as being right with God .
45004012	And Abraham is also the father of those who have been circumcised and who live following the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised .
45004013	Abraham and his descendants received the promise that they would get the whole world . He did not receive that promise through the law , but through being right with God by his faith .
45004014	If people could receive what God promised by following the law , then faith is worthless . And God’s promise to Abraham is worthless ,
45004015	because the law can only bring God’s anger . But if there is no law , there is nothing to disobey .
45004016	So people receive God’s promise by having faith . This happens so the promise can be a free gift . Then all of Abraham’s children can have that promise . It is not only for those who live under the law of Moses but for anyone who lives with faith like that of Abraham , who is the father of us all .
45004017	As it is written in the Scriptures : “ I am making you a father of many nations . ” This is true before God , the God Abraham believed , the God who gives life to the dead and who creates something out of nothing .
45004018	There was no hope that Abraham would have children . But Abraham believed God and continued hoping , and so he became the father of many nations . As God told him , “ Your descendants also will be too many to count . ”
45004019	Abraham was almost a hundred years old , much past the age for having children , and Sarah could not have children . Abraham thought about all this , but his faith in God did not become weak .
45004020	He never doubted that God would keep his promise , and he never stopped believing . He grew stronger in his faith and gave praise to God .
45004021	Abraham felt sure that God was able to do what he had promised .
45004022	So , “ God accepted Abraham’s faith , and that faith made him right with God . ”
45004023	Those words ( “ God accepted Abraham’s faith ” ) were written not only for Abraham
45004024	but also for us . God will accept us also because we believe in the One who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead .
45004025	Jesus was given to die for our sins , and he was raised from the dead to make us right with God .
45005001	Since we have been made right with God by our faith , we have peace with God . This happened through our Lord Jesus Christ ,
45005002	who through our faith has brought us into that blessing of God’s grace that we now enjoy . And we are happy because of the hope we have of sharing God’s glory .
45005003	We also have joy with our troubles , because we know that these troubles produce patience .
45005004	And patience produces character , and character produces hope .
45005005	And this hope will never disappoint us , because God has poured out his love to fill our hearts . He gave us his love through the Holy Spirit , whom God has given to us .
45005006	When we were unable to help ourselves , at the right time , Christ died for us , although we were living against God .
45005007	Very few people will die to save the life of someone else . Although perhaps for a good person someone might possibly die .
45005008	But God shows his great love for us in this way : Christ died for us while we were still sinners .
45005009	So through Christ we will surely be saved from God’s anger , because we have been made right with God by the blood of Christ’s death .
45005010	While we were God’s enemies , he made us his friends through the death of his Son . Surely , now that we are his friends , he will save us through his Son’s life .
45005011	And not only that , but now we are also very happy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ . Through him we are now God’s friends again .
45005012	Sin came into the world because of what one man did , and with sin came death . This is why everyone must die — because everyone sinned .
45005013	Sin was in the world before the law of Moses , but sin is not counted against us as breaking a command when there is no law .
45005014	But from the time of Adam to the time of Moses , everyone had to die , even those who had not sinned by breaking a command , as Adam had . Adam was like the One who was coming in the future .
45005015	But God’s free gift is not like Adam’s sin . Many people died because of the sin of that one man . But the grace from God was much greater ; many people received God’s gift of life by the grace of the one man , Jesus Christ .
45005016	After Adam sinned once , he was judged guilty . But the gift of God is different . God’s free gift came after many sins , and it makes people right with God .
45005017	One man sinned , and so death ruled all people because of that one man . But now those people who accept God’s full grace and the great gift of being made right with him will surely have true life and rule through the one man , Jesus Christ .
45005018	So as one sin of Adam brought the punishment of death to all people , one good act that Christ did makes all people right with God . And that brings true life for all .
45005019	One man disobeyed God , and many became sinners . In the same way , one man obeyed God , and many will be made right .
45005020	The law came to make sin worse . But when sin grew worse , God’s grace increased .
45005021	Sin once used death to rule us , but God gave people more of his grace so that grace could rule by making people right with him . And this brings life forever through Jesus Christ our Lord .
45006001	So do you think we should continue sinning so that God will give us even more grace ?
45006002	No ! We died to our old sinful lives , so how can we continue living with sin ?
45006003	Did you forget that all of us became part of Christ when we were baptized ? We shared his death in our baptism .
45006004	When we were baptized , we were buried with Christ and shared his death . So , just as Christ was raised from the dead by the wonderful power of the Father , we also can live a new life .
45006005	Christ died , and we have been joined with him by dying too . So we will also be joined with him by rising from the dead as he did .
45006006	We know that our old life died with Christ on the cross so that our sinful selves would have no power over us and we would not be slaves to sin .
45006007	Anyone who has died is made free from sin’s control .
45006008	If we died with Christ , we know we will also live with him .
45006009	Christ was raised from the dead , and we know that he cannot die again . Death has no power over him now .
45006010	Yes , when Christ died , he died to defeat the power of sin one time — enough for all time . He now has a new life , and his new life is with God .
45006011	In the same way , you should see yourselves as being dead to the power of sin and alive with God through Christ Jesus .
45006012	So , do not let sin control your life here on earth so that you do what your sinful self wants to do .
45006013	Do not offer the parts of your body to serve sin , as things to be used in doing evil . Instead , offer yourselves to God as people who have died and now live . Offer the parts of your body to God to be used in doing good .
45006014	Sin will not be your master , because you are not under law but under God’s grace .
45006015	So what should we do ? Should we sin because we are under grace and not under law ? No !
45006016	Surely you know that when you give yourselves like slaves to obey someone , then you are really slaves of that person . The person you obey is your master . You can follow sin , which brings spiritual death , or you can obey God , which makes you right with him .
45006017	In the past you were slaves to sin — sin controlled you . But thank God , you fully obeyed the things that you were taught .
45006018	You were made free from sin , and now you are slaves to goodness .
45006019	I use this example because this is hard for you to understand . In the past you offered the parts of your body to be slaves to sin and evil ; you lived only for evil . In the same way now you must give yourselves to be slaves of goodness . Then you will live only for God .
45006020	In the past you were slaves to sin , and goodness did not control you .
45006021	You did evil things , and now you are ashamed of them . Those things only bring death .
45006022	But now you are free from sin and have become slaves of God . This brings you a life that is only for God , and this gives you life forever .
45006023	The payment for sin is death . But God gives us the free gift of life forever in Christ Jesus our Lord .
45007001	Brothers and sisters , all of you understand the law of Moses . So surely you know that the law rules over people only while they are alive .
45007002	For example , a woman must stay married to her husband as long as he is alive . But if her husband dies , she is free from the law of marriage .
45007003	But if she marries another man while her husband is still alive , the law says she is guilty of adultery . But if her husband dies , she is free from the law of marriage . Then if she marries another man , she is not guilty of adultery .
45007004	In the same way , my brothers and sisters , your old selves died , and you became free from the law through the body of Christ . This happened so that you might belong to someone else — the One who was raised from the dead — and so that we might be used in service to God .
45007005	In the past , we were ruled by our sinful selves . The law made us want to do sinful things that controlled our bodies , so the things we did were bringing us death .
45007006	In the past , the law held us like prisoners , but our old selves died , and we were made free from the law . So now we serve God in a new way with the Spirit , and not in the old way with written rules .
45007007	You might think I am saying that sin and the law are the same thing . That is not true . But the law was the only way I could learn what sin meant . I would never have known what it means to want to take something belonging to someone else if the law had not said , “ You must not want to take your neighbor’s things . ”
45007008	And sin found a way to use that command and cause me to want all kinds of things I should not want . But without the law , sin has no power .
45007009	I was alive before I knew the law . But when the law’s command came to me , then sin began to live ,
45007010	and I died . The command was meant to bring life , but for me it brought death .
45007011	Sin found a way to fool me by using the command to make me die .
45007012	So the law is holy , and the command is holy and right and good .
45007013	Does this mean that something that is good brought death to me ? No ! Sin used something that is good to bring death to me . This happened so that I could see what sin is really like ; the command was used to show that sin is very evil .
45007014	We know that the law is spiritual , but I am not spiritual since sin rules me as if I were its slave .
45007015	I do not understand the things I do . I do not do what I want to do , and I do the things I hate .
45007016	And if I do not want to do the hated things I do , that means I agree that the law is good .
45007017	But I am not really the one who is doing these hated things ; it is sin living in me that does them .
45007018	Yes , I know that nothing good lives in me — I mean nothing good lives in the part of me that is earthly and sinful . I want to do the things that are good , but I do not do them .
45007019	I do not do the good things I want to do , but I do the bad things I do not want to do .
45007020	So if I do things I do not want to do , then I am not the one doing them . It is sin living in me that does those things .
45007021	So I have learned this rule : When I want to do good , evil is there with me .
45007022	In my mind , I am happy with God’s law .
45007023	But I see another law working in my body , which makes war against the law that my mind accepts . That other law working in my body is the law of sin , and it makes me its prisoner .
45007024	What a miserable man I am ! Who will save me from this body that brings me death ?
45007025	I thank God for saving me through Jesus Christ our Lord ! So in my mind I am a slave to God’s law , but in my sinful self I am a slave to the law of sin .
45008001	So now , those who are in Christ Jesus are not judged guilty .
45008002	Through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit that brings life made you free from the law that brings sin and death .
45008003	The law was without power , because the law was made weak by our sinful selves . But God did what the law could not do . He sent his own Son to earth with the same human life that others use for sin . By sending his Son to be an offering for sin , God used a human life to destroy sin .
45008004	He did this so that we could be the kind of people the law correctly wants us to be . Now we do not live following our sinful selves , but we live following the Spirit .
45008005	Those who live following their sinful selves think only about things that their sinful selves want . But those who live following the Spirit are thinking about the things the Spirit wants them to do .
45008006	If people’s thinking is controlled by the sinful self , there is death . But if their thinking is controlled by the Spirit , there is life and peace .
45008007	When people’s thinking is controlled by the sinful self , they are against God , because they refuse to obey God’s law and really are not even able to obey God’s law .
45008008	Those people who are ruled by their sinful selves cannot please God .
45008009	But you are not ruled by your sinful selves . You are ruled by the Spirit , if that Spirit of God really lives in you . But the person who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to Christ .
45008010	Your body will always be dead because of sin . But if Christ is in you , then the Spirit gives you life , because Christ made you right with God .
45008011	God raised Jesus from the dead , and if God’s Spirit is living in you , he will also give life to your bodies that die . God is the One who raised Christ from the dead , and he will give life through his Spirit that lives in you .
45008012	So , my brothers and sisters , we must not be ruled by our sinful selves or live the way our sinful selves want .
45008013	If you use your lives to do the wrong things your sinful selves want , you will die spiritually . But if you use the Spirit’s help to stop doing the wrong things you do with your body , you will have true life .
45008014	The true children of God are those who let God’s Spirit lead them .
45008015	The Spirit we received does not make us slaves again to fear ; it makes us children of God . With that Spirit we cry out , “ Father . ”
45008016	And the Spirit himself joins with our spirits to say we are God’s children .
45008017	If we are God’s children , we will receive blessings from God together with Christ . But we must suffer as Christ suffered so that we will have glory as Christ has glory .
45008018	The sufferings we have now are nothing compared to the great glory that will be shown to us .
45008019	Everything God made is waiting with excitement for God to show his children’s glory completely .
45008020	Everything God made was changed to become useless , not by its own wish but because God wanted it and because all along there was this hope :
45008021	that everything God made would be set free from ruin to have the freedom and glory that belong to God’s children .
45008022	We know that everything God made has been waiting until now in pain , like a woman ready to give birth .
45008023	Not only the world , but we also have been waiting with pain inside us . We have the Spirit as the first part of God’s promise . So we are waiting for God to finish making us his own children , which means our bodies will be made free .
45008024	We were saved , and we have this hope . If we see what we are waiting for , that is not really hope . People do not hope for something they already have .
45008025	But we are hoping for something we do not have yet , and we are waiting for it patiently .
45008026	Also , the Spirit helps us with our weakness . We do not know how to pray as we should . But the Spirit himself speaks to God for us , even begs God for us with deep feelings that words cannot explain .
45008027	God can see what is in people’s hearts . And he knows what is in the mind of the Spirit , because the Spirit speaks to God for his people in the way God wants .
45008028	We know that in everything God works for the good of those who love him . They are the people he called , because that was his plan .
45008029	God knew them before he made the world , and he chose them to be like his Son so that Jesus would be the firstborn of many brothers and sisters .
45008030	God planned for them to be like his Son ; and those he planned to be like his Son , he also called ; and those he called , he also made right with him ; and those he made right , he also glorified .
45008031	So what should we say about this ? If God is for us , no one can defeat us .
45008032	He did not spare his own Son but gave him for us all . So with Jesus , God will surely give us all things .
45008033	Who can accuse the people God has chosen ? No one , because God is the One who makes them right .
45008034	Who can say God’s people are guilty ? No one , because Christ Jesus died , but he was also raised from the dead , and now he is on God’s right side , appealing to God for us .
45008035	Can anything separate us from the love Christ has for us ? Can troubles or problems or sufferings or hunger or nakedness or danger or violent death ?
45008036	As it is written in the Scriptures : “ For you we are in danger of death all the time . People think we are worth no more than sheep to be killed . ”
45008037	But in all these things we are completely victorious through God who showed his love for us .
45008038	Yes , I am sure that neither death , nor life , nor angels , nor ruling spirits , nothing now , nothing in the future , no powers ,
45008039	nothing above us , nothing below us , nor anything else in the whole world will ever be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord .
45009001	I am in Christ , and I am telling you the truth ; I do not lie . My conscience is ruled by the Holy Spirit , and it tells me I am not lying .
45009002	I have great sorrow and always feel much sadness .
45009003	I wish I could help my Jewish brothers and sisters , my people . I would even wish that I were cursed and cut off from Christ if that would help them .
45009004	They are the people of Israel , God’s chosen children . They have seen the glory of God , and they have the agreements that God made between himself and his people . God gave them the law of Moses and the right way of worship and his promises .
45009005	They are the descendants of our great ancestors , and they are the earthly family into which Christ was born , who is God over all . Praise him forever ! Amen .
45009006	It is not that God failed to keep his promise to them . But only some of the people of Israel are truly God’s people ,
45009007	and only some of Abraham’s descendants are true children of Abraham . But God said to Abraham : “ The descendants I promised you will be from Isaac . ”
45009008	This means that not all of Abraham’s descendants are God’s true children . Abraham’s true children are those who become God’s children because of the promise God made to Abraham .
45009009	God’s promise to Abraham was this : “ At the right time I will return , and Sarah will have a son . ”
45009010	And that is not all . Rebekah’s sons had the same father , our father Isaac .
45009013	As the Scripture says , “ I loved Jacob , but I hated Esau . ”
45009014	So what should we say about this ? Is God unfair ? In no way .
45009015	God said to Moses , “ I will show kindness to anyone to whom I want to show kindness , and I will show mercy to anyone to whom I want to show mercy . ”
45009016	So God will choose the one to whom he decides to show mercy ; his choice does not depend on what people want or try to do .
45009017	The Scripture says to the king of Egypt : “ I made you king for this reason : to show my power in you so that my name will be talked about in all the earth . ”
45009018	So God shows mercy where he wants to show mercy , and he makes stubborn the people he wants to make stubborn .
45009019	So one of you will ask me : “ Then why does God blame us for our sins ? Who can fight his will ? ”
45009020	You are only human , and human beings have no right to question God . An object should not ask the person who made it , “ Why did you make me like this ? ”
45009021	The potter can make anything he wants to make . He can use the same clay to make one thing for special use and another thing for daily use .
45009022	It is the same way with God . He wanted to show his anger and to let people see his power . But he patiently stayed with those people he was angry with — people who were made ready to be destroyed .
45009023	He waited with patience so that he could make known his rich glory to the people who receive his mercy . He has prepared these people to have his glory ,
45009024	and we are those people whom God called . He called us not from the Jews only but also from those who are not Jews .
45009025	As the Scripture says in Hosea : “ I will say , ‘ You are my people ’ to those I had called ‘ not my people . ’ And I will show my love to those people I did not love . ”
45009026	“ They were called , ‘ You are not my people , ’ but later they will be called ‘ children of the living God . ’ ”
45009027	And Isaiah cries out about Israel : “ The people of Israel are many , like the grains of sand by the sea . But only a few of them will be saved ,
45009028	because the Lord will quickly and completely punish the people on the earth . ”
45009029	It is as Isaiah said : “ The Lord All-Powerful allowed a few of our descendants to live . Otherwise we would have been completely destroyed like the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah . ”
45009030	So what does all this mean ? Those who are not Jews were not trying to make themselves right with God , but they were made right with God because of their faith .
45009031	The people of Israel tried to follow a law to make themselves right with God . But they did not succeed ,
45009032	because they tried to make themselves right by the things they did instead of trusting in God to make them right . They stumbled over the stone that causes people to stumble .
45009033	As it is written in the Scripture : “ I will put in Jerusalem a stone that causes people to stumble , a rock that makes them fall . Anyone who trusts in him will never be disappointed . ”
45010001	Brothers and sisters , the thing I want most is for all the Jews to be saved . That is my prayer to God .
45010002	I can say this about them : They really try to follow God , but they do not know the right way .
45010003	Because they did not know the way that God makes people right with him , they tried to make themselves right in their own way . So they did not accept God’s way of making people right .
45010004	Christ ended the law so that everyone who believes in him may be right with God .
45010005	Moses writes about being made right by following the law . He says , “ A person who obeys these things will live because of them . ”
45010006	But this is what the Scripture says about being made right through faith : “ Don’t say to yourself , ‘ Who will go up into heaven ? ’ ” ( That means , “ Who will go up to heaven and bring Christ down to earth ? ” )
45010007	“ And do not say , ‘ Who will go down into the world below ? ’ ” ( That means , “ Who will go down and bring Christ up from the dead ? ” )
45010008	This is what the Scripture says : “ The word is near you ; it is in your mouth and in your heart . ” That is the teaching of faith that we are telling .
45010009	If you declare with your mouth , “ Jesus is Lord , ” and if you believe in your heart that God raised Jesus from the dead , you will be saved .
45010010	We believe with our hearts , and so we are made right with God . And we declare with our mouths that we believe , and so we are saved .
45010011	As the Scripture says , “ Anyone who trusts in him will never be disappointed . ”
45010012	That Scripture says “ anyone ” because there is no difference between those who are Jews and those who are not . The same Lord is the Lord of all and gives many blessings to all who trust in him ,
45010013	as the Scripture says , “ Anyone who calls on the Lord will be saved . ”
45010014	But before people can ask the Lord for help , they must believe in him ; and before they can believe in him , they must hear about him ; and for them to hear about the Lord , someone must tell them ;
45010015	and before someone can go and tell them , that person must be sent . It is written , “ How beautiful is the person who comes to bring good news . ”
45010016	But not all the Jews accepted the good news . Isaiah said , “ Lord , who believed what we told them ? ”
45010017	So faith comes from hearing the Good News , and people hear the Good News when someone tells them about Christ .
45010018	But I ask : Didn’t people hear the Good News ? Yes , they heard — as the Scripture says : “ Their message went out through all the world ; their words go everywhere on earth . ”
45010019	Again I ask : Didn’t the people of Israel understand ? Yes , they did understand . First , Moses says : “ I will use those who are not a nation to make you jealous . I will use a nation that does not understand to make you angry . ”
45010020	Then Isaiah is bold enough to say : “ I was found by those who were not asking me for help . I made myself known to people who were not looking for me . ”
45010021	But about Israel God says , “ All day long I stood ready to accept people who disobey and are stubborn . ”
45011001	So I ask : Did God throw out his people ? No ! I myself am an Israelite from the family of Abraham , from the tribe of Benjamin .
45011002	God chose the Israelites to be his people before they were born , and he has not thrown his people out . Surely you know what the Scripture says about Elijah , how he prayed to God against the people of Israel .
45011003	“ Lord , ” he said , “ they have killed your prophets , and they have destroyed your altars . I am the only prophet left , and now they are trying to kill me , too . ”
45011004	But what answer did God give Elijah ? He said , “ But I have left seven thousand people in Israel who have never bowed down before Baal . ”
45011005	It is the same now . There are a few people that God has chosen by his grace .
45011006	And if he chose them by grace , it is not for the things they have done . If they could be made God’s people by what they did , God’s gift of grace would not really be a gift .
45011007	So this is what has happened : Although the Israelites tried to be right with God , they did not succeed , but the ones God chose did become right with him . The others were made stubborn and refused to listen to God .
45011008	As it is written in the Scriptures : “ God gave the people a dull mind so they could not understand . ” “ He closed their eyes so they could not see and their ears so they could not hear . This continues until today . ”
45011009	And David says : “ Let their own feasts trap them and cause their ruin ; let their feasts cause them to stumble and be paid back .
45011010	Let their eyes be closed so they cannot see and their backs be forever weak from troubles . ”
45011011	So I ask : When the Jews fell , did that fall destroy them ? No ! But their failure brought salvation to those who are not Jews , in order to make the Jews jealous .
45011012	The Jews’ failure brought rich blessings for the world , and the Jews’ loss brought rich blessings for the non-Jewish people . So surely the world will receive much richer blessings when enough Jews become the kind of people God wants .
45011013	Now I am speaking to you who are not Jews . I am an apostle to those who are not Jews , and since I have that work , I will make the most of it .
45011014	I hope I can make my own people jealous and , in that way , help some of them to be saved .
45011015	When God turned away from the Jews , he became friends with other people in the world . So when God accepts the Jews , surely that will bring them life after death .
45011016	If the first piece of bread is offered to God , then the whole loaf is made holy . If the roots of a tree are holy , then the tree’s branches are holy too .
45011017	It is as if some of the branches from an olive tree have been broken off . You non-Jewish people are like the branch of a wild olive tree that has been joined to that first tree . You now share the strength and life of the first tree , the Jews .
45011018	So do not brag about those branches that were broken off . If you brag , remember that you do not support the root , but the root supports you .
45011019	You will say , “ Branches were broken off so that I could be joined to their tree . ”
45011020	That is true . But those branches were broken off because they did not believe , and you continue to be part of the tree only because you believe . Do not be proud , but be afraid .
45011021	If God did not let the natural branches of that tree stay , then he will not let you stay if you don’t believe .
45011022	So you see that God is kind and also very strict . He punishes those who stop following him . But God is kind to you , if you continue following in his kindness . If you do not , you will be cut off from the tree .
45011023	And if the Jews will believe in God again , he will accept them back . God is able to put them back where they were .
45011024	It is not natural for a wild branch to be part of a good tree . And you who are not Jews are like a branch cut from a wild olive tree and joined to a good olive tree . But since those Jews are like a branch that grew from the good tree , surely they can be joined to their own tree again .
45011025	I want you to understand this secret , brothers and sisters , so you will understand that you do not know everything : Part of Israel has been made stubborn , but that will change when many who are not Jews have come to God .
45011026	And that is how all Israel will be saved . It is written in the Scriptures : “ The Savior will come from Jerusalem ; he will take away all evil from the family of Jacob .
45011027	And I will make this agreement with those people when I take away their sins . ”
45011028	The Jews refuse to accept the Good News , so they are God’s enemies . This has happened to help you who are not Jews . But the Jews are still God’s chosen people , and he loves them very much because of the promises he made to their ancestors .
45011029	God never changes his mind about the people he calls and the things he gives them .
45011030	At one time you refused to obey God . But now you have received mercy , because those people refused to obey .
45011031	And now the Jews refuse to obey , because God showed mercy to you . But this happened so that they also can receive mercy from him .
45011032	God has given all people over to their stubborn ways so that he can show mercy to all .
45011033	Yes , God’s riches are very great , and his wisdom and knowledge have no end ! No one can explain the things God decides or understand his ways .
45011034	As the Scripture says , “ Who has known the mind of the Lord , or who has been able to give him advice ? ”
45011035	“ No one has ever given God anything that he must pay back . ”
45011036	Yes , God made all things , and everything continues through him and for him . To him be the glory forever ! Amen .
45012001	So brothers and sisters , since God has shown us great mercy , I beg you to offer your lives as a living sacrifice to him . Your offering must be only for God and pleasing to him , which is the spiritual way for you to worship .
45012002	Do not be shaped by this world ; instead be changed within by a new way of thinking . Then you will be able to decide what God wants for you ; you will know what is good and pleasing to him and what is perfect .
45012003	Because God has given me a special gift , I have something to say to everyone among you . Do not think you are better than you are . You must decide what you really are by the amount of faith God has given you .
45012004	Each one of us has a body with many parts , and these parts all have different uses .
45012005	In the same way , we are many , but in Christ we are all one body . Each one is a part of that body , and each part belongs to all the other parts .
45012006	We all have different gifts , each of which came because of the grace God gave us . The person who has the gift of prophecy should use that gift in agreement with the faith .
45012007	Anyone who has the gift of serving should serve . Anyone who has the gift of teaching should teach .
45012008	Whoever has the gift of encouraging others should encourage . Whoever has the gift of giving to others should give freely . Anyone who has the gift of being a leader should try hard when he leads . Whoever has the gift of showing mercy to others should do so with joy .
45012009	Your love must be real . Hate what is evil , and hold on to what is good .
45012010	Love each other like brothers and sisters . Give each other more honor than you want for yourselves .
45012011	Do not be lazy but work hard , serving the Lord with all your heart .
45012012	Be joyful because you have hope . Be patient when trouble comes , and pray at all times .
45012013	Share with God’s people who need help . Bring strangers in need into your homes .
45012014	Wish good for those who harm you ; wish them well and do not curse them .
45012015	Be happy with those who are happy , and be sad with those who are sad .
45012016	Live in peace with each other . Do not be proud , but make friends with those who seem unimportant . Do not think how smart you are .
45012017	If someone does wrong to you , do not pay him back by doing wrong to him . Try to do what everyone thinks is right .
45012018	Do your best to live in peace with everyone .
45012019	My friends , do not try to punish others when they wrong you , but wait for God to punish them with his anger . It is written : “ I will punish those who do wrong ; I will repay them , ” says the Lord .
45012020	But you should do this : “ If your enemy is hungry , feed him ; if he is thirsty , give him a drink . Doing this will be like pouring burning coals on his head . ”
45012021	Do not let evil defeat you , but defeat evil by doing good .
45013001	All of you must yield to the government rulers . No one rules unless God has given him the power to rule , and no one rules now without that power from God .
45013002	So those who are against the government are really against what God has commanded . And they will bring punishment on themselves .
45013003	Those who do right do not have to fear the rulers ; only those who do wrong fear them . Do you want to be unafraid of the rulers ? Then do what is right , and they will praise you .
45013004	The ruler is God’s servant to help you . But if you do wrong , then be afraid . He has the power to punish ; he is God’s servant to punish those who do wrong .
45013005	So you must yield to the government , not only because you might be punished , but because you know it is right .
45013006	This is also why you pay taxes . Rulers are working for God and give their time to their work .
45013007	Pay everyone , then , what you owe . If you owe any kind of tax , pay it . Show respect and honor to them all .
45013008	Do not owe people anything , except always owe love to each other , because the person who loves others has obeyed all the law .
45013009	The law says , “ You must not be guilty of adultery . You must not murder anyone . You must not steal . You must not want to take your neighbor’s things . ” All these commands and all others are really only one rule : “ Love your neighbor as you love yourself . ”
45013010	Love never hurts a neighbor , so loving is obeying all the law .
45013011	Do this because we live in an important time . It is now time for you to wake up from your sleep , because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed .
45013012	The “ night ” is almost finished , and the “ day ” is almost here . So we should stop doing things that belong to darkness and take up the weapons used for fighting in the light .
45013013	Let us live in a right way , like people who belong to the day . We should not have wild parties or get drunk . There should be no sexual sins of any kind , no fighting or jealousy .
45013014	But clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ and forget about satisfying your sinful self .
45014001	Accept into your group someone who is weak in faith , and do not argue about opinions .
45014002	One person believes it is right to eat all kinds of food . But another , who is weak , believes it is right to eat only vegetables .
45014003	The one who knows that it is right to eat any kind of food must not reject the one who eats only vegetables . And the person who eats only vegetables must not think that the one who eats all foods is wrong , because God has accepted that person .
45014004	You cannot judge another person’s servant . The master decides if the servant is doing well or not . And the Lord’s servant will do well because the Lord helps him do well .
45014005	Some think that one day is more important than another , and others think that every day is the same . Let all be sure in their own mind .
45014006	Those who think one day is more important than other days are doing that for the Lord . And those who eat all kinds of food are doing that for the Lord , and they give thanks to God . Others who refuse to eat some foods do that for the Lord , and they give thanks to God .
45014007	We do not live or die for ourselves .
45014008	If we live , we are living for the Lord , and if we die , we are dying for the Lord . So living or dying , we belong to the Lord .
45014009	The reason Christ died and rose from the dead to live again was so he would be Lord over both the dead and the living .
45014010	So why do you judge your brothers or sisters in Christ ? And why do you think you are better than they are ? We will all stand before God to be judged ,
45014011	because it is written in the Scriptures : “ ‘ As surely as I live , ’ says the Lord , ‘ Everyone will bow before me ; everyone will say that I am God . ’ ”
45014012	So each of us will have to answer to God .
45014013	For that reason we should stop judging each other . We must make up our minds not to do anything that will make another Christian sin .
45014014	I am in the Lord Jesus , and I know that there is no food that is wrong to eat . But if a person believes something is wrong , that thing is wrong for him .
45014015	If you hurt your brother’s or sister’s faith because of something you eat , you are not really following the way of love . Do not destroy someone’s faith by eating food he thinks is wrong , because Christ died for him .
45014016	Do not allow what you think is good to become what others say is evil .
45014017	In the kingdom of God , eating and drinking are not important . The important things are living right with God , peace , and joy in the Holy Spirit .
45014018	Anyone who serves Christ by living this way is pleasing God and will be accepted by other people .
45014019	So let us try to do what makes peace and helps one another .
45014020	Do not let the eating of food destroy the work of God . All foods are all right to eat , but it is wrong to eat food that causes someone else to sin .
45014021	It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that will cause your brother or sister to sin .
45014022	Your beliefs about these things should be kept secret between you and God . People are happy if they can do what they think is right without feeling guilty .
45014023	But those who eat something without being sure it is right are wrong because they did not believe it was right . Anything that is done without believing it is right is a sin .
45015001	We who are strong in faith should help the weak with their weaknesses , and not please only ourselves .
45015002	Let each of us please our neighbors for their good , to help them be stronger in faith .
45015003	Even Christ did not live to please himself . It was as the Scriptures said : “ When people insult you , it hurts me . ”
45015004	Everything that was written in the past was written to teach us . The Scriptures give us patience and encouragement so that we can have hope .
45015005	May the patience and encouragement that come from God allow you to live in harmony with each other the way Christ Jesus wants .
45015006	Then you will all be joined together , and you will give glory to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
45015007	Christ accepted you , so you should accept each other , which will bring glory to God .
45015008	I tell you that Christ became a servant of the Jews to show that God’s promises to the Jewish ancestors are true .
45015009	And he also did this so that those who are not Jews could give glory to God for the mercy he gives to them . It is written in the Scriptures : “ So I will praise you among the non-Jewish people . I will sing praises to your name . ”
45015010	The Scripture also says , “ Be happy , you who are not Jews , together with his people . ”
45015011	Again the Scripture says , “ All you who are not Jews , praise the Lord . All you people , sing praises to him . ”
45015012	And Isaiah says , “ A new king will come from the family of Jesse . He will come to rule over the non-Jewish people , and they will have hope because of him . ”
45015013	I pray that the God who gives hope will fill you with much joy and peace while you trust in him . Then your hope will overflow by the power of the Holy Spirit .
45015014	My brothers and sisters , I am sure that you are full of goodness . I know that you have all the knowledge you need and that you are able to teach each other .
45015015	But I have written to you very openly about some things I wanted you to remember . I did this because God gave me this special gift :
45015016	to be a minister of Christ Jesus to those who are not Jews . I served God by teaching his Good News , so that the non-Jewish people could be an offering that God would accept — an offering made holy by the Holy Spirit .
45015017	So I am proud of what I have done for God in Christ Jesus .
45015018	I will not talk about anything except what Christ has done through me in leading those who are not Jews to obey God . They have obeyed God because of what I have said and done ,
45015019	because of the power of miracles and the great things they saw , and because of the power of the Holy Spirit . I preached the Good News from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum , and so I have finished that part of my work .
45015020	I always want to preach the Good News in places where people have never heard of Christ , because I do not want to build on the work someone else has already started .
45015021	But it is written in the Scriptures : “ Those who were not told about him will see , and those who have not heard about him will understand . ”
45015022	This is the reason I was stopped many times from coming to you .
45015023	Now I have finished my work here . Since for many years I have wanted to come to you ,
45015024	I hope to visit you on my way to Spain . After I enjoy being with you for a while , I hope you can help me on my trip .
45015025	Now I am going to Jerusalem to help God’s people .
45015026	The believers in Macedonia and Southern Greece were happy to give their money to help the poor among God’s people at Jerusalem .
45015027	They were happy to do this , and really they owe it to them . These who are not Jews have shared in the Jews’ spiritual blessings , so they should use their material possessions to help the Jews .
45015028	After I am sure the poor in Jerusalem get the money that has been given for them , I will leave for Spain and stop and visit you .
45015029	I know that when I come to you I will bring Christ’s full blessing .
45015030	Brothers and sisters , I beg you to help me in my work by praying to God for me . Do this because of our Lord Jesus and the love that the Holy Spirit gives us .
45015031	Pray that I will be saved from the nonbelievers in Judea and that this help I bring to Jerusalem will please God’s people there .
45015032	Then , if God wants me to , I will come to you with joy , and together you and I will have a time of rest .
45015033	The God who gives peace be with you all . Amen .
45016001	I recommend to you our sister Phoebe , who is a helper in the church in Cenchrea .
45016002	I ask you to accept her in the Lord in the way God’s people should . Help her with anything she needs , because she has helped me and many other people also .
45016003	Give my greetings to Priscilla and Aquila , who work together with me in Christ Jesus
45016004	and who risked their own lives to save my life . I am thankful to them , and all the non-Jewish churches are thankful as well .
45016005	Also , greet for me the church that meets at their house . Greetings to my dear friend Epenetus , who was the first person in Asia to follow Christ .
45016006	Greetings to Mary , who worked very hard for you .
45016007	Greetings to Andronicus and Junia , my relatives , who were in prison with me . They are very important apostles . They were believers in Christ before I was .
45016008	Greetings to Ampliatus , my dear friend in the Lord .
45016009	Greetings to Urbanus , a worker together with me for Christ . And greetings to my dear friend Stachys .
45016010	Greetings to Apelles , who was tested and proved that he truly loves Christ . Greetings to all those who are in the family of Aristobulus .
45016011	Greetings to Herodion , my fellow citizen . Greetings to all those in the family of Narcissus who belong to the Lord .
45016012	Greetings to Tryphena and Tryphosa , women who work very hard for the Lord . Greetings to my dear friend Persis , who also has worked very hard for the Lord .
45016013	Greetings to Rufus , who is a special person in the Lord , and to his mother , who has been like a mother to me also .
45016014	Greetings to Asyncritus , Phlegon , Hermes , Patrobas , Hermas , and all the brothers and sisters who are with them .
45016015	Greetings to Philologus and Julia , Nereus and his sister , and Olympas , and to all God’s people with them .
45016016	Greet each other with a holy kiss . All of Christ’s churches send greetings to you .
45016017	Brothers and sisters , I ask you to look out for those who cause people to be against each other and who upset other people’s faith . They are against the true teaching you learned , so stay away from them .
45016018	Such people are not serving our Lord Christ but are only doing what pleases themselves . They use fancy talk and fine words to fool the minds of those who do not know about evil .
45016019	All the believers have heard that you obey , so I am very happy because of you . But I want you to be wise in what is good and innocent in what is evil .
45016020	The God who brings peace will soon defeat Satan and give you power over him . The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you .
45016021	Timothy , a worker together with me , sends greetings , as well as Lucius , Jason , and Sosipater , my relatives .
45016022	I am Tertius , and I am writing this letter from Paul . I send greetings to you in the Lord .
45016023	Gaius is letting me and the whole church here use his home . He also sends greetings to you , as do Erastus , the city treasurer , and our brother Quartus . [
45016024	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you . Amen . ]
45016025	Glory to God who can make you strong in faith by the Good News that I tell people and by the message about Jesus Christ . The message about Christ is the secret that was hidden for long ages past but is now made known .
45016026	It has been made clear through the writings of the prophets . And by the command of the eternal God it is made known to all nations that they might believe and obey .
45016027	To the only wise God be glory forever through Jesus Christ ! Amen .
46001001	From Paul . God called me to be an apostle of Christ Jesus because that is what God wanted . Also from Sosthenes , our brother in Christ .
46001002	To the church of God in Corinth , to you who have been made holy in Christ Jesus . You were called to be God’s holy people with all people everywhere who pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ — their Lord and ours :
46001003	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
46001004	I always thank my God for you because of the grace God has given you in Christ Jesus .
46001005	I thank God because in Christ you have been made rich in every way , in all your speaking and in all your knowledge .
46001006	Just as our witness about Christ has been guaranteed to you ,
46001007	so you have every gift from God while you wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to come again .
46001008	Jesus will keep you strong until the end so that there will be no wrong in you on the day our Lord Jesus Christ comes again .
46001009	God , who has called you into fellowship with his Son , Jesus Christ our Lord , is faithful .
46001010	I beg you , brothers and sisters , by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that all of you agree with each other and not be split into groups . I beg that you be completely joined together by having the same kind of thinking and the same purpose .
46001011	My brothers and sisters , some people from Chloe’s family have told me quite plainly that there are quarrels among you .
46001012	This is what I mean : One of you says , “ I follow Paul ” ; another says , “ I follow Apollos ” ; another says , “ I follow Peter ” ; and another says , “ I follow Christ . ”
46001013	Christ has been divided up into different groups ! Did Paul die on the cross for you ? No ! Were you baptized in the name of Paul ? No !
46001014	I thank God I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius
46001015	so that now no one can say you were baptized in my name .
46001016	( I also baptized the family of Stephanas , but I do not remember that I baptized anyone else . )
46001017	Christ did not send me to baptize people but to preach the Good News . And he sent me to preach the Good News without using words of human wisdom so that the cross of Christ would not lose its power .
46001018	The teaching about the cross is foolishness to those who are being lost , but to us who are being saved it is the power of God .
46001019	It is written in the Scriptures : “ I will cause the wise to lose their wisdom ; I will make the wise unable to understand . ”
46001020	Where is the wise person ? Where is the educated person ? Where is the skilled talker of this world ? God has made the wisdom of the world foolish .
46001021	In the wisdom of God the world did not know God through its own wisdom . So God chose to use the message that sounds foolish to save those who believe .
46001022	The Jews ask for miracles , and the Greeks want wisdom .
46001023	But we preach a crucified Christ . This causes the Jews to stumble and is foolishness to non-Jews .
46001024	But Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God to those people God has called — Jews and Greeks .
46001025	Even the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom , and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength .
46001026	Brothers and sisters , look at what you were when God called you . Not many of you were wise in the way the world judges wisdom . Not many of you had great influence . Not many of you came from important families .
46001027	But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise , and he chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong .
46001028	He chose what the world thinks is unimportant and what the world looks down on and thinks is nothing in order to destroy what the world thinks is important .
46001029	God did this so that no one can brag in his presence .
46001030	Because of God you are in Christ Jesus , who has become for us wisdom from God . In Christ we are put right with God , and have been made holy , and have been set free from sin .
46001031	So , as the Scripture says , “ If people want to brag , they should brag only about the Lord . ”
46002001	Dear brothers and sisters , when I came to you , I did not come preaching God’s secret with fancy words or a show of human wisdom .
46002002	I decided that while I was with you I would forget about everything except Jesus Christ and his death on the cross .
46002003	So when I came to you , I was weak and fearful and trembling .
46002004	My teaching and preaching were not with words of human wisdom that persuade people but with proof of the power that the Spirit gives .
46002005	This was so that your faith would be in God’s power and not in human wisdom .
46002006	However , I speak a wisdom to those who are mature . But this wisdom is not from this world or from the rulers of this world , who are losing their power .
46002007	I speak God’s secret wisdom , which he has kept hidden . Before the world began , God planned this wisdom for our glory .
46002008	None of the rulers of this world understood it . If they had , they would not have crucified the Lord of glory .
46002009	But as it is written in the Scriptures : “ No one has ever seen this , and no one has ever heard about it . No one has ever imagined what God has prepared for those who love him . ”
46002010	But God has shown us these things through the Spirit . The Spirit searches out all things , even the deep secrets of God .
46002011	Who knows the thoughts that another person has ? Only a person’s spirit that lives within him knows his thoughts . It is the same with God . No one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God .
46002012	Now we did not receive the spirit of the world , but we received the Spirit that is from God so that we can know all that God has given us .
46002013	And we speak about these things , not with words taught us by human wisdom but with words taught us by the Spirit . And so we explain spiritual truths to spiritual people .
46002014	A person who does not have the Spirit does not accept the truths that come from the Spirit of God . That person thinks they are foolish and cannot understand them , because they can only be judged to be true by the Spirit .
46002015	The spiritual person is able to judge all things , but no one can judge him . The Scripture says :
46002016	“ Who has known the mind of the Lord ? Who has been able to teach him ? ” But we have the mind of Christ .
46003001	Brothers and sisters , in the past I could not talk to you as I talk to spiritual people . I had to talk to you as I would to people without the Spirit — babies in Christ .
46003002	The teaching I gave you was like milk , not solid food , because you were not able to take solid food . And even now you are not ready .
46003003	You are still not spiritual , because there is jealousy and quarreling among you , and this shows that you are not spiritual . You are acting like people of the world .
46003004	One of you says , “ I belong to Paul , ” and another says , “ I belong to Apollos . ” When you say things like this , you are acting like people of the world .
46003005	Is Apollos important ? No ! Is Paul important ? No ! We are only servants of God who helped you believe . Each one of us did the work God gave us to do .
46003006	I planted the seed , and Apollos watered it . But God is the One who made it grow .
46003007	So the one who plants is not important , and the one who waters is not important . Only God , who makes things grow , is important .
46003008	The one who plants and the one who waters have the same purpose , and each will be rewarded for his own work .
46003009	We are God’s workers , working together ; you are like God’s farm , God’s house .
46003010	Using the gift God gave me , I laid the foundation of that house like an expert builder . Others are building on that foundation , but all people should be careful how they build on it .
46003011	The foundation that has already been laid is Jesus Christ , and no one can lay down any other foundation .
46003012	But if people build on that foundation , using gold , silver , jewels , wood , grass , or straw ,
46003013	their work will be clearly seen , because the Day of Judgment will make it visible . That Day will appear with fire , and the fire will test everyone’s work to show what sort of work it was .
46003014	If the building that has been put on the foundation still stands , the builder will get a reward .
46003015	But if the building is burned up , the builder will suffer loss . The builder will be saved , but it will be as one who escaped from a fire .
46003016	Don’t you know that you are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit lives in you ?
46003017	If anyone destroys God’s temple , God will destroy that person , because God’s temple is holy and you are that temple .
46003018	Do not fool yourselves . If you think you are wise in this world , you should become a fool so that you can become truly wise ,
46003019	because the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God . It is written in the Scriptures , “ He catches those who are wise in their own clever traps . ”
46003020	It is also written in the Scriptures , “ The Lord knows what wise people think . He knows their thoughts are just a puff of wind . ”
46003021	So you should not brag about human leaders . All things belong to you :
46003022	Paul , Apollos , and Peter ; the world , life , death , the present , and the future — all these belong to you .
46003023	And you belong to Christ , and Christ belongs to God .
46004001	People should think of us as servants of Christ , the ones God has trusted with his secrets .
46004002	Now in this way those who are trusted with something valuable must show they are worthy of that trust .
46004003	As for myself , I do not care if I am judged by you or by any human court . I do not even judge myself .
46004004	I know of no wrong I have done , but this does not make me right before the Lord . The Lord is the One who judges me .
46004005	So do not judge before the right time ; wait until the Lord comes . He will bring to light things that are now hidden in darkness , and will make known the secret purposes of people’s hearts . Then God will praise each one of them .
46004006	Brothers and sisters , I have used Apollos and myself as examples so you could learn through us the meaning of the saying , “ Follow only what is written in the Scriptures . ” Then you will not be more proud of one person than another .
46004007	Who says you are better than others ? What do you have that was not given to you ? And if it was given to you , why do you brag as if you did not receive it as a gift ?
46004008	You think you already have everything you need . You think you are rich . You think you have become kings without us . I wish you really were kings so we could be kings together with you .
46004009	But it seems to me that God has put us apostles in last place , like those sentenced to die . We are like a show for the whole world to see — angels and people .
46004010	We are fools for Christ’s sake , but you are very wise in Christ . We are weak , but you are strong . You receive honor , but we are shamed .
46004011	Even to this very hour we do not have enough to eat or drink or to wear . We are often beaten , and we have no homes in which to live .
46004012	We work hard with our own hands for our food . When people curse us , we bless them . When they hurt us , we put up with it .
46004013	When they tell evil lies about us , we speak nice words about them . Even today , we are treated as though we were the garbage of the world — the filth of the earth .
46004014	I am not trying to make you feel ashamed . I am writing this to give you a warning as my own dear children .
46004015	For though you may have ten thousand teachers in Christ , you do not have many fathers . Through the Good News I became your father in Christ Jesus ,
46004016	so I beg you , please follow my example .
46004017	That is why I am sending to you Timothy , my son in the Lord . I love Timothy , and he is faithful . He will help you remember my way of life in Christ Jesus , just as I teach it in all the churches everywhere .
46004018	Some of you have become proud , thinking that I will not come to you again .
46004019	But I will come to you very soon if the Lord wishes . Then I will know what the proud ones do , not what they say ,
46004020	because the kingdom of God is present not in talk but in power .
46004021	Which do you want : that I come to you with punishment or with love and gentleness ?
46005001	It is actually being said that there is sexual sin among you . And it is a kind that does not happen even among people who do not know God . A man there has his father’s wife .
46005002	And you are proud ! You should have been filled with sadness so that the man who did this should be put out of your group .
46005003	I am not there with you in person , but I am with you in spirit . And I have already judged the man who did that sin as if I were really there .
46005004	When you meet together in the name of our Lord Jesus , and I meet with you in spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus ,
46005005	then hand this man over to Satan . So his sinful self will be destroyed , and his spirit will be saved on the day of the Lord .
46005006	Your bragging is not good . You know the saying , “ Just a little yeast makes the whole batch of dough rise . ”
46005007	Take out all the old yeast so that you will be a new batch of dough without yeast , which you really are . For Christ , our Passover lamb , has been sacrificed .
46005008	So let us celebrate this feast , but not with the bread that has the old yeast — the yeast of sin and wickedness . Let us celebrate this feast with the bread that has no yeast — the bread of goodness and truth .
46005009	I wrote you in my earlier letter not to associate with those who sin sexually .
46005010	But I did not mean you should not associate with those of this world who sin sexually , or with the greedy , or robbers , or those who worship idols . To get away from them you would have to leave this world .
46005011	I am writing to tell you that you must not associate with those who call themselves believers in Christ but who sin sexually , or are greedy , or worship idols , or abuse others with words , or get drunk , or cheat people . Do not even eat with people like that .
46006001	When you have something against another Christian , how can you bring yourself to go before judges who are not right with God ? Why do you not let God’s people decide who is right ?
46006002	Surely you know that God’s people will judge the world . So if you are to judge the world , are you not able to judge small cases as well ?
46006003	You know that in the future we will judge angels , so surely we can judge the ordinary things of this life .
46006004	If you have ordinary cases that must be judged , are you going to appoint people as judges who mean nothing to the church ?
46006005	I say this to shame you . Surely there is someone among you wise enough to judge a complaint between believers .
46006006	But now one believer goes to court against another believer — and you do this in front of unbelievers !
46006007	The fact that you have lawsuits against each other shows that you are already defeated . Why not let yourselves be wronged ? Why not let yourselves be cheated ?
46006008	But you yourselves do wrong and cheat , and you do this to other believers !
46006011	In the past , some of you were like that , but you were washed clean . You were made holy , and you were made right with God in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God .
46006012	“ I am allowed to do all things , ” but not all things are good for me to do . “ I am allowed to do all things , ” but I will not let anything make me its slave .
46006013	“ Food is for the stomach , and the stomach for food , ” but God will destroy them both . The body is not for sexual sin but for the Lord , and the Lord is for the body .
46006014	By his power God has raised the Lord from the dead and will also raise us from the dead .
46006015	Surely you know that your bodies are parts of Christ himself . So I must never take the parts of Christ and join them to a prostitute !
46006016	It is written in the Scriptures , “ The two will become one body . ” So you should know that anyone who joins with a prostitute becomes one body with the prostitute .
46006017	But the one who joins with the Lord is one spirit with the Lord .
46006018	So run away from sexual sin . Every other sin people do is outside their bodies , but those who sin sexually sin against their own bodies .
46006019	You should know that your body is a temple for the Holy Spirit who is in you . You have received the Holy Spirit from God . So you do not belong to yourselves ,
46006020	because you were bought by God for a price . So honor God with your bodies .
46007001	Now I will discuss the things you wrote me about . It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman .
46007002	But because sexual sin is a danger , each man should have his own wife , and each woman should have her own husband .
46007003	The husband should give his wife all that he owes her as his wife . And the wife should give her husband all that she owes him as her husband .
46007004	The wife does not have full rights over her own body ; her husband shares them . And the husband does not have full rights over his own body ; his wife shares them .
46007005	Do not refuse to give your bodies to each other , unless you both agree to stay away from sexual relations for a time so you can give your time to prayer . Then come together again so Satan cannot tempt you because of a lack of self-control .
46007006	I say this to give you permission to stay away from sexual relations for a time . It is not a command to do so .
46007007	I wish that everyone were like me , but each person has his own gift from God . One has one gift , another has another gift .
46007008	Now for those who are not married and for the widows I say this : It is good for them to stay unmarried as I am .
46007009	But if they cannot control themselves , they should marry . It is better to marry than to burn with sexual desire .
46007010	Now I give this command for the married people . ( The command is not from me ; it is from the Lord . ) A wife should not leave her husband .
46007011	But if she does leave , she must not marry again , or she should make up with her husband . Also the husband should not divorce his wife .
46007012	For all the others I say this ( I am saying this , not the Lord ) : If a Christian man has a wife who is not a believer , and she is happy to live with him , he must not divorce her .
46007013	And if a Christian woman has a husband who is not a believer , and he is happy to live with her , she must not divorce him .
46007014	The husband who is not a believer is made holy through his believing wife . And the wife who is not a believer is made holy through her believing husband . If this were not true , your children would not be clean , but now your children are holy .
46007015	But if those who are not believers decide to leave , let them leave . When this happens , the Christian man or woman is free . But God called us to live in peace .
46007016	Wife , you don’t know ; maybe you will save your husband . And husband , you don’t know ; maybe you will save your wife .
46007017	But in any case each one of you should continue to live the way God has given you to live — the way you were when God called you . This is a rule I make in all the churches .
46007018	If a man was already circumcised when he was called , he should not undo his circumcision . If a man was without circumcision when he was called , he should not be circumcised .
46007019	It is not important if a man is circumcised or not . The important thing is obeying God’s commands .
46007020	Each one of you should stay the way you were when God called you .
46007021	If you were a slave when God called you , do not let that bother you . But if you can be free , then make good use of your freedom .
46007022	Those who were slaves when the Lord called them are free persons who belong to the Lord . In the same way , those who were free when they were called are now Christ’s slaves .
46007023	You all were bought at a great price , so do not become slaves of people .
46007024	Brothers and sisters , each of you should stay as you were when you were called , and stay there with God .
46007025	Now I write about people who are not married . I have no command from the Lord about this ; I give my opinion . But I can be trusted , because the Lord has shown me mercy .
46007026	The present time is a time of trouble , so I think it is good for you to stay the way you are .
46007027	If you have a wife , do not try to become free from her . If you are not married , do not try to find a wife .
46007028	But if you decide to marry , you have not sinned . And if a girl who has never married decides to marry , she has not sinned . But those who marry will have trouble in this life , and I want you to be free from trouble .
46007029	Brothers and sisters , this is what I mean : We do not have much time left . So starting now , those who have wives should live as if they had no wives .
46007030	Those who are crying should live as if they were not crying . Those who are happy should live as if they were not happy . Those who buy things should live as if they own nothing .
46007031	Those who use the things of the world should live as if they were not using them , because this world in its present form will soon be gone .
46007032	I want you to be free from worry . A man who is not married is busy with the Lord’s work , trying to please the Lord .
46007033	But a man who is married is busy with things of the world , trying to please his wife .
46007034	He must think about two things — pleasing his wife and pleasing the Lord . A woman who is not married or a girl who has never married is busy with the Lord’s work . She wants to be holy in body and spirit . But a married woman is busy with things of the world , as to how she can please her husband .
46007035	I am saying this to help you , not to limit you . But I want you to live in the right way , to give yourselves fully to the Lord without concern for other things .
46007036	If a man thinks he is not doing the right thing with the girl he is engaged to , if she is almost past the best age to marry and he feels he should marry her , he should do what he wants . They should get married . It is no sin .
46007037	But if a man is sure in his mind that there is no need for marriage , and has his own desires under control , and has decided not to marry the one to whom he is engaged , he is doing the right thing .
46007038	So the man who marries his girl does right , but the man who does not marry will do better .
46007039	A woman must stay with her husband as long as he lives . But if her husband dies , she is free to marry any man she wants , but she must marry another believer .
46007040	The woman is happier if she does not marry again . This is my opinion , but I believe I also have God’s Spirit .
46008001	Now I will write about meat that is sacrificed to idols . We know that “ we all have knowledge . ” Knowledge puffs you up with pride , but love builds up .
46008002	If you think you know something , you do not yet know anything as you should .
46008003	But if any person loves God , that person is known by God .
46008004	So this is what I say about eating meat sacrificed to idols : We know that an idol is really nothing in the world , and we know there is only one God .
46008005	Even though there are things called gods , in heaven or on earth ( and there are many “ gods ” and “ lords ” ) ,
46008006	for us there is only one God — our Father . All things came from him , and we live for him . And there is only one Lord — Jesus Christ . All things were made through him , and we also were made through him .
46008007	But not all people know this . Some people are still so used to idols that when they eat meat , they still think of it as being sacrificed to an idol . Because their conscience is weak , when they eat it , they feel guilty .
46008008	But food will not bring us closer to God . Refusing to eat does not make us less pleasing to God , and eating does not make us better in God’s sight .
46008009	But be careful that your freedom does not cause those who are weak in faith to fall into sin .
46008010	Suppose one of you who has knowledge eats in an idol’s temple . Someone who is weak in faith might see you eating there and be encouraged to eat meat sacrificed to idols while thinking it is wrong to do so .
46008011	This weak believer for whom Christ died is ruined because of your “ knowledge . ”
46008012	When you sin against your brothers and sisters in Christ like this and cause them to do what they feel is wrong , you are also sinning against Christ .
46008013	So if the food I eat causes them to fall into sin , I will never eat meat again so that I will not cause any of them to sin .
46009001	I am a free man . I am an apostle . I have seen Jesus our Lord . You people are all an example of my work in the Lord .
46009002	If others do not accept me as an apostle , surely you do , because you are proof that I am an apostle in the Lord .
46009003	This is the answer I give people who want to judge me :
46009004	Do we not have the right to eat and drink ?
46009005	Do we not have the right to bring a believing wife with us when we travel as do the other apostles and the Lord’s brothers and Peter ?
46009006	Are Barnabas and I the only ones who must work to earn our living ?
46009007	No soldier ever serves in the army and pays his own salary . No one ever plants a vineyard without eating some of the grapes . No person takes care of a flock without drinking some of the milk .
46009008	I do not say this by human authority ; God’s law also says the same thing .
46009009	It is written in the law of Moses : “ When an ox is working in the grain , do not cover its mouth to keep it from eating . ” When God said this , was he thinking only about oxen ? No .
46009010	He was really talking about us . Yes , that Scripture was written for us , because it goes on to say : “ The one who plows and the one who works in the grain should hope to get some of the grain for their work . ”
46009011	Since we planted spiritual seed among you , is it too much if we should harvest material things ?
46009012	If others have the right to get something from you , surely we have this right , too . But we do not use it . No , we put up with everything ourselves so that we will not keep anyone from believing the Good News of Christ .
46009013	Surely you know that those who work at the Temple get their food from the Temple , and those who serve at the altar get part of what is offered at the altar .
46009014	In the same way , the Lord has commanded that those who tell the Good News should get their living from this work .
46009015	But I have not used any of these rights . And I am not writing this now to get anything from you . I would rather die than to have my reason for bragging taken away .
46009016	Telling the Good News does not give me any reason for bragging . Telling the Good News is my duty — something I must do . And how terrible it will be for me if I do not tell the Good News .
46009017	If I preach because it is my own choice , I have a reward . But if I preach and it is not my choice to do so , I am only doing the duty that was given to me .
46009018	So what reward do I get ? This is my reward : that when I tell the Good News I can offer it freely . I do not use my full rights in my work of preaching the Good News .
46009019	I am free and belong to no one . But I make myself a slave to all people to win as many as I can .
46009020	To the Jews I became like a Jew to win the Jews . I myself am not ruled by the law . But to those who are ruled by the law I became like a person who is ruled by the law . I did this to win those who are ruled by the law .
46009021	To those who are without the law I became like a person who is without the law . I did this to win those people who are without the law . ( But really , I am not without God’s law — I am ruled by Christ’s law . )
46009022	To those who are weak , I became weak so I could win the weak . I have become all things to all people so I could save some of them in any way possible .
46009023	I do all this because of the Good News and so I can share in its blessings .
46009024	You know that in a race all the runners run , but only one gets the prize . So run to win !
46009025	All those who compete in the games use self-control so they can win a crown . That crown is an earthly thing that lasts only a short time , but our crown will never be destroyed .
46009026	So I do not run without a goal . I fight like a boxer who is hitting something — not just the air .
46009027	I treat my body hard and make it my slave so that I myself will not be disqualified after I have preached to others .
46010001	Brothers and sisters , I want you to know what happened to our ancestors who followed Moses . They were all under the cloud and all went through the sea .
46010002	They were all baptized as followers of Moses in the cloud and in the sea .
46010003	They all ate the same spiritual food ,
46010004	and all drank the same spiritual drink . They drank from that spiritual rock that followed them , and that rock was Christ .
46010005	But God was not pleased with most of them , so they died in the desert .
46010006	And these things happened as examples for us , to stop us from wanting evil things as those people did .
46010007	Do not worship idols , as some of them did . Just as it is written in the Scriptures : “ They sat down to eat and drink , and then they got up and sinned sexually . ”
46010008	We must not take part in sexual sins , as some of them did . In one day twenty-three thousand of them died because of their sins .
46010009	We must not test Christ as some of them did ; they were killed by snakes .
46010010	Do not complain as some of them did ; they were killed by the angel that destroys .
46010011	The things that happened to those people are examples . They were written down to teach us , because we live in a time when all these things of the past have reached their goal .
46010012	If you think you are strong , you should be careful not to fall .
46010013	The only temptation that has come to you is that which everyone has . But you can trust God , who will not permit you to be tempted more than you can stand . But when you are tempted , he will also give you a way to escape so that you will be able to stand it .
46010014	So , my dear friends , run away from the worship of idols .
46010015	I am speaking to you as to reasonable people ; judge for yourselves what I say .
46010016	We give thanks for the cup of blessing , which is a sharing in the blood of Christ . And the bread that we break is a sharing in the body of Christ .
46010017	Because there is one loaf of bread , we who are many are one body , because we all share that one loaf .
46010018	Think about the Israelites : Do not those who eat the sacrifices share in the altar ?
46010019	I do not mean that the food sacrificed to an idol is important . I do not mean that an idol is anything at all .
46010020	But I say that what is sacrificed to idols is offered to demons , not to God . And I do not want you to share anything with demons .
46010021	You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons also . You cannot share in the Lord’s table and the table of demons .
46010022	Are we trying to make the Lord jealous ? We are not stronger than he is , are we ?
46010023	“ We are allowed to do all things , ” but not all things are good for us to do . “ We are allowed to do all things , ” but not all things help others grow stronger .
46010024	Do not look out only for yourselves . Look out for the good of others also .
46010025	Eat any meat that is sold in the meat market . Do not ask questions about it .
46010026	You may eat it , “ because the earth belongs to the Lord , and everything in it . ”
46010027	Those who are not believers may invite you to eat with them . If you want to go , eat anything that is put before you . Do not ask questions about it .
46010028	But if anyone says to you , “ That food was offered to idols , ” do not eat it . Do not eat it because of that person who told you and because eating it might be thought to be wrong .
46010029	I don’t mean you think it is wrong , but the other person might . But why , you ask , should my freedom be judged by someone else’s conscience ?
46010030	If I eat the meal with thankfulness , why am I criticized because of something for which I thank God ?
46010031	The answer is , if you eat or drink , or if you do anything , do it all for the glory of God .
46010032	Never do anything that might hurt others — Jews , Greeks , or God’s church —
46010033	just as I , also , try to please everybody in every way . I am not trying to do what is good for me but what is good for most people so they can be saved .
46011001	Follow my example , as I follow the example of Christ .
46011002	I praise you because you remember me in everything , and you follow closely the teachings just as I gave them to you .
46011003	But I want you to understand this : The head of every man is Christ , the head of a woman is the man , and the head of Christ is God .
46011004	Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered brings shame to his head .
46011005	But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered brings shame to her head . She is the same as a woman who has her head shaved .
46011006	If a woman does not cover her head , she should have her hair cut off . But since it is shameful for a woman to cut off her hair or to shave her head , she should cover her head .
46011007	But a man should not cover his head , because he is the likeness and glory of God . But woman is man’s glory .
46011008	Man did not come from woman , but woman came from man .
46011009	And man was not made for woman , but woman was made for man .
46011010	So that is why a woman should have a symbol of authority on her head , because of the angels .
46011011	But in the Lord women are not independent of men , and men are not independent of women .
46011012	This is true because woman came from man , but also man is born from woman . But everything comes from God .
46011013	Decide this for yourselves : Is it right for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered ?
46011014	Even nature itself teaches you that wearing long hair is shameful for a man .
46011015	But long hair is a woman’s glory . Long hair is given to her as a covering .
46011016	Some people may still want to argue about this , but I would add that neither we nor the churches of God have any other practice .
46011017	In the things I tell you now I do not praise you , because when you come together you do more harm than good .
46011018	First , I hear that when you meet together as a church you are divided , and I believe some of this .
46011019	( It is necessary to have differences among you so that it may be clear which of you really have God’s approval . )
46011020	When you come together , you are not really eating the Lord’s Supper .
46011021	This is because when you eat , each person eats without waiting for the others . Some people do not get enough to eat , while others have too much to drink .
46011022	You can eat and drink in your own homes ! You seem to think God’s church is not important , and you embarrass those who are poor . What should I tell you ? Should I praise you ? I do not praise you for doing this .
46011023	The teaching I gave you is the same teaching I received from the Lord : On the night when the Lord Jesus was handed over to be killed , he took bread
46011024	and gave thanks for it . Then he broke the bread and said , “ This is my body ; it is for you . Do this to remember me . ”
46011025	In the same way , after they ate , Jesus took the cup . He said , “ This cup is the new agreement that is sealed with the blood of my death . When you drink this , do it to remember me . ”
46011026	Every time you eat this bread and drink this cup you are telling others about the Lord’s death until he comes .
46011027	So a person who eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in a way that is not worthy of it will be guilty of sinning against the body and the blood of the Lord .
46011028	Look into your own hearts before you eat the bread and drink the cup ,
46011029	because all who eat the bread and drink the cup without recognizing the body eat and drink judgment against themselves .
46011030	That is why many in your group are sick and weak , and some of you have died .
46011031	But if we judged ourselves in the right way , God would not judge us .
46011032	But when the Lord judges us , he disciplines us so that we will not be destroyed along with the world .
46011033	So my brothers and sisters , when you come together to eat , wait for each other .
46011034	Anyone who is too hungry should eat at home so that in meeting together you will not bring God’s judgment on yourselves . I will tell you what to do about the other things when I come .
46012001	Now , brothers and sisters , I want you to understand about spiritual gifts .
46012002	You know the way you lived before you were believers . You let yourselves be influenced and led away to worship idols — things that could not speak .
46012003	So I want you to understand that no one who is speaking with the help of God’s Spirit says , “ Jesus be cursed . ” And no one can say , “ Jesus is Lord , ” without the help of the Holy Spirit .
46012004	There are different kinds of gifts , but they are all from the same Spirit .
46012005	There are different ways to serve but the same Lord to serve .
46012006	And there are different ways that God works through people but the same God . God works in all of us in everything we do .
46012007	Something from the Spirit can be seen in each person , for the common good .
46012008	The Spirit gives one person the ability to speak with wisdom , and the same Spirit gives another the ability to speak with knowledge .
46012009	The same Spirit gives faith to one person . And , to another , that one Spirit gives gifts of healing .
46012010	The Spirit gives to another person the power to do miracles , to another the ability to prophesy . And he gives to another the ability to know the difference between good and evil spirits . The Spirit gives one person the ability to speak in different kinds of languages and to another the ability to interpret those languages .
46012011	One Spirit , the same Spirit , does all these things , and the Spirit decides what to give each person .
46012012	A person’s body is one thing , but it has many parts . Though there are many parts to a body , all those parts make only one body . Christ is like that also .
46012013	Some of us are Jews , and some are Greeks . Some of us are slaves , and some are free . But we were all baptized into one body through one Spirit . And we were all made to share in the one Spirit .
46012014	The human body has many parts .
46012015	The foot might say , “ Because I am not a hand , I am not part of the body . ” But saying this would not stop the foot from being a part of the body .
46012016	The ear might say , “ Because I am not an eye , I am not part of the body . ” But saying this would not stop the ear from being a part of the body .
46012017	If the whole body were an eye , it would not be able to hear . If the whole body were an ear , it would not be able to smell .
46012020	So then there are many parts , but only one body .
46012021	The eye cannot say to the hand , “ I don’t need you ! ” And the head cannot say to the foot , “ I don’t need you ! ”
46012022	No ! Those parts of the body that seem to be the weaker are really necessary .
46012023	And the parts of the body we think are less deserving are the parts to which we give the most honor . We give special respect to the parts we want to hide .
46012024	The more respectable parts of our body need no special care . But God put the body together and gave more honor to the parts that need it
46012025	so our body would not be divided . God wanted the different parts to care the same for each other .
46012026	If one part of the body suffers , all the other parts suffer with it . Or if one part of our body is honored , all the other parts share its honor .
46012027	Together you are the body of Christ , and each one of you is a part of that body .
46012028	In the church God has given a place first to apostles , second to prophets , and third to teachers . Then God has given a place to those who do miracles , those who have gifts of healing , those who can help others , those who are able to govern , and those who can speak in different languages .
46012029	Not all are apostles . Not all are prophets . Not all are teachers . Not all do miracles .
46012030	Not all have gifts of healing . Not all speak in different languages . Not all interpret those languages .
46012031	But you should truly want to have the greater gifts . And now I will show you the best way of all .
46013001	I may speak in different languages of people or even angels . But if I do not have love , I am only a noisy bell or a crashing cymbal .
46013002	I may have the gift of prophecy . I may understand all the secret things of God and have all knowledge , and I may have faith so great I can move mountains . But even with all these things , if I do not have love , then I am nothing .
46013003	I may give away everything I have , and I may even give my body as an offering to be burned . But I gain nothing if I do not have love .
46013004	Love is patient and kind . Love is not jealous , it does not brag , and it is not proud .
46013005	Love is not rude , is not selfish , and does not get upset with others . Love does not count up wrongs that have been done .
46013006	Love takes no pleasure in evil but rejoices over the truth .
46013007	Love patiently accepts all things . It always trusts , always hopes , and always endures .
46013008	Love never ends . There are gifts of prophecy , but they will be ended . There are gifts of speaking in different languages , but those gifts will stop . There is the gift of knowledge , but it will come to an end .
46013009	The reason is that our knowledge and our ability to prophesy are not perfect .
46013010	But when perfection comes , the things that are not perfect will end .
46013011	When I was a child , I talked like a child , I thought like a child , I reasoned like a child . When I became a man , I stopped those childish ways .
46013012	It is the same with us . Now we see a dim reflection , as if we were looking into a mirror , but then we shall see clearly . Now I know only a part , but then I will know fully , as God has known me .
46013013	So these three things continue forever : faith , hope , and love . And the greatest of these is love .
46014001	You should seek after love , and you should truly want to have the spiritual gifts , especially the gift of prophecy .
46014002	I will explain why . Those who have the gift of speaking in different languages are not speaking to people ; they are speaking to God . No one understands them ; they are speaking secret things through the Spirit .
46014003	But those who prophesy are speaking to people to give them strength , encouragement , and comfort .
46014004	The ones who speak in different languages are helping only themselves , but those who prophesy are helping the whole church .
46014005	I wish all of you had the gift of speaking in different kinds of languages , but more , I wish you would prophesy . Those who prophesy are greater than those who can only speak in different languages — unless someone is there who can explain what is said so that the whole church can be helped .
46014006	Brothers and sisters , will it help you if I come to you speaking in different languages ? No ! It will help you only if I bring you a new truth or some new knowledge , or prophecy , or teaching .
46014007	It is the same as with lifeless things that make sounds — like a flute or a harp . If they do not make clear musical notes , you will not know what is being played .
46014008	And in a war , if the trumpet does not give a clear sound , who will prepare for battle ?
46014009	It is the same with you . Unless you speak clearly with your tongue , no one can understand what you are saying . You will be talking into the air !
46014010	It may be true that there are all kinds of sounds in the world , and none is without meaning .
46014011	But unless I understand the meaning of what someone says to me , we will be like foreigners to each other .
46014012	It is the same with you . Since you want spiritual gifts very much , seek most of all to have the gifts that help the church grow stronger .
46014013	The one who has the gift of speaking in a different language should pray for the gift to interpret what is spoken .
46014014	If I pray in a different language , my spirit is praying , but my mind does nothing .
46014015	So what should I do ? I will pray with my spirit , but I will also pray with my mind . I will sing with my spirit , but I will also sing with my mind .
46014016	If you praise God with your spirit , those persons there without understanding cannot say amen to your prayer of thanks , because they do not know what you are saying .
46014017	You may be thanking God in a good way , but the other person is not helped .
46014018	I thank God that I speak in different kinds of languages more than all of you .
46014019	But in the church meetings I would rather speak five words I understand in order to teach others than thousands of words in a different language .
46014020	Brothers and sisters , do not think like children . In evil things be like babies , but in your thinking you should be like adults .
46014021	It is written in the Scriptures : “ With people who use strange words and foreign languages I will speak to these people . But even then they will not listen to me , ” says the Lord .
46014022	So the gift of speaking in different kinds of languages is a sign for those who do not believe , not for those who do believe . And prophecy is for people who believe , not for those who do not believe .
46014023	Suppose the whole church meets together and everyone speaks in different languages . If some people come in who do not understand or do not believe , they will say you are crazy .
46014024	But suppose everyone is prophesying and some people come in who do not believe or do not understand . If everyone is prophesying , their sin will be shown to them , and they will be judged by all that they hear .
46014025	The secret things in their hearts will be made known . So they will bow down and worship God saying , “ Truly , God is with you . ”
46014026	So , brothers and sisters , what should you do ? When you meet together , one person has a song , and another has a teaching . Another has a new truth from God . Another speaks in a different language , and another person interprets that language . The purpose of all these things should be to help the church grow strong .
46014027	When you meet together , if anyone speaks in a different language , it should be only two , or not more than three , who speak . They should speak one after the other , and someone should interpret .
46014028	But if there is no interpreter , then those who speak in a different language should be quiet in the church meeting . They should speak only to themselves and to God .
46014029	Only two or three prophets should speak , and the others should judge what they say .
46014030	If a message from God comes to another person who is sitting , the first speaker should stop .
46014031	You can all prophesy one after the other . In this way all the people can be taught and encouraged .
46014032	The spirits of prophets are under the control of the prophets themselves .
46014033	God is not a God of confusion but a God of peace . As is true in all the churches of God’s people ,
46014034	women should keep quiet in the church meetings . They are not allowed to speak , but they must yield to this rule as the law says .
46014035	If they want to learn something , they should ask their own husbands at home . It is shameful for a woman to speak in the church meeting .
46014036	Did God’s teaching come from you ? Or are you the only ones to whom it has come ?
46014037	Those who think they are prophets or spiritual persons should understand that what I am writing to you is the Lord’s command .
46014038	Those who ignore this will be ignored by God .
46014039	So my brothers and sisters , you should truly want to prophesy . But do not stop people from using the gift of speaking in different kinds of languages .
46014040	But let everything be done in a right and orderly way .
46015001	Now , brothers and sisters , I want you to remember the Good News I brought to you . You received this Good News and continue strong in it .
46015002	And you are being saved by it if you continue believing what I told you . If you do not , then you believed for nothing .
46015003	I passed on to you what I received , of which this was most important : that Christ died for our sins , as the Scriptures say ;
46015004	that he was buried and was raised to life on the third day as the Scriptures say ;
46015005	and that he was seen by Peter and then by the twelve apostles .
46015006	After that , Jesus was seen by more than five hundred of the believers at the same time . Most of them are still living today , but some have died .
46015007	Then he was seen by James and later by all the apostles .
46015008	Last of all he was seen by me — as by a person not born at the normal time .
46015009	All the other apostles are greater than I am . I am not even good enough to be called an apostle , because I persecuted the church of God .
46015010	But God’s grace has made me what I am , and his grace to me was not wasted . I worked harder than all the other apostles . ( But it was not I really ; it was God’s grace that was with me . )
46015011	So if I preached to you or the other apostles preached to you , we all preach the same thing , and this is what you believed .
46015012	Now since we preached that Christ was raised from the dead , why do some of you say that people will not be raised from the dead ?
46015013	If no one is ever raised from the dead , then Christ has not been raised .
46015014	And if Christ has not been raised , then our preaching is worth nothing , and your faith is worth nothing .
46015015	And also , we are guilty of lying about God , because we testified of him that he raised Christ from the dead . But if people are not raised from the dead , then God never raised Christ .
46015016	If the dead are not raised , Christ has not been raised either .
46015017	And if Christ has not been raised , then your faith has nothing to it ; you are still guilty of your sins .
46015018	And those in Christ who have already died are lost .
46015019	If our hope in Christ is for this life only , we should be pitied more than anyone else in the world .
46015020	But Christ has truly been raised from the dead — the first one and proof that those who sleep in death will also be raised .
46015021	Death has come because of what one man did , but the rising from death also comes because of one man .
46015022	In Adam all of us die . In the same way , in Christ all of us will be made alive again .
46015023	But everyone will be raised to life in the right order . Christ was first to be raised . When Christ comes again , those who belong to him will be raised to life ,
46015024	and then the end will come . At that time Christ will destroy all rulers , authorities , and powers , and he will hand over the kingdom to God the Father .
46015025	Christ must rule until he puts all enemies under his control .
46015026	The last enemy to be destroyed will be death .
46015027	The Scripture says that God put all things under his control . When it says “ all things ” are under him , it is clear this does not include God himself . God is the One who put everything under his control .
46015028	After everything has been put under the Son , then he will put himself under God , who had put all things under him . Then God will be the complete ruler over everything .
46015029	If the dead are never raised , what will people do who are being baptized for the dead ? If the dead are not raised at all , why are people being baptized for them ?
46015030	And what about us ? Why do we put ourselves in danger every hour ?
46015031	I die every day . That is true , brothers and sisters , just as it is true that I brag about you in Christ Jesus our Lord .
46015032	If I fought wild animals in Ephesus only with human hopes , I have gained nothing . If the dead are not raised , “ Let us eat and drink , because tomorrow we will die . ”
46015033	Do not be fooled : “ Bad friends will ruin good habits . ”
46015034	Come back to your right way of thinking and stop sinning . Some of you do not know God — I say this to shame you .
46015035	But someone may ask , “ How are the dead raised ? What kind of body will they have ? ”
46015036	Foolish person ! When you sow a seed , it must die in the ground before it can live and grow .
46015037	And when you sow it , it does not have the same “ body ” it will have later . What you sow is only a bare seed , maybe wheat or something else .
46015038	But God gives it a body that he has planned for it , and God gives each kind of seed its own body .
46015039	All things made of flesh are not the same : People have one kind of flesh , animals have another , birds have another , and fish have another .
46015040	Also there are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies . But the beauty of the heavenly bodies is one kind , and the beauty of the earthly bodies is another .
46015041	The sun has one kind of beauty , the moon has another beauty , and the stars have another . And each star is different in its beauty .
46015042	It is the same with the dead who are raised to life . The body that is “ planted ” will ruin and decay , but it is raised to a life that cannot be destroyed .
46015043	When the body is “ planted , ” it is without honor , but it is raised in glory . When the body is “ planted , ” it is weak , but when it is raised , it is powerful .
46015044	The body that is “ planted ” is a physical body . When it is raised , it is a spiritual body . There is a physical body , and there is also a spiritual body .
46015045	It is written in the Scriptures : “ The first man , Adam , became a living person . ” But the last Adam became a spirit that gives life .
46015046	The spiritual did not come first , but the physical and then the spiritual .
46015047	The first man came from the dust of the earth . The second man came from heaven .
46015048	People who belong to the earth are like the first man of earth . But those people who belong to heaven are like the man of heaven .
46015049	Just as we were made like the man of earth , so we will also be made like the man of heaven .
46015050	I tell you this , brothers and sisters : Flesh and blood cannot have a part in the kingdom of God . Something that will ruin cannot have a part in something that never ruins .
46015051	But look ! I tell you this secret : We will not all sleep in death , but we will all be changed .
46015052	It will take only a second — as quickly as an eye blinks — when the last trumpet sounds . The trumpet will sound , and those who have died will be raised to live forever , and we will all be changed .
46015053	This body that can be destroyed must clothe itself with something that can never be destroyed . And this body that dies must clothe itself with something that can never die .
46015054	So this body that can be destroyed will clothe itself with that which can never be destroyed , and this body that dies will clothe itself with that which can never die . When this happens , this Scripture will be made true : “ Death is destroyed forever in victory . ”
46015055	“ Death , where is your victory ? Death , where is your pain ? ”
46015056	Death’s power to hurt is sin , and the power of sin is the law .
46015057	But we thank God ! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ .
46015058	So my dear brothers and sisters , stand strong . Do not let anything move you . Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord , because you know that your work in the Lord is never wasted .
46016001	Now I will write about the collection of money for God’s people . Do the same thing I told the Galatian churches to do :
46016002	On the first day of every week , each one of you should put aside money as you have been blessed . Save it up so you will not have to collect money after I come .
46016003	When I arrive , I will send whomever you approve to take your gift to Jerusalem . I will send them with letters of introduction ,
46016004	and if it seems good for me to go also , they will go along with me .
46016005	I plan to go through Macedonia , so I will come to you after I go through there .
46016006	Perhaps I will stay with you for a time or even all winter . Then you can help me on my trip , wherever I go .
46016007	I do not want to see you now just in passing . I hope to stay a longer time with you if the Lord allows it .
46016008	But I will stay at Ephesus until Pentecost ,
46016009	because a good opportunity for a great and growing work has been given to me now . And there are many people working against me .
46016010	If Timothy comes to you , see to it that he has nothing to fear with you , because he is working for the Lord just as I am .
46016011	So none of you should treat Timothy as unimportant , but help him on his trip in peace so that he can come back to me . I am expecting him to come with the brothers .
46016012	Now about our brother Apollos : I strongly encouraged him to visit you with the other brothers . He did not at all want to come now ; he will come when he has the opportunity .
46016013	Be alert . Continue strong in the faith . Have courage , and be strong .
46016014	Do everything in love .
46016015	You know that the family of Stephanas were the first believers in Southern Greece and that they have given themselves to the service of God’s people . I ask you , brothers and sisters ,
46016016	to follow the leading of people like these and anyone else who works and serves with them .
46016017	I am happy that Stephanas , Fortunatus , and Achaicus have come . You are not here , but they have filled your place .
46016018	They have refreshed my spirit and yours . You should recognize the value of people like these .
46016019	The churches in Asia send greetings to you . Aquila and Priscilla greet you in the Lord , as does the church that meets in their house .
46016020	All the brothers and sisters here send greetings . Give each other a holy kiss when you meet .
46016021	I , Paul , am writing this greeting with my own hand .
46016022	If anyone does not love the Lord , let him be separated from God — lost forever ! Come , O Lord !
46016023	The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you .
46016024	My love be with all of you in Christ Jesus .
47001001	From Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus . I am an apostle because that is what God wanted . Also from Timothy our brother in Christ . To the church of God in Corinth , and to all of God’s people everywhere in Southern Greece :
47001002	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
47001003	Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ . God is the Father who is full of mercy and all comfort .
47001004	He comforts us every time we have trouble , so when others have trouble , we can comfort them with the same comfort God gives us .
47001005	We share in the many sufferings of Christ . In the same way , much comfort comes to us through Christ .
47001006	If we have troubles , it is for your comfort and salvation , and if we have comfort , you also have comfort . This helps you to accept patiently the same sufferings we have .
47001007	Our hope for you is strong , knowing that you share in our sufferings and also in the comfort we receive .
47001008	Brothers and sisters , we want you to know about the trouble we suffered in Asia . We had great burdens there that were beyond our own strength . We even gave up hope of living .
47001009	Truly , in our own hearts we believed we would die . But this happened so we would not trust in ourselves but in God , who raises people from the dead .
47001010	God saved us from these great dangers of death , and he will continue to save us . We have put our hope in him , and he will save us again .
47001011	And you can help us with your prayers . Then many people will give thanks for us — that God blessed us because of their many prayers .
47001012	This is what we are proud of , and I can say it with a clear conscience : In everything we have done in the world , and especially with you , we have had an honest and sincere heart from God . We did this by God’s grace , not by the kind of wisdom the world has .
47001015	I was so sure of all this that I made plans to visit you first so you could be blessed twice .
47001016	I planned to visit you on my way to Macedonia and again on my way back . I wanted to get help from you for my trip to Judea .
47001017	Do you think that I made these plans without really meaning it ? Or maybe you think I make plans as the world does , so that I say yes , yes and at the same time no , no .
47001018	But since you can believe God , you can believe that what we tell you is never both yes and no .
47001019	The Son of God , Jesus Christ , that Silas and Timothy and I preached to you , was not yes and no . In Christ it has always been yes .
47001020	The yes to all of God’s promises is in Christ , and through Christ we say yes to the glory of God .
47001021	Remember , God is the One who makes you and us strong in Christ . God made us his chosen people .
47001022	He put his mark on us to show that we are his , and he put his Spirit in our hearts to be a guarantee for all he has promised .
47001023	I tell you this , and I ask God to be my witness that this is true : The reason I did not come back to Corinth was to keep you from being punished or hurt .
47001024	We are not trying to control your faith . You are strong in faith . But we are workers with you for your own joy .
47002001	So I decided that my next visit to you would not be another one to make you sad .
47002002	If I make you sad , who will make me glad ? Only you can make me glad — particularly the person whom I made sad .
47002003	I wrote you a letter for this reason : that when I came to you I would not be made sad by the people who should make me happy . I felt sure of all of you , that you would share my joy .
47002004	When I wrote to you before , I was very troubled and unhappy in my heart , and I wrote with many tears . I did not write to make you sad , but to let you know how much I love you .
47002005	Someone there among you has caused sadness , not to me , but to all of you . I mean he caused sadness to all in some way . ( I do not want to make it sound worse than it really is . )
47002006	The punishment that most of you gave him is enough for him .
47002007	But now you should forgive him and comfort him to keep him from having too much sadness and giving up completely .
47002008	So I beg you to show that you love him .
47002009	I wrote you to test you and to see if you obey in everything .
47002010	If you forgive someone , I also forgive him . And what I have forgiven — if I had anything to forgive — I forgave it for you , as if Christ were with me .
47002011	I did this so that Satan would not win anything from us , because we know very well what Satan’s plans are .
47002012	When I came to Troas to preach the Good News of Christ , the Lord gave me a good opportunity there .
47002013	But I had no peace , because I did not find my brother Titus . So I said good-bye to them at Troas and went to Macedonia .
47002014	But thanks be to God , who always leads us as captives in Christ’s victory parade . God uses us to spread his knowledge everywhere like a sweet-smelling perfume .
47002015	Our offering to God is this : We are the sweet smell of Christ among those who are being saved and among those who are being lost .
47002016	To those who are lost , we are the smell of death that brings death , but to those who are being saved , we are the smell of life that brings life . So who is able to do this work ?
47002017	We do not sell the word of God for a profit as many other people do . But in Christ we speak the truth before God , as messengers of God .
47003001	Are we starting to brag about ourselves again ? Do we need letters of introduction to you or from you , like some other people ?
47003002	You yourselves are our letter , written on our hearts , known and read by everyone .
47003003	You show that you are a letter from Christ sent through us . This letter is not written with ink but with the Spirit of the living God . It is not written on stone tablets but on human hearts .
47003004	We can say this , because through Christ we feel certain before God .
47003005	We are not saying that we can do this work ourselves . It is God who makes us able to do all that we do .
47003006	He made us able to be servants of a new agreement from himself to his people . This new agreement is not a written law , but it is of the Spirit . The written law brings death , but the Spirit gives life .
47003007	The law that brought death was written in words on stone . It came with God’s glory , which made Moses’ face so bright that the Israelites could not continue to look at it . But that glory later disappeared .
47003008	So surely the new way that brings the Spirit has even more glory .
47003009	If the law that judged people guilty of sin had glory , surely the new way that makes people right with God has much greater glory .
47003010	That old law had glory , but it really loses its glory when it is compared to the much greater glory of this new way .
47003011	If that law which disappeared came with glory , then this new way which continues forever has much greater glory .
47003012	We have this hope , so we are very bold .
47003013	We are not like Moses , who put a covering over his face so the Israelites would not see it . The glory was disappearing , and Moses did not want them to see it end .
47003014	But their minds were closed , and even today that same covering hides the meaning when they read the old agreement . That covering is taken away only through Christ .
47003015	Even today , when they read the law of Moses , there is a covering over their minds .
47003016	But when a person changes and follows the Lord , that covering is taken away .
47003017	The Lord is the Spirit , and where the Spirit of the Lord is , there is freedom .
47003018	Our faces , then , are not covered . We all show the Lord’s glory , and we are being changed to be like him . This change in us brings ever greater glory , which comes from the Lord , who is the Spirit .
47004001	God , with his mercy , gave us this work to do , so we don’t give up .
47004002	But we have turned away from secret and shameful ways . We use no trickery , and we do not change the teaching of God . We teach the truth plainly , showing everyone who we are . Then they can know in their hearts what kind of people we are in God’s sight .
47004003	If the Good News that we preach is hidden , it is hidden only to those who are lost .
47004004	The devil who rules this world has blinded the minds of those who do not believe . They cannot see the light of the Good News — the Good News about the glory of Christ , who is exactly like God .
47004005	We do not preach about ourselves , but we preach that Jesus Christ is Lord and that we are your servants for Jesus .
47004006	God once said , “ Let the light shine out of the darkness ! ” This is the same God who made his light shine in our hearts by letting us know the glory of God that is in the face of Christ .
47004007	We have this treasure from God , but we are like clay jars that hold the treasure . This shows that the great power is from God , not from us .
47004008	We have troubles all around us , but we are not defeated . We do not know what to do , but we do not give up the hope of living .
47004009	We are persecuted , but God does not leave us . We are hurt sometimes , but we are not destroyed .
47004010	We carry the death of Jesus in our own bodies so that the life of Jesus can also be seen in our bodies .
47004011	We are alive , but for Jesus we are always in danger of death so that the life of Jesus can be seen in our bodies that die .
47004012	So death is working in us , but life is working in you .
47004013	It is written in the Scriptures , “ I believed , so I spoke . ” Our faith is like this , too . We believe , and so we speak .
47004014	God raised the Lord Jesus from the dead , and we know that God will also raise us with Jesus . God will bring us together with you , and we will stand before him .
47004015	All these things are for you . And so the grace of God that is being given to more and more people will bring increasing thanks to God for his glory .
47004016	So we do not give up . Our physical body is becoming older and weaker , but our spirit inside us is made new every day .
47004017	We have small troubles for a while now , but they are helping us gain an eternal glory that is much greater than the troubles .
47004018	We set our eyes not on what we see but on what we cannot see . What we see will last only a short time , but what we cannot see will last forever .
47005001	We know that our body — the tent we live in here on earth — will be destroyed . But when that happens , God will have a house for us . It will not be a house made by human hands ; instead , it will be a home in heaven that will last forever .
47005002	But now we groan in this tent . We want God to give us our heavenly home ,
47005003	because it will clothe us so we will not be naked .
47005004	While we live in this body , we have burdens , and we groan . We do not want to be naked , but we want to be clothed with our heavenly home . Then this body that dies will be fully covered with life .
47005005	This is what God made us for , and he has given us the Spirit to be a guarantee for this new life .
47005006	So we always have courage . We know that while we live in this body , we are away from the Lord .
47005007	We live by what we believe , not by what we can see .
47005008	So I say that we have courage . We really want to be away from this body and be at home with the Lord .
47005009	Our only goal is to please God whether we live here or there ,
47005010	because we must all stand before Christ to be judged . Each of us will receive what we should get — good or bad — for the things we did in the earthly body .
47005011	Since we know what it means to fear the Lord , we try to help people accept the truth about us . God knows what we really are , and I hope that in your hearts you know , too .
47005012	We are not trying to prove ourselves to you again , but we are telling you about ourselves so you will be proud of us . Then you will have an answer for those who are proud about things that can be seen rather than what is in the heart .
47005013	If we are out of our minds , it is for God . If we have our right minds , it is for you .
47005014	The love of Christ controls us , because we know that One died for all , so all have died .
47005015	Christ died for all so that those who live would not continue to live for themselves . He died for them and was raised from the dead so that they would live for him .
47005016	From this time on we do not think of anyone as the world does . In the past we thought of Christ as the world thinks , but we no longer think of him in that way .
47005017	If anyone belongs to Christ , there is a new creation . The old things have gone ; everything is made new !
47005018	All this is from God . Through Christ , God made peace between us and himself , and God gave us the work of telling everyone about the peace we can have with him .
47005019	God was in Christ , making peace between the world and himself . In Christ , God did not hold the world guilty of its sins . And he gave us this message of peace .
47005020	So we have been sent to speak for Christ . It is as if God is calling to you through us . We speak for Christ when we beg you to be at peace with God .
47005021	Christ had no sin , but God made him become sin so that in Christ we could become right with God .
47006001	We are workers together with God , so we beg you : Do not let the grace that you received from God be for nothing .
47006002	God says , “ At the right time I heard your prayers . On the day of salvation I helped you . ” I tell you that the “ right time ” is now , and the “ day of salvation ” is now .
47006003	We do not want anyone to find fault with our work , so nothing we do will be a problem for anyone .
47006004	But in every way we show we are servants of God : in accepting many hard things , in troubles , in difficulties , and in great problems .
47006005	We are beaten and thrown into prison . We meet those who become upset with us and start riots . We work hard , and sometimes we get no sleep or food .
47006006	We show we are servants of God by our pure lives , our understanding , patience , and kindness , by the Holy Spirit , by true love ,
47006007	by speaking the truth , and by God’s power . We use our right living to defend ourselves against everything .
47006008	Some people honor us , but others blame us . Some people say evil things about us , but others say good things . Some people say we are liars , but we speak the truth .
47006009	We are not known , but we are well known . We seem to be dying , but we continue to live . We are punished , but we are not killed .
47006010	We have much sadness , but we are always rejoicing . We are poor , but we are making many people rich in faith . We have nothing , but really we have everything .
47006011	We have spoken freely to you in Corinth and have opened our hearts to you .
47006012	Our feelings of love for you have not stopped , but you have stopped your feelings of love for us .
47006013	I speak to you as if you were my children . Do to us as we have done — open your hearts to us .
47006014	You are not the same as those who do not believe . So do not join yourselves to them . Good and bad do not belong together . Light and darkness cannot share together .
47006015	How can Christ and Belial , the devil , have any agreement ? What can a believer have together with a nonbeliever ?
47006016	The temple of God cannot have any agreement with idols , and we are the temple of the living God . As God said : “ I will live with them and walk with them . And I will be their God , and they will be my people . ”
47006017	“ Leave those people , and be separate , says the Lord . Touch nothing that is unclean , and I will accept you . ”
47006018	“ I will be your father , and you will be my sons and daughters , says the Lord Almighty . ”
47007001	Dear friends , we have these promises from God , so we should make ourselves pure — free from anything that makes body or soul unclean . We should try to become holy in the way we live , because we respect God .
47007002	Open your hearts to us . We have not done wrong to anyone , we have not ruined the faith of anyone , and we have not cheated anyone .
47007003	I do not say this to blame you . I told you before that we love you so much we would live or die with you .
47007004	I feel very sure of you and am very proud of you . You give me much comfort , and in all of our troubles I have great joy .
47007005	When we came into Macedonia , we had no rest . We found trouble all around us . We had fighting on the outside and fear on the inside .
47007006	But God , who comforts those who are troubled , comforted us when Titus came .
47007007	We were comforted , not only by his coming but also by the comfort you gave him . Titus told us about your wish to see me and that you are very sorry for what you did . He also told me about your great care for me , and when I heard this , I was much happier .
47007008	Even if my letter made you sad , I am not sorry I wrote it . At first I was sorry , because it made you sad , but you were sad only for a short time .
47007009	Now I am happy , not because you were made sad , but because your sorrow made you change your lives . You became sad in the way God wanted you to , so you were not hurt by us in any way .
47007010	The kind of sorrow God wants makes people change their hearts and lives . This leads to salvation , and you cannot be sorry for that . But the kind of sorrow the world has brings death .
47007011	See what this sorrow — the sorrow God wanted you to have — has done to you : It has made you very serious . It made you want to restore yourselves . It made you angry and afraid . It made you want to see me . It made you care . It made you want to do the right thing . In every way you have regained your innocence .
47007012	I wrote that letter , not because of the one who did the wrong or because of the person who was hurt . I wrote the letter so you could see , before God , the great care you have for us .
47007013	That is why we were comforted . Not only were we very comforted , we were even happier to see that Titus was so happy . All of you made him feel much better .
47007014	I bragged to Titus about you , and you showed that I was right . Everything we said to you was true , and you have proved that what we bragged about to Titus is true .
47007015	And his love for you is stronger when he remembers that you were all ready to obey . You welcomed him with respect and fear .
47007016	I am very happy that I can trust you fully .
47008001	And now , brothers and sisters , we want you to know about the grace God gave the churches in Macedonia .
47008002	They have been tested by great troubles , and they are very poor . But they gave much because of their great joy .
47008003	I can tell you that they gave as much as they were able and even more than they could afford . No one told them to do it .
47008004	But they begged and pleaded with us to let them share in this service for God’s people .
47008005	And they gave in a way we did not expect : They first gave themselves to the Lord and to us . This is what God wants .
47008006	So we asked Titus to help you finish this special work of grace since he is the one who started it .
47008007	You are rich in everything — in faith , in speaking , in knowledge , in truly wanting to help , and in the love you learned from us . In the same way , be strong also in the grace of giving .
47008008	I am not commanding you to give . But I want to see if your love is true by comparing you with others that really want to help .
47008009	You know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ . You know that Christ was rich , but for you he became poor so that by his becoming poor you might become rich .
47008010	This is what I think you should do : Last year you were the first to want to give , and you were the first who gave .
47008011	So now finish the work you started . Then your “ doing ” will be equal to your “ wanting to do . ” Give from what you have .
47008012	If you want to give , your gift will be accepted . It will be judged by what you have , not by what you do not have .
47008013	We do not want you to have troubles while other people are at ease , but we want everything to be equal .
47008014	At this time you have plenty . What you have can help others who are in need . Then later , when they have plenty , they can help you when you are in need , and all will be equal .
47008015	As it is written in the Scriptures , “ The person who gathered more did not have too much , nor did the person who gathered less have too little . ”
47008016	I thank God because he gave Titus the same love for you that I have .
47008017	Titus accepted what we asked him to do . He wanted very much to go to you , and this was his own idea .
47008018	We are sending with him the brother who is praised by all the churches because of his service in preaching the Good News .
47008019	Also , this brother was chosen by the churches to go with us when we deliver this gift of money . We are doing this service to bring glory to the Lord and to show that we really want to help .
47008020	We are being careful so that no one will criticize us for the way we are handling this large gift .
47008021	We are trying hard to do what the Lord accepts as right and also what people think is right .
47008022	Also , we are sending with them our brother , who is always ready to help . He has proved this to us in many ways , and he wants to help even more now , because he has much faith in you .
47008023	Now about Titus — he is my partner who is working with me to help you . And about the other brothers — they are sent from the churches , and they bring glory to Christ .
47008024	So show these men the proof of your love and the reason we are proud of you . Then all the churches can see it .
47009001	I really do not need to write you about this help for God’s people .
47009002	I know you want to help . I have been bragging about this to the people in Macedonia , telling them that you in Southern Greece have been ready to give since last year . And your desire to give has made most of them ready to give also .
47009003	But I am sending the brothers to you so that our bragging about you in this will not be empty words . I want you to be ready , as I said you would be .
47009004	If any of the people from Macedonia come with me and find that you are not ready , we will be ashamed that we were so sure of you . ( And you will be ashamed , too ! )
47009005	So I thought I should ask these brothers to go to you before we do . They will finish getting in order the generous gift you promised so it will be ready when we come . And it will be a generous gift — not one that you did not want to give .
47009006	Remember this : The person who plants a little will have a small harvest , but the person who plants a lot will have a big harvest .
47009007	Each of you should give as you have decided in your heart to give . You should not be sad when you give , and you should not give because you feel forced to give . God loves the person who gives happily .
47009008	And God can give you more blessings than you need . Then you will always have plenty of everything — enough to give to every good work .
47009009	It is written in the Scriptures : “ He gives freely to the poor . The things he does are right and will continue forever . ”
47009010	God is the One who gives seed to the farmer and bread for food . He will give you all the seed you need and make it grow so there will be a great harvest from your goodness .
47009011	He will make you rich in every way so that you can always give freely . And your giving through us will cause many to give thanks to God .
47009012	This service you do not only helps the needs of God’s people , it also brings many more thanks to God .
47009013	It is a proof of your faith . Many people will praise God because you obey the Good News of Christ — the gospel you say you believe — and because you freely share with them and with all others .
47009014	And when they pray , they will wish they could be with you because of the great grace that God has given you .
47009015	Thanks be to God for his gift that is too wonderful for words .
47010001	I , Paul , am begging you with the gentleness and the kindness of Christ . Some people say that I am easy on you when I am with you and bold when I am away .
47010002	They think we live in a worldly way , and I plan to be very bold with them when I come . I beg you that when I come I will not need to use that same boldness with you .
47010003	We do live in the world , but we do not fight in the same way the world fights .
47010004	We fight with weapons that are different from those the world uses . Our weapons have power from God that can destroy the enemy’s strong places . We destroy people’s arguments
47010005	and every proud thing that raises itself against the knowledge of God . We capture every thought and make it give up and obey Christ .
47010006	We are ready to punish anyone there who does not obey , but first we want you to obey fully .
47010007	You must look at the facts before you . If you feel sure that you belong to Christ , you must remember that we belong to Christ just as you do .
47010008	It is true that we brag freely about the authority the Lord gave us . But this authority is to build you up , not to tear you down . So I will not be ashamed .
47010009	I do not want you to think I am trying to scare you with my letters .
47010010	Some people say , “ Paul’s letters are powerful and sound important , but when he is with us , he is weak . And his speaking is nothing . ”
47010011	They should know this : We are not there with you now , so we say these things in letters . But when we are there with you , we will show the same authority that we show in our letters .
47010012	We do not dare to compare ourselves with those who think they are very important . They use themselves to measure themselves , and they judge themselves by what they themselves are . This shows that they know nothing .
47010013	But we will not brag about things outside the work that was given us to do . We will limit our bragging to the work that God gave us , and this includes our work with you .
47010014	We are not bragging too much , as we would be if we had not already come to you . But we have come to you with the Good News of Christ .
47010015	We limit our bragging to the work that is ours , not what others have done . We hope that as your faith continues to grow , you will help our work to grow much larger .
47010016	We want to tell the Good News in the areas beyond your city . We do not want to brag about work that has already been done in another person’s area .
47010017	But , “ If people want to brag , they should brag only about the Lord . ”
47010018	It is not those who say they are good who are accepted but those the Lord thinks are good .
47011001	I wish you would be patient with me even when I am a little foolish , but you are already doing that .
47011002	I am jealous over you with a jealousy that comes from God . I promised to give you to Christ , as your only husband . I want to give you as his pure bride .
47011003	But I am afraid that your minds will be led away from your true and pure following of Christ just as Eve was tricked by the snake with his evil ways .
47011004	You are very patient with anyone who comes to you and preaches a different Jesus from the one we preached . You are very willing to accept a spirit or gospel that is different from the Spirit and Good News you received from us .
47011005	I do not think that those “ great apostles ” are any better than I am .
47011006	I may not be a trained speaker , but I do have knowledge . We have shown this to you clearly in every way .
47011007	I preached God’s Good News to you without pay . I made myself unimportant to make you important . Do you think that was wrong ?
47011008	I accepted pay from other churches , taking their money so I could serve you .
47011009	If I needed something when I was with you , I did not trouble any of you . The brothers who came from Macedonia gave me all that I needed . I did not allow myself to depend on you in any way , and I will never depend on you .
47011010	No one in Southern Greece will stop me from bragging about that . I say this with the truth of Christ in me .
47011011	And why do I not depend on you ? Do you think it is because I do not love you ? God knows that I love you .
47011012	And I will continue doing what I am doing now , because I want to stop those people from having a reason to brag . They would like to say that the work they brag about is the same as ours .
47011013	Such men are not true apostles but are workers who lie . They change themselves to look like apostles of Christ .
47011014	This does not surprise us . Even Satan changes himself to look like an angel of light .
47011015	So it does not surprise us if Satan’s servants also make themselves look like servants who work for what is right . But in the end they will be punished for what they do .
47011016	I tell you again : No one should think I am a fool . But if you think so , accept me as you would accept a fool . Then I can brag a little , too .
47011017	When I brag because I feel sure of myself , I am not talking as the Lord would talk but as a fool .
47011018	Many people are bragging about their lives in the world . So I will brag too .
47011019	You are wise , so you will gladly be patient with fools !
47011020	You are even patient with those who order you around , or use you , or trick you , or think they are better than you , or hit you in the face .
47011021	It is shameful to me to say this , but we were too “ weak ” to do those things to you ! But if anyone else is brave enough to brag , then I also will be brave and brag . ( I am talking as a fool . )
47011022	Are they Hebrews ? So am I . Are they Israelites ? So am I . Are they from Abraham’s family ? So am I .
47011023	Are they serving Christ ? I am serving him more . ( I am crazy to talk like this . ) I have worked much harder than they . I have been in prison more often . I have been hurt more in beatings . I have been near death many times .
47011024	Five times the Jews have given me their punishment of thirty-nine lashes with a whip .
47011025	Three different times I was beaten with rods . One time I was almost stoned to death . Three times I was in ships that wrecked , and one of those times I spent a night and a day in the sea .
47011026	I have gone on many travels and have been in danger from rivers , thieves , my own people , the Jews , and those who are not Jews . I have been in danger in cities , in places where no one lives , and on the sea . And I have been in danger with false Christians .
47011027	I have done hard and tiring work , and many times I did not sleep . I have been hungry and thirsty , and many times I have been without food . I have been cold and without clothes .
47011028	Besides all this , there is on me every day the load of my concern for all the churches .
47011029	I feel weak every time someone is weak , and I feel upset every time someone is led into sin .
47011030	If I must brag , I will brag about the things that show I am weak .
47011031	God knows I am not lying . He is the God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ , and he is to be praised forever .
47011032	When I was in Damascus , the governor under King Aretas wanted to arrest me , so he put guards around the city .
47011033	But my friends lowered me in a basket through a hole in the city wall . So I escaped from the governor .
47012001	I must continue to brag . It will do no good , but I will talk now about visions and revelations from the Lord .
47012002	I know a man in Christ who was taken up to the third heaven fourteen years ago . I do not know whether the man was in his body or out of his body , but God knows .
47012005	I will brag about a man like that , but I will not brag about myself , except about my weaknesses .
47012006	But if I wanted to brag about myself , I would not be a fool , because I would be telling the truth . But I will not brag about myself . I do not want people to think more of me than what they see me do or hear me say .
47012007	So that I would not become too proud of the wonderful things that were shown to me , a painful physical problem was given to me . This problem was a messenger from Satan , sent to beat me and keep me from being too proud .
47012008	I begged the Lord three times to take this problem away from me .
47012009	But he said to me , “ My grace is enough for you . When you are weak , my power is made perfect in you . ” So I am very happy to brag about my weaknesses . Then Christ’s power can live in me .
47012010	For this reason I am happy when I have weaknesses , insults , hard times , sufferings , and all kinds of troubles for Christ . Because when I am weak , then I am truly strong .
47012011	I have been talking like a fool , but you made me do it . You are the ones who should say good things about me . I am worth nothing , but those “ great apostles ” are not worth any more than I am !
47012012	When I was with you , I patiently did the things that prove I am an apostle — signs , wonders , and miracles .
47012013	So you received everything that the other churches have received . Only one thing was different : I was not a burden to you . Forgive me for this !
47012014	I am now ready to visit you the third time , and I will not be a burden to you . I want nothing from you , except you . Children should not have to save up to give to their parents . Parents should save to give to their children .
47012015	So I am happy to give everything I have for you , even myself . If I love you more , will you love me less ?
47012016	It is clear I was not a burden to you , but you think I was tricky and lied to catch you .
47012017	Did I cheat you by using any of the messengers I sent to you ? No , you know I did not .
47012018	I asked Titus to go to you , and I sent our brother with him . Titus did not cheat you , did he ? No , you know that Titus and I did the same thing and with the same spirit .
47012019	Do you think we have been defending ourselves to you all this time ? We have been speaking in Christ and before God . You are our dear friends , and everything we do is to make you stronger .
47012020	I am afraid that when I come , you will not be what I want you to be , and I will not be what you want me to be . I am afraid that among you there may be arguing , jealousy , anger , selfish fighting , evil talk , gossip , pride , and confusion .
47012021	I am afraid that when I come to you again , my God will make me ashamed before you . I may be saddened by many of those who have sinned because they have not changed their hearts or turned from their sexual sins and the shameful things they have done .
47013001	I will come to you for the third time . “ Every case must be proved by two or three witnesses . ”
47013002	When I was with you the second time , I gave a warning to those who had sinned . Now I am away from you , and I give a warning to all the others . When I come to you again , I will not be easy with them .
47013003	You want proof that Christ is speaking through me . My proof is that he is not weak among you , but he is powerful .
47013004	It is true that he was weak when he was killed on the cross , but he lives now by God’s power . It is true that we are weak in Christ , but for you we will be alive in Christ by God’s power .
47013005	Look closely at yourselves . Test yourselves to see if you are living in the faith . You know that Jesus Christ is in you — unless you fail the test .
47013006	But I hope you will see that we ourselves have not failed the test .
47013007	We pray to God that you will not do anything wrong . It is not important to see that we have passed the test , but it is important that you do what is right , even if it seems we have failed .
47013008	We cannot do anything against the truth , but only for the truth .
47013009	We are happy to be weak , if you are strong , and we pray that you will become complete .
47013010	I am writing this while I am away from you so that when I come I will not have to be harsh in my use of authority . The Lord gave me this authority to build you up , not to tear you down .
47013011	Now , brothers and sisters , I say good-bye . Live in harmony . Do what I have asked you to do . Agree with each other , and live in peace . Then the God of love and peace will be with you .
47013012	Greet each other with a holy kiss .
47013013	All of God’s holy people send greetings to you .
47013014	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ , the love of God , and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all .
48001001	From Paul , an apostle . I was not chosen to be an apostle by human beings , nor was I sent from human beings . I was made an apostle through Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised Jesus from the dead .
48001002	This letter is also from all those of God’s family who are with me . To the churches in Galatia :
48001003	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
48001004	Jesus gave himself for our sins to free us from this evil world we live in , as God the Father planned .
48001005	The glory belongs to God forever and ever . Amen .
48001006	God , by his grace through Christ , called you to become his people . So I am amazed that you are turning away so quickly and believing something different than the Good News .
48001007	Really , there is no other Good News . But some people are confusing you ; they want to change the Good News of Christ .
48001008	We preached to you the Good News . So if we ourselves , or even an angel from heaven , should preach to you something different , we should be judged guilty !
48001009	I said this before , and now I say it again : You have already accepted the Good News . If anyone is preaching something different to you , let that person be judged guilty !
48001010	Do you think I am trying to make people accept me ? No , God is the One I am trying to please . Am I trying to please people ? If I still wanted to please people , I would not be a servant of Christ .
48001011	Brothers and sisters , I want you to know that the Good News I preached to you was not made up by human beings .
48001012	I did not get it from humans , nor did anyone teach it to me , but Jesus Christ showed it to me .
48001013	You have heard about my past life in the Jewish religion . I attacked the church of God and tried to destroy it .
48001014	I was becoming a leader in the Jewish religion , doing better than most other Jews of my age . I tried harder than anyone else to follow the teachings handed down by our ancestors .
48001015	But God had special plans for me and set me apart for his work even before I was born . He called me through his grace
48001016	and showed his son to me so that I might tell the Good News about him to those who are not Jewish . When God called me , I did not get advice or help from any person .
48001017	I did not go to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was . But , without waiting , I went away to Arabia and later went back to Damascus .
48001018	After three years I went to Jerusalem to meet Peter and stayed with him for fifteen days .
48001019	I met no other apostles , except James , the brother of the Lord .
48001020	God knows that these things I write are not lies .
48001021	Later , I went to the areas of Syria and Cilicia .
48001022	In Judea the churches in Christ had never met me .
48001023	They had only heard it said , “ This man who was attacking us is now preaching the same faith that he once tried to destroy . ”
48001024	And these believers praised God because of me .
48002001	After fourteen years I went to Jerusalem again , this time with Barnabas . I also took Titus with me .
48002002	I went because God showed me I should go . I met with the believers there , and in private I told their leaders the Good News that I preach to the non-Jewish people . I did not want my past work and the work I am now doing to be wasted .
48002003	Titus was with me , but he was not forced to be circumcised , even though he was a Greek .
48002004	We talked about this problem because some false believers had come into our group secretly . They came in like spies to overturn the freedom we have in Christ Jesus . They wanted to make us slaves .
48002005	But we did not give in to those false believers for a minute . We wanted the truth of the Good News to continue for you .
48002006	Those leaders who seemed to be important did not change the Good News that I preach . ( It doesn’t matter to me if they were “ important ” or not . To God everyone is the same . )
48002007	But these leaders saw that I had been given the work of telling the Good News to those who are not Jewish , just as Peter had the work of telling the Jews .
48002008	God gave Peter the power to work as an apostle for the Jewish people . But he also gave me the power to work as an apostle for those who are not Jews .
48002009	James , Peter , and John , who seemed to be the leaders , understood that God had given me this special grace , so they accepted Barnabas and me . They agreed that they would go to the Jewish people and that we should go to those who are not Jewish .
48002010	The only thing they asked us was to remember to help the poor — something I really wanted to do .
48002011	When Peter came to Antioch , I challenged him to his face , because he was wrong .
48002012	Peter ate with the non-Jewish people until some Jewish people sent from James came to Antioch . When they arrived , Peter stopped eating with those who weren’t Jewish , and he separated himself from them . He was afraid of the Jews .
48002013	So Peter was a hypocrite , as were the other Jewish believers who joined with him . Even Barnabas was influenced by what these Jewish believers did .
48002014	When I saw they were not following the truth of the Good News , I spoke to Peter in front of them all . I said , “ Peter , you are a Jew , but you are not living like a Jew . You are living like those who are not Jewish . So why do you now try to force those who are not Jewish to live like Jews ? ”
48002015	We were not born as non-Jewish “ sinners , ” but as Jews .
48002016	Yet we know that a person is made right with God not by following the law , but by trusting in Jesus Christ . So we , too , have put our faith in Christ Jesus , that we might be made right with God because we trusted in Christ . It is not because we followed the law , because no one can be made right with God by following the law .
48002017	We Jews came to Christ , trying to be made right with God , and it became clear that we are sinners , too . Does this mean that Christ encourages sin ? No !
48002018	But I would really be wrong to begin teaching again those things that I gave up .
48002019	It was the law that put me to death , and I died to the law so that I can now live for God .
48002020	I was put to death on the cross with Christ , and I do not live anymore — it is Christ who lives in me . I still live in my body , but I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave himself to save me .
48002021	By saying these things I am not going against God’s grace . Just the opposite , if the law could make us right with God , then Christ’s death would be useless .
48003001	You people in Galatia were told very clearly about the death of Jesus Christ on the cross . But you were foolish ; you let someone trick you .
48003002	Tell me this one thing : How did you receive the Holy Spirit ? Did you receive the Spirit by following the law ? No , you received the Spirit because you heard the Good News and believed it .
48003003	You began your life in Christ by the Spirit . Now are you trying to make it complete by your own power ? That is foolish .
48003004	Were all your experiences wasted ? I hope not !
48003005	Does God give you the Spirit and work miracles among you because you follow the law ? No , he does these things because you heard the Good News and believed it .
48003006	The Scriptures say the same thing about Abraham : “ Abraham believed God , and God accepted Abraham’s faith , and that faith made him right with God . ”
48003007	So you should know that the true children of Abraham are those who have faith .
48003008	The Scriptures , telling what would happen in the future , said that God would make the non-Jewish people right through their faith . This Good News was told to Abraham beforehand , as the Scripture says : “ All nations will be blessed through you . ”
48003009	So all who believe as Abraham believed are blessed just as Abraham was .
48003010	But those who depend on following the law to make them right are under a curse , because the Scriptures say , “ Anyone will be cursed who does not always obey what is written in the Book of the Law . ”
48003011	Now it is clear that no one can be made right with God by the law , because the Scriptures say , “ Those who are right with God will live by faith . ”
48003012	The law is not based on faith . It says , “ A person who obeys these things will live because of them . ”
48003013	Christ took away the curse the law put on us . He changed places with us and put himself under that curse . It is written in the Scriptures , “ Anyone whose body is displayed on a tree is cursed . ”
48003014	Christ did this so that God’s blessing promised to Abraham might come through Jesus Christ to those who are not Jews . Jesus died so that by our believing we could receive the Spirit that God promised .
48003015	Brothers and sisters , let us think in human terms : Even an agreement made between two persons is firm . After that agreement is accepted by both people , no one can stop it or add anything to it .
48003016	God made promises both to Abraham and to his descendant . God did not say , “ and to your descendants . ” That would mean many people . But God said , “ and to your descendant . ” That means only one person ; that person is Christ .
48003017	This is what I mean : God had an agreement with Abraham and promised to keep it . The law , which came four hundred thirty years later , cannot change that agreement and so destroy God’s promise to Abraham .
48003018	If the law could give us Abraham’s blessing , then the promise would not be necessary . But that is not possible , because God freely gave his blessings to Abraham through the promise he had made .
48003019	So what was the law for ? It was given to show that the wrong things people do are against God’s will . And it continued until the special descendant , who had been promised , came . The law was given through angels who used Moses for a mediator to give the law to people .
48003020	But a mediator is not needed when there is only one side , and God is only one .
48003021	Does this mean that the law is against God’s promises ? Never ! That would be true only if the law could make us right with God . But God did not give a law that can bring life .
48003022	Instead , the Scriptures showed that the whole world is bound by sin . This was so the promise would be given through faith to people who believe in Jesus Christ .
48003023	Before this faith came , we were all held prisoners by the law . We had no freedom until God showed us the way of faith that was coming .
48003024	In other words , the law was our guardian leading us to Christ so that we could be made right with God through faith .
48003025	Now the way of faith has come , and we no longer live under a guardian .
48003028	In Christ , there is no difference between Jew and Greek , slave and free person , male and female . You are all the same in Christ Jesus .
48003029	You belong to Christ , so you are Abraham’s descendants . You will inherit all of God’s blessings because of the promise God made to Abraham .
48004001	I want to tell you this : While those who will inherit their fathers’ property are still children , they are no different from slaves . It does not matter that the children own everything .
48004002	While they are children , they must obey those who are chosen to care for them . But when the children reach the age set by their fathers , they are free .
48004003	It is the same for us . We were once like children , slaves to the useless rules of this world .
48004004	But when the right time came , God sent his Son who was born of a woman and lived under the law .
48004005	God did this so he could buy freedom for those who were under the law and so we could become his children .
48004006	Since you are God’s children , God sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts , and the Spirit cries out , “ Father . ”
48004007	So now you are not a slave ; you are God’s child , and God will give you the blessing he promised , because you are his child .
48004008	In the past you did not know God . You were slaves to gods that were not real .
48004009	But now you know the true God . Really , it is God who knows you . So why do you turn back to those weak and useless rules you followed before ? Do you want to be slaves to those things again ?
48004010	You still follow teachings about special days , months , seasons , and years .
48004011	I am afraid for you , that my work for you has been wasted .
48004012	Brothers and sisters , I became like you , so I beg you to become like me . You were very good to me before .
48004013	You remember that it was because of an illness that I came to you the first time , preaching the Good News .
48004014	Though my sickness was a trouble for you , you did not hate me or make me leave . But you welcomed me as an angel from God , as if I were Jesus Christ himself !
48004015	You were very happy then , but where is that joy now ? I am ready to testify that you would have taken out your eyes and given them to me if that were possible .
48004016	Now am I your enemy because I tell you the truth ?
48004017	Those people are working hard to persuade you , but this is not good for you . They want to persuade you to turn against us and follow only them .
48004018	It is good for people to show interest in you , but only if their purpose is good . This is always true , not just when I am with you .
48004019	My little children , again I feel the pain of childbirth for you until you truly become like Christ .
48004020	I wish I could be with you now and could change the way I am talking to you , because I do not know what to think about you .
48004021	Some of you still want to be under the law . Tell me , do you know what the law says ?
48004022	The Scriptures say that Abraham had two sons . The mother of one son was a slave woman , and the mother of the other son was a free woman .
48004023	Abraham’s son from the slave woman was born in the normal human way . But the son from the free woman was born because of the promise God made to Abraham .
48004024	This story teaches something else : The two women are like the two agreements between God and his people . One agreement is the law that God made on Mount Sinai , and the people who are under this agreement are like slaves . The mother named Hagar is like that agreement .
48004025	She is like Mount Sinai in Arabia and is a picture of the earthly city of Jerusalem . This city and its people are slaves to the law .
48004026	But the heavenly Jerusalem , which is above , is like the free woman . She is our mother .
48004027	It is written in the Scriptures : “ Be happy , Jerusalem . You are like a woman who never gave birth to children . Start singing and shout for joy . You never felt the pain of giving birth , but you will have more children than the woman who has a husband . ”
48004028	My brothers and sisters , you are God’s children because of his promise , as Isaac was then .
48004029	The son who was born in the normal way treated the other son badly . It is the same today .
48004030	But what does the Scripture say ? “ Throw out the slave woman and her son . The son of the slave woman should not inherit anything . The son of the free woman should receive it all . ”
48004031	So , my brothers and sisters , we are not children of the slave woman , but of the free woman .
48005001	We have freedom now , because Christ made us free . So stand strong . Do not change and go back into the slavery of the law .
48005002	Listen , I Paul tell you that if you go back to the law by being circumcised , Christ does you no good .
48005003	Again , I warn every man : If you allow yourselves to be circumcised , you must follow all the law .
48005004	If you try to be made right with God through the law , your life with Christ is over — you have left God’s grace .
48005005	But we have the true hope that comes from being made right with God , and by the Spirit we wait eagerly for this hope .
48005006	When we are in Christ Jesus , it is not important if we are circumcised or not . The important thing is faith — the kind of faith that works through love .
48005007	You were running a good race . Who stopped you from following the true way ?
48005008	This change did not come from the One who chose you .
48005009	Be careful ! “ Just a little yeast makes the whole batch of dough rise . ”
48005010	But I trust in the Lord that you will not believe those different ideas . Whoever is confusing you with such ideas will be punished .
48005011	My brothers and sisters , I do not teach that a man must be circumcised . If I teach circumcision , why am I still being attacked ? If I still taught circumcision , my preaching about the cross would not be a problem .
48005012	I wish the people who are bothering you would castrate themselves !
48005013	My brothers and sisters , God called you to be free , but do not use your freedom as an excuse to do what pleases your sinful self . Serve each other with love .
48005014	The whole law is made complete in this one command : “ Love your neighbor as you love yourself . ”
48005015	If you go on hurting each other and tearing each other apart , be careful , or you will completely destroy each other .
48005016	So I tell you : Live by following the Spirit . Then you will not do what your sinful selves want .
48005017	Our sinful selves want what is against the Spirit , and the Spirit wants what is against our sinful selves . The two are against each other , so you cannot do just what you please .
48005018	But if the Spirit is leading you , you are not under the law .
48005019	The wrong things the sinful self does are clear : being sexually unfaithful , not being pure , taking part in sexual sins ,
48005020	worshiping gods , doing witchcraft , hating , making trouble , being jealous , being angry , being selfish , making people angry with each other , causing divisions among people ,
48005021	feeling envy , being drunk , having wild and wasteful parties , and doing other things like these . I warn you now as I warned you before : Those who do these things will not inherit God’s kingdom .
48005022	But the Spirit produces the fruit of love , joy , peace , patience , kindness , goodness , faithfulness ,
48005023	gentleness , self-control . There is no law that says these things are wrong .
48005024	Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified their own sinful selves . They have given up their old selfish feelings and the evil things they wanted to do .
48005025	We get our new life from the Spirit , so we should follow the Spirit .
48005026	We must not be proud or make trouble with each other or be jealous of each other .
48006001	Brothers and sisters , if someone in your group does something wrong , you who are spiritual should go to that person and gently help make him right again . But be careful , because you might be tempted to sin , too .
48006002	By helping each other with your troubles , you truly obey the law of Christ .
48006003	If anyone thinks he is important when he really is not , he is only fooling himself .
48006004	Each person should judge his own actions and not compare himself with others . Then he can be proud for what he himself has done .
48006005	Each person must be responsible for himself .
48006006	Anyone who is learning the teaching of God should share all the good things he has with his teacher .
48006007	Do not be fooled : You cannot cheat God . People harvest only what they plant .
48006008	If they plant to satisfy their sinful selves , their sinful selves will bring them ruin . But if they plant to please the Spirit , they will receive eternal life from the Spirit .
48006009	We must not become tired of doing good . We will receive our harvest of eternal life at the right time if we do not give up .
48006010	When we have the opportunity to help anyone , we should do it . But we should give special attention to those who are in the family of believers .
48006011	See what large letters I use to write this myself .
48006012	Some people are trying to force you to be circumcised so the Jews will accept them . They are afraid they will be attacked if they follow only the cross of Christ .
48006013	Those who are circumcised do not obey the law themselves , but they want you to be circumcised so they can brag about what they forced you to do .
48006014	I hope I will never brag about things like that . The cross of our Lord Jesus Christ is my only reason for bragging . Through the cross of Jesus my world was crucified , and I died to the world .
48006015	It is not important if a man is circumcised or uncircumcised . The important thing is being the new people God has made .
48006016	Peace and mercy to those who follow this rule — and to all of God’s people .
48006017	So do not give me any more trouble . I have scars on my body that show I belong to Christ Jesus .
48006018	My brothers and sisters , the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit . Amen .
49001001	From Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus . I am an apostle because that is what God wanted . To God’s holy people living in Ephesus , believers in Christ Jesus :
49001002	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
49001003	Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ . In Christ , God has given us every spiritual blessing in the heavenly world .
49001004	That is , in Christ , he chose us before the world was made so that we would be his holy people — people without blame before him .
49001005	Because of his love , God had already decided to make us his own children through Jesus Christ . That was what he wanted and what pleased him ,
49001006	and it brings praise to God because of his wonderful grace . God gave that grace to us freely , in Christ , the One he loves .
49001007	In Christ we are set free by the blood of his death , and so we have forgiveness of sins . How rich is God’s grace ,
49001008	which he has given to us so fully and freely . God , with full wisdom and understanding ,
49001009	let us know his secret purpose . This was what God wanted , and he planned to do it through Christ .
49001010	His goal was to carry out his plan , when the right time came , that all things in heaven and on earth would be joined together in Christ as the head .
49001011	In Christ we were chosen to be God’s people , because from the very beginning God had decided this in keeping with his plan . And he is the One who makes everything agree with what he decides and wants .
49001012	We are the first people who hoped in Christ , and we were chosen so that we would bring praise to God’s glory .
49001013	So it is with you . When you heard the true teaching — the Good News about your salvation — you believed in Christ . And in Christ , God put his special mark of ownership on you by giving you the Holy Spirit that he had promised .
49001014	That Holy Spirit is the guarantee that we will receive what God promised for his people until God gives full freedom to those who are his — to bring praise to God’s glory .
49001015	That is why since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all God’s people ,
49001016	I have not stopped giving thanks to God for you . I always remember you in my prayers ,
49001017	asking the God of our Lord Jesus Christ , the glorious Father , to give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation so that you will know him better .
49001018	I pray also that you will have greater understanding in your heart so you will know the hope to which he has called us and that you will know how rich and glorious are the blessings God has promised his holy people .
49001019	And you will know that God’s power is very great for us who believe . That power is the same as the great strength
49001020	God used to raise Christ from the dead and put him at his right side in the heavenly world .
49001021	God has put Christ over all rulers , authorities , powers , and kings , not only in this world but also in the next .
49001022	God put everything under his power and made him the head over everything for the church ,
49001023	which is Christ’s body . The church is filled with Christ , and Christ fills everything in every way .
49002001	In the past you were spiritually dead because of your sins and the things you did against God .
49002002	Yes , in the past you lived the way the world lives , following the ruler of the evil powers that are above the earth . That same spirit is now working in those who refuse to obey God .
49002003	In the past all of us lived like them , trying to please our sinful selves and doing all the things our bodies and minds wanted . We should have suffered God’s anger because we were sinful by nature . We were the same as all other people .
49002004	But God’s mercy is great , and he loved us very much .
49002005	Though we were spiritually dead because of the things we did against God , he gave us new life with Christ . You have been saved by God’s grace .
49002006	And he raised us up with Christ and gave us a seat with him in the heavens . He did this for those in Christ Jesus
49002007	so that for all future time he could show the very great riches of his grace by being kind to us in Christ Jesus .
49002008	I mean that you have been saved by grace through believing . You did not save yourselves ; it was a gift from God .
49002009	It was not the result of your own efforts , so you cannot brag about it .
49002010	God has made us what we are . In Christ Jesus , God made us to do good works , which God planned in advance for us to live our lives doing .
49002011	You were not born Jewish . You are the people the Jews call “ uncircumcised . ” Those who call you “ uncircumcised ” call themselves “ circumcised . ” ( Their circumcision is only something they themselves do on their bodies . )
49002012	Remember that in the past you were without Christ . You were not citizens of Israel , and you had no part in the agreements with the promise that God made to his people . You had no hope , and you did not know God .
49002013	But now in Christ Jesus , you who were far away from God are brought near through the blood of Christ’s death .
49002014	Christ himself is our peace . He made both Jewish people and those who are not Jews one people . They were separated as if there were a wall between them , but Christ broke down that wall of hate by giving his own body .
49002015	The Jewish law had many commands and rules , but Christ ended that law . His purpose was to make the two groups of people become one new people in him and in this way make peace .
49002016	It was also Christ’s purpose to end the hatred between the two groups , to make them into one body , and to bring them back to God . Christ did all this with his death on the cross .
49002017	Christ came and preached peace to you who were far away from God , and to those who were near to God .
49002018	Yes , it is through Christ we all have the right to come to the Father in one Spirit .
49002019	Now you who are not Jewish are not foreigners or strangers any longer , but are citizens together with God’s holy people . You belong to God’s family .
49002020	You are like a building that was built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets . Christ Jesus himself is the most important stone in that building ,
49002021	and that whole building is joined together in Christ . He makes it grow and become a holy temple in the Lord .
49002022	And in Christ you , too , are being built together with the Jews into a place where God lives through the Spirit .
49003001	So I , Paul , am a prisoner of Christ Jesus for you who are not Jews .
49003002	Surely you have heard that God gave me this work to tell you about his grace .
49003003	He let me know his secret by showing it to me . I have already written a little about this .
49003004	If you read what I wrote then , you can see that I truly understand the secret about the Christ .
49003005	People who lived in other times were not told that secret . But now , through the Spirit , God has shown that secret to his holy apostles and prophets .
49003006	This is that secret : that through the Good News those who are not Jews will share with the Jews in God’s blessing . They belong to the same body , and they share together in the promise that God made in Christ Jesus .
49003007	By God’s special gift of grace given to me through his power , I became a servant to tell that Good News .
49003008	I am the least important of all God’s people , but God gave me this gift — to tell those who are not Jews the Good News about the riches of Christ , which are too great to understand fully .
49003009	And God gave me the work of telling all people about the plan for his secret , which has been hidden in him since the beginning of time . He is the One who created everything .
49003010	His purpose was that through the church all the rulers and powers in the heavenly world will now know God’s wisdom , which has so many forms .
49003011	This agrees with the purpose God had since the beginning of time , and he carried out his plan through Christ Jesus our Lord .
49003012	In Christ we can come before God with freedom and without fear . We can do this through faith in Christ .
49003013	So I ask you not to become discouraged because of the sufferings I am having for you . My sufferings are for your glory .
49003014	So I bow in prayer before the Father
49003015	from whom every family in heaven and on earth gets its true name .
49003016	I ask the Father in his great glory to give you the power to be strong inwardly through his Spirit .
49003017	I pray that Christ will live in your hearts by faith and that your life will be strong in love and be built on love .
49003018	And I pray that you and all God’s holy people will have the power to understand the greatness of Christ’s love — how wide and how long and how high and how deep that love is .
49003019	Christ’s love is greater than anyone can ever know , but I pray that you will be able to know that love . Then you can be filled with the fullness of God .
49003020	With God’s power working in us , God can do much , much more than anything we can ask or imagine .
49003021	To him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus for all time , forever and ever . Amen .
49004001	I am in prison because I belong to the Lord . Therefore I urge you who have been chosen by God to live up to the life to which God called you .
49004002	Always be humble , gentle , and patient , accepting each other in love .
49004003	You are joined together with peace through the Spirit , so make every effort to continue together in this way .
49004004	There is one body and one Spirit , and God called you to have one hope .
49004005	There is one Lord , one faith , and one baptism .
49004006	There is one God and Father of everything . He rules everything and is everywhere and is in everything .
49004007	Christ gave each one of us the special gift of grace , showing how generous he is .
49004008	That is why it says in the Scriptures , “ When he went up to the heights , he led a parade of captives , and he gave gifts to people . ”
49004009	When it says , “ He went up , ” what does it mean ? It means that he first came down to the earth .
49004010	So Jesus came down , and he is the same One who went up above all the heaven . Christ did that to fill everything with his presence .
49004011	And Christ gave gifts to people — he made some to be apostles , some to be prophets , some to go and tell the Good News , and some to have the work of caring for and teaching God’s people .
49004012	Christ gave those gifts to prepare God’s holy people for the work of serving , to make the body of Christ stronger .
49004013	This work must continue until we are all joined together in the same faith and in the same knowledge of the Son of God . We must become like a mature person , growing until we become like Christ and have his perfection .
49004014	Then we will no longer be babies . We will not be tossed about like a ship that the waves carry one way and then another . We will not be influenced by every new teaching we hear from people who are trying to fool us . They make plans and try any kind of trick to fool people into following the wrong path .
49004015	No ! Speaking the truth with love , we will grow up in every way into Christ , who is the head .
49004016	The whole body depends on Christ , and all the parts of the body are joined and held together . Each part does its own work to make the whole body grow and be strong with love .
49004017	In the Lord’s name , I tell you this . Do not continue living like those who do not believe . Their thoughts are worth nothing .
49004018	They do not understand , and they know nothing , because they refuse to listen . So they cannot have the life that God gives .
49004019	They have lost all feeling of shame , and they use their lives for doing evil . They continually want to do all kinds of evil .
49004020	But what you learned in Christ was not like this .
49004021	I know that you heard about him , and you are in him , so you were taught the truth that is in Jesus .
49004022	You were taught to leave your old self — to stop living the evil way you lived before . That old self becomes worse , because people are fooled by the evil things they want to do .
49004023	But you were taught to be made new in your hearts ,
49004024	to become a new person . That new person is made to be like God — made to be truly good and holy .
49004025	So you must stop telling lies . Tell each other the truth , because we all belong to each other in the same body .
49004026	When you are angry , do not sin , and be sure to stop being angry before the end of the day .
49004027	Do not give the devil a way to defeat you .
49004028	Those who are stealing must stop stealing and start working . They should earn an honest living for themselves . Then they will have something to share with those who are poor .
49004029	When you talk , do not say harmful things , but say what people need — words that will help others become stronger . Then what you say will do good to those who listen to you .
49004030	And do not make the Holy Spirit sad . The Spirit is God’s proof that you belong to him . God gave you the Spirit to show that God will make you free when the final day comes .
49004031	Do not be bitter or angry or mad . Never shout angrily or say things to hurt others . Never do anything evil .
49004032	Be kind and loving to each other , and forgive each other just as God forgave you in Christ .
49005001	You are God’s children whom he loves , so try to be like him .
49005002	Live a life of love just as Christ loved us and gave himself for us as a sweet-smelling offering and sacrifice to God .
49005003	But there must be no sexual sin among you , or any kind of evil or greed . Those things are not right for God’s holy people .
49005004	Also , there must be no evil talk among you , and you must not speak foolishly or tell evil jokes . These things are not right for you . Instead , you should be giving thanks to God .
49005005	You can be sure of this : No one will have a place in the kingdom of Christ and of God who sins sexually , or does evil things , or is greedy . Anyone who is greedy is serving a false god .
49005006	Do not let anyone fool you by telling you things that are not true , because these things will bring God’s anger on those who do not obey him .
49005007	So have nothing to do with them .
49005008	In the past you were full of darkness , but now you are full of light in the Lord . So live like children who belong to the light .
49005009	Light brings every kind of goodness , right living , and truth .
49005010	Try to learn what pleases the Lord .
49005011	Have nothing to do with the things done in darkness , which are not worth anything . But show that they are wrong .
49005012	It is shameful even to talk about what those people do in secret .
49005013	But the light makes all things easy to see ,
49005014	and everything that is made easy to see can become light . This is why it is said : “ Wake up , sleeper ! Rise from death , and Christ will shine on you . ”
49005015	So be very careful how you live . Do not live like those who are not wise , but live wisely .
49005016	Use every chance you have for doing good , because these are evil times .
49005017	So do not be foolish but learn what the Lord wants you to do .
49005018	Do not be drunk with wine , which will ruin you , but be filled with the Spirit .
49005019	Speak to each other with psalms , hymns , and spiritual songs , singing and making music in your hearts to the Lord .
49005020	Always give thanks to God the Father for everything , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ .
49005021	Yield to obey each other as you would to Christ .
49005022	Wives , yield to your husbands , as you do to the Lord ,
49005023	because the husband is the head of the wife , as Christ is the head of the church . And he is the Savior of the body , which is the church .
49005024	As the church yields to Christ , so you wives should yield to your husbands in everything .
49005025	Husbands , love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it
49005026	to make it belong to God . Christ used the word to make the church clean by washing it with water .
49005027	He died so that he could give the church to himself like a bride in all her beauty . He died so that the church could be pure and without fault , with no evil or sin or any other wrong thing in it .
49005028	In the same way , husbands should love their wives as they love their own bodies . The man who loves his wife loves himself .
49005029	No one ever hates his own body , but feeds and takes care of it . And that is what Christ does for the church ,
49005030	because we are parts of his body .
49005031	The Scripture says , “ So a man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife , and the two will become one body . ”
49005032	That secret is very important — I am talking about Christ and the church .
49005033	But each one of you must love his wife as he loves himself , and a wife must respect her husband .
49006001	Children , obey your parents as the Lord wants , because this is the right thing to do .
49006002	The command says , “ Honor your father and mother . ” This is the first command that has a promise with it —
49006003	“ Then everything will be well with you , and you will have a long life on the earth . ”
49006004	Fathers , do not make your children angry , but raise them with the training and teaching of the Lord .
49006005	Slaves , obey your masters here on earth with fear and respect and from a sincere heart , just as you obey Christ .
49006006	You must do this not only while they are watching you , to please them . With all your heart you must do what God wants as people who are obeying Christ .
49006007	Do your work with enthusiasm . Work as if you were serving the Lord , not as if you were serving only men and women .
49006008	Remember that the Lord will give a reward to everyone , slave or free , for doing good .
49006009	Masters , in the same way , be good to your slaves . Do not threaten them . Remember that the One who is your Master and their Master is in heaven , and he treats everyone alike .
49006010	Finally , be strong in the Lord and in his great power .
49006011	Put on the full armor of God so that you can fight against the devil’s evil tricks .
49006012	Our fight is not against people on earth but against the rulers and authorities and the powers of this world’s darkness , against the spiritual powers of evil in the heavenly world .
49006013	That is why you need to put on God’s full armor . Then on the day of evil you will be able to stand strong . And when you have finished the whole fight , you will still be standing .
49006014	So stand strong , with the belt of truth tied around your waist and the protection of right living on your chest .
49006015	On your feet wear the Good News of peace to help you stand strong .
49006016	And also use the shield of faith with which you can stop all the burning arrows of the Evil One .
49006017	Accept God’s salvation as your helmet , and take the sword of the Spirit , which is the word of God .
49006018	Pray in the Spirit at all times with all kinds of prayers , asking for everything you need . To do this you must always be ready and never give up . Always pray for all God’s people .
49006019	Also pray for me that when I speak , God will give me words so that I can tell the secret of the Good News without fear .
49006020	I have been sent to preach this Good News , and I am doing that now , here in prison . Pray that when I preach the Good News I will speak without fear , as I should .
49006021	I am sending to you Tychicus , our brother whom we love and a faithful servant of the Lord’s work . He will tell you everything that is happening with me . Then you will know how I am and what I am doing .
49006022	I am sending him to you for this reason — so that you will know how we are , and he can encourage you .
49006023	Peace and love with faith to you brothers and sisters from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
49006024	Grace to all of you who love our Lord Jesus Christ with love that never ends .
50001001	From Paul and Timothy , servants of Christ Jesus . To all of God’s holy people in Christ Jesus who live in Philippi , including your overseers and deacons :
50001002	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
50001003	I thank my God every time I remember you ,
50001004	always praying with joy for all of you .
50001005	I thank God for the help you gave me while I preached the Good News — help you gave from the first day you believed until now .
50001006	God began doing a good work in you , and I am sure he will continue it until it is finished when Jesus Christ comes again .
50001007	And I know that I am right to think like this about all of you , because I have you in my heart . All of you share in God’s grace with me while I am in prison and while I am defending and proving the truth of the Good News .
50001008	God knows that I want to see you very much , because I love all of you with the love of Christ Jesus .
50001009	This is my prayer for you : that your love will grow more and more ; that you will have knowledge and understanding with your love ;
50001010	that you will see the difference between good and bad and will choose the good ; that you will be pure and without wrong for the coming of Christ ;
50001011	that you will be filled with the good things produced in your life by Christ to bring glory and praise to God .
50001012	I want you brothers and sisters to know that what has happened to me has helped to spread the Good News .
50001013	All the palace guards and everyone else knows that I am in prison because I am a believer in Christ .
50001014	Because I am in prison , most of the believers have become more bold in Christ and are not afraid to speak the word of God .
50001015	It is true that some preach about Christ because they are jealous and ambitious , but others preach about Christ because they want to help .
50001016	They preach because they have love , and they know that God gave me the work of defending the Good News .
50001017	But the others preach about Christ for selfish and wrong reasons , wanting to make trouble for me in prison .
50001018	But it doesn’t matter . The important thing is that in every way , whether for right or wrong reasons , they are preaching about Christ . So I am happy , and I will continue to be happy .
50001019	Because you are praying for me and the Spirit of Jesus Christ is helping me , I know this trouble will bring my freedom .
50001020	I expect and hope that I will not fail Christ in anything but that I will have the courage now , as always , to show the greatness of Christ in my life here on earth , whether I live or die .
50001021	To me the only important thing about living is Christ , and dying would be profit for me .
50001022	If I continue living in my body , I will be able to work for the Lord . I do not know what to choose — living or dying .
50001023	It is hard to choose between the two . I want to leave this life and be with Christ , which is much better ,
50001024	but you need me here in my body .
50001025	Since I am sure of this , I know I will stay with you to help you grow and have joy in your faith .
50001026	You will be very happy in Christ Jesus when I am with you again .
50001027	Only one thing concerns me : Be sure that you live in a way that brings honor to the Good News of Christ . Then whether I come and visit you or am away from you , I will hear that you are standing strong with one purpose , that you work together as one for the faith of the Good News ,
50001028	and that you are not afraid of those who are against you . All of this is proof that your enemies will be destroyed but that you will be saved by God .
50001029	God gave you the honor not only of believing in Christ but also of suffering for him , both of which bring glory to Christ .
50001030	When I was with you , you saw the struggles I had , and you hear about the struggles I am having now . You yourselves are having the same kind of struggles .
50002001	Does your life in Christ give you strength ? Does his love comfort you ? Do we share together in the spirit ? Do you have mercy and kindness ?
50002002	If so , make me very happy by having the same thoughts , sharing the same love , and having one mind and purpose .
50002003	When you do things , do not let selfishness or pride be your guide . Instead , be humble and give more honor to others than to yourselves .
50002004	Do not be interested only in your own life , but be interested in the lives of others .
50002005	In your lives you must think and act like Christ Jesus .
50002006	Christ himself was like God in everything . But he did not think that being equal with God was something to be used for his own benefit .
50002007	But he gave up his place with God and made himself nothing . He was born as a man and became like a servant .
50002008	And when he was living as a man , he humbled himself and was fully obedient to God , even when that caused his death — death on a cross .
50002009	So God raised him to the highest place . God made his name greater than every other name
50002010	so that every knee will bow to the name of Jesus — everyone in heaven , on earth , and under the earth .
50002011	And everyone will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord and bring glory to God the Father .
50002012	My dear friends , you have always obeyed God when I was with you . It is even more important that you obey now while I am away from you . Keep on working to complete your salvation with fear and trembling ,
50002013	because God is working in you to help you want to do and be able to do what pleases him .
50002014	Do everything without complaining or arguing .
50002015	Then you will be innocent and without any wrong . You will be God’s children without fault . But you are living with crooked and mean people all around you , among whom you shine like stars in the dark world .
50002016	You offer the teaching that gives life . So when Christ comes again , I can be happy because my work was not wasted . I ran the race and won .
50002017	Your faith makes you offer your lives as a sacrifice in serving God . If I have to offer my own blood with your sacrifice , I will be happy and full of joy with all of you .
50002018	You also should be happy and full of joy with me .
50002019	I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon . I will be happy to learn how you are .
50002020	I have no one else like Timothy , who truly cares for you .
50002021	Other people are interested only in their own lives , not in the work of Jesus Christ .
50002022	You know the kind of person Timothy is . You know he has served with me in telling the Good News , as a son serves his father .
50002023	I plan to send him to you quickly when I know what will happen to me .
50002024	I am sure that the Lord will help me to come to you soon .
50002025	Epaphroditus , my brother in Christ , works and serves with me in the army of Christ . When I needed help , you sent him to me . I think now that I must send him back to you ,
50002026	because he wants very much to see all of you . He is worried because you heard that he was sick .
50002027	Yes , he was sick , and nearly died , but God had mercy on him and me too so that I would not have more sadness .
50002028	I want very much to send him to you so that when you see him you can be happy , and I can stop worrying about you .
50002029	Welcome him in the Lord with much joy . Give honor to people like him ,
50002030	because he almost died for the work of Christ . He risked his life to give me the help you could not give in your service to me .
50003001	My brothers and sisters , be full of joy in the Lord . It is no trouble for me to write the same things to you again , and it will help you to be more ready .
50003002	Watch out for those who do evil , who are like dogs , who demand to cut the body .
50003003	We are the ones who are truly circumcised . We worship God through his Spirit , and our pride is in Christ Jesus . We do not put trust in ourselves or anything we can do ,
50003004	although I might be able to put trust in myself . If anyone thinks he has a reason to trust in himself , he should know that I have greater reason for trusting in myself .
50003005	I was circumcised eight days after my birth . I am from the people of Israel and the tribe of Benjamin . I am a Hebrew , and my parents were Hebrews . I had a strict view of the law , which is why I became a Pharisee .
50003006	I was so enthusiastic I tried to hurt the church . No one could find fault with the way I obeyed the law of Moses .
50003007	Those things were important to me , but now I think they are worth nothing because of Christ .
50003008	Not only those things , but I think that all things are worth nothing compared with the greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord . Because of him , I have lost all those things , and now I know they are worthless trash . This allows me to have Christ
50003009	and to belong to him . Now I am right with God , not because I followed the law , but because I believed in Christ . God uses my faith to make me right with him .
50003010	I want to know Christ and the power that raised him from the dead . I want to share in his sufferings and become like him in his death .
50003011	Then I have hope that I myself will be raised from the dead .
50003012	I do not mean that I am already as God wants me to be . I have not yet reached that goal , but I continue trying to reach it and to make it mine . Christ wants me to do that , which is the reason he made me his .
50003013	Brothers and sisters , I know that I have not yet reached that goal , but there is one thing I always do . Forgetting the past and straining toward what is ahead ,
50003014	I keep trying to reach the goal and get the prize for which God called me through Christ to the life above .
50003015	All of us who are spiritually mature should think this way , too . And if there are things you do not agree with , God will make them clear to you .
50003016	But we should continue following the truth we already have .
50003017	Brothers and sisters , all of you should try to follow my example and to copy those who live the way we showed you .
50003018	Many people live like enemies of the cross of Christ . I have often told you about them , and it makes me cry to tell you about them now .
50003019	In the end , they will be destroyed . They do whatever their bodies want , they are proud of their shameful acts , and they think only about earthly things .
50003020	But our homeland is in heaven , and we are waiting for our Savior , the Lord Jesus Christ , to come from heaven .
50003021	By his power to rule all things , he will change our humble bodies and make them like his own glorious body .
50004001	My dear brothers and sisters , I love you and want to see you . You bring me joy and make me proud of you , so stand strong in the Lord as I have told you .
50004002	I ask Euodia and Syntyche to agree in the Lord .
50004003	And I ask you , my faithful friend , to help these women . They served with me in telling the Good News , together with Clement and others who worked with me , whose names are written in the book of life .
50004004	Be full of joy in the Lord always . I will say again , be full of joy .
50004005	Let everyone see that you are gentle and kind . The Lord is coming soon .
50004006	Do not worry about anything , but pray and ask God for everything you need , always giving thanks .
50004007	And God’s peace , which is so great we cannot understand it , will keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus .
50004008	Brothers and sisters , think about the things that are good and worthy of praise . Think about the things that are true and honorable and right and pure and beautiful and respected .
50004009	Do what you learned and received from me , what I told you , and what you saw me do . And the God who gives peace will be with you .
50004010	I am very happy in the Lord that you have shown your care for me again . You continued to care about me , but there was no way for you to show it .
50004011	I am not telling you this because I need anything . I have learned to be satisfied with the things I have and with everything that happens .
50004012	I know how to live when I am poor , and I know how to live when I have plenty . I have learned the secret of being happy at any time in everything that happens , when I have enough to eat and when I go hungry , when I have more than I need and when I do not have enough .
50004013	I can do all things through Christ , because he gives me strength .
50004014	But it was good that you helped me when I needed it .
50004015	You Philippians remember when I first preached the Good News there . When I left Macedonia , you were the only church that gave me help .
50004016	Several times you sent me things I needed when I was in Thessalonica .
50004017	Really , it is not that I want to receive gifts from you , but I want you to have the good that comes from giving .
50004018	And now I have everything , and more . I have all I need , because Epaphroditus brought your gift to me . It is like a sweet-smelling sacrifice offered to God , who accepts that sacrifice and is pleased with it .
50004019	My God will use his wonderful riches in Christ Jesus to give you everything you need .
50004020	Glory to our God and Father forever and ever ! Amen .
50004021	Greet each of God’s people in Christ Jesus . Those who are with me send greetings to you .
50004022	All of God’s people greet you , particularly those from the palace of Caesar .
50004023	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you all .
51001001	From Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus . I am an apostle because that is what God wanted . Also from Timothy , our brother .
51001002	To the holy and faithful brothers and sisters in Christ that live in Colossae : Grace and peace to you from God our Father .
51001003	In our prayers for you we always thank God , the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
51001004	because we have heard about the faith you have in Christ Jesus and the love you have for all of God’s people .
51001005	You have this faith and love because of your hope , and what you hope for is kept safe for you in heaven . You learned about this hope when you heard the message about the truth , the Good News
51001006	that was told to you . Everywhere in the world that Good News is bringing blessings and is growing . This has happened with you , too , since you heard the Good News and understood the truth about the grace of God .
51001007	You learned about God’s grace from Epaphras , whom we love . He works together with us and is a faithful servant of Christ for us .
51001008	He also told us about the love you have from the Holy Spirit .
51001009	Because of this , since the day we heard about you , we have continued praying for you , asking God that you will know fully what he wants . We pray that you will also have great wisdom and understanding in spiritual things
51001010	so that you will live the kind of life that honors and pleases the Lord in every way . You will produce fruit in every good work and grow in the knowledge of God .
51001011	God will strengthen you with his own great power so that you will not give up when troubles come , but you will be patient .
51001012	And you will joyfully give thanks to the Father who has made you able to have a share in all that he has prepared for his people in the kingdom of light .
51001013	God has freed us from the power of darkness , and he brought us into the kingdom of his dear Son .
51001014	The Son paid for our sins , and in him we have forgiveness .
51001015	No one can see God , but Jesus Christ is exactly like him . He ranks higher than everything that has been made .
51001016	Through his power all things were made — things in heaven and on earth , things seen and unseen , all powers , authorities , lords , and rulers . All things were made through Christ and for Christ .
51001017	He was there before anything was made , and all things continue because of him .
51001018	He is the head of the body , which is the church . Everything comes from him . He is the first one who was raised from the dead . So in all things Jesus has first place .
51001019	God was pleased for all of himself to live in Christ .
51001020	And through Christ , God has brought all things back to himself again — things on earth and things in heaven . God made peace through the blood of Christ’s death on the cross .
51001021	At one time you were separated from God . You were his enemies in your minds , and the evil things you did were against God .
51001022	But now God has made you his friends again . He did this through Christ’s death in the body so that he might bring you into God’s presence as people who are holy , with no wrong , and with nothing of which God can judge you guilty .
51001023	This will happen if you continue strong and sure in your faith . You must not be moved away from the hope brought to you by the Good News that you heard . That same Good News has been told to everyone in the world , and I , Paul , help in preaching that Good News .
51001024	I am happy in my sufferings for you . There are things that Christ must still suffer through his body , the church . I am accepting , in my body , my part of these things that must be suffered .
51001025	I became a servant of the church because God gave me a special work to do that helps you , and that work is to tell fully the message of God .
51001026	This message is the secret that was hidden from everyone since the beginning of time , but now it is made known to God’s holy people .
51001027	God decided to let his people know this rich and glorious secret which he has for all people . This secret is Christ himself , who is in you . He is our only hope for glory .
51001028	So we continue to preach Christ to each person , using all wisdom to warn and to teach everyone , in order to bring each one into God’s presence as a mature person in Christ .
51001029	To do this , I work and struggle , using Christ’s great strength that works so powerfully in me .
51002001	I want you to know how hard I work for you , those in Laodicea , and others who have never seen me .
51002002	I want them to be strengthened and joined together with love so that they may be rich in their understanding . This leads to their knowing fully God’s secret , that is , Christ himself .
51002003	In him all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are safely kept .
51002004	I say this so that no one can fool you by arguments that seem good , but are false .
51002005	Though I am absent from you in my body , my heart is with you , and I am happy to see your good lives and your strong faith in Christ .
51002006	As you received Christ Jesus the Lord , so continue to live in him .
51002007	Keep your roots deep in him and have your lives built on him . Be strong in the faith , just as you were taught , and always be thankful .
51002008	Be sure that no one leads you away with false and empty teaching that is only human , which comes from the ruling spirits of this world , and not from Christ .
51002009	All of God lives fully in Christ ( even when Christ was on earth ) ,
51002010	and you have a full and true life in Christ , who is ruler over all rulers and powers .
51002011	Also in Christ you had a different kind of circumcision , a circumcision not done by hands . It was through Christ’s circumcision , that is , his death , that you were made free from the power of your sinful self .
51002012	When you were baptized , you were buried with Christ , and you were raised up with him through your faith in God’s power that was shown when he raised Christ from the dead .
51002013	When you were spiritually dead because of your sins and because you were not free from the power of your sinful self , God made you alive with Christ , and he forgave all our sins .
51002014	He canceled the debt , which listed all the rules we failed to follow . He took away that record with its rules and nailed it to the cross .
51002015	God stripped the spiritual rulers and powers of their authority . With the cross , he won the victory and showed the world that they were powerless .
51002016	So do not let anyone make rules for you about eating and drinking or about a religious feast , a New Moon Festival , or a Sabbath day .
51002017	These things were like a shadow of what was to come . But what is true and real has come and is found in Christ .
51002018	Do not let anyone disqualify you by making you humiliate yourself and worship angels . Such people enter into visions , which fill them with foolish pride because of their human way of thinking .
51002019	They do not hold tightly to Christ , the head . It is from him that all the parts of the body are cared for and held together . So it grows in the way God wants it to grow .
51002020	Since you died with Christ and were made free from the ruling spirits of the world , why do you act as if you still belong to this world by following rules like these :
51002021	“ Don’t handle this , ” “ Don’t taste that , ” “ Don’t even touch that thing ” ?
51002022	These rules refer to earthly things that are gone as soon as they are used . They are only human commands and teachings .
51002023	They seem to be wise , but they are only part of a human religion . They make people pretend not to be proud and make them punish their bodies , but they do not really control the evil desires of the sinful self .
51003001	Since you were raised from the dead with Christ , aim at what is in heaven , where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God .
51003002	Think only about the things in heaven , not the things on earth .
51003003	Your old sinful self has died , and your new life is kept with Christ in God .
51003004	Christ is your life , and when he comes again , you will share in his glory .
51003005	So put all evil things out of your life : sexual sinning , doing evil , letting evil thoughts control you , wanting things that are evil , and greed . This is really serving a false god .
51003006	These things make God angry .
51003007	In your past , evil life you also did these things .
51003008	But now also put these things out of your life : anger , bad temper , doing or saying things to hurt others , and using evil words when you talk .
51003009	Do not lie to each other . You have left your old sinful life and the things you did before .
51003010	You have begun to live the new life , in which you are being made new and are becoming like the One who made you . This new life brings you the true knowledge of God .
51003011	In the new life there is no difference between Greeks and Jews , those who are circumcised and those who are not circumcised , or people who are foreigners , or Scythians . There is no difference between slaves and free people . But Christ is in all believers , and Christ is all that is important .
51003012	God has chosen you and made you his holy people . He loves you . So you should always clothe yourselves with mercy , kindness , humility , gentleness , and patience .
51003013	Bear with each other , and forgive each other . If someone does wrong to you , forgive that person because the Lord forgave you .
51003014	Even more than all this , clothe yourself in love . Love is what holds you all together in perfect unity .
51003015	Let the peace that Christ gives control your thinking , because you were all called together in one body to have peace . Always be thankful .
51003016	Let the teaching of Christ live in you richly . Use all wisdom to teach and instruct each other by singing psalms , hymns , and spiritual songs with thankfulness in your hearts to God .
51003017	Everything you do or say should be done to obey Jesus your Lord . And in all you do , give thanks to God the Father through Jesus .
51003018	Wives , yield to the authority of your husbands , because this is the right thing to do in the Lord .
51003019	Husbands , love your wives and be gentle with them .
51003020	Children , obey your parents in all things , because this pleases the Lord .
51003021	Fathers , do not nag your children . If you are too hard to please , they may want to stop trying .
51003022	Slaves , obey your masters in all things . Do not obey just when they are watching you , to gain their favor , but serve them honestly , because you respect the Lord .
51003023	In all the work you are doing , work the best you can . Work as if you were doing it for the Lord , not for people .
51003024	Remember that you will receive your reward from the Lord , which he promised to his people . You are serving the Lord Christ .
51003025	But remember that anyone who does wrong will be punished for that wrong , and the Lord treats everyone the same .
51004001	Masters , give what is good and fair to your slaves . Remember that you have a Master in heaven .
51004002	Continue praying , keeping alert , and always thanking God .
51004003	Also pray for us that God will give us an opportunity to tell people his message . Pray that we can preach the secret that God has made known about Christ . This is why I am in prison .
51004004	Pray that I can speak in a way that will make it clear , as I should .
51004005	Be wise in the way you act with people who are not believers , making the most of every opportunity .
51004006	When you talk , you should always be kind and pleasant so you will be able to answer everyone in the way you should .
51004007	Tychicus is my dear brother in Christ and a faithful minister and servant with me in the Lord . He will tell you all the things that are happening to me .
51004008	This is why I am sending him : so you may know how we are and he may encourage you .
51004009	I send him with Onesimus , a faithful and dear brother in Christ , and one of your group . They will tell you all that has happened here .
51004010	Aristarchus , a prisoner with me , and Mark , the cousin of Barnabas , greet you . ( I have already told you what to do about Mark . If he comes , welcome him . )
51004011	Jesus , who is called Justus , also greets you . These are the only Jewish believers who work with me for the kingdom of God , and they have been a comfort to me .
51004012	Epaphras , a servant of Jesus Christ , from your group , also greets you . He always prays for you that you will grow to be spiritually mature and have everything God wants for you .
51004013	I know he has worked hard for you and the people in Laodicea and in Hierapolis .
51004014	Demas and our dear friend Luke , the doctor , greet you .
51004015	Greet the brothers and sisters in Laodicea . And greet Nympha and the church that meets in her house .
51004016	After this letter is read to you , be sure it is also read to the church in Laodicea . And you read the letter that I wrote to Laodicea .
51004017	Tell Archippus , “ Be sure to finish the work the Lord gave you . ”
51004018	I , Paul , greet you and write this with my own hand . Remember me in prison . Grace be with you .
52001001	From Paul , Silas , and Timothy . To the church in Thessalonica , the church in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ : Grace and peace to you .
52001002	We always thank God for all of you and mention you when we pray .
52001003	We continually recall before God our Father the things you have done because of your faith and the work you have done because of your love . And we thank him that you continue to be strong because of your hope in our Lord Jesus Christ .
52001004	Brothers and sisters , God loves you , and we know he has chosen you ,
52001005	because the Good News we brought to you came not only with words , but with power , with the Holy Spirit , and with sure knowledge that it is true . Also you know how we lived when we were with you in order to help you .
52001006	And you became like us and like the Lord . You suffered much , but still you accepted the teaching with the joy that comes from the Holy Spirit .
52001007	So you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and Southern Greece .
52001008	And the Lord’s teaching spread from you not only into Macedonia and Southern Greece , but now your faith in God has become known everywhere . So we do not need to say anything about it .
52001009	People everywhere are telling about the way you accepted us when we were there with you . They tell how you stopped worshiping idols and began serving the living and true God .
52001010	And you wait for God’s Son , whom God raised from the dead , to come from heaven . He is Jesus , who saves us from God’s angry judgment that is sure to come .
52002001	Brothers and sisters , you know our visit to you was not a failure .
52002002	Before we came to you , we suffered in Philippi . People there insulted us , as you know , and many people were against us . But our God helped us to be brave and to tell you his Good News .
52002003	Our appeal does not come from lies or wrong reasons , nor were we trying to trick you .
52002004	But we speak the Good News because God tested us and trusted us to do it . When we speak , we are not trying to please people , but God , who tests our hearts .
52002005	You know that we never tried to influence you by saying nice things about you . We were not trying to get your money ; we had no selfishness to hide from you . God knows that this is true .
52002006	We were not looking for human praise , from you or anyone else ,
52002007	even though as apostles of Christ we could have used our authority over you . But we were very gentle with you , like a mother caring for her little children .
52002008	Because we loved you , we were happy to share not only God’s Good News with you , but even our own lives . You had become so dear to us !
52002009	Brothers and sisters , I know you remember our hard work and difficulties . We worked night and day so we would not burden any of you while we preached God’s Good News to you .
52002010	When we were with you , we lived in a holy and honest way , without fault . You know this is true , and so does God .
52002011	You know that we treated each of you as a father treats his own children .
52002012	We encouraged you , we urged you , and we insisted that you live good lives for God , who calls you to his glorious kingdom .
52002013	Also , we always thank God because when you heard his message from us , you accepted it as the word of God , not the words of humans . And it really is God’s message which works in you who believe .
52002014	Brothers and sisters , your experiences have been like those of God’s churches in Christ that are in Judea . You suffered from the people of your own country , as they suffered from the Jews
52002015	who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets and forced us to leave that country . They do not please God and are against all people .
52002016	They try to stop us from teaching those who are not Jews so they may be saved . By doing this , they are increasing their sins to the limit . The anger of God has come to them at last .
52002017	Brothers and sisters , though we were separated from you for a short time , our thoughts were still with you . We wanted very much to see you and tried hard to do so .
52002018	We wanted to come to you . I , Paul , tried to come more than once , but Satan stopped us .
52002019	You are our hope , our joy , and the crown we will take pride in when our Lord Jesus Christ comes .
52002020	Truly you are our glory and our joy .
52003001	When we could not wait any longer , we decided it was best to stay in Athens alone
52003002	and send Timothy to you . Timothy , our brother , works with us for God and helps us tell people the Good News about Christ . We sent him to strengthen and encourage you in your faith
52003003	so none of you would be upset by these troubles . You yourselves know that we must face these troubles .
52003004	Even when we were with you , we told you we all would have to suffer , and you know it has happened .
52003005	Because of this , when I could wait no longer , I sent Timothy to you so I could learn about your faith . I was afraid the devil had tempted you , and perhaps our hard work would have been wasted .
52003006	But Timothy now has come back to us from you and has brought us good news about your faith and love . He told us that you always remember us in a good way and that you want to see us just as much as we want to see you .
52003007	So , brothers and sisters , while we have much trouble and suffering , we are encouraged about you because of your faith .
52003008	Our life is really full if you stand strong in the Lord .
52003009	We have so much joy before our God because of you . We cannot thank him enough for all the joy we feel .
52003010	Night and day we continue praying with all our heart that we can see you again and give you all the things you need to make your faith strong .
52003011	Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus prepare the way for us to come to you .
52003012	May the Lord make your love grow more and multiply for each other and for all people so that you will love others as we love you .
52003013	May your hearts be made strong so that you will be holy and without fault before our God and Father when our Lord Jesus comes with all his holy ones .
52004001	Brothers and sisters , we taught you how to live in a way that will please God , and you are living that way . Now we ask and encourage you in the Lord Jesus to live that way even more .
52004002	You know what we told you to do by the authority of the Lord Jesus .
52004003	God wants you to be holy and to stay away from sexual sins .
52004004	He wants each of you to learn to control your own body in a way that is holy and honorable .
52004005	Don’t use your body for sexual sin like the people who do not know God .
52004006	Also , do not wrong or cheat another Christian in this way . The Lord will punish people who do those things as we have already told you and warned you .
52004007	God called us to be holy and does not want us to live in sin .
52004008	So the person who refuses to obey this teaching is disobeying God , not simply a human teaching . And God is the One who gives us his Holy Spirit .
52004009	We do not need to write you about having love for your Christian family , because God has already taught you to love each other .
52004010	And truly you do love the Christians in all of Macedonia . Brothers and sisters , now we encourage you to love them even more .
52004011	Do all you can to live a peaceful life . Take care of your own business , and do your own work as we have already told you .
52004012	If you do , then people who are not believers will respect you , and you will not have to depend on others for what you need .
52004013	Brothers and sisters , we want you to know about those Christians who have died so you will not be sad , as others who have no hope .
52004014	We believe that Jesus died and that he rose again . So , because of him , God will raise with Jesus those who have died .
52004015	What we tell you now is the Lord’s own message . We who are living when the Lord comes again will not go before those who have already died .
52004016	The Lord himself will come down from heaven with a loud command , with the voice of the archangel , and with the trumpet call of God . And those who have died believing in Christ will rise first .
52004017	After that , we who are still alive will be gathered up with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air . And we will be with the Lord forever .
52004018	So encourage each other with these words .
52005001	Now , brothers and sisters , we do not need to write you about times and dates .
52005002	You know very well that the day the Lord comes again will be a surprise , like a thief that comes in the night .
52005003	While people are saying , “ We have peace and we are safe , ” they will be destroyed quickly . It is like pains that come quickly to a woman having a baby . Those people will not escape .
52005004	But you , brothers and sisters , are not living in darkness , and so that day will not surprise you like a thief .
52005005	You are all people who belong to the light and to the day . We do not belong to the night or to darkness .
52005006	So we should not be like other people who are sleeping , but we should be alert and have self-control .
52005007	Those who sleep , sleep at night . Those who get drunk , get drunk at night .
52005008	But we belong to the day , so we should control ourselves . We should wear faith and love to protect us , and the hope of salvation should be our helmet .
52005009	God did not choose us to suffer his anger but to have salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ .
52005010	Jesus died for us so that we can live together with him , whether we are alive or dead when he comes .
52005011	So encourage each other and give each other strength , just as you are doing now .
52005012	Now , brothers and sisters , we ask you to appreciate those who work hard among you , who lead you in the Lord and teach you .
52005013	Respect them with a very special love because of the work they do . Live in peace with each other .
52005014	We ask you , brothers and sisters , to warn those who do not work . Encourage the people who are afraid . Help those who are weak . Be patient with everyone .
52005015	Be sure that no one pays back wrong for wrong , but always try to do what is good for each other and for all people .
52005016	Always be joyful .
52005017	Pray continually ,
52005018	and give thanks whatever happens . That is what God wants for you in Christ Jesus .
52005019	Do not hold back the work of the Holy Spirit .
52005020	Do not treat prophecy as if it were unimportant .
52005021	But test everything . Keep what is good ,
52005022	and stay away from everything that is evil .
52005023	Now may God himself , the God of peace , make you pure , belonging only to him . May your whole self — spirit , soul , and body — be kept safe and without fault when our Lord Jesus Christ comes .
52005024	You can trust the One who calls you to do that for you .
52005025	Brothers and sisters , pray for us .
52005026	Give each other a holy kiss when you meet .
52005027	I tell you by the authority of the Lord to read this letter to all the believers .
52005028	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you .
53001001	From Paul , Silas , and Timothy . To the church in Thessalonica in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ :
53001002	Grace and peace to you from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
53001003	We must always thank God for you , brothers and sisters . This is only right , because your faith is growing more and more , and the love that every one of you has for each other is increasing .
53001004	So we brag about you to the other churches of God . We tell them about the way you continue to be strong and have faith even though you are being treated badly and are suffering many troubles .
53001005	This is proof that God is right in his judgment . He wants you to be counted worthy of his kingdom for which you are suffering .
53001006	God will do what is right . He will give trouble to those who trouble you .
53001007	And he will give rest to you who are troubled and to us also when the Lord Jesus appears with burning fire from heaven with his powerful angels .
53001008	Then he will punish those who do not know God and who do not obey the Good News about our Lord Jesus Christ .
53001009	Those people will be punished with a destruction that continues forever . They will be kept away from the Lord and from his great power .
53001010	This will happen on the day when the Lord Jesus comes to receive glory because of his holy people . And all the people who have believed will be amazed at Jesus . You will be in that group , because you believed what we told you .
53001011	That is why we always pray for you , asking our God to help you live the kind of life he called you to live . We pray that with his power God will help you do the good things you want and perform the works that come from your faith .
53001012	We pray all this so that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ will have glory in you , and you will have glory in him . That glory comes from the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ .
53002001	Brothers and sisters , we have something to say about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and the time when we will meet together with him .
53002002	Do not become easily upset in your thinking or afraid if you hear that the day of the Lord has already come . Someone may have said this in a prophecy or in a message or in a letter as if it came from us .
53002003	Do not let anyone fool you in any way . That day of the Lord will not come until the turning away from God happens and the Man of Evil , who is on his way to hell , appears .
53002004	He will be against and put himself above any so-called god or anything that people worship . And that Man of Evil will even go into God’s Temple and sit there and say that he is God .
53002005	I told you when I was with you that all this would happen . Do you not remember ?
53002006	And now you know what is stopping that Man of Evil so he will appear at the right time .
53002007	The secret power of evil is already working in the world , but there is one who is stopping that power . And he will continue to stop it until he is taken out of the way .
53002008	Then that Man of Evil will appear , and the Lord Jesus will kill him with the breath that comes from his mouth and will destroy him with the glory of his coming .
53002009	The Man of Evil will come by the power of Satan . He will have great power , and he will do many different false miracles , signs , and wonders .
53002010	He will use every kind of evil to trick those who are lost . They will die , because they refused to love the truth . ( If they loved the truth , they would be saved . )
53002011	For this reason God sends them something powerful that leads them away from the truth so they will believe a lie .
53002012	So all those will be judged guilty who did not believe the truth , but enjoyed doing evil .
53002013	Brothers and sisters , whom the Lord loves , God chose you from the beginning to be saved . So we must always thank God for you . You are saved by the Spirit that makes you holy and by your faith in the truth .
53002014	God used the Good News that we preached to call you to be saved so you can share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ .
53002015	So , brothers and sisters , stand strong and continue to believe the teachings we gave you in our speaking and in our letter .
53003001	And now , brothers and sisters , pray for us that the Lord’s teaching will continue to spread quickly and that people will give honor to that teaching , just as happened with you .
53003002	And pray that we will be protected from stubborn and evil people , because not all people believe .
53003003	But the Lord is faithful and will give you strength and will protect you from the Evil One .
53003004	The Lord makes us feel sure that you are doing and will continue to do the things we told you .
53003005	May the Lord lead your hearts into God’s love and Christ’s patience .
53003006	Brothers and sisters , by the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ we command you to stay away from any believer who refuses to work and does not follow the teaching we gave you .
53003007	You yourselves know that you should live as we live . We were not lazy when we were with you .
53003008	And when we ate another person’s food , we always paid for it . We worked very hard night and day so we would not be an expense to any of you .
53003009	We had the right to ask you to help us , but we worked to take care of ourselves so we would be an example for you to follow .
53003010	When we were with you , we gave you this rule : “ Anyone who refuses to work should not eat . ”
53003011	We hear that some people in your group refuse to work . They do nothing but busy themselves in other people’s lives .
53003012	We command those people and beg them in the Lord Jesus Christ to work quietly and earn their own food .
53003013	But you , brothers and sisters , never become tired of doing good .
53003014	If some people do not obey what we tell you in this letter , then take note of them . Have nothing to do with them so they will feel ashamed .
53003015	But do not treat them as enemies . Warn them as fellow believers .
53003016	Now may the Lord of peace give you peace at all times and in every way . The Lord be with all of you .
53003017	I , Paul , end this letter now in my own handwriting . All my letters have this to show they are from me . This is the way I write .
53003018	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all .
54001001	From Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus , by the command of God our Savior and Christ Jesus our hope .
54001002	To Timothy , a true child to me because you believe : Grace , mercy , and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord .
54001003	I asked you to stay longer in Ephesus when I went into Macedonia so you could command some people there to stop teaching false things .
54001004	Tell them not to spend their time on stories that are not true and on long lists of names in family histories . These things only bring arguments ; they do not help God’s work , which is done in faith .
54001005	The purpose of this command is for people to have love , a love that comes from a pure heart and a good conscience and a true faith .
54001006	Some people have missed these things and turned to useless talk .
54001007	They want to be teachers of the law , but they do not understand either what they are talking about or what they are sure about .
54001008	But we know that the law is good if someone uses it lawfully .
54001009	We also know that the law is not made for good people but for those who are against the law and for those who refuse to follow it . It is for people who are against God and are sinful , who are unholy and ungodly , who kill their fathers and mothers , who murder ,
54001010	who take part in sexual sins , who have sexual relations with people of the same sex , who sell slaves , who tell lies , who speak falsely , and who do anything against the true teaching of God .
54001011	That teaching is part of the Good News of the blessed God that he gave me to tell .
54001012	I thank Christ Jesus our Lord , who gave me strength , because he trusted me and gave me this work of serving him .
54001013	In the past I spoke against Christ and persecuted him and did all kinds of things to hurt him . But God showed me mercy , because I did not know what I was doing . I did not believe .
54001014	But the grace of our Lord was fully given to me , and with that grace came the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus .
54001015	What I say is true , and you should fully accept it : Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners , of whom I am the worst .
54001016	But I was given mercy so that in me , the worst of all sinners , Christ Jesus could show that he has patience without limit . His patience with me made me an example for those who would believe in him and have life forever .
54001017	To the King that rules forever , who will never die , who cannot be seen , the only God , be honor and glory forever and ever . Amen .
54001018	Timothy , my child , I am giving you a command that agrees with the prophecies that were given about you in the past . I tell you this so you can follow them and fight the good fight .
54001019	Continue to have faith and do what you know is right . Some people have rejected this , and their faith has been shipwrecked .
54001020	Hymenaeus and Alexander have done that , and I have given them to Satan so they will learn not to speak against God .
54002001	First , I tell you to pray for all people , asking God for what they need and being thankful to him .
54002002	Pray for rulers and for all who have authority so that we can have quiet and peaceful lives full of worship and respect for God .
54002003	This is good , and it pleases God our Savior ,
54002004	who wants all people to be saved and to know the truth .
54002005	There is one God and one mediator so that human beings can reach God . That way is through Christ Jesus , who is himself human .
54002006	He gave himself as a payment to free all people . He is proof that came at the right time .
54002007	That is why I was chosen to tell the Good News and to be an apostle . ( I am telling the truth ; I am not lying . ) I was chosen to teach those who are not Jews to believe and to know the truth .
54002008	So , I want the men everywhere to pray , lifting up their hands in a holy manner , without anger and arguments .
54002009	Also , women should wear proper clothes that show respect and self-control , not using braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive clothes .
54002010	Instead , they should do good deeds , which is right for women who say they worship God .
54002011	Let a woman learn by listening quietly and being ready to cooperate in everything .
54002012	But I do not allow a woman to teach or to have authority over a man , but to listen quietly ,
54002013	because Adam was formed first and then Eve .
54002014	And Adam was not tricked , but the woman was tricked and became a sinner .
54002015	But she will be saved through having children if she continues in faith , love , and holiness , with self-control .
54003001	What I say is true : Anyone wanting to become an overseer desires a good work .
54003002	An overseer must not give people a reason to criticize him , and he must have only one wife . He must be self-controlled , wise , respected by others , ready to welcome guests , and able to teach .
54003003	He must not drink too much wine or like to fight , but rather be gentle and peaceable , not loving money .
54003004	He must be a good family leader , having children who cooperate with full respect .
54003005	( If someone does not know how to lead the family , how can that person take care of God’s church ? )
54003006	But an elder must not be a new believer , or he might be too proud of himself and be judged guilty just as the devil was .
54003007	An elder must also have the respect of people who are not in the church so he will not be criticized by others and caught in the devil’s trap .
54003008	In the same way , deacons must be respected by others , not saying things they do not mean . They must not drink too much wine or try to get rich by cheating others .
54003009	With a clear conscience they must follow the secret of the faith that God made known to us .
54003010	Test them first . Then let them serve as deacons if you find nothing wrong in them .
54003011	In the same way , women must be respected by others . They must not speak evil of others . They must be self-controlled and trustworthy in everything .
54003012	Deacons must have only one wife and be good leaders of their children and their own families .
54003013	Those who serve well as deacons are making an honorable place for themselves , and they will be very bold in their faith in Christ Jesus .
54003014	Although I hope I can come to you soon , I am writing these things to you now .
54003015	Then , even if I am delayed , you will know how to live in the family of God . That family is the church of the living God , the support and foundation of the truth .
54003016	Without doubt , the secret of our life of worship is great : He was shown to us in a human body , proved right in spirit , and seen by angels . He was proclaimed to the nations , believed in by the world , and taken up in glory .
54004001	Now the Holy Spirit clearly says that in the later times some people will stop believing the faith . They will follow spirits that lie and teachings of demons .
54004002	Such teachings come from the false words of liars whose consciences are destroyed as if by a hot iron .
54004003	They forbid people to marry and tell them not to eat certain foods which God created to be eaten with thanks by people who believe and know the truth .
54004004	Everything God made is good , and nothing should be refused if it is accepted with thanks ,
54004005	because it is made holy by what God has said and by prayer .
54004006	By telling these things to the brothers and sisters , you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus . You will be made strong by the words of the faith and the good teaching which you have been following .
54004007	But do not follow foolish stories that disagree with God’s truth , but train yourself to serve God .
54004008	Training your body helps you in some ways , but serving God helps you in every way by bringing you blessings in this life and in the future life , too .
54004009	What I say is true , and you should fully accept it .
54004010	This is why we work and struggle : We hope in the living God who is the Savior of all people , especially of those who believe .
54004011	Command and teach these things .
54004012	Do not let anyone treat you as if you are unimportant because you are young . Instead , be an example to the believers with your words , your actions , your love , your faith , and your pure life .
54004013	Until I come , continue to read the Scriptures to the people , strengthen them , and teach them .
54004014	Use the gift you have , which was given to you through prophecy when the group of elders laid their hands on you .
54004015	Continue to do those things ; give your life to doing them so your progress may be seen by everyone .
54004016	Be careful in your life and in your teaching . If you continue to live and teach rightly , you will save both yourself and those who listen to you .
54005001	Do not speak angrily to an older man , but plead with him as if he were your father . Treat younger men like brothers ,
54005002	older women like mothers , and younger women like sisters . Always treat them in a pure way .
54005003	Take care of widows who are truly widows .
54005004	But if a widow has children or grandchildren , let them first learn to do their duty to their own family and to repay their parents or grandparents . That pleases God .
54005005	The true widow , who is all alone , puts her hope in God and continues to pray night and day for God’s help .
54005006	But the widow who uses her life to please herself is really dead while she is alive .
54005007	Tell the believers to do these things so that no one can criticize them .
54005008	Whoever does not care for his own relatives , especially his own family members , has turned against the faith and is worse than someone who does not believe in God .
54005009	To be on the list of widows , a woman must be at least sixty years old . She must have been faithful to her husband .
54005010	She must be known for her good works — works such as raising her children , welcoming strangers , washing the feet of God’s people , helping those in trouble , and giving her life to do all kinds of good deeds .
54005011	But do not put younger widows on that list . After they give themselves to Christ , they are pulled away from him by their physical desires , and then they want to marry again .
54005012	They will be judged for not doing what they first promised to do .
54005013	Besides that , they learn to waste their time , going from house to house . And they not only waste their time but also begin to gossip and busy themselves with other people’s lives , saying things they should not say .
54005014	So I want the younger widows to marry , have children , and manage their homes . Then no enemy will have any reason to criticize them .
54005015	But some have already turned away to follow Satan .
54005016	If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family , she should care for them herself . The church should not have to care for them . Then it will be able to take care of those who are truly widows .
54005017	The elders who lead the church well should receive double honor , especially those who work hard by speaking and teaching ,
54005018	because the Scripture says : “ When an ox is working in the grain , do not cover its mouth to keep it from eating , ” and “ A worker should be given his pay . ”
54005019	Do not listen to someone who accuses an elder , without two or three witnesses .
54005020	Tell those who continue sinning that they are wrong . Do this in front of the whole church so that the others will have a warning .
54005021	Before God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels , I command you to do these things without showing favor of any kind to anyone .
54005022	Think carefully before you lay your hands on anyone , and don’t share in the sins of others . Keep yourself pure .
54005023	Stop drinking only water , but drink a little wine to help your stomach and your frequent sicknesses .
54005024	The sins of some people are easy to see even before they are judged , but the sins of others are seen only later .
54005025	So also good deeds are easy to see , but even those that are not easily seen cannot stay hidden .
54006001	All who are slaves under a yoke should show full respect to their masters so no one will speak against God’s name and our teaching .
54006002	The slaves whose masters are believers should not show their masters any less respect because they are believers . They should serve their masters even better , because they are helping believers they love . You must teach and preach these things .
54006003	Anyone who has a different teaching does not agree with the true teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching that shows the true way to serve God .
54006004	This person is full of pride and understands nothing , but is sick with a love for arguing and fighting about words . This brings jealousy , fighting , speaking against others , evil mistrust ,
54006005	and constant quarrels from those who have evil minds and have lost the truth . They think that serving God is a way to get rich .
54006006	Serving God does make us very rich , if we are satisfied with what we have .
54006007	We brought nothing into the world , so we can take nothing out .
54006008	But , if we have food and clothes , we will be satisfied with that .
54006009	Those who want to become rich bring temptation to themselves and are caught in a trap . They want many foolish and harmful things that ruin and destroy people .
54006010	The love of money causes all kinds of evil . Some people have left the faith , because they wanted to get more money , but they have caused themselves much sorrow .
54006011	But you , man of God , run away from all those things . Instead , live in the right way , serve God , have faith , love , patience , and gentleness .
54006012	Fight the good fight of faith , grabbing hold of the life that continues forever . You were called to have that life when you confessed the good confession before many witnesses .
54006013	In the sight of God , who gives life to everything , and of Christ Jesus , I give you a command . Christ Jesus made the good confession when he stood before Pontius Pilate .
54006014	Do what you were commanded to do without wrong or blame until our Lord Jesus Christ comes again .
54006015	God will make that happen at the right time . He is the blessed and only Ruler , the King of all kings and the Lord of all lords .
54006016	He is the only One who never dies . He lives in light so bright no one can go near it . No one has ever seen God , or can see him . May honor and power belong to God forever . Amen .
54006017	Command those who are rich with things of this world not to be proud . Tell them to hope in God , not in their uncertain riches . God richly gives us everything to enjoy .
54006018	Tell the rich people to do good , to be rich in doing good deeds , to be generous and ready to share .
54006019	By doing that , they will be saving a treasure for themselves as a strong foundation for the future . Then they will be able to have the life that is true life .
54006020	Timothy , guard what God has trusted to you . Stay away from foolish , useless talk and from the arguments of what is falsely called “ knowledge . ”
54006021	By saying they have that “ knowledge , ” some have missed the true faith . Grace be with you .
55001001	From Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God . God sent me to tell about the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus .
55001002	To Timothy , a dear child to me : Grace , mercy , and peace to you from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord .
55001003	I thank God as I always mention you in my prayers , day and night . I serve him , doing what I know is right as my ancestors did .
55001004	Remembering that you cried for me , I want very much to see you so I can be filled with joy .
55001005	I remember your true faith . That faith first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice , and I know you now have that same faith .
55001006	This is why I remind you to keep using the gift God gave you when I laid my hands on you . Now let it grow , as a small flame grows into a fire .
55001007	God did not give us a spirit that makes us afraid but a spirit of power and love and self-control .
55001008	So do not be ashamed to tell people about our Lord Jesus , and do not be ashamed of me , in prison for the Lord . But suffer with me for the Good News . God , who gives us the strength to do that ,
55001009	saved us and made us his holy people . That was not because of anything we did ourselves but because of God’s purpose and grace . That grace was given to us through Christ Jesus before time began ,
55001010	but it is now shown to us by the coming of our Savior Christ Jesus . He destroyed death , and through the Good News he showed us the way to have life that cannot be destroyed .
55001011	I was chosen to tell that Good News and to be an apostle and a teacher .
55001012	I am suffering now because I tell the Good News , but I am not ashamed , because I know Jesus , the One in whom I have believed . And I am sure he is able to protect what he has trusted me with until that day .
55001013	Follow the pattern of true teachings that you heard from me in faith and love , which are in Christ Jesus .
55001014	Protect the truth that you were given ; protect it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us .
55001015	You know that everyone in Asia has left me , even Phygelus and Hermogenes .
55001016	May the Lord show mercy to the family of Onesiphorus , who has often helped me and was not ashamed that I was in prison .
55001017	When he came to Rome , he looked eagerly for me until he found me .
55001018	May the Lord allow him to find mercy from the Lord on that day . You know how many ways he helped me in Ephesus .
55002001	You then , Timothy , my child , be strong in the grace we have in Christ Jesus .
55002002	You should teach people whom you can trust the things you and many others have heard me say . Then they will be able to teach others .
55002003	Share in the troubles we have like a good soldier of Christ Jesus .
55002004	A soldier wants to please the enlisting officer , so no one serving in the army wastes time with everyday matters .
55002005	Also an athlete who takes part in a contest must obey all the rules in order to win .
55002006	The farmer who works hard should be the first person to get some of the food that was grown .
55002007	Think about what I am saying , because the Lord will give you the ability to understand everything .
55002008	Remember Jesus Christ , who was raised from the dead , who is from the family of David . This is the Good News I preach ,
55002009	and I am suffering because of it to the point of being bound with chains like a criminal . But God’s teaching is not in chains .
55002010	So I patiently accept all these troubles so that those whom God has chosen can have the salvation that is in Christ Jesus . With that salvation comes glory that never ends .
55002011	This teaching is true : If we died with him , we will also live with him .
55002012	If we accept suffering , we will also rule with him . If we say we don’t know him , he will say he doesn’t know us .
55002013	If we are not faithful , he will still be faithful , because he must be true to who he is .
55002014	Continue teaching these things , warning people in God’s presence not to argue about words . It does not help anyone , and it ruins those who listen .
55002015	Make every effort to give yourself to God as the kind of person he will approve . Be a worker who is not ashamed and who uses the true teaching in the right way .
55002016	Stay away from foolish , useless talk , because that will lead people further away from God .
55002017	Their evil teaching will spread like a sickness inside the body . Hymenaeus and Philetus are like that .
55002018	They have left the true teaching , saying that the rising from the dead has already taken place , and so they are destroying the faith of some people .
55002019	But God’s strong foundation continues to stand . These words are written on the seal : “ The Lord knows those who belong to him , ” and “ Everyone who wants to belong to the Lord must stop doing wrong . ”
55002020	In a large house there are not only things made of gold and silver , but also things made of wood and clay . Some things are used for special purposes , and others are made for ordinary jobs .
55002021	All who make themselves clean from evil will be used for special purposes . They will be made holy , useful to the Master , ready to do any good work .
55002022	But run away from the evil desires of youth . Try hard to live right and to have faith , love , and peace , together with those who trust in the Lord from pure hearts .
55002023	Stay away from foolish and stupid arguments , because you know they grow into quarrels .
55002024	And a servant of the Lord must not quarrel but must be kind to everyone , a good teacher , and patient .
55002025	The Lord’s servant must gently teach those who disagree . Then maybe God will let them change their minds so they can accept the truth .
55002026	And they may wake up and escape from the trap of the devil , who catches them to do what he wants .
55003001	Remember this ! In the last days there will be many troubles ,
55003002	because people will love themselves , love money , brag , and be proud . They will say evil things against others and will not obey their parents or be thankful or be the kind of people God wants .
55003003	They will not love others , will refuse to forgive , will gossip , and will not control themselves . They will be cruel , will hate what is good ,
55003004	will turn against their friends , and will do foolish things without thinking . They will be conceited , will love pleasure instead of God ,
55003005	and will act as if they serve God but will not have his power . Stay away from those people .
55003006	Some of them go into homes and get control of silly women who are full of sin and are led by many evil desires .
55003007	These women are always learning new teachings , but they are never able to understand the truth fully .
55003008	Just as Jannes and Jambres were against Moses , these people are against the truth . Their thinking has been ruined , and they have failed in trying to follow the faith .
55003009	But they will not be successful in what they do , because as with Jannes and Jambres , everyone will see that they are foolish .
55003010	But you have followed what I teach , the way I live , my goal , faith , patience , and love . You know I never give up .
55003011	You know how I have been hurt and have suffered , as in Antioch , Iconium , and Lystra . I have suffered , but the Lord saved me from all those troubles .
55003012	Everyone who wants to live as God desires , in Christ Jesus , will be persecuted .
55003013	But people who are evil and cheat others will go from bad to worse . They will fool others , but they will also be fooling themselves .
55003014	But you should continue following the teachings you learned . You know they are true , because you trust those who taught you .
55003015	Since you were a child you have known the Holy Scriptures which are able to make you wise . And that wisdom leads to salvation through faith in Christ Jesus .
55003016	All Scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching , for showing people what is wrong in their lives , for correcting faults , and for teaching how to live right .
55003017	Using the Scriptures , the person who serves God will be capable , having all that is needed to do every good work .
55004001	I give you a command in the presence of God and Christ Jesus , the One who will judge the living and the dead , and by his coming and his kingdom :
55004002	Preach the Good News . Be ready at all times , and tell people what they need to do . Tell them when they are wrong . Encourage them with great patience and careful teaching ,
55004003	because the time will come when people will not listen to the true teaching but will find many more teachers who please them by saying the things they want to hear .
55004004	They will stop listening to the truth and will begin to follow false stories .
55004005	But you should control yourself at all times , accept troubles , do the work of telling the Good News , and complete all the duties of a servant of God .
55004006	My life is being given as an offering to God , and the time has come for me to leave this life .
55004007	I have fought the good fight , I have finished the race , I have kept the faith .
55004008	Now , a crown is being held for me — a crown for being right with God . The Lord , the judge who judges rightly , will give the crown to me on that day — not only to me but to all those who have waited with love for him to come again .
55004009	Do your best to come to me as soon as you can ,
55004010	because Demas , who loved this world , left me and went to Thessalonica . Crescens went to Galatia , and Titus went to Dalmatia .
55004011	Luke is the only one still with me . Get Mark and bring him with you when you come , because he can help me in my work here .
55004012	I sent Tychicus to Ephesus .
55004013	When I was in Troas , I left my coat there with Carpus . So when you come , bring it to me , along with my books , particularly the ones written on parchment .
55004014	Alexander the metalworker did many harmful things against me . The Lord will punish him for what he did .
55004015	You also should be careful that he does not hurt you , because he fought strongly against our teaching .
55004016	The first time I defended myself , no one helped me ; everyone left me . May they be forgiven .
55004017	But the Lord stayed with me and gave me strength so I could fully tell the Good News to all those who are not Jews . So I was saved from the lion’s mouth .
55004018	The Lord will save me when anyone tries to hurt me , and he will bring me safely to his heavenly kingdom . Glory forever and ever be the Lord’s . Amen .
55004019	Greet Priscilla and Aquila and the family of Onesiphorus .
55004020	Erastus stayed in Corinth , and I left Trophimus sick in Miletus .
55004021	Try as hard as you can to come to me before winter . Eubulus sends greetings to you . Also Pudens , Linus , Claudia , and all the brothers and sisters in Christ greet you .
55004022	The Lord be with your spirit . Grace be with you .
56001001	From Paul , a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ . I was sent to help the faith of God’s chosen people and to help them know the truth that shows people how to serve God .
56001002	That faith and that knowledge come from the hope for life forever , which God promised to us before time began . And God cannot lie .
56001003	At the right time God let the world know about that life through preaching . He trusted me with that work , and I preached by the command of God our Savior .
56001004	To Titus , my true child in the faith we share : Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior .
56001005	I left you in Crete so you could finish doing the things that still needed to be done and so you could appoint elders in every town , as I directed you .
56001006	An elder must not be guilty of doing wrong , must have only one wife , and must have believing children . They must not be known as children who are wild and do not cooperate .
56001007	As God’s managers , overseers must not be guilty of doing wrong , being selfish , or becoming angry quickly . They must not drink too much wine , like to fight , or try to get rich by cheating others .
56001008	Overseers must be ready to welcome guests , love what is good , be wise , live right , and be holy and self-controlled .
56001009	By holding on to the trustworthy word just as we teach it , overseers can help people by using true teaching , and they can show those who are against the true teaching that they are wrong .
56001010	There are many people who refuse to cooperate , who talk about worthless things and lead others into the wrong way — mainly those who insist on circumcision to be saved .
56001011	These people must be stopped , because they are upsetting whole families by teaching things they should not teach , which they do to get rich by cheating people .
56001012	Even one of their own prophets said , “ Cretans are always liars , evil animals , and lazy people who do nothing but eat . ”
56001013	The words that prophet said are true . So firmly tell those people they are wrong so they may become strong in the faith ,
56001014	not accepting Jewish false stories and the commands of people who reject the truth .
56001015	To those who are pure , all things are pure , but to those who are full of sin and do not believe , nothing is pure . Both their minds and their consciences have been ruined .
56001016	They say they know God , but their actions show they do not accept him . They are hateful people , they refuse to obey , and they are useless for doing anything good .
56002001	But you must tell everyone what to do to follow the true teaching .
56002002	Teach older men to be self-controlled , serious , wise , strong in faith , in love , and in patience .
56002003	In the same way , teach older women to be holy in their behavior , not speaking against others or enslaved to too much wine , but teaching what is good .
56002004	Then they can teach the young women to love their husbands , to love their children ,
56002005	to be wise and pure , to be good workers at home , to be kind , and to yield to their husbands . Then no one will be able to criticize the teaching God gave us .
56002006	In the same way , encourage young men to be wise .
56002007	In every way be an example of doing good deeds . When you teach , do it with honesty and seriousness .
56002008	Speak the truth so that you cannot be criticized . Then those who are against you will be ashamed because there is nothing bad to say about us .
56002009	Slaves should yield to their own masters at all times , trying to please them and not arguing with them .
56002010	They should not steal from them but should show their masters they can be fully trusted so that in everything they do they will make the teaching of God our Savior attractive .
56002011	That is the way we should live , because God’s grace that can save everyone has come .
56002012	It teaches us not to live against God nor to do the evil things the world wants to do . Instead , that grace teaches us to live in the present age in a wise and right way and in a way that shows we serve God .
56002013	We should live like that while we wait for our great hope and the coming of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ .
56002014	He gave himself for us so he might pay the price to free us from all evil and to make us pure people who belong only to him — people who are always wanting to do good deeds .
56002015	Say these things and encourage the people and tell them what is wrong in their lives , with all authority . Do not let anyone treat you as if you were unimportant .
56003001	Remind the believers to yield to the authority of rulers and government leaders , to obey them , to be ready to do good ,
56003002	to speak no evil about anyone , to live in peace , and to be gentle and polite to all people .
56003003	In the past we also were foolish . We did not obey , we were wrong , and we were slaves to many things our bodies wanted and enjoyed . We spent our lives doing evil and being jealous . People hated us , and we hated each other .
56003004	But when the kindness and love of God our Savior was shown ,
56003005	he saved us because of his mercy . It was not because of good deeds we did to be right with him . He saved us through the washing that made us new people through the Holy Spirit .
56003006	God poured out richly upon us that Holy Spirit through Jesus Christ our Savior .
56003007	Being made right with God by his grace , we could have the hope of receiving the life that never ends .
56003008	This teaching is true , and I want you to be sure the people understand these things . Then those who believe in God will be careful to use their lives for doing good . These things are good and will help everyone .
56003009	But stay away from those who have foolish arguments and talk about useless family histories and argue and quarrel about the law . Those things are worth nothing and will not help anyone .
56003010	After a first and second warning , avoid someone who causes arguments .
56003011	You can know that such people are evil and sinful ; their own sins prove them wrong .
56003012	When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you , make every effort to come to me at Nicopolis , because I have decided to stay there this winter .
56003013	Do all you can to help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey so that they have everything they need .
56003014	Our people must learn to use their lives for doing good deeds to provide what is necessary so that their lives will not be useless .
56003015	All who are with me greet you . Greet those who love us in the faith . Grace be with you all .
57001001	From Paul , a prisoner of Christ Jesus , and from Timothy , our brother . To Philemon , our dear friend and worker with us ;
57001002	to Apphia , our sister ; to Archippus , a worker with us ; and to the church that meets in your home :
57001003	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
57001004	I always thank my God when I mention you in my prayers ,
57001005	because I hear about the love you have for all God’s holy people and the faith you have in the Lord Jesus .
57001006	I pray that the faith you share may make you understand every blessing we have in Christ .
57001007	I have great joy and comfort , my brother , because the love you have shown to God’s people has refreshed them .
57001008	So , in Christ , I could be bold and order you to do what is right .
57001009	But because I love you , I am pleading with you instead . I , Paul , an old man now and also a prisoner for Christ Jesus ,
57001010	am pleading with you for my child Onesimus , who became my child while I was in prison .
57001011	In the past he was useless to you , but now he has become useful for both you and me .
57001012	I am sending him back to you , and with him I am sending my own heart .
57001013	I wanted to keep him with me so that in your place he might help me while I am in prison for the Good News .
57001014	But I did not want to do anything without asking you first so that any good you do for me will be because you want to do it , not because I forced you .
57001015	Maybe Onesimus was separated from you for a short time so you could have him back forever —
57001016	no longer as a slave , but better than a slave , as a loved brother . I love him very much , but you will love him even more , both as a person and as a believer in the Lord .
57001017	So if you consider me your partner , welcome Onesimus as you would welcome me .
57001018	If he has done anything wrong to you or if he owes you anything , charge that to me .
57001019	I , Paul , am writing this with my own hand . I will pay it back , and I will say nothing about what you owe me for your own life .
57001020	So , my brother , I ask that you do this for me in the Lord : Refresh my heart in Christ .
57001021	I write this letter , knowing that you will do what I ask you and even more .
57001022	One more thing — prepare a room for me in which to stay , because I hope God will answer your prayers and I will be able to come to you .
57001023	Epaphras , a prisoner with me for Christ Jesus , sends greetings to you .
57001024	And also Mark , Aristarchus , Demas , and Luke , workers together with me , send greetings .
57001025	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit .
58001001	In the past God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets many times and in many different ways .
58001002	But now in these last days God has spoken to us through his Son . God has chosen his Son to own all things , and through him he made the world .
58001003	The Son reflects the glory of God and shows exactly what God is like . He holds everything together with his powerful word . When the Son made people clean from their sins , he sat down at the right side of God , the Great One in heaven .
58001004	The Son became much greater than the angels , and God gave him a name that is much greater than theirs .
58001005	This is because God never said to any of the angels , “ You are my Son . Today I have become your Father . ” Nor did God say of any angel , “ I will be his Father , and he will be my Son . ”
58001006	And when God brings his firstborn Son into the world , he says , “ Let all God’s angels worship him . ”
58001007	This is what God said about the angels : “ God makes his angels become like winds . He makes his servants become like flames of fire . ”
58001008	But God said this about his Son : “ God , your throne will last forever and ever . You will rule your kingdom with fairness .
58001009	You love right and hate evil , so God has chosen you from among your friends ; he has set you apart with much joy . ”
58001010	God also says , “ Lord , in the beginning you made the earth , and your hands made the skies .
58001011	They will be destroyed , but you will remain . They will all wear out like clothes .
58001012	You will fold them like a coat . And , like clothes , you will change them . But you never change , and your life will never end . ”
58001013	And God never said this to an angel : “ Sit by me at my right side until I put your enemies under your control . ”
58001014	All the angels are spirits who serve God and are sent to help those who will receive salvation .
58002001	So we must be more careful to follow what we were taught . Then we will not stray away from the truth .
58002002	The teaching God spoke through angels was shown to be true , and anyone who did not follow it or obey it received the punishment that was earned .
58002003	So surely we also will be punished if we ignore this great salvation . The Lord himself first told about this salvation , and those who heard him testified it was true .
58002004	God also testified to the truth of the message by using wonders , great signs , many kinds of miracles , and by giving people gifts through the Holy Spirit , just as he wanted .
58002005	God did not choose angels to be the rulers of the new world that was coming , which is what we have been talking about .
58002006	It is written in the Scriptures , “ Why are people even important to you ? Why do you take care of human beings ?
58002007	You made them a little lower than the angels and crowned them with glory and honor .
58002008	You put all things under their control . ” When God put everything under their control , there was nothing left that they did not rule . Still , we do not yet see them ruling over everything .
58002009	But we see Jesus , who for a short time was made lower than the angels . And now he is wearing a crown of glory and honor because he suffered and died . And by God’s grace , he died for everyone .
58002010	God is the One who made all things , and all things are for his glory . He wanted to have many children share his glory , so he made the One who leads people to salvation perfect through suffering .
58002011	Jesus , who makes people holy , and those who are made holy are from the same family . So he is not ashamed to call them his brothers and sisters .
58002012	He says , “ Then , I will tell my brothers and sisters about you ; I will praise you in the public meeting . ”
58002013	He also says , “ I will trust in God . ” And he also says , “ I am here , and with me are the children God has given me . ”
58002014	Since these children are people with physical bodies , Jesus himself became like them . He did this so that , by dying , he could destroy the one who has the power of death — the devil —
58002015	and free those who were like slaves all their lives because of their fear of death .
58002016	Clearly , it is not angels that Jesus helps , but the people who are from Abraham .
58002017	For this reason Jesus had to be made like his brothers and sisters in every way so he could be their merciful and faithful high priest in service to God . Then Jesus could die in their place to take away their sins .
58002018	And now he can help those who are tempted , because he himself suffered and was tempted .
58003001	So all of you holy brothers and sisters , who were called by God , think about Jesus , who was sent to us and is the high priest of our faith .
58003002	Jesus was faithful to God as Moses was in God’s family .
58003003	Jesus has more honor than Moses , just as the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself .
58003004	Every house is built by someone , but the builder of everything is God himself .
58003005	Moses was faithful in God’s family as a servant , and he told what God would say in the future .
58003006	But Christ is faithful as a Son over God’s house . And we are God’s house if we confidently maintain our hope .
58003007	So it is as the Holy Spirit says : “ Today listen to what he says .
58003008	Do not be stubborn as in the past when you turned against God , when you tested God in the desert .
58003009	There your ancestors tried me and tested me and saw the things I did for forty years .
58003010	I was angry with them . I said , ‘ They are not loyal to me and have not understood my ways . ’
58003011	I was angry and made a promise , ‘ They will never enter my rest . ’ ”
58003012	So brothers and sisters , be careful that none of you has an evil , unbelieving heart that will turn you away from the living God .
58003013	But encourage each other every day while it is “ today . ” Help each other so none of you will become hardened because sin has tricked you .
58003014	We all share in Christ if we keep till the end the sure faith we had in the beginning .
58003015	This is what the Scripture says : “ Today listen to what he says . Do not be stubborn as in the past when you turned against God . ”
58003016	Who heard God’s voice and was against him ? It was all those people Moses led out of Egypt .
58003017	And with whom was God angry for forty years ? He was angry with those who sinned , who died in the desert .
58003018	And to whom was God talking when he promised that they would never enter his rest ? He was talking to those who did not obey him .
58003019	So we see they were not allowed to enter and have God’s rest , because they did not believe .
58004001	Now , since God has left us the promise that we may enter his rest , let us be very careful so none of you will fail to enter .
58004002	The Good News was preached to us just as it was to them . But the teaching they heard did not help them , because they heard it but did not accept it with faith .
58004003	We who have believed are able to enter and have God’s rest . As God has said , “ I was angry and made a promise , ‘ They will never enter my rest . ’ ” But God’s work was finished from the time he made the world .
58004004	In the Scriptures he talked about the seventh day of the week : “ And on the seventh day God rested from all his works . ”
58004005	And again in the Scripture God said , “ They will never enter my rest . ”
58004006	It is still true that some people will enter God’s rest , but those who first heard the way to be saved did not enter , because they did not obey .
58004007	So God planned another day , called “ today . ” He spoke about that day through David a long time later in the same Scripture used before : “ Today listen to what he says . Do not be stubborn . ”
58004008	We know that Joshua did not lead the people into that rest , because God spoke later about another day .
58004009	This shows that the rest for God’s people is still coming .
58004010	Anyone who enters God’s rest will rest from his work as God did .
58004011	Let us try as hard as we can to enter God’s rest so that no one will fail by following the example of those who refused to obey .
58004012	God’s word is alive and working and is sharper than a double-edged sword . It cuts all the way into us , where the soul and the spirit are joined , to the center of our joints and bones . And it judges the thoughts and feelings in our hearts .
58004013	Nothing in all the world can be hidden from God . Everything is clear and lies open before him , and to him we must explain the way we have lived .
58004014	Since we have a great high priest , Jesus the Son of God , who has gone into heaven , let us hold on to the faith we have .
58004015	For our high priest is able to understand our weaknesses . He was tempted in every way that we are , but he did not sin .
58004016	Let us , then , feel very sure that we can come before God’s throne where there is grace . There we can receive mercy and grace to help us when we need it .
58005001	Every high priest is chosen from among other people . He is given the work of going before God for them to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins .
58005002	Since he himself is weak , he is able to be gentle with those who do not understand and who are doing wrong things .
58005003	Because he is weak , the high priest must offer sacrifices for his own sins and also for the sins of the people .
58005004	To be a high priest is an honor , but no one chooses himself for this work . He must be called by God as Aaron was .
58005005	So also Christ did not choose himself to have the honor of being a high priest , but God chose him . God said to him , “ You are my Son . Today I have become your Father . ”
58005006	And in another Scripture God says , “ You are a priest forever , a priest like Melchizedek . ”
58005007	While Jesus lived on earth , he prayed to God and asked God for help . He prayed with loud cries and tears to the One who could save him from death , and his prayer was heard because he trusted God .
58005008	Even though Jesus was the Son of God , he learned obedience by what he suffered .
58005009	And because his obedience was perfect , he was able to give eternal salvation to all who obey him .
58005010	In this way God made Jesus a high priest , a priest like Melchizedek .
58005011	We have much to say about this , but it is hard to explain because you are so slow to understand .
58005012	By now you should be teachers , but you need someone to teach you again the first lessons of God’s message . You still need the teaching that is like milk . You are not ready for solid food .
58005013	Anyone who lives on milk is still a baby and knows nothing about right teaching .
58005014	But solid food is for those who are grown up . They are mature enough to know the difference between good and evil .
58006001	So let us go on to grown-up teaching . Let us not go back over the beginning lessons we learned about Christ . We should not again start teaching about faith in God and about turning away from those acts that lead to death .
58006002	We should not return to the teaching about baptisms , about laying on of hands , about the raising of the dead and eternal judgment .
58006003	And we will go on to grown-up teaching if God allows .
58006004	Some people cannot be brought back again to a changed life . They were once in God’s light , and enjoyed heaven’s gift , and shared in the Holy Spirit .
58006005	They found out how good God’s word is , and they received the powers of his new world .
58006006	But they fell away from Christ . It is impossible to bring them back to a changed life again , because they are nailing the Son of God to a cross again and are shaming him in front of others .
58006007	Some people are like land that gets plenty of rain . The land produces a good crop for those who work it , and it receives God’s blessings .
58006008	Other people are like land that grows thorns and weeds and is worthless . It is about to be cursed by God and will be destroyed by fire .
58006009	Dear friends , we are saying this to you , but we really expect better things from you that will lead to your salvation .
58006010	God is fair ; he will not forget the work you did and the love you showed for him by helping his people . And he will remember that you are still helping them .
58006011	We want each of you to go on with the same hard work all your lives so you will surely get what you hope for .
58006012	We do not want you to become lazy . Be like those who through faith and patience will receive what God has promised .
58006013	God made a promise to Abraham . And as there is no one greater than God , he used himself when he swore to Abraham ,
58006014	saying , “ I will surely bless you and give you many descendants . ”
58006015	Abraham waited patiently for this to happen , and he received what God promised .
58006016	People always use the name of someone greater than themselves when they swear . The oath proves that what they say is true , and this ends all arguing .
58006017	God wanted to prove that his promise was true to those who would get what he promised . And he wanted them to understand clearly that his purposes never change , so he made an oath .
58006018	These two things cannot change : God cannot lie when he makes a promise , and he cannot lie when he makes an oath . These things encourage us who came to God for safety . They give us strength to hold on to the hope we have been given .
58006019	We have this hope as an anchor for the soul , sure and strong . It enters behind the curtain in the Most Holy Place in heaven ,
58006020	where Jesus has gone ahead of us and for us . He has become the high priest forever , a priest like Melchizedek .
58007001	Melchizedek was the king of Salem and a priest for God Most High . He met Abraham when Abraham was coming back after defeating the kings . When they met , Melchizedek blessed Abraham ,
58007002	and Abraham gave him a tenth of everything he had brought back from the battle . First , Melchizedek’s name means “ king of goodness , ” and he is king of Salem , which means “ king of peace . ”
58007003	No one knows who Melchizedek’s father or mother was , where he came from , when he was born , or when he died . Melchizedek is like the Son of God ; he continues being a priest forever .
58007004	You can see how great Melchizedek was . Abraham , the great father , gave him a tenth of everything that he won in battle .
58007005	Now the law says that those in the tribe of Levi who become priests must collect a tenth from the people — their own people — even though the priests and the people are from the family of Abraham .
58007006	Melchizedek was not from the tribe of Levi , but he collected a tenth from Abraham . And he blessed Abraham , the man who had God’s promises .
58007007	Now everyone knows that the more important person blesses the less important person .
58007008	Priests receive a tenth , even though they are only men who live and then die . But Melchizedek , who received a tenth from Abraham , continues living , as the Scripture says .
58007009	We might even say that Levi , who receives a tenth , also paid it when Abraham paid Melchizedek a tenth .
58007010	Levi was not yet born , but he was in the body of his ancestor when Melchizedek met Abraham .
58007011	The people were given the law concerning the system of priests from the tribe of Levi , but they could not be made perfect through that system . So there was a need for another priest to come , a priest like Melchizedek , not Aaron .
58007012	And when a different kind of priest comes , the law must be changed , too .
58007013	We are saying these things about Christ , who belonged to a different tribe . No one from that tribe ever served as a priest at the altar .
58007014	It is clear that our Lord came from the tribe of Judah , and Moses said nothing about priests belonging to that tribe .
58007015	And this becomes even more clear when we see that another priest comes who is like Melchizedek .
58007016	He was not made a priest by human rules and laws but through the power of his life , which continues forever .
58007017	It is said about him , “ You are a priest forever , a priest like Melchizedek . ”
58007018	The old rule is now set aside , because it was weak and useless .
58007019	The law of Moses could not make anything perfect . But now a better hope has been given to us , and with this hope we can come near to God .
58007020	It is important that God did this with an oath . Others became priests without an oath ,
58007021	but Christ became a priest with God’s oath . God said : “ The Lord has made a promise and will not change his mind . ‘ You are a priest forever . ’ ”
58007022	This means that Jesus is the guarantee of a better agreement from God to his people .
58007023	When one of the other priests died , he could not continue being a priest . So there were many priests .
58007024	But because Jesus lives forever , he will never stop serving as priest .
58007025	So he is able always to save those who come to God through him because he always lives , asking God to help them .
58007026	Jesus is the kind of high priest we need . He is holy , sinless , pure , not influenced by sinners , and he is raised above the heavens .
58007027	He is not like the other priests who had to offer sacrifices every day , first for their own sins , and then for the sins of the people . Christ offered his sacrifice only once and for all time when he offered himself .
58007028	The law chooses high priests who are people with weaknesses , but the word of God’s oath came later than the law . It made God’s Son to be the high priest , and that Son has been made perfect forever .
58008001	Here is the point of what we are saying : We have a high priest who sits on the right side of God’s throne in heaven .
58008002	Our high priest serves in the Most Holy Place , the true place of worship that was made by God , not by humans .
58008003	Every high priest has the work of offering gifts and sacrifices to God . So our high priest must also offer something to God .
58008004	If our high priest were now living on earth , he would not be a priest , because there are already priests here who follow the law by offering gifts to God .
58008005	The work they do as priests is only a copy and a shadow of what is in heaven . This is why God warned Moses when he was ready to build the Holy Tent : “ Be very careful to make everything by the plan I showed you on the mountain . ”
58008006	But the priestly work that has been given to Jesus is much greater than the work that was given to the other priests . In the same way , the new agreement that Jesus brought from God to his people is much greater than the old one . And the new agreement is based on promises of better things .
58008007	If there had been nothing wrong with the first agreement , there would have been no need for a second agreement .
58008008	But God found something wrong with his people . He says : “ Look , the time is coming , says the Lord , when I will make a new agreement with the people of Israel and the people of Judah .
58008009	It will not be like the agreement I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to bring them out of Egypt . But they broke that agreement , and I turned away from them , says the Lord .
58008010	This is the agreement I will make with the people of Israel at that time , says the Lord . I will put my teachings in their minds and write them on their hearts . I will be their God , and they will be my people .
58008011	People will no longer have to teach their neighbors and relatives to know the Lord , because all people will know me , from the least to the most important .
58008012	I will forgive them for the wicked things they did , and I will not remember their sins anymore . ”
58008013	God called this a new agreement , so he has made the first agreement old . And anything that is old and worn out is ready to disappear .
58009001	The first agreement had rules for worship and a place on earth for worship .
58009002	The Holy Tent was set up for this . The first area in the Tent was called the Holy Place . In it were the lamp and the table with the bread that was made holy for God .
58009003	Behind the second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Place .
58009004	In it was a golden altar for burning incense and the Ark covered with gold that held the old agreement . Inside this Ark was a golden jar of manna , Aaron’s rod that once grew leaves , and the stone tablets of the old agreement .
58009005	Above the Ark were the creatures that showed God’s glory , whose wings reached over the lid . But we cannot tell everything about these things now .
58009006	When everything in the Tent was made ready in this way , the priests went into the first room every day to worship .
58009007	But only the high priest could go into the second room , and he did that only once a year . He could never enter the inner room without taking blood with him , which he offered to God for himself and for sins the people did without knowing they did them .
58009008	The Holy Spirit uses this to show that the way into the Most Holy Place was not open while the system of the old Holy Tent was still being used .
58009009	This is an example for the present time . It shows that the gifts and sacrifices offered cannot make the conscience of the worshiper perfect .
58009010	These gifts and sacrifices were only about food and drink and special washings . They were rules for the body , to be followed until the time of God’s new way .
58009011	But when Christ came as the high priest of the good things we now have , he entered the greater and more perfect tent . It is not made by humans and does not belong to this world .
58009012	Christ entered the Most Holy Place only once — and for all time . He did not take with him the blood of goats and calves . His sacrifice was his own blood , and by it he set us free from sin forever .
58009013	The blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a cow are sprinkled on the people who are unclean , and this makes their bodies clean again .
58009014	How much more is done by the blood of Christ . He offered himself through the eternal Spirit as a perfect sacrifice to God . His blood will make our consciences pure from useless acts so we may serve the living God .
58009015	For this reason Christ brings a new agreement from God to his people . Those who are called by God can now receive the blessings he has promised , blessings that will last forever . They can have those things because Christ died so that the people who lived under the first agreement could be set free from sin .
58009016	When there is a will , it must be proven that the one who wrote that will is dead .
58009017	A will means nothing while the person is alive ; it can be used only after the person dies .
58009018	This is why even the first agreement could not begin without blood to show death .
58009019	First , Moses told all the people every command in the law . Next he took the blood of calves and mixed it with water . Then he used red wool and a branch of the hyssop plant to sprinkle it on the book of the law and on all the people .
58009020	He said , “ This is the blood that begins the Agreement that God commanded you to obey . ”
58009021	In the same way , Moses sprinkled the blood on the Holy Tent and over all the things used in worship .
58009022	The law says that almost everything must be made clean by blood , and sins cannot be forgiven without blood to show death .
58009023	So the copies of the real things in heaven had to be made clean by animal sacrifices . But the real things in heaven need much better sacrifices .
58009024	Christ did not go into the Most Holy Place made by humans , which is only a copy of the real one . He went into heaven itself and is there now before God to help us .
58009025	The high priest enters the Most Holy Place once every year with blood that is not his own . But Christ did not offer himself many times .
58009026	Then he would have had to suffer many times since the world was made . But Christ came only once and for all time at just the right time to take away all sin by sacrificing himself .
58009027	Just as everyone must die once and then be judged ,
58009028	so Christ was offered as a sacrifice one time to take away the sins of many people . And he will come a second time , not to offer himself for sin , but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him .
58010001	The law is only an unclear picture of the good things coming in the future ; it is not the real thing . The people under the law offer the same sacrifices every year , but these sacrifices can never make perfect those who come near to worship God .
58010002	If the law could make them perfect , the sacrifices would have already stopped . The worshipers would be made clean , and they would no longer have a sense of sin .
58010003	But these sacrifices remind them of their sins every year ,
58010004	because it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins .
58010005	So when Christ came into the world , he said : “ You do not want sacrifices and offerings , but you have prepared a body for me .
58010006	You do not ask for burnt offerings and offerings to take away sins .
58010007	Then I said , ‘ Look , I have come . It is written about me in the book . God , I have come to do what you want . ’ ”
58010008	In this Scripture he first said , “ You do not want sacrifices and offerings . You do not ask for burnt offerings and offerings to take away sins . ” ( These are all sacrifices that the law commands . )
58010009	Then he said , “ Look , I have come to do what you want . ” God ends the first system of sacrifices so he can set up the new system .
58010010	And because of this , we are made holy through the sacrifice Christ made in his body once and for all time .
58010011	Every day the priests stand and do their religious service , often offering the same sacrifices . Those sacrifices can never take away sins .
58010012	But after Christ offered one sacrifice for sins , forever , he sat down at the right side of God .
58010013	And now Christ waits there for his enemies to be put under his power .
58010014	With one sacrifice he made perfect forever those who are being made holy .
58010015	The Holy Spirit also tells us about this . First he says :
58010016	“ This is the agreement I will make with them at that time , says the Lord . I will put my teachings in their hearts and write them on their minds . ”
58010017	Then he says : “ Their sins and the evil things they do — I will not remember anymore . ”
58010018	Now when these have been forgiven , there is no more need for a sacrifice for sins .
58010019	So , brothers and sisters , we are completely free to enter the Most Holy Place without fear because of the blood of Jesus’ death .
58010020	We can enter through a new and living way that Jesus opened for us . It leads through the curtain — Christ’s body .
58010021	And since we have a great priest over God’s house ,
58010022	let us come near to God with a sincere heart and a sure faith , because we have been made free from a guilty conscience , and our bodies have been washed with pure water .
58010023	Let us hold firmly to the hope that we have confessed , because we can trust God to do what he promised .
58010024	Let us think about each other and help each other to show love and do good deeds .
58010025	You should not stay away from the church meetings , as some are doing , but you should meet together and encourage each other . Do this even more as you see the day coming .
58010026	If we decide to go on sinning after we have learned the truth , there is no longer any sacrifice for sins .
58010027	There is nothing but fear in waiting for the judgment and the terrible fire that will destroy all those who live against God .
58010028	Anyone who refused to obey the law of Moses was found guilty from the proof given by two or three witnesses . He was put to death without mercy .
58010029	So what do you think should be done to those who do not respect the Son of God , who look at the blood of the agreement that made them holy as no different from others’ blood , who insult the Spirit of God’s grace ? Surely they should have a much worse punishment .
58010030	We know that God said , “ I will punish those who do wrong ; I will repay them . ” And he also said , “ The Lord will judge his people . ”
58010031	It is a terrible thing to fall into the hands of the living God .
58010032	Remember those days in the past when you first learned the truth . You had a hard struggle with many sufferings , but you continued strong .
58010033	Sometimes you were hurt and attacked before crowds of people , and sometimes you shared with those who were being treated that way .
58010034	You helped the prisoners . You even had joy when all that you owned was taken from you , because you knew you had something better and more lasting .
58010035	So do not lose the courage you had in the past , which has a great reward .
58010036	You must hold on , so you can do what God wants and receive what he has promised .
58010037	For in a very short time , “ The One who is coming will come and will not be delayed .
58010038	Those who are right with me will live by faith . But if they turn back with fear , I will not be pleased with them . ”
58010039	But we are not those who turn back and are lost . We are people who have faith and are saved .
58011001	Faith means being sure of the things we hope for and knowing that something is real even if we do not see it .
58011002	Faith is the reason we remember great people who lived in the past .
58011003	It is by faith we understand that the whole world was made by God’s command so what we see was made by something that cannot be seen .
58011004	It was by faith that Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain did . God said he was pleased with the gifts Abel offered and called Abel a good man because of his faith . Abel died , but through his faith he is still speaking .
58011005	It was by faith that Enoch was taken to heaven so he would not die . He could not be found , because God had taken him away . Before he was taken , the Scripture says that he was a man who truly pleased God .
58011006	Without faith no one can please God . Anyone who comes to God must believe that he is real and that he rewards those who truly want to find him .
58011007	It was by faith that Noah heard God’s warnings about things he could not yet see . He obeyed God and built a large boat to save his family . By his faith , Noah showed that the world was wrong , and he became one of those who are made right with God through faith .
58011008	It was by faith Abraham obeyed God’s call to go to another place God promised to give him . He left his own country , not knowing where he was to go .
58011009	It was by faith that he lived like a foreigner in the country God promised to give him . He lived in tents with Isaac and Jacob , who had received that same promise from God .
58011010	Abraham was waiting for the city that has real foundations — the city planned and built by God .
58011011	He was too old to have children , and Sarah could not have children . It was by faith that Abraham was made able to become a father , because he trusted God to do what he had promised .
58011012	This man was so old he was almost dead , but from him came as many descendants as there are stars in the sky . Like the sand on the seashore , they could not be counted .
58011013	All these great people died in faith . They did not get the things that God promised his people , but they saw them coming far in the future and were glad . They said they were like visitors and strangers on earth .
58011014	When people say such things , they show they are looking for a country that will be their own .
58011015	If they had been thinking about the country they had left , they could have gone back .
58011016	But they were waiting for a better country — a heavenly country . So God is not ashamed to be called their God , because he has prepared a city for them .
58011017	It was by faith that Abraham , when God tested him , offered his son Isaac as a sacrifice . God made the promises to Abraham , but Abraham was ready to offer his own son as a sacrifice .
58011018	God had said , “ The descendants I promised you will be from Isaac . ”
58011019	Abraham believed that God could raise the dead , and really , it was as if Abraham got Isaac back from death .
58011020	It was by faith that Isaac blessed the future of Jacob and Esau .
58011021	It was by faith that Jacob , as he was dying , blessed each one of Joseph’s sons . Then he worshiped as he leaned on the top of his walking stick .
58011022	It was by faith that Joseph , while he was dying , spoke about the Israelites leaving Egypt and gave instructions about what to do with his body .
58011023	It was by faith that Moses’ parents hid him for three months after he was born . They saw that Moses was a beautiful baby , and they were not afraid to disobey the king’s order .
58011024	It was by faith that Moses , when he grew up , refused to be called the son of the king of Egypt’s daughter .
58011025	He chose to suffer with God’s people instead of enjoying sin for a short time .
58011026	He thought it was better to suffer for the Christ than to have all the treasures of Egypt , because he was looking for God’s reward .
58011027	It was by faith that Moses left Egypt and was not afraid of the king’s anger . Moses continued strong as if he could see the God that no one can see .
58011028	It was by faith that Moses prepared the Passover and spread the blood on the doors so the one who brings death would not kill the firstborn sons of Israel .
58011029	It was by faith that the people crossed the Red Sea as if it were dry land . But when the Egyptians tried it , they were drowned .
58011030	It was by faith that the walls of Jericho fell after the people had marched around them for seven days .
58011031	It was by faith that Rahab , the prostitute , welcomed the spies and was not killed with those who refused to obey God .
58011032	Do I need to give more examples ? I do not have time to tell you about Gideon , Barak , Samson , Jephthah , David , Samuel , and the prophets .
58011033	Through their faith they defeated kingdoms . They did what was right , received God’s promises , and shut the mouths of lions .
58011034	They stopped great fires and were saved from being killed with swords . They were weak , and yet were made strong . They were powerful in battle and defeated other armies .
58011035	Women received their dead relatives raised back to life . Others were tortured and refused to accept their freedom so they could be raised from the dead to a better life .
58011036	Some were laughed at and beaten . Others were put in chains and thrown into prison .
58011037	They were stoned to death , they were cut in half , and they were killed with swords . Some wore the skins of sheep and goats . They were poor , abused , and treated badly .
58011038	The world was not good enough for them ! They wandered in deserts and mountains , living in caves and holes in the earth .
58011039	All these people are known for their faith , but none of them received what God had promised .
58011040	God planned to give us something better so that they would be made perfect , but only together with us .
58012001	We are surrounded by a great cloud of people whose lives tell us what faith means . So let us run the race that is before us and never give up . We should remove from our lives anything that would get in the way and the sin that so easily holds us back .
58012002	Let us look only to Jesus , the One who began our faith and who makes it perfect . He suffered death on the cross . But he accepted the shame as if it were nothing because of the joy that God put before him . And now he is sitting at the right side of God’s throne .
58012003	Think about Jesus’ example . He held on while wicked people were doing evil things to him . So do not get tired and stop trying .
58012004	You are struggling against sin , but your struggles have not yet caused you to be killed .
58012005	You have forgotten the encouraging words that call you his children : “ My child , don’t think the Lord’s discipline is worth nothing , and don’t stop trying when he corrects you .
58012006	The Lord disciplines those he loves , and he punishes everyone he accepts as his child . ”
58012007	So hold on through your sufferings , because they are like a father’s discipline . God is treating you as children . All children are disciplined by their fathers .
58012008	If you are never disciplined ( and every child must be disciplined ) , you are not true children .
58012009	We have all had fathers here on earth who disciplined us , and we respected them . So it is even more important that we accept discipline from the Father of our spirits so we will have life .
58012010	Our fathers on earth disciplined us for a short time in the way they thought was best . But God disciplines us to help us , so we can become holy as he is .
58012011	We do not enjoy being disciplined . It is painful at the time , but later , after we have learned from it , we have peace , because we start living in the right way .
58012012	You have become weak , so make yourselves strong again .
58012013	Keep on the right path , so the weak will not stumble but rather be strengthened .
58012014	Try to live in peace with all people , and try to live free from sin . Anyone whose life is not holy will never see the Lord .
58012015	Be careful that no one fails to receive God’s grace and begins to cause trouble among you . A person like that can ruin many of you .
58012016	Be careful that no one takes part in sexual sin or is like Esau and never thinks about God . As the oldest son , Esau would have received everything from his father , but he sold all that for a single meal .
58012017	You remember that after Esau did this , he wanted to get his father’s blessing , but his father refused . Esau could find no way to change what he had done , even though he wanted the blessing so much that he cried .
58012018	You have not come to a mountain that can be touched and that is burning with fire . You have not come to darkness , sadness , and storms .
58012019	You have not come to the noise of a trumpet or to the sound of a voice like the one the people of Israel heard and begged not to hear another word .
58012020	They did not want to hear the command : “ If anything , even an animal , touches the mountain , it must be put to death with stones . ”
58012021	What they saw was so terrible that Moses said , “ I am shaking with fear . ”
58012022	But you have come to Mount Zion , to the city of the living God , the heavenly Jerusalem . You have come to thousands of angels gathered together with joy .
58012023	You have come to the meeting of God’s firstborn children whose names are written in heaven . You have come to God , the judge of all people , and to the spirits of good people who have been made perfect .
58012024	You have come to Jesus , the One who brought the new agreement from God to his people , and you have come to the sprinkled blood that has a better message than the blood of Abel .
58012025	So be careful and do not refuse to listen when God speaks . Others refused to listen to him when he warned them on earth , and they did not escape . So it will be worse for us if we refuse to listen to God who warns us from heaven .
58012026	When he spoke before , his voice shook the earth , but now he has promised , “ Once again I will shake not only the earth but also the heavens . ”
58012027	The words “ once again ” clearly show us that everything that was made — things that can be shaken — will be destroyed . Only the things that cannot be shaken will remain .
58012028	So let us be thankful , because we have a kingdom that cannot be shaken . We should worship God in a way that pleases him with respect and fear ,
58012029	because our God is like a fire that burns things up .
58013001	Keep on loving each other as brothers and sisters .
58013002	Remember to welcome strangers , because some who have done this have welcomed angels without knowing it .
58013003	Remember those who are in prison as if you were in prison with them . Remember those who are suffering as if you were suffering with them .
58013004	Marriage should be honored by everyone , and husband and wife should keep their marriage pure . God will judge as guilty those who take part in sexual sins .
58013005	Keep your lives free from the love of money , and be satisfied with what you have . God has said , “ I will never leave you ; I will never abandon you . ”
58013006	So we can be sure when we say , “ I will not be afraid , because the Lord is my helper . People can’t do anything to me . ”
58013007	Remember your leaders who taught God’s message to you . Remember how they lived and died , and copy their faith .
58013008	Jesus Christ is the same yesterday , today , and forever .
58013009	Do not let all kinds of strange teachings lead you into the wrong way . Your hearts should be strengthened by God’s grace , not by obeying rules about foods , which do not help those who obey them .
58013010	We have a sacrifice , but the priests who serve in the Holy Tent cannot eat from it .
58013011	The high priest carries the blood of animals into the Most Holy Place where he offers this blood for sins . But the bodies of the animals are burned outside the camp .
58013012	So Jesus also suffered outside the city to make his people holy with his own blood .
58013013	So let us go to Jesus outside the camp , holding on as he did when we are abused .
58013014	Here on earth we do not have a city that lasts forever , but we are looking for the city that we will have in the future .
58013015	So through Jesus let us always offer to God our sacrifice of praise , coming from lips that speak his name .
58013016	Do not forget to do good to others , and share with them , because such sacrifices please God .
58013017	Obey your leaders and act under their authority . They are watching over you , because they are responsible for your souls . Obey them so that they will do this work with joy , not sadness . It will not help you to make their work hard .
58013018	Pray for us . We are sure that we have a clear conscience , because we always want to do the right thing .
58013019	I especially beg you to pray so that God will send me back to you soon .
58013022	My brothers and sisters , I beg you to listen patiently to this message I have written to encourage you , because it is not very long .
58013023	I want you to know that our brother Timothy has been let out of prison . If he arrives soon , we will both come to see you .
58013024	Greet all your leaders and all of God’s people . Those from Italy send greetings to you .
58013025	Grace be with you all .
59001001	From James , a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ . To all of God’s people who are scattered everywhere in the world : Greetings .
59001002	My brothers and sisters , when you have many kinds of troubles , you should be full of joy ,
59001003	because you know that these troubles test your faith , and this will give you patience .
59001004	Let your patience show itself perfectly in what you do . Then you will be perfect and complete and will have everything you need .
59001005	But if any of you needs wisdom , you should ask God for it . He is generous to everyone and will give you wisdom without criticizing you .
59001006	But when you ask God , you must believe and not doubt . Anyone who doubts is like a wave in the sea , blown up and down by the wind .
59001009	Believers who are poor should take pride that God has made them spiritually rich .
59001010	Those who are rich should take pride that God has shown them that they are spiritually poor . The rich will die like a wild flower in the grass .
59001011	The sun rises with burning heat and dries up the plants . The flower falls off , and its beauty is gone . In the same way the rich will die while they are still taking care of business .
59001012	When people are tempted and still continue strong , they should be happy . After they have proved their faith , God will reward them with life forever . God promised this to all those who love him .
59001013	When people are tempted , they should not say , “ God is tempting me . ” Evil cannot tempt God , and God himself does not tempt anyone .
59001014	But people are tempted when their own evil desire leads them away and traps them .
59001015	This desire leads to sin , and then the sin grows and brings death .
59001016	My dear brothers and sisters , do not be fooled about this .
59001017	Every good action and every perfect gift is from God . These good gifts come down from the Creator of the sun , moon , and stars , who does not change like their shifting shadows .
59001018	God decided to give us life through the word of truth so we might be the most important of all the things he made .
59001019	My dear brothers and sisters , always be willing to listen and slow to speak . Do not become angry easily ,
59001020	because anger will not help you live the right kind of life God wants .
59001021	So put out of your life every evil thing and every kind of wrong . Then in gentleness accept God’s teaching that is planted in your hearts , which can save you .
59001022	Do what God’s teaching says ; when you only listen and do nothing , you are fooling yourselves .
59001023	Those who hear God’s teaching and do nothing are like people who look at themselves in a mirror .
59001024	They see their faces and then go away and quickly forget what they looked like .
59001025	But the truly happy people are those who carefully study God’s perfect law that makes people free , and they continue to study it . They do not forget what they heard , but they obey what God’s teaching says . Those who do this will be made happy .
59001026	People who think they are religious but say things they should not say are just fooling themselves . Their “ religion ” is worth nothing .
59001027	Religion that God accepts as pure and without fault is this : caring for orphans or widows who need help , and keeping yourself free from the world’s evil influence .
59002001	My dear brothers and sisters , as believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ , never think some people are more important than others .
59002002	Suppose someone comes into your church meeting wearing nice clothes and a gold ring . At the same time a poor person comes in wearing old , dirty clothes .
59002003	You show special attention to the one wearing nice clothes and say , “ Please , sit here in this good seat . ” But you say to the poor person , “ Stand over there , ” or , “ Sit on the floor by my feet . ”
59002004	What are you doing ? You are making some people more important than others , and with evil thoughts you are deciding that one person is better .
59002005	Listen , my dear brothers and sisters ! God chose the poor in the world to be rich with faith and to receive the kingdom God promised to those who love him .
59002006	But you show no respect to the poor . The rich are always trying to control your lives . They are the ones who take you to court .
59002007	And they are the ones who speak against Jesus , who owns you .
59002008	This royal law is found in the Scriptures : “ Love your neighbor as you love yourself . ” If you obey this law , you are doing right .
59002009	But if you treat one person as being more important than another , you are sinning . You are guilty of breaking God’s law .
59002010	A person who follows all of God’s law but fails to obey even one command is guilty of breaking all the commands in that law .
59002011	The same God who said , “ You must not be guilty of adultery , ” also said , “ You must not murder anyone . ” So if you do not take part in adultery but you murder someone , you are guilty of breaking all of God’s law .
59002012	In everything you say and do , remember that you will be judged by the law that makes people free .
59002013	So you must show mercy to others , or God will not show mercy to you when he judges you . But the person who shows mercy can stand without fear at the judgment .
59002014	My brothers and sisters , if people say they have faith , but do nothing , their faith is worth nothing . Can faith like that save them ?
59002015	A brother or sister in Christ might need clothes or food .
59002016	If you say to that person , “ God be with you ! I hope you stay warm and get plenty to eat , ” but you do not give what that person needs , your words are worth nothing .
59002017	In the same way , faith by itself — that does nothing — is dead .
59002018	Someone might say , “ You have faith , but I have deeds . ” Show me your faith without doing anything , and I will show you my faith by what I do .
59002019	You believe there is one God . Good ! But the demons believe that , too , and they tremble with fear .
59002020	You foolish person ! Must you be shown that faith that does nothing is worth nothing ?
59002021	Abraham , our ancestor , was made right with God by what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar .
59002022	So you see that Abraham’s faith and the things he did worked together . His faith was made perfect by what he did .
59002023	This shows the full meaning of the Scripture that says : “ Abraham believed God , and God accepted Abraham’s faith , and that faith made him right with God . ” And Abraham was called God’s friend .
59002024	So you see that people are made right with God by what they do , not by faith only .
59002025	Another example is Rahab , a prostitute , who was made right with God by something she did . She welcomed the spies into her home and helped them escape by a different road .
59002026	Just as a person’s body that does not have a spirit is dead , so faith that does nothing is dead !
59003001	My brothers and sisters , not many of you should become teachers , because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly .
59003002	We all make many mistakes . If people never said anything wrong , they would be perfect and able to control their entire selves , too .
59003003	When we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us , we can control their whole bodies .
59003004	Also a ship is very big , and it is pushed by strong winds . But a very small rudder controls that big ship , making it go wherever the pilot wants .
59003005	It is the same with the tongue . It is a small part of the body , but it brags about great things . A big forest fire can be started with only a little flame .
59003006	And the tongue is like a fire . It is a whole world of evil among the parts of our bodies . The tongue spreads its evil through the whole body . The tongue is set on fire by hell , and it starts a fire that influences all of life .
59003007	People can tame every kind of wild animal , bird , reptile , and fish , and they have tamed them ,
59003008	but no one can tame the tongue . It is wild and evil and full of deadly poison .
59003009	We use our tongues to praise our Lord and Father , but then we curse people , whom God made like himself .
59003010	Praises and curses come from the same mouth ! My brothers and sisters , this should not happen .
59003011	Do good and bad water flow from the same spring ?
59003012	My brothers and sisters , can a fig tree make olives , or can a grapevine make figs ? No ! And a well full of salty water cannot give good water .
59003013	Are there those among you who are truly wise and understanding ? Then they should show it by living right and doing good things with a gentleness that comes from wisdom .
59003014	But if you are selfish and have bitter jealousy in your hearts , do not brag . Your bragging is a lie that hides the truth .
59003015	That kind of “ wisdom ” does not come from God but from the world . It is not spiritual ; it is from the devil .
59003016	Where jealousy and selfishness are , there will be confusion and every kind of evil .
59003017	But the wisdom that comes from God is first of all pure , then peaceful , gentle , and easy to please . This wisdom is always ready to help those who are troubled and to do good for others . It is always fair and honest .
59003018	People who work for peace in a peaceful way plant a good crop of right-living .
59004001	Do you know where your fights and arguments come from ? They come from the selfish desires that war within you .
59004002	You want things , but you do not have them . So you are ready to kill and are jealous of other people , but you still cannot get what you want . So you argue and fight . You do not get what you want , because you do not ask God .
59004003	Or when you ask , you do not receive because the reason you ask is wrong . You want things so you can use them for your own pleasures .
59004004	So , you are not loyal to God ! You should know that loving the world is the same as hating God . Anyone who wants to be a friend of the world becomes God’s enemy .
59004005	Do you think the Scripture means nothing that says , “ The Spirit that God made to live in us wants us for himself alone ” ?
59004006	But God gives us even more grace , as the Scripture says , “ God is against the proud , but he gives grace to the humble . ”
59004007	So give yourselves completely to God . Stand against the devil , and the devil will run from you .
59004008	Come near to God , and God will come near to you . You sinners , clean sin out of your lives . You who are trying to follow God and the world at the same time , make your thinking pure .
59004009	Be sad , cry , and weep ! Change your laughter into crying and your joy into sadness .
59004010	Humble yourself in the Lord’s presence , and he will honor you .
59004011	Brothers and sisters , do not tell evil lies about each other . If you speak against your fellow believers or judge them , you are judging and speaking against the law they follow . And when you are judging the law , you are no longer a follower of the law . You have become a judge .
59004012	God is the only Lawmaker and Judge . He is the only One who can save and destroy . So it is not right for you to judge your neighbor .
59004013	Some of you say , “ Today or tomorrow we will go to some city . We will stay there a year , do business , and make money . ”
59004014	But you do not know what will happen tomorrow ! Your life is like a mist . You can see it for a short time , but then it goes away .
59004015	So you should say , “ If the Lord wants , we will live and do this or that . ”
59004016	But now you are proud and you brag . All of this bragging is wrong .
59004017	Anyone who knows the right thing to do , but does not do it , is sinning .
59005001	You rich people , listen ! Cry and be very sad because of the troubles that are coming to you .
59005002	Your riches have rotted , and your clothes have been eaten by moths .
59005003	Your gold and silver have rusted , and that rust will be a proof that you were wrong . It will eat your bodies like fire . You saved your treasure for the last days .
59005004	The pay you did not give the workers who mowed your fields cries out against you , and the cries of the workers have been heard by the Lord All-Powerful .
59005005	Your life on earth was full of rich living and pleasing yourselves with everything you wanted . You made yourselves fat , like an animal ready to be killed .
59005006	You have judged guilty and then murdered innocent people , who were not against you .
59005007	Brothers and sisters , be patient until the Lord comes again . A farmer patiently waits for his valuable crop to grow from the earth and for it to receive the autumn and spring rains .
59005008	You , too , must be patient . Do not give up hope , because the Lord is coming soon .
59005009	Brothers and sisters , do not complain against each other or you will be judged guilty . And the Judge is ready to come !
59005010	Brothers and sisters , follow the example of the prophets who spoke for the Lord . They suffered many hard things , but they were patient .
59005011	We say they are happy because they did not give up . You have heard about Job’s patience , and you know the Lord’s purpose for him in the end . You know the Lord is full of mercy and is kind .
59005012	My brothers and sisters , above all , do not use an oath when you make a promise . Don’t use the name of heaven , earth , or anything else to prove what you say . When you mean yes , say only yes , and when you mean no , say only no so you will not be judged guilty .
59005013	Anyone who is having troubles should pray . Anyone who is happy should sing praises .
59005014	Anyone who is sick should call the church’s elders . They should pray for and pour oil on the person in the name of the Lord .
59005015	And the prayer that is said with faith will make the sick person well ; the Lord will heal that person . And if the person has sinned , the sins will be forgiven .
59005016	Confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so God can heal you . When a believing person prays , great things happen .
59005017	Elijah was a human being just like us . He prayed that it would not rain , and it did not rain on the land for three and a half years !
59005018	Then Elijah prayed again , and the rain came down from the sky , and the land produced crops again .
59005019	My brothers and sisters , if one of you wanders away from the truth , and someone helps that person come back ,
59005020	remember this : Anyone who brings a sinner back from the wrong way will save that sinner’s soul from death and will cause many sins to be forgiven .
60001001	From Peter , an apostle of Jesus Christ . To God’s chosen people who are away from their homes and are scattered all around Pontus , Galatia , Cappadocia , Asia , and Bithynia .
60001002	God planned long ago to choose you by making you his holy people , which is the Spirit’s work . God wanted you to obey him and to be made clean by the blood of the death of Jesus Christ . Grace and peace be yours more and more .
60001003	Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ . In God’s great mercy he has caused us to be born again into a living hope , because Jesus Christ rose from the dead .
60001004	Now we hope for the blessings God has for his children . These blessings , which cannot be destroyed or be spoiled or lose their beauty , are kept in heaven for you .
60001005	God’s power protects you through your faith until salvation is shown to you at the end of time .
60001006	This makes you very happy , even though now for a short time different kinds of troubles may make you sad .
60001007	These troubles come to prove that your faith is pure . This purity of faith is worth more than gold , which can be proved to be pure by fire but will ruin . But the purity of your faith will bring you praise and glory and honor when Jesus Christ is shown to you .
60001008	You have not seen Christ , but still you love him . You cannot see him now , but you believe in him . So you are filled with a joy that cannot be explained , a joy full of glory .
60001009	And you are receiving the goal of your faith — the salvation of your souls .
60001010	The prophets searched carefully and tried to learn about this salvation . They prophesied about the grace that was coming to you .
60001011	The Spirit of Christ was in the prophets , telling in advance about the sufferings of Christ and about the glory that would follow those sufferings . The prophets tried to learn about what the Spirit was showing them , when those things would happen , and what the world would be like at that time .
60001012	It was shown them that their service was not for themselves but for you , when they told about the truths you have now heard . Those who preached the Good News to you told you those things with the help of the Holy Spirit who was sent from heaven — things into which angels desire to look .
60001013	So prepare your minds for service and have self-control . All your hope should be for the gift of grace that will be yours when Jesus Christ is shown to you .
60001014	Now that you are obedient children of God do not live as you did in the past . You did not understand , so you did the evil things you wanted .
60001015	But be holy in all you do , just as God , the One who called you , is holy .
60001016	It is written in the Scriptures : “ You must be holy , because I am holy . ”
60001017	You pray to God and call him Father , and he judges each person’s work equally . So while you are here on earth , you should live with respect for God .
60001018	You know that in the past you were living in a worthless way , a way passed down from the people who lived before you . But you were saved from that useless life . You were bought , not with something that ruins like gold or silver ,
60001019	but with the precious blood of Christ , who was like a pure and perfect lamb .
60001020	Christ was chosen before the world was made , but he was shown to the world in these last times for your sake .
60001021	Through Christ you believe in God , who raised Christ from the dead and gave him glory . So your faith and your hope are in God .
60001022	Now that your obedience to the truth has purified your souls , you can have true love for your Christian brothers and sisters . So love each other deeply with all your heart .
60001023	You have been born again , and this new life did not come from something that dies , but from something that cannot die . You were born again through God’s living message that continues forever .
60001024	The Scripture says , “ All people are like the grass , and all their glory is like the flowers of the field . The grass dies and the flowers fall ,
60001025	but the word of the Lord will live forever . ” And this is the word that was preached to you .
60002001	So then , rid yourselves of all evil , all lying , hypocrisy , jealousy , and evil speech .
60002002	As newborn babies want milk , you should want the pure and simple teaching . By it you can mature in your salvation ,
60002003	because you have already examined and seen how good the Lord is .
60002004	Come to the Lord Jesus , the “ stone ” that lives . The people of the world did not want this stone , but he was the stone God chose , and he was precious .
60002005	You also are like living stones , so let yourselves be used to build a spiritual temple — to be holy priests who offer spiritual sacrifices to God . He will accept those sacrifices through Jesus Christ .
60002006	The Scripture says : “ I will put a stone in the ground in Jerusalem . Everything will be built on this important and precious rock . Anyone who trusts in him will never be disappointed . ”
60002007	This stone is worth much to you who believe . But to the people who do not believe , “ the stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone . ”
60002008	Also , he is “ a stone that causes people to stumble , a rock that makes them fall . ” They stumble because they do not obey what God says , which is what God planned to happen to them .
60002009	But you are a chosen people , royal priests , a holy nation , a people for God’s own possession . You were chosen to tell about the wonderful acts of God , who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light .
60002010	At one time you were not a people , but now you are God’s people . In the past you had never received mercy , but now you have received God’s mercy .
60002011	Dear friends , you are like foreigners and strangers in this world . I beg you to avoid the evil things your bodies want to do that fight against your soul .
60002012	People who do not believe are living all around you and might say that you are doing wrong . Live such good lives that they will see the good things you do and will give glory to God on the day when Christ comes again .
60002013	For the Lord’s sake , yield to the people who have authority in this world : the king , who is the highest authority ,
60002014	and the leaders who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to praise those who do right .
60002015	It is God’s desire that by doing good you should stop foolish people from saying stupid things about you .
60002016	Live as free people , but do not use your freedom as an excuse to do evil . Live as servants of God .
60002017	Show respect for all people : Love the brothers and sisters of God’s family , respect God , honor the king .
60002018	Slaves , yield to the authority of your masters with all respect , not only those who are good and kind , but also those who are dishonest .
60002019	A person might have to suffer even when it is unfair , but if he thinks of God and can stand the pain , God is pleased .
60002020	If you are beaten for doing wrong , there is no reason to praise you for being patient in your punishment . But if you suffer for doing good , and you are patient , then God is pleased .
60002021	This is what you were called to do , because Christ suffered for you and gave you an example to follow . So you should do as he did .
60002022	“ He had never sinned , and he had never lied . ”
60002023	People insulted Christ , but he did not insult them in return . Christ suffered , but he did not threaten . He let God , the One who judges rightly , take care of him .
60002024	Christ carried our sins in his body on the cross so we would stop living for sin and start living for what is right . And you are healed because of his wounds .
60002025	You were like sheep that wandered away , but now you have come back to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls .
60003001	In the same way , you wives should yield to your husbands . Then , if some husbands do not obey God’s teaching , they will be persuaded to believe without anyone’s saying a word to them . They will be persuaded by the way their wives live .
60003002	Your husbands will see the pure lives you live with your respect for God .
60003003	It is not fancy hair , gold jewelry , or fine clothes that should make you beautiful .
60003004	No , your beauty should come from within you — the beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit that will never be destroyed and is very precious to God .
60003005	In this same way the holy women who lived long ago and followed God made themselves beautiful , yielding to their own husbands .
60003006	Sarah obeyed Abraham , her husband , and called him her master . And you women are true children of Sarah if you always do what is right and are not afraid .
60003007	In the same way , you husbands should live with your wives in an understanding way , since they are weaker than you . But show them respect , because God gives them the same blessing he gives you — the grace that gives true life . Do this so that nothing will stop your prayers .
60003008	Finally , all of you should be in agreement , understanding each other , loving each other as family , being kind and humble .
60003009	Do not do wrong to repay a wrong , and do not insult to repay an insult . But repay with a blessing , because you yourselves were called to do this so that you might receive a blessing .
60003010	The Scripture says , “ A person must do these things to enjoy life and have many happy days . He must not say evil things , and he must not tell lies .
60003011	He must stop doing evil and do good . He must look for peace and work for it .
60003012	The Lord sees the good people and listens to their prayers . But the Lord is against those who do evil . ”
60003013	If you are trying hard to do good , no one can really hurt you .
60003014	But even if you suffer for doing right , you are blessed . “ Don’t be afraid of what they fear ; do not dread those things . ”
60003015	But respect Christ as the holy Lord in your hearts . Always be ready to answer everyone who asks you to explain about the hope you have ,
60003016	but answer in a gentle way and with respect . Keep a clear conscience so that those who speak evil of your good life in Christ will be made ashamed .
60003017	It is better to suffer for doing good than for doing wrong if that is what God wants .
60003018	Christ himself suffered for sins once . He was not guilty , but he suffered for those who are guilty to bring you to God . His body was killed , but he was made alive in the spirit .
60003019	And in the spirit he went and preached to the spirits in prison
60003020	who refused to obey God long ago in the time of Noah . God was waiting patiently for them while Noah was building the boat . Only a few people — eight in all — were saved by water .
60003021	And that water is like baptism that now saves you — not the washing of dirt from the body , but the promise made to God from a good conscience . And this is because Jesus Christ was raised from the dead .
60003022	Now Jesus has gone into heaven and is at God’s right side ruling over angels , authorities , and powers .
60004001	Since Christ suffered while he was in his body , strengthen yourselves with the same way of thinking Christ had . The person who has suffered in the body is finished with sin .
60004002	Strengthen yourselves so that you will live here on earth doing what God wants , not the evil things people want .
60004003	In the past you wasted too much time doing what nonbelievers enjoy . You were guilty of sexual sins , evil desires , drunkenness , wild and drunken parties , and hateful idol worship .
60004004	Nonbelievers think it is strange that you do not do the many wild and wasteful things they do , so they insult you .
60004005	But they will have to explain this to God , who is ready to judge the living and the dead .
60004006	For this reason the Good News was preached to those who are now dead . Even though they were judged like all people , the Good News was preached to them so they could live in the spirit as God lives .
60004007	The time is near when all things will end . So think clearly and control yourselves so you will be able to pray .
60004008	Most importantly , love each other deeply , because love will cause people to forgive each other for many sins .
60004009	Open your homes to each other , without complaining .
60004010	Each of you has received a gift to use to serve others . Be good servants of God’s various gifts of grace .
60004011	Anyone who speaks should speak words from God . Anyone who serves should serve with the strength God gives so that in everything God will be praised through Jesus Christ . Power and glory belong to him forever and ever . Amen .
60004012	My friends , do not be surprised at the terrible trouble which now comes to test you . Do not think that something strange is happening to you .
60004013	But be happy that you are sharing in Christ’s sufferings so that you will be happy and full of joy when Christ comes again in glory .
60004014	When people insult you because you follow Christ , you are blessed , because the glorious Spirit , the Spirit of God , is with you .
60004015	Do not suffer for murder , theft , or any other crime , nor because you trouble other people .
60004016	But if you suffer because you are a Christian , do not be ashamed . Praise God because you wear that name .
60004017	It is time for judgment to begin with God’s family . And if that judging begins with us , what will happen to those people who do not obey the Good News of God ?
60004018	“ If it is very hard for a good person to be saved , the wicked person and the sinner will surely be lost ! ”
60004019	So those who suffer as God wants should trust their souls to the faithful Creator as they continue to do what is right .
60005001	Now I have something to say to the elders in your group . I also am an elder . I have seen Christ’s sufferings , and I will share in the glory that will be shown to us . I beg you to
60005002	shepherd God’s flock , for whom you are responsible . Watch over them because you want to , not because you are forced . That is how God wants it . Do it because you are happy to serve , not because you want money .
60005003	Do not be like a ruler over people you are responsible for , but be good examples to them .
60005004	Then when Christ , the Chief Shepherd , comes , you will get a glorious crown that will never lose its beauty .
60005005	In the same way , younger people should be willing to be under older people . And all of you should be very humble with each other . “ God is against the proud , but he gives grace to the humble . ”
60005006	Be humble under God’s powerful hand so he will lift you up when the right time comes .
60005007	Give all your worries to him , because he cares about you .
60005008	Control yourselves and be careful ! The devil , your enemy , goes around like a roaring lion looking for someone to eat .
60005009	Refuse to give in to him , by standing strong in your faith . You know that your Christian family all over the world is having the same kinds of suffering .
60005010	And after you suffer for a short time , God , who gives all grace , will make everything right . He will make you strong and support you and keep you from falling . He called you to share in his glory in Christ , a glory that will continue forever .
60005011	All power is his forever and ever . Amen .
60005012	I wrote this short letter with the help of Silas , who I know is a faithful brother in Christ . I wrote to encourage you and to tell you that this is the true grace of God . Stand strong in that grace .
60005013	The church in Babylon , who was chosen like you , sends you greetings . Mark , my son in Christ , also greets you .
60005014	Give each other a kiss of Christian love when you meet . Peace to all of you who are in Christ .
61001001	From Simon Peter , a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ . To you who have received a faith as valuable as ours , because our God and Savior Jesus Christ does what is right .
61001002	Grace and peace be given to you more and more , because you truly know God and Jesus our Lord .
61001003	Jesus has the power of God , by which he has given us everything we need to live and to serve God . We have these things because we know him . Jesus called us by his glory and goodness .
61001004	Through these he gave us the very great and precious promises . With these gifts you can share in God’s nature , and the world will not ruin you with its evil desires .
61001005	Because you have these blessings , do your best to add these things to your lives : to your faith , add goodness ; and to your goodness , add knowledge ;
61001006	and to your knowledge , add self-control ; and to your self-control , add patience ; and to your patience , add service for God ;
61001007	and to your service for God , add kindness for your brothers and sisters in Christ ; and to this kindness , add love .
61001008	If all these things are in you and are growing , they will help you to be useful and productive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ .
61001009	But anyone who does not have these things cannot see clearly . He is blind and has forgotten that he was made clean from his past sins .
61001010	My brothers and sisters , try hard to be certain that you really are called and chosen by God . If you do all these things , you will never fall .
61001011	And you will be given a very great welcome into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ .
61001012	You know these things , and you are very strong in the truth , but I will always help you remember them .
61001013	I think it is right for me to help you remember as long as I am in this body .
61001014	I know I must soon leave this body , as our Lord Jesus Christ has shown me .
61001015	I will try my best so that you may be able to remember these things even after I am gone .
61001016	When we told you about the powerful coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , we were not telling just clever stories that someone invented . But we saw the greatness of Jesus with our own eyes .
61001017	Jesus heard the voice of God , the Greatest Glory , when he received honor and glory from God the Father . The voice said , “ This is my Son , whom I love , and I am very pleased with him . ”
61001018	We heard that voice from heaven while we were with Jesus on the holy mountain .
61001019	This makes us more sure about the message the prophets gave . It is good for you to follow closely what they said as you would follow a light shining in a dark place , until the day begins and the morning star rises in your hearts .
61001020	Most of all , you must understand this : No prophecy in the Scriptures ever comes from the prophet’s own interpretation .
61001021	No prophecy ever came from what a person wanted to say , but people led by the Holy Spirit spoke words from God .
61002001	There used to be false prophets among God’s people , just as you will have some false teachers in your group . They will secretly teach things that are wrong — teachings that will cause people to be lost . They will even refuse to accept the Master , Jesus , who bought their freedom . So they will bring quick ruin on themselves .
61002002	Many will follow their evil ways and say evil things about the way of truth .
61002003	Those false teachers only want your money , so they will use you by telling you lies . Their judgment spoken against them long ago is still coming , and their ruin is certain .
61002004	When angels sinned , God did not let them go free without punishment . He sent them to hell and put them in caves of darkness where they are being held for judgment .
61002005	And God punished the world long ago when he brought a flood to the world that was full of people who were against him . But God saved Noah , who preached about being right with God , and seven other people with him .
61002006	And God also destroyed the evil cities of Sodom and Gomorrah by burning them until they were ashes . He made those cities an example of what will happen to those who are against God .
61002007	But he saved Lot from those cities . Lot , a good man , was troubled because of the filthy lives of evil people .
61002008	( Lot was a good man , but because he lived with evil people every day , his good heart was hurt by the evil things he saw and heard . )
61002009	So the Lord knows how to save those who serve him when troubles come . He will hold evil people and punish them , while waiting for the Judgment Day .
61002010	That punishment is especially for those who live by doing the evil things their sinful selves want and who hate authority . These false teachers are bold and do anything they want . They are not afraid to speak against the angels .
61002011	But even the angels , who are much stronger and more powerful than false teachers , do not accuse them with insults before the Lord .
61002012	But these people speak against things they do not understand . They are like animals that act without thinking , animals born to be caught and killed . And , like animals , these false teachers will be destroyed .
61002013	They have caused many people to suffer , so they themselves will suffer . That is their pay for what they have done . They take pleasure in openly doing evil , so they are like dirty spots and stains among you . They delight in deceiving you while eating meals with you .
61002014	Every time they look at a woman they want her , and their desire for sin is never satisfied . They lead weak people into the trap of sin , and they have taught their hearts to be greedy . God will punish them !
61002015	These false teachers left the right road and lost their way , following the way Balaam went . Balaam was the son of Beor , who loved being paid for doing wrong .
61002016	But a donkey , which cannot talk , told Balaam he was sinning . It spoke with a man’s voice and stopped the prophet’s crazy thinking .
61002017	Those false teachers are like springs without water and clouds blown by a storm . A place in the blackest darkness has been kept for them .
61002018	They brag with words that mean nothing . By their evil desires they lead people into the trap of sin — people who are just beginning to escape from others who live in error .
61002019	They promise them freedom , but they themselves are not free . They are slaves of things that will be destroyed . For people are slaves of anything that controls them .
61002020	They were made free from the evil in the world by knowing our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ . But if they return to evil things and those things control them , then it is worse for them than it was before .
61002021	Yes , it would be better for them to have never known the right way than to know it and to turn away from the holy teaching that was given to them .
61002022	What they did is like this true saying : “ A dog goes back to what it has thrown up , ” and , “ After a pig is washed , it goes back and rolls in the mud . ”
61003001	My friends , this is the second letter I have written you to help your honest minds remember .
61003002	I want you to think about the words the holy prophets spoke in the past , and remember the command our Lord and Savior gave us through your apostles .
61003003	It is most important for you to understand what will happen in the last days . People will laugh at you . They will live doing the evil things they want to do .
61003004	They will say , “ Jesus promised to come again . Where is he ? Our fathers have died , but the world continues the way it has been since it was made . ”
61003005	But they do not want to remember what happened long ago . By the word of God heaven was made , and the earth was made from water and with water .
61003006	Then the world was flooded and destroyed with water .
61003007	And that same word of God is keeping heaven and earth that we now have in order to be destroyed by fire . They are being kept for the Judgment Day and the destruction of all who are against God .
61003008	But do not forget this one thing , dear friends : To the Lord one day is as a thousand years , and a thousand years is as one day .
61003009	The Lord is not slow in doing what he promised — the way some people understand slowness . But God is being patient with you . He does not want anyone to be lost , but he wants all people to change their hearts and lives .
61003010	But the day of the Lord will come like a thief . The skies will disappear with a loud noise . Everything in them will be destroyed by fire , and the earth and everything in it will be exposed .
61003011	In that way everything will be destroyed . So what kind of people should you be ? You should live holy lives and serve God ,
61003012	as you wait for and look forward to the coming of the day of God . When that day comes , the skies will be destroyed with fire , and everything in them will melt with heat .
61003013	But God made a promise to us , and we are waiting for a new heaven and a new earth where goodness lives .
61003014	Dear friends , since you are waiting for this to happen , do your best to be without sin and without fault . Try to be at peace with God .
61003015	Remember that we are saved because our Lord is patient . Our dear brother Paul told you the same thing when he wrote to you with the wisdom that God gave him .
61003016	He writes about this in all his letters . Some things in Paul’s letters are hard to understand , and people who are ignorant and weak in faith explain these things falsely . They also falsely explain the other Scriptures , but they are destroying themselves by doing this .
61003017	Dear friends , since you already know about this , be careful . Do not let those evil people lead you away by the wrong they do . Be careful so you will not fall from your strong faith .
61003018	But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ . Glory be to him now and forever ! Amen .
62001001	We write you now about what has always existed , which we have heard , we have seen with our own eyes , we have looked at , and we have touched with our hands . We write to you about the Word that gives life .
62001002	He who gives life was shown to us . We saw him and can give proof about it . And now we announce to you that he has life that continues forever . He was with God the Father and was shown to us .
62001003	We announce to you what we have seen and heard , because we want you also to have fellowship with us . Our fellowship is with God the Father and with his Son , Jesus Christ .
62001004	We write this to you so we may be full of joy .
62001005	Here is the message we have heard from Christ and now announce to you : God is light , and in him there is no darkness at all .
62001006	So if we say we have fellowship with God , but we continue living in darkness , we are liars and do not follow the truth .
62001007	But if we live in the light , as God is in the light , we can share fellowship with each other . Then the blood of Jesus , God’s Son , cleanses us from every sin .
62001008	If we say we have no sin , we are fooling ourselves , and the truth is not in us .
62001009	But if we confess our sins , he will forgive our sins , because we can trust God to do what is right . He will cleanse us from all the wrongs we have done .
62001010	If we say we have not sinned , we make God a liar , and we do not accept God’s teaching .
62002001	My dear children , I write this letter to you so you will not sin . But if anyone does sin , we have a helper in the presence of the Father — Jesus Christ , the One who does what is right .
62002002	He died in our place to take away our sins , and not only our sins but the sins of all people .
62002003	We can be sure that we know God if we obey his commands .
62002004	Anyone who says , “ I know God , ” but does not obey God’s commands is a liar , and the truth is not in that person .
62002005	But if someone obeys God’s teaching , then in that person God’s love has truly reached its goal . This is how we can be sure we are living in God :
62002006	Whoever says that he lives in God must live as Jesus lived .
62002007	My dear friends , I am not writing a new command to you but an old command you have had from the beginning . It is the teaching you have already heard .
62002008	But also I am writing a new command to you , and you can see its truth in Jesus and in you , because the darkness is passing away , and the true light is already shining .
62002009	Anyone who says , “ I am in the light , ” but hates a brother or sister , is still in the darkness .
62002010	Whoever loves a brother or sister lives in the light and will not cause anyone to stumble in his faith .
62002011	But whoever hates a brother or sister is in darkness , lives in darkness , and does not know where to go , because the darkness has made that person blind .
62002012	I write to you , dear children , because your sins are forgiven through Christ .
62002013	I write to you , fathers , because you know the One who existed from the beginning . I write to you , young people , because you have defeated the Evil One .
62002014	I write to you , children , because you know the Father . I write to you , fathers , because you know the One who existed from the beginning . I write to you , young people , because you are strong ; the teaching of God lives in you , and you have defeated the Evil One .
62002015	Do not love the world or the things in the world . If you love the world , the love of the Father is not in you .
62002016	These are the ways of the world : wanting to please our sinful selves , wanting the sinful things we see , and being too proud of what we have . None of these come from the Father , but all of them come from the world .
62002017	The world and everything that people want in it are passing away , but the person who does what God wants lives forever .
62002018	My dear children , these are the last days . You have heard that the enemy of Christ is coming , and now many enemies of Christ are already here . This is how we know that these are the last days .
62002019	These enemies of Christ were in our fellowship , but they left us . They never really belonged to us ; if they had been a part of us , they would have stayed with us . But they left , and this shows that none of them really belonged to us .
62002020	You have the gift that the Holy One gave you , so you all know the truth .
62002021	I do not write to you because you do not know the truth but because you do know the truth . And you know that no lie comes from the truth .
62002022	Who is the liar ? It is the person who does not accept Jesus as the Christ . This is the enemy of Christ : the person who does not accept the Father and his Son .
62002023	Whoever does not accept the Son does not have the Father . But whoever confesses the Son has the Father , too .
62002024	Be sure you continue to follow the teaching you heard from the beginning . If you continue to follow what you heard from the beginning , you will stay in the Son and in the Father .
62002025	And this is what the Son promised to us — life forever .
62002026	I am writing this letter about those people who are trying to lead you the wrong way .
62002027	Christ gave you a special gift that is still in you , so you do not need any other teacher . His gift teaches you about everything , and it is true , not false . So continue to live in Christ , as his gift taught you .
62002028	Yes , my dear children , live in him so that when Christ comes back , we can be without fear and not be ashamed in his presence .
62002029	Since you know that Christ is righteous , you know that all who do right are God’s children .
62003001	The Father has loved us so much that we are called children of God . And we really are his children . The reason the people in the world do not know us is that they have not known him .
62003002	Dear friends , now we are children of God , and we have not yet been shown what we will be in the future . But we know that when Christ comes again , we will be like him , because we will see him as he really is .
62003003	Christ is pure , and all who have this hope in Christ keep themselves pure like Christ .
62003004	The person who sins breaks God’s law . Yes , sin is living against God’s law .
62003005	You know that Christ came to take away sins and that there is no sin in Christ .
62003006	So anyone who lives in Christ does not go on sinning . Anyone who goes on sinning has never really understood Christ and has never known him .
62003007	Dear children , do not let anyone lead you the wrong way . Christ is righteous . So to be like Christ a person must do what is right .
62003008	The devil has been sinning since the beginning , so anyone who continues to sin belongs to the devil . The Son of God came for this purpose : to destroy the devil’s work .
62003009	Those who are God’s children do not continue sinning , because the new life from God remains in them . They are not able to go on sinning , because they have become children of God .
62003010	So we can see who God’s children are and who the devil’s children are : Those who do not do what is right are not God’s children , and those who do not love their brothers and sisters are not God’s children .
62003011	This is the teaching you have heard from the beginning : We must love each other .
62003012	Do not be like Cain who belonged to the Evil One and killed his brother . And why did he kill him ? Because the things Cain did were evil , and the things his brother did were good .
62003013	Brothers and sisters , do not be surprised when the people of the world hate you .
62003014	We know we have left death and have come into life because we love each other . Whoever does not love is still dead .
62003015	Everyone who hates a brother or sister is a murderer , and you know that no murderers have eternal life in them .
62003016	This is how we know what real love is : Jesus gave his life for us . So we should give our lives for our brothers and sisters .
62003017	Suppose someone has enough to live and sees a brother or sister in need , but does not help . Then God’s love is not living in that person .
62003018	My children , we should love people not only with words and talk , but by our actions and true caring .
62003021	My dear friends , if our hearts do not make us feel guilty , we can come without fear into God’s presence .
62003022	And God gives us what we ask for because we obey God’s commands and do what pleases him .
62003023	This is what God commands : that we believe in his Son , Jesus Christ , and that we love each other , just as he commanded .
62003024	The people who obey God’s commands live in God , and God lives in them . We know that God lives in us because of the Spirit God gave us .
62004001	My dear friends , many false prophets have gone out into the world . So do not believe every spirit , but test the spirits to see if they are from God .
62004002	This is how you can know God’s Spirit : Every spirit who confesses that Jesus Christ came to earth as a human is from God .
62004003	And every spirit who refuses to say this about Jesus is not from God . It is the spirit of the enemy of Christ , which you have heard is coming , and now he is already in the world .
62004004	My dear children , you belong to God and have defeated them ; because God’s Spirit , who is in you , is greater than the devil , who is in the world .
62004005	And they belong to the world , so what they say is from the world , and the world listens to them .
62004006	But we belong to God , and those who know God listen to us . But those who are not from God do not listen to us . That is how we know the Spirit that is true and the spirit that is false .
62004007	Dear friends , we should love each other , because love comes from God . Everyone who loves has become God’s child and knows God .
62004008	Whoever does not love does not know God , because God is love .
62004009	This is how God showed his love to us : He sent his one and only Son into the world so that we could have life through him .
62004010	This is what real love is : It is not our love for God ; it is God’s love for us . He sent his Son to die in our place to take away our sins .
62004011	Dear friends , if God loved us that much we also should love each other .
62004012	No one has ever seen God , but if we love each other , God lives in us , and his love is made perfect in us .
62004013	We know that we live in God and he lives in us , because he gave us his Spirit .
62004014	We have seen and can testify that the Father sent his Son to be the Savior of the world .
62004015	Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God has God living inside , and that person lives in God .
62004016	And so we know the love that God has for us , and we trust that love . God is love . Those who live in love live in God , and God lives in them .
62004017	This is how love is made perfect in us : that we can be without fear on the day God judges us , because in this world we are like him .
62004018	Where God’s love is , there is no fear , because God’s perfect love drives out fear . It is punishment that makes a person fear , so love is not made perfect in the person who fears .
62004019	We love because God first loved us .
62004020	If people say , “ I love God , ” but hate their brothers or sisters , they are liars . Those who do not love their brothers and sisters , whom they have seen , cannot love God , whom they have never seen .
62004021	And God gave us this command : Those who love God must also love their brothers and sisters .
62005001	Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is God’s child , and whoever loves the Father also loves the Father’s children .
62005002	This is how we know we love God’s children : when we love God and obey his commands .
62005003	Loving God means obeying his commands . And God’s commands are not too hard for us ,
62005004	because everyone who is a child of God conquers the world . And this is the victory that conquers the world — our faith .
62005005	So the one who conquers the world is the person who believes that Jesus is the Son of God .
62005006	Jesus Christ is the One who came by water and blood . He did not come by water only , but by water and blood . And the Spirit says that this is true , because the Spirit is the truth .
62005007	So there are three witnesses :
62005008	the Spirit , the water , and the blood ; and these three witnesses agree .
62005009	We believe people when they say something is true . But what God says is more important , and he has told us the truth about his own Son .
62005010	Anyone who believes in the Son of God has the truth that God told us . Anyone who does not believe makes God a liar , because that person does not believe what God told us about his Son .
62005011	This is what God told us : God has given us eternal life , and this life is in his Son .
62005012	Whoever has the Son has life , but whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life .
62005013	I write this letter to you who believe in the Son of God so you will know you have eternal life .
62005014	And this is the boldness we have in God’s presence : that if we ask God for anything that agrees with what he wants , he hears us .
62005015	If we know he hears us every time we ask him , we know we have what we ask from him .
62005016	If anyone sees a brother or sister sinning ( sin that does not lead to eternal death ) , that person should pray , and God will give the sinner life . I am talking about people whose sin does not lead to eternal death . There is sin that leads to death . I do not mean that a person should pray about that sin .
62005017	Doing wrong is always sin , but there is sin that does not lead to eternal death .
62005018	We know that those who are God’s children do not continue to sin . The Son of God keeps them safe , and the Evil One cannot touch them .
62005019	We know that we belong to God , but the Evil One controls the whole world .
62005020	We also know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding so that we can know the True One . And our lives are in the True One and in his Son , Jesus Christ . He is the true God and the eternal life .
62005021	So , dear children , keep yourselves away from false gods .
63001001	From the Elder . To the chosen lady and her children : I love all of you in the truth , and all those who know the truth love you .
63001002	We love you because of the truth that lives in us and will be with us forever .
63001003	Grace , mercy , and peace from God the Father and his Son , Jesus Christ , will be with us in truth and love .
63001004	I was very happy to learn that some of your children are following the way of truth , as the Father commanded us .
63001005	And now , dear lady , this is not a new command but is the same command we have had from the beginning . I ask you that we all love each other .
63001006	And love means living the way God commanded us to live . As you have heard from the beginning , his command is this : Live a life of love .
63001007	Many false teachers are in the world now who do not confess that Jesus Christ came to earth as a human . Anyone who does not confess this is a false teacher and an enemy of Christ .
63001008	Be careful yourselves that you do not lose everything you have worked for , but that you receive your full reward .
63001009	Anyone who goes beyond Christ’s teaching and does not continue to follow only his teaching does not have God . But whoever continues to follow the teaching of Christ has both the Father and the Son .
63001010	If someone comes to you and does not bring this teaching , do not welcome or accept that person into your house .
63001011	If you welcome such a person , you share in the evil work .
63001012	I have many things to write to you , but I do not want to use paper and ink . Instead , I hope to come to you and talk face to face so we can be full of joy .
63001013	The children of your chosen sister greet you .
64001001	From the Elder . To my dear friend Gaius , whom I love in the truth :
64001002	My dear friend , I know your soul is doing fine , and I pray that you are doing well in every way and that your health is good .
64001003	I was very happy when some brothers and sisters came and told me about the truth in your life and how you are following the way of truth .
64001004	Nothing gives me greater joy than to hear that my children are following the way of truth .
64001005	My dear friend , it is good that you help the brothers and sisters , even those you do not know .
64001006	They told the church about your love . Please help them to continue their trip in a way worthy of God .
64001007	They started out in service to Christ , and they have been accepting nothing from nonbelievers .
64001008	So we should help such people ; when we do , we share in their work for the truth .
64001009	I wrote something to the church , but Diotrephes , who loves to be their leader , will not listen to us .
64001010	So if I come , I will talk about what Diotrephes is doing , about how he lies and says evil things about us . But more than that , he refuses to accept the other brothers and sisters ; he even stops those who do want to accept them and puts them out of the church .
64001011	My dear friend , do not follow what is bad ; follow what is good . The one who does good belongs to God . But the one who does evil has never known God .
64001012	Everyone says good things about Demetrius , and the truth agrees with what they say . We also speak well of him , and you know what we say is true .
64001013	I have many things I want to write you , but I do not want to use pen and ink .
64001014	I hope to see you soon and talk face to face .
64001015	Peace to you . The friends here greet you . Please greet each friend there by name .
65001001	From Jude , a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James . To all who have been called by God . God the Father loves you , and you have been kept safe in Jesus Christ :
65001002	Mercy , peace , and love be yours richly .
65001003	Dear friends , I wanted very much to write you about the salvation we all share . But I felt the need to write you about something else : I want to encourage you to fight hard for the faith that was given the holy people of God once and for all time .
65001004	Some people have secretly entered your group . Long ago the prophets wrote about these people who will be judged guilty . They are against God and have changed the grace of our God into a reason for sexual sin . They also refuse to accept Jesus Christ , our only Master and Lord .
65001005	I want to remind you of some things you already know : Remember that the Lord saved his people by bringing them out of the land of Egypt . But later he destroyed all those who did not believe .
65001006	And remember the angels who did not keep their place of power but left their proper home . The Lord has kept these angels in darkness , bound with everlasting chains , to be judged on the great day .
65001007	Also remember the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and the other towns around them . In the same way they were full of sexual sin and people who desired sexual relations that God does not allow . They suffer the punishment of eternal fire , as an example for all to see .
65001008	It is the same with these people who have entered your group . They are guided by dreams and make themselves filthy with sin . They reject God’s authority and speak against the angels .
65001009	Not even the archangel Michael , when he argued with the devil about who would have the body of Moses , dared to judge the devil guilty . Instead , he said , “ The Lord punish you . ”
65001010	But these people speak against things they do not understand . And what they do know , by feeling , as dumb animals know things , are the very things that destroy them .
65001011	It will be terrible for them . They have followed the way of Cain , and for money they have given themselves to doing the wrong that Balaam did . They have fought against God as Korah did , and like Korah , they surely will be destroyed .
65001012	They are like dirty spots in your special Christian meals you share . They eat with you and have no fear , caring only for themselves . They are clouds without rain , which the wind blows around . They are autumn trees without fruit that are pulled out of the ground . So they are twice dead .
65001013	They are like wild waves of the sea , tossing up their own shameful actions like foam . They are like stars that wander in the sky . A place in the blackest darkness has been kept for them forever .
65001014	Enoch , the seventh descendant from Adam , said about these people : “ Look , the Lord is coming with many thousands of his holy angels to
65001015	judge every person . He is coming to punish all who are against God for all the evil they have done against him . And he will punish the sinners who are against God for all the evil they have said against him . ”
65001016	These people complain and blame others , doing the evil things they want to do . They brag about themselves , and they flatter others to get what they want .
65001017	Dear friends , remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ said before .
65001018	They said to you , “ In the last times there will be people who laugh about God , following their own evil desires which are against God . ”
65001019	These are the people who divide you , people whose thoughts are only of this world , who do not have the Spirit .
65001020	But dear friends , use your most holy faith to build yourselves up , praying in the Holy Spirit .
65001021	Keep yourselves in God’s love as you wait for the Lord Jesus Christ with his mercy to give you life forever .
65001022	Show mercy to some people who have doubts .
65001023	Take others out of the fire , and save them . Show mercy mixed with fear to others , hating even their clothes which are dirty from sin .
65001024	God is strong and can help you not to fall . He can bring you before his glory without any wrong in you and can give you great joy .
65001025	He is the only God , the One who saves us . To him be glory , greatness , power , and authority through Jesus Christ our Lord for all time past , now , and forever . Amen .
66001001	This is the revelation of Jesus Christ , which God gave to him , to show his servants what must soon happen . And Jesus sent his angel to show it to his servant John ,
66001002	who has told everything he has seen . It is the word of God ; it is the message from Jesus Christ .
66001003	Blessed is the one who reads the words of God’s message , and blessed are the people who hear this message and do what is written in it . The time is near when all of this will happen .
66001004	From John . To the seven churches in Asia : Grace and peace to you from the One who is and was and is coming , and from the seven spirits before his throne ,
66001005	and from Jesus Christ . Jesus is the faithful witness , the first among those raised from the dead . He is the ruler of the kings of the earth . He is the One who loves us , who made us free from our sins with the blood of his death .
66001006	He made us to be a kingdom of priests who serve God his Father . To Jesus Christ be glory and power forever and ever ! Amen .
66001007	Look , Jesus is coming with the clouds , and everyone will see him , even those who stabbed him . And all peoples of the earth will cry loudly because of him . Yes , this will happen ! Amen .
66001008	The Lord God says , “ I am the Alpha and the Omega . I am the One who is and was and is coming . I am the Almighty . ”
66001009	I , John , am your brother . All of us share with Christ in suffering , in the kingdom , and in patience to continue . I was on the island of Patmos , because I had preached the word of God and the message about Jesus .
66001010	On the Lord’s day I was in the Spirit , and I heard a loud voice behind me that sounded like a trumpet .
66001011	The voice said , “ Write what you see in a book and send it to the seven churches : to Ephesus , Smyrna , Pergamum , Thyatira , Sardis , Philadelphia , and Laodicea . ”
66001012	I turned to see who was talking to me . When I turned , I saw seven golden lampstands
66001013	and someone among the lampstands who was “ like a Son of Man . ” He was dressed in a long robe and had a gold band around his chest .
66001014	His head and hair were white like wool , as white as snow , and his eyes were like flames of fire .
66001015	His feet were like bronze that glows hot in a furnace , and his voice was like the noise of flooding water .
66001016	He held seven stars in his right hand , and a sharp double-edged sword came out of his mouth . He looked like the sun shining at its brightest time .
66001017	When I saw him , I fell down at his feet like a dead man . He put his right hand on me and said , “ Do not be afraid . I am the First and the Last .
66001018	I am the One who lives ; I was dead , but look , I am alive forever and ever ! And I hold the keys to death and to the place of the dead .
66001019	So write the things you see , what is now and what will happen later .
66001020	Here is the secret of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and the seven golden lampstands : The seven lampstands are the seven churches , and the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches .
66002001	“ Write this to the angel of the church in Ephesus : “ The One who holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the seven golden lampstands says this :
66002002	I know what you do , how you work hard and never give up . I know you do not put up with the false teachings of evil people . You have tested those who say they are apostles but really are not , and you found they are liars .
66002003	You have patience and have suffered troubles for my name and have not given up .
66002004	“ But I have this against you : You have left the love you had in the beginning .
66002005	So remember where you were before you fell . Change your hearts and do what you did at first . If you do not change , I will come to you and will take away your lampstand from its place .
66002006	But there is something you do that is right : You hate what the Nicolaitans do , as much as I .
66002007	“ Every person who has ears should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches . To those who win the victory I will give the right to eat the fruit from the tree of life , which is in the garden of God .
66002008	“ Write this to the angel of the church in Smyrna : “ The One who is the First and the Last , who died and came to life again , says this :
66002009	I know your troubles and that you are poor , but really you are rich ! I know the bad things some people say about you . They say they are Jews , but they are not true Jews . They are a synagogue that belongs to Satan .
66002010	Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer . I tell you , the devil will put some of you in prison to test you , and you will suffer for ten days . But be faithful , even if you have to die , and I will give you the crown of life .
66002011	“ Everyone who has ears should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches . Those who win the victory will not be hurt by the second death .
66002012	“ Write this to the angel of the church in Pergamum : “ The One who has the sharp , double-edged sword says this :
66002013	I know where you live . It is where Satan has his throne . But you are true to me . You did not refuse to tell about your faith in me even during the time of Antipas , my faithful witness who was killed in your city , where Satan lives .
66002014	“ But I have a few things against you : You have some there who follow the teaching of Balaam . He taught Balak how to cause the people of Israel to sin by eating food offered to idols and by taking part in sexual sins .
66002015	You also have some who follow the teaching of the Nicolaitans .
66002016	So change your hearts and lives . If you do not , I will come to you quickly and fight against them with the sword that comes out of my mouth .
66002017	“ Everyone who has ears should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches . “ I will give some of the hidden manna to everyone who wins the victory . I will also give to each one who wins the victory a white stone with a new name written on it . No one knows this new name except the one who receives it .
66002018	“ Write this to the angel of the church in Thyatira : “ The Son of God , who has eyes that blaze like fire and feet like shining bronze , says this :
66002019	I know what you do . I know about your love , your faith , your service , and your patience . I know that you are doing more now than you did at first .
66002020	“ But I have this against you : You let that woman Jezebel spread false teachings . She says she is a prophetess , but by her teaching she leads my people to take part in sexual sins and to eat food that is offered to idols .
66002021	I have given her time to change her heart and turn away from her sin , but she does not want to change .
66002022	So I will throw her on a bed of suffering . And all those who take part in adultery with her will suffer greatly if they do not turn away from the wrongs she does .
66002023	I will also kill her followers . Then all the churches will know I am the One who searches hearts and minds , and I will repay each of you for what you have done .
66002024	“ But others of you in Thyatira have not followed her teaching and have not learned what some call Satan’s deep secrets . I say to you that I will not put any other load on you .
66002025	Only continue in your loyalty until I come .
66002026	“ I will give power over the nations to everyone who wins the victory and continues to be obedient to me until the end .
66002027	‘ You will rule over them with an iron rod , as when pottery is broken into pieces . ’
66002028	This is the same power I received from my Father . I will also give him the morning star .
66002029	Everyone who has ears should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches .
66003001	“ Write this to the angel of the church in Sardis : “ The One who has the seven spirits and the seven stars says this : I know what you do . People say that you are alive , but really you are dead .
66003002	Wake up ! Strengthen what you have left before it dies completely . I have found that what you are doing is less than what my God wants .
66003003	So do not forget what you have received and heard . Obey it , and change your hearts and lives . So you must wake up , or I will come like a thief , and you will not know when I will come to you .
66003004	But you have a few there in Sardis who have kept their clothes unstained , so they will walk with me and will wear white clothes , because they are worthy .
66003005	Those who win the victory will be dressed in white clothes like them . And I will not erase their names from the book of life , but I will say they belong to me before my Father and before his angels .
66003006	Everyone who has ears should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches .
66003007	“ Write this to the angel of the church in Philadelphia : “ This is what the One who is holy and true , who holds the key of David , says . When he opens a door , no one can close it . And when he closes it , no one can open it .
66003008	I know what you do . I have put an open door before you , which no one can close . I know you have little strength , but you have obeyed my teaching and were not afraid to speak my name .
66003009	Those in the synagogue that belongs to Satan say they are Jews , but they are not true Jews ; they are liars . I will make them come before you and bow at your feet , and they will know that I have loved you .
66003010	You have obeyed my teaching about not giving up your faith . So I will keep you from the time of trouble that will come to the whole world to test those who live on earth .
66003011	“ I am coming soon . Continue strong in your faith so no one will take away your crown .
66003012	I will make those who win the victory pillars in the temple of my God , and they will never have to leave it . I will write on them the name of my God and the name of the city of my God , the new Jerusalem , that comes down out of heaven from my God . I will also write on them my new name .
66003013	Everyone who has ears should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches .
66003014	“ Write this to the angel of the church in Laodicea : “ The Amen , the faithful and true witness , the ruler of all God has made , says this :
66003015	I know what you do , that you are not hot or cold . I wish that you were hot or cold !
66003016	But because you are lukewarm — neither hot , nor cold — I am ready to spit you out of my mouth .
66003017	You say , ‘ I am rich , and I have become wealthy and do not need anything . ’ But you do not know that you are really miserable , pitiful , poor , blind , and naked .
66003018	I advise you to buy from me gold made pure in fire so you can be truly rich . Buy from me white clothes so you can be clothed and so you can cover your shameful nakedness . Buy from me medicine to put on your eyes so you can truly see .
66003019	“ I correct and punish those whom I love . So be eager to do right , and change your hearts and lives .
66003020	Here I am ! I stand at the door and knock . If you hear my voice and open the door , I will come in and eat with you , and you will eat with me .
66003021	“ Those who win the victory will sit with me on my throne in the same way that I won the victory and sat down with my Father on his throne .
66003022	Everyone who has ears should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches . ”
66004001	After the vision of these things I looked , and there before me was an open door in heaven . And the same voice that spoke to me before , that sounded like a trumpet , said , “ Come up here , and I will show you what must happen after this . ”
66004002	Immediately I was in the Spirit , and before me was a throne in heaven , and someone was sitting on it .
66004003	The One who sat on the throne looked like precious stones , like jasper and carnelian . All around the throne was a rainbow the color of an emerald .
66004004	Around the throne there were twenty-four other thrones with twenty-four elders sitting on them . They were dressed in white and had golden crowns on their heads .
66004005	Lightning flashes and noises and thunder came from the throne . Before the throne seven lamps were burning , which are the seven spirits of God .
66004006	Also before the throne there was something that looked like a sea of glass , clear like crystal . In the center and around the throne were four living creatures with eyes all over them , in front and in back .
66004007	The first living creature was like a lion . The second was like a calf . The third had a face like a man . The fourth was like a flying eagle .
66004008	Each of these four living creatures had six wings and was covered all over with eyes , inside and out . Day and night they never stop saying : “ Holy , holy , holy is the Lord God Almighty . He was , he is , and he is coming . ”
66004009	These living creatures give glory , honor , and thanks to the One who sits on the throne , who lives forever and ever .
66004010	Then the twenty-four elders bow down before the One who sits on the throne , and they worship him who lives forever and ever . They put their crowns down before the throne and say :
66004011	“ You are worthy , our Lord and God , to receive glory and honor and power , because you made all things . Everything existed and was made , because you wanted it . ”
66005001	Then I saw a scroll in the right hand of the One sitting on the throne . The scroll had writing on both sides and was kept closed with seven seals .
66005002	And I saw a powerful angel calling in a loud voice , “ Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll ? ”
66005003	But there was no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth who could open the scroll or look inside it .
66005004	I cried bitterly because there was no one who was worthy to open the scroll or look inside .
66005005	But one of the elders said to me , “ Do not cry ! The Lion from the tribe of Judah , David’s descendant , has won the victory so that he is able to open the scroll and its seven seals . ”
66005006	Then I saw a Lamb standing in the center of the throne and in the middle of the four living creatures and the elders . The Lamb looked as if he had been killed . He had seven horns and seven eyes , which are the seven spirits of God that were sent into all the world .
66005007	The Lamb came and took the scroll from the right hand of the One sitting on the throne .
66005008	When he took the scroll , the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders bowed down before the Lamb . Each one of them had a harp and golden bowls full of incense , which are the prayers of God’s holy people .
66005009	And they all sang a new song to the Lamb : “ You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals , because you were killed , and with the blood of your death you bought people for God from every tribe , language , people , and nation .
66005010	You made them to be a kingdom of priests for our God , and they will rule on the earth . ”
66005011	Then I looked , and I heard the voices of many angels around the throne , and the four living creatures , and the elders . There were thousands and thousands of angels ,
66005012	saying in a loud voice : “ The Lamb who was killed is worthy to receive power , wealth , wisdom , and strength , honor , glory , and praise ! ”
66005013	Then I heard all creatures in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea saying : “ To the One who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be praise and honor and glory and power forever and ever . ”
66005014	The four living creatures said , “ Amen , ” and the elders bowed down and worshiped .
66006001	Then I watched while the Lamb opened the first of the seven seals . I heard one of the four living creatures say with a voice like thunder , “ Come ! ”
66006002	I looked , and there before me was a white horse . The rider on the horse held a bow , and he was given a crown , and he rode out , determined to win the victory .
66006003	When the Lamb opened the second seal , I heard the second living creature say , “ Come ! ”
66006004	Then another horse came out , a red one . Its rider was given power to take away peace from the earth and to make people kill each other , and he was given a big sword .
66006005	When the Lamb opened the third seal , I heard the third living creature say , “ Come ! ” I looked , and there before me was a black horse , and its rider held a pair of scales in his hand .
66006006	Then I heard something that sounded like a voice coming from the middle of the four living creatures . The voice said , “ A quart of wheat for a day’s pay , and three quarts of barley for a day’s pay , and do not damage the olive oil and wine ! ”
66006007	When the Lamb opened the fourth seal , I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say , “ Come ! ”
66006008	I looked , and there before me was a pale horse . Its rider was named death , and Hades was following close behind him . They were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill people by war , by starvation , by disease , and by the wild animals of the earth .
66006009	When the Lamb opened the fifth seal , I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been killed because they were faithful to the word of God and to the message they had received .
66006010	These souls shouted in a loud voice , “ Holy and true Lord , how long until you judge the people of the earth and punish them for killing us ? ”
66006011	Then each one of them was given a white robe and was told to wait a short time longer . There were still some of their fellow servants and brothers and sisters in the service of Christ who must be killed as they were . They had to wait until all of this was finished .
66006012	Then I watched while the Lamb opened the sixth seal , and there was a great earthquake . The sun became black like rough black cloth , and the whole moon became red like blood .
66006013	And the stars in the sky fell to the earth like figs falling from a fig tree when the wind blows .
66006014	The sky disappeared as a scroll when it is rolled up , and every mountain and island was moved from its place .
66006015	Then the kings of the earth , the rulers , the generals , the rich people , the powerful people , the slaves , and the free people hid themselves in caves and in the rocks on the mountains .
66006016	They called to the mountains and the rocks , “ Fall on us . Hide us from the face of the One who sits on the throne and from the anger of the Lamb !
66006017	The great day for their anger has come , and who can stand against it ? ”
66007001	After the vision of these things I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth . The angels were holding the four winds of the earth to keep them from blowing on the land or on the sea or on any tree .
66007002	Then I saw another angel coming up from the east who had the seal of the living God . And he called out in a loud voice to the four angels to whom God had given power to harm the earth and the sea .
66007003	He said to them , “ Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees until we mark with a sign the foreheads of the people who serve our God . ”
66007004	Then I heard how many people were marked with the sign . There were one hundred forty-four thousand from every tribe of the people of Israel .
66007005	From the tribe of Judah twelve thousand were marked with the sign , from the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand , from the tribe of Gad twelve thousand ,
66007006	from the tribe of Asher twelve thousand , from the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand , from the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand ,
66007007	from the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand , from the tribe of Levi twelve thousand , from the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand ,
66007008	from the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand , from the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand , and from the tribe of Benjamin twelve thousand were marked with the sign .
66007009	After the vision of these things I looked , and there was a great number of people , so many that no one could count them . They were from every nation , tribe , people , and language of the earth . They were all standing before the throne and before the Lamb , wearing white robes and holding palm branches in their hands .
66007010	They were shouting in a loud voice , “ Salvation belongs to our God , who sits on the throne , and to the Lamb . ”
66007011	All the angels were standing around the throne and the elders and the four living creatures . They all bowed down on their faces before the throne and worshiped God ,
66007012	saying , “ Amen ! Praise , glory , wisdom , thanks , honor , power , and strength belong to our God forever and ever . Amen ! ”
66007013	Then one of the elders asked me , “ Who are these people dressed in white robes ? Where did they come from ? ”
66007014	I answered , “ You know , sir . ” And the elder said to me , “ These are the people who have come out of the great distress . They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb .
66007015	Because of this , they are before the throne of God . They worship him day and night in his temple . And the One who sits on the throne will be present with them .
66007016	Those people will never be hungry again , and they will never be thirsty again . The sun will not hurt them , and no heat will burn them ,
66007017	because the Lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd . He will lead them to springs of water that give life . And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes . ”
66008001	When the Lamb opened the seventh seal , there was silence in heaven for about half an hour .
66008002	And I saw the seven angels who stand before God and to whom were given seven trumpets .
66008003	Another angel came and stood at the altar , holding a golden pan for incense . He was given much incense to offer with the prayers of all God’s holy people . The angel put this offering on the golden altar before the throne .
66008004	The smoke from the incense went up from the angel’s hand to God with the prayers of God’s people .
66008005	Then the angel filled the incense pan with fire from the altar and threw it on the earth , and there were flashes of lightning , thunder and loud noises , and an earthquake .
66008006	Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to blow them .
66008007	The first angel blew his trumpet , and hail and fire mixed with blood were poured down on the earth . And a third of the earth , and all the green grass , and a third of the trees were burned up .
66008008	Then the second angel blew his trumpet , and something that looked like a big mountain , burning with fire , was thrown into the sea . And a third of the sea became blood ,
66008009	a third of the living things in the sea died , and a third of the ships were destroyed .
66008010	Then the third angel blew his trumpet , and a large star , burning like a torch , fell from the sky . It fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water .
66008011	The name of the star is Wormwood . And a third of all the water became bitter , and many people died from drinking the water that was bitter .
66008012	Then the fourth angel blew his trumpet , and a third of the sun , and a third of the moon , and a third of the stars were struck . So a third of them became dark , and a third of the day was without light , and also the night .
66008013	While I watched , I heard an eagle that was flying high in the air cry out in a loud voice , “ Trouble ! Trouble ! Trouble for those who live on the earth because of the remaining sounds of the trumpets that the other three angels are about to blow ! ”
66009001	Then the fifth angel blew his trumpet , and I saw a star fall from the sky to the earth . The star was given the key to the deep hole that leads to the bottomless pit .
66009002	Then it opened up the hole that leads to the bottomless pit , and smoke came up from the hole like smoke from a big furnace . Then the sun and sky became dark because of the smoke from the hole .
66009003	Then locusts came down to the earth out of the smoke , and they were given the power to sting like scorpions .
66009004	They were told not to harm the grass on the earth or any plant or tree . They could harm only the people who did not have the sign of God on their foreheads .
66009005	These locusts were not given the power to kill anyone , but to cause pain to the people for five months . And the pain they felt was like the pain a scorpion gives when it stings someone .
66009006	During those days people will look for a way to die , but they will not find it . They will want to die , but death will run away from them .
66009007	The locusts looked like horses prepared for battle . On their heads they wore what looked like crowns of gold , and their faces looked like human faces .
66009008	Their hair was like women’s hair , and their teeth were like lions’ teeth .
66009009	Their chests looked like iron breastplates , and the sound of their wings was like the noise of many horses and chariots hurrying into battle .
66009010	The locusts had tails with stingers like scorpions , and in their tails was their power to hurt people for five months .
66009011	The locusts had a king who was the angel of the bottomless pit . His name in the Hebrew language is Abaddon and in the Greek language is Apollyon .
66009012	The first trouble is past ; there are still two other troubles that will come .
66009013	Then the sixth angel blew his trumpet , and I heard a voice coming from the horns on the golden altar that is before God .
66009014	The voice said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet , “ Free the four angels who are tied at the great river Euphrates . ”
66009015	And they let loose the four angels who had been kept ready for this hour and day and month and year so they could kill a third of all people on the earth .
66009016	I heard how many troops on horses were in their army — two hundred million .
66009017	The horses and their riders I saw in the vision looked like this : They had breastplates that were fiery red , dark blue , and yellow like sulfur . The heads of the horses looked like heads of lions , with fire , smoke , and sulfur coming out of their mouths .
66009018	A third of all the people on earth were killed by these three terrible disasters coming out of the horses’ mouths : the fire , the smoke , and the sulfur .
66009019	The horses’ power was in their mouths and in their tails ; their tails were like snakes with heads , and with them they hurt people .
66009020	The other people who were not killed by these terrible disasters still did not change their hearts and turn away from what they had made with their own hands . They did not stop worshiping demons and idols made of gold , silver , bronze , stone , and wood — things that cannot see or hear or walk .
66009021	These people did not change their hearts and turn away from murder or evil magic , from their sexual sins or stealing .
66010001	Then I saw another powerful angel coming down from heaven dressed in a cloud with a rainbow over his head . His face was like the sun , and his legs were like pillars of fire .
66010002	The angel was holding a small scroll open in his hand . He put his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land .
66010003	Then he shouted loudly like the roaring of a lion . And when he shouted , the voices of seven thunders spoke .
66010004	When the seven thunders spoke , I started to write . But I heard a voice from heaven say , “ Keep hidden what the seven thunders said , and do not write them down . ”
66010005	Then the angel I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven ,
66010006	and he made a promise by the power of the One who lives forever and ever . He is the One who made the skies and all that is in them , the earth and all that is in it , and the sea and all that is in it . The angel promised , “ There will be no more waiting !
66010007	In the days when the seventh angel is ready to blow his trumpet , God’s secret will be finished . This secret is the Good News God told to his servants , the prophets . ”
66010008	Then I heard the same voice from heaven again , saying to me : “ Go and take the open scroll that is in the hand of the angel that is standing on the sea and on the land . ”
66010009	So I went to the angel and told him to give me the small scroll . And he said to me , “ Take the scroll and eat it . It will be sour in your stomach , but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey . ”
66010010	So I took the small scroll from the angel’s hand and ate it . In my mouth it tasted sweet as honey , but after I ate it , it was sour in my stomach .
66010011	Then I was told , “ You must prophesy again about many peoples , nations , languages , and kings . ”
66011001	I was given a measuring stick like a rod , and I was told , “ Go and measure the temple of God and the altar , and count the people worshiping there .
66011002	But do not measure the yard outside the temple . Leave it alone , because it has been given to those who are not God’s people . And they will trample on the holy city for forty-two months .
66011003	And I will give power to my two witnesses to prophesy for one thousand two hundred sixty days , and they will be dressed in rough cloth to show their sadness . ”
66011004	These two witnesses are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth .
66011005	And if anyone tries to hurt them , fire comes from their mouths and kills their enemies . And if anyone tries to hurt them in whatever way , in that same way that person will die .
66011006	These witnesses have the power to stop the sky from raining during the time they are prophesying . And they have power to make the waters become blood , and they have power to send every kind of trouble to the earth as many times as they want .
66011007	When the two witnesses have finished telling their message , the beast that comes up from the bottomless pit will fight a war against them . He will defeat them and kill them .
66011008	The bodies of the two witnesses will lie in the street of the great city where the Lord was killed . This city is named Sodom and Egypt , which has a spiritual meaning .
66011009	Those from every race of people , tribe , language , and nation will look at the bodies of the two witnesses for three and one-half days , and they will refuse to bury them .
66011010	People who live on the earth will rejoice and be happy because these two are dead . They will send each other gifts , because these two prophets brought much suffering to those who live on the earth .
66011011	But after three and one-half days , God put the breath of life into the two prophets again . They stood on their feet , and everyone who saw them became very afraid .
66011012	Then the two prophets heard a loud voice from heaven saying , “ Come up here ! ” And they went up into heaven in a cloud as their enemies watched .
66011013	In the same hour there was a great earthquake , and a tenth of the city was destroyed . Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake , and those who did not die were very afraid and gave glory to the God of heaven .
66011014	The second trouble is finished . Pay attention : The third trouble is coming soon .
66011015	Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet . And there were loud voices in heaven , saying : “ The power to rule the world now belongs to our Lord and his Christ , and he will rule forever and ever . ”
66011016	Then the twenty-four elders , who sit on their thrones before God , bowed down on their faces and worshiped God .
66011017	They said : “ We give thanks to you , Lord God Almighty , who is and who was , because you have used your great power and have begun to rule !
66011018	The people of the world were angry , but your anger has come . The time has come to judge the dead , and to reward your servants the prophets and your holy people , all who respect you , great and small . The time has come to destroy those who destroy the earth ! ”
66011019	Then God’s temple in heaven was opened . The Ark that holds the agreement God gave to his people could be seen in his temple . Then there were flashes of lightning , noises , thunder , an earthquake , and a great hailstorm .
66012001	And then a great wonder appeared in heaven : A woman was clothed with the sun , and the moon was under her feet , and a crown of twelve stars was on her head .
66012002	She was pregnant and cried out with pain , because she was about to give birth .
66012003	Then another wonder appeared in heaven : There was a giant red dragon with seven heads and seven crowns on each head . He also had ten horns .
66012004	His tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and threw them down to the earth . He stood in front of the woman who was ready to give birth so he could eat her baby as soon as it was born .
66012005	Then the woman gave birth to a son who will rule all the nations with an iron rod . And her child was taken up to God and to his throne .
66012006	The woman ran away into the desert to a place God prepared for her where she would be taken care of for one thousand two hundred sixty days .
66012007	Then there was a war in heaven . Michael and his angels fought against the dragon , and the dragon and his angels fought back .
66012008	But the dragon was not strong enough , and he and his angels lost their place in heaven .
66012009	The giant dragon was thrown down out of heaven . ( He is that old snake called the devil or Satan , who tricks the whole world . ) The dragon with his angels was thrown down to the earth .
66012010	Then I heard a loud voice in heaven saying : “ The salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ have now come . The accuser of our brothers and sisters , who accused them day and night before our God , has been thrown down .
66012011	And our brothers and sisters defeated him by the blood of the Lamb’s death and by the message they preached . They did not love their lives so much that they were afraid of death .
66012012	So rejoice , you heavens and all who live there ! But it will be terrible for the earth and the sea , because the devil has come down to you ! He is filled with anger , because he knows he does not have much time . ”
66012013	When the dragon saw he had been thrown down to the earth , he hunted for the woman who had given birth to the son .
66012014	But the woman was given the two wings of a great eagle so she could fly to the place prepared for her in the desert . There she would be taken care of for three and one-half years , away from the snake .
66012015	Then the snake poured water out of its mouth like a river toward the woman so the flood would carry her away .
66012016	But the earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and swallowing the river that came from the mouth of the dragon .
66012017	Then the dragon was very angry at the woman , and he went off to make war against all her other children — those who obey God’s commands and who have the message Jesus taught .
66013001	And the dragon stood on the seashore . Then I saw a beast coming up out of the sea . It had ten horns and seven heads , and there was a crown on each horn . A name against God was written on each head .
66013002	This beast looked like a leopard , with feet like a bear’s feet and a mouth like a lion’s mouth . And the dragon gave the beast all of his power and his throne and great authority .
66013003	One of the heads of the beast looked as if it had been killed by a wound , but this death wound was healed . Then the whole world was amazed and followed the beast .
66013004	People worshiped the dragon because he had given his power to the beast . And they also worshiped the beast , asking , “ Who is like the beast ? Who can make war against it ? ”
66013005	The beast was allowed to say proud words and words against God , and it was allowed to use its power for forty-two months .
66013006	It used its mouth to speak against God , against God’s name , against the place where God lives , and against all those who live in heaven .
66013007	It was given power to make war against God’s holy people and to defeat them . It was given power over every tribe , people , language , and nation .
66013008	And all who live on earth will worship the beast — all the people since the beginning of the world whose names are not written in the Lamb’s book of life . The Lamb is the One who was killed .
66013009	Anyone who has ears should listen :
66013010	If you are to be a prisoner , then you will be a prisoner . If you are to be killed with the sword , then you will be killed with the sword . This means that God’s holy people must have patience and faith .
66013011	Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth . It had two horns like a lamb , but it spoke like a dragon .
66013012	This beast stands before the first beast and uses the same power the first beast has . By this power it makes everyone living on earth worship the first beast , who had the death wound that was healed .
66013013	And the second beast does great miracles so that it even makes fire come down from heaven to earth while people are watching .
66013014	It fools those who live on earth by the miracles it has been given the power to do . It does these miracles to serve the first beast . The second beast orders people to make an idol to honor the first beast , the one that was wounded by the deadly sword but sprang to life again .
66013015	The second beast was given power to give life to the idol of the first one so that the idol could speak . And the second beast was given power to command all who will not worship the image of the beast to be killed .
66013016	The second beast also forced all people , small and great , rich and poor , free and slave , to have a mark on their right hand or on their forehead .
66013017	No one could buy or sell without this mark , which is the name of the beast or the number of its name .
66013018	This takes wisdom . Let the one who has understanding find the meaning of the number , which is the number of a person . Its number is 666 .
66014001	Then I looked , and there before me was the Lamb standing on Mount Zion . With him were one hundred forty-four thousand people who had his name and his Father’s name written on their foreheads .
66014002	And I heard a sound from heaven like the noise of flooding water and like the sound of loud thunder . The sound I heard was like people playing harps .
66014003	And they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders . No one could learn the new song except the one hundred forty-four thousand who had been bought from the earth .
66014004	These are the ones who did not do sinful things with women , because they kept themselves pure . They follow the Lamb every place he goes . These one hundred forty-four thousand were bought from among the people of the earth as people to be offered to God and the Lamb .
66014005	They were not guilty of telling lies ; they are without fault .
66014006	Then I saw another angel flying high in the air . He had the eternal Good News to preach to those who live on earth — to every nation , tribe , language , and people .
66014007	He preached in a loud voice , “ Fear God and give him praise , because the time has come for God to judge all people . So worship God who made the heavens , and the earth , and the sea , and the springs of water . ”
66014008	Then the second angel followed the first angel and said , “ Ruined , ruined is the great city of Babylon ! She made all the nations drink the wine of the anger of her adultery . ”
66014009	Then a third angel followed the first two angels , saying in a loud voice : “ If anyone worships the beast and his idol and gets the beast’s mark on the forehead or on the hand ,
66014010	that one also will drink the wine of God’s anger , which is prepared with all its strength in the cup of his anger . And that person will be put in pain with burning sulfur before the holy angels and the Lamb .
66014011	And the smoke from their burning pain will rise forever and ever . There will be no rest , day or night , for those who worship the beast and his idol or who get the mark of his name . ”
66014012	This means God’s holy people must be patient . They must obey God’s commands and keep their faith in Jesus .
66014013	Then I heard a voice from heaven saying , “ Write this : Blessed are the dead who die from now on in the Lord . ” The Spirit says , “ Yes , they will rest from their hard work , and the reward of all they have done stays with them . ”
66014014	Then I looked , and there before me was a white cloud , and sitting on the white cloud was One who looked like a Son of Man . He had a gold crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand .
66014015	Then another angel came out of the temple and called out in a loud voice to the One who was sitting on the cloud , “ Take your sickle and harvest from the earth , because the time to harvest has come , and the fruit of the earth is ripe . ”
66014016	So the One who was sitting on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth , and the earth was harvested .
66014017	Then another angel came out of the temple in heaven , and he also had a sharp sickle .
66014018	And then another angel , who has power over the fire , came from the altar . This angel called to the angel with the sharp sickle , saying , “ Take your sharp sickle and gather the bunches of grapes from the earth’s vine , because its grapes are ripe . ”
66014019	Then the angel swung his sickle over the earth . He gathered the earth’s grapes and threw them into the great winepress of God’s anger .
66014020	They were trampled in the winepress outside the city , and blood flowed out of the winepress as high as horses’ bridles for a distance of about one hundred eighty miles .
66015001	Then I saw another wonder in heaven that was great and amazing . There were seven angels bringing seven disasters . These are the last disasters , because after them , God’s anger is finished .
66015002	I saw what looked like a sea of glass mixed with fire . All of those who had won the victory over the beast and his idol and over the number of his name were standing by the sea of glass . They had harps that God had given them .
66015003	They sang the song of Moses , the servant of God , and the song of the Lamb : “ You do great and wonderful things , Lord God Almighty . Everything the Lord does is right and true , King of the nations .
66015004	Everyone will respect you , Lord , and will honor you . Only you are holy . All the nations will come and worship you , because the right things you have done are now made known . ”
66015005	After this I saw that the temple ( the Tent of the Agreement ) in heaven was opened .
66015006	And the seven angels bringing the seven disasters came out of the temple . They were dressed in clean , shining linen and wore golden bands tied around their chests .
66015007	Then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls filled with the anger of God , who lives forever and ever .
66015008	The temple was filled with smoke from the glory and the power of God , and no one could enter the temple until the seven disasters of the seven angels were finished .
66016001	Then I heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels , “ Go and pour out the seven bowls of God’s anger on the earth . ”
66016002	The first angel left and poured out his bowl on the land . Then ugly and painful sores came upon all those who had the mark of the beast and who worshiped his idol .
66016003	The second angel poured out his bowl on the sea , and it became blood like that of a dead man , and every living thing in the sea died .
66016004	The third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and the springs of water , and they became blood .
66016005	Then I heard the angel of the waters saying : “ Holy One , you are the One who is and who was . You are right to decide to punish these evil people .
66016006	They have poured out the blood of your holy people and your prophets . So now you have given them blood to drink as they deserve . ”
66016007	And I heard a voice coming from the altar saying : “ Yes , Lord God Almighty , the way you punish evil people is right and fair . ”
66016008	The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun , and he was given power to burn the people with fire .
66016009	They were burned by the great heat , and they cursed the name of God , who had control over these disasters . But the people refused to change their hearts and lives and give glory to God .
66016010	The fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast , and darkness covered its kingdom . People gnawed their tongues because of the pain .
66016011	They also cursed the God of heaven because of their pain and the sores they had , but they refused to change their hearts and turn away from the evil things they did .
66016012	The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates so that the water in the river was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the east to come .
66016013	Then I saw three evil spirits that looked like frogs coming out of the mouth of the dragon , out of the mouth of the beast , and out of the mouth of the false prophet .
66016014	These evil spirits are the spirits of demons , which have power to do miracles . They go out to the kings of the whole world to gather them together for the battle on the great day of God Almighty .
66016015	“ Listen ! I will come as a thief comes ! Blessed are those who stay awake and keep their clothes on so that they will not walk around naked and have people see their shame . ”
66016016	Then the evil spirits gathered the kings together to the place that is called Armageddon in the Hebrew language .
66016017	The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air . Then a loud voice came out of the temple from the throne , saying , “ It is finished ! ”
66016018	Then there were flashes of lightning , noises , thunder , and a big earthquake — the worst earthquake that has ever happened since people have been on earth .
66016019	The great city split into three parts , and the cities of the nations were destroyed . And God remembered the sins of Babylon the Great , so he gave that city the cup filled with the wine of his terrible anger .
66016020	Then every island ran away , and mountains disappeared .
66016021	Giant hailstones , each weighing about a hundred pounds , fell from the sky upon people . People cursed God for the disaster of the hail , because this disaster was so terrible .
66017001	Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke to me . He said , “ Come , and I will show you the punishment that will be given to the great prostitute , the one sitting over many waters .
66017002	The kings of the earth sinned sexually with her , and the people of the earth became drunk from the wine of her sexual sin . ”
66017003	Then the angel carried me away by the Spirit to the desert . There I saw a woman sitting on a red beast . It was covered with names against God written on it , and it had seven heads and ten horns .
66017004	The woman was dressed in purple and red and was shining with the gold , precious jewels , and pearls she was wearing . She had a golden cup in her hand , a cup filled with evil things and the uncleanness of her sexual sin .
66017005	On her forehead a title was written that was secret . This is what was written : the great babylon mother of prostitutes and of the evil things of the earth
66017006	Then I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of God’s holy people and with the blood of those who were killed because of their faith in Jesus . When I saw the woman , I was very amazed .
66017007	Then the angel said to me , “ Why are you amazed ? I will tell you the secret of this woman and the beast she rides — the one with seven heads and ten horns .
66017008	The beast you saw was once alive but is not alive now . But soon it will come up out of the bottomless pit and go away to be destroyed . There are people who live on earth whose names have not been written in the book of life since the beginning of the world . They will be amazed when they see the beast , because he was once alive , is not alive now , but will come again .
66017009	“ You need a wise mind to understand this . The seven heads on the beast are seven mountains where the woman sits .
66017010	And they are seven kings . Five of the kings have already been destroyed , one of the kings lives now , and another has not yet come . When he comes , he must stay a short time .
66017011	The beast that was once alive , but is not alive now , is also an eighth king . He belongs to the first seven kings , and he will go away to be destroyed .
66017012	“ The ten horns you saw are ten kings who have not yet begun to rule , but they will receive power to rule with the beast for one hour .
66017013	All ten of these kings have the same purpose , and they will give their power and authority to the beast .
66017014	They will make war against the Lamb , but the Lamb will defeat them , because he is Lord of lords and King of kings . He will defeat them with his called , chosen , and faithful followers . ”
66017015	Then the angel said to me , “ The waters that you saw , where the prostitute sits , are peoples , races , nations , and languages .
66017016	The ten horns and the beast you saw will hate the prostitute . They will take everything she has and leave her naked . They will eat her body and burn her with fire .
66017017	God made the ten horns want to carry out his purpose by agreeing to give the beast their power to rule , until what God has said comes about .
66017018	The woman you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth . ”
66018001	After the vision of these things , I saw another angel coming down from heaven . This angel had great power , and his glory made the earth bright .
66018002	He shouted in a powerful voice : “ Ruined , ruined is the great city of Babylon ! She has become a home for demons and a prison for every evil spirit , and a prison for every unclean bird and unclean beast .
66018003	She has been ruined , because all the peoples of the earth have drunk the wine of the desire of her sexual sin . She has been ruined also because the kings of the earth have sinned sexually with her , and the merchants of the earth have grown rich from the great wealth of her luxury . ”
66018004	Then I heard another voice from heaven saying : “ Come out of that city , my people , so that you will not share in her sins , so that you will not receive the disasters that will come to her .
66018005	Her sins have piled up as high as the sky , and God has not forgotten the wrongs she has done .
66018006	Give that city the same as she gave to others . Pay her back twice as much as she did . Prepare wine for her that is twice as strong as the wine she prepared for others .
66018007	She gave herself much glory and rich living . Give her that much suffering and sadness . She says to herself , ‘ I am a queen sitting on my throne . I am not a widow ; I will never be sad . ’
66018008	So these disasters will come to her in one day : death , and crying , and great hunger , and she will be destroyed by fire , because the Lord God who judges her is powerful . ”
66018009	The kings of the earth who sinned sexually with her and shared her wealth will see the smoke from her burning . Then they will cry and be sad because of her death .
66018010	They will be afraid of her suffering and stand far away and say : “ Terrible ! How terrible for you , great city , powerful city of Babylon , because your punishment has come in one hour ! ”
66018011	And the merchants of the earth will cry and be sad about her , because now there is no one to buy their cargoes —
66018012	cargoes of gold , silver , jewels , pearls , fine linen , purple cloth , silk , red cloth ; all kinds of citron wood and all kinds of things made from ivory , expensive wood , bronze , iron , and marble ;
66018013	cinnamon , spice , incense , myrrh , frankincense , wine , olive oil , fine flour , wheat , cattle , sheep , horses , carriages , slaves , and human lives .
66018014	The merchants will say , “ Babylon , the good things you wanted are gone from you . All your rich and fancy things have disappeared . You will never have them again . ”
66018015	The merchants who became rich from selling to her will be afraid of her suffering and will stand far away . They will cry and be sad
66018016	and say : “ Terrible ! How terrible for the great city ! She was dressed in fine linen , purple and red cloth , and she was shining with gold , precious jewels , and pearls !
66018017	All these riches have been destroyed in one hour ! ” Every sea captain , every passenger , the sailors , and all those who earn their living from the sea stood far away from Babylon .
66018018	As they saw the smoke from her burning , they cried out loudly , “ There was never a city like this great city ! ”
66018019	And they threw dust on their heads and cried out , weeping and being sad . They said : “ Terrible ! How terrible for the great city ! All the people who had ships on the sea became rich because of her wealth ! But she has been destroyed in one hour !
66018020	Be happy because of this , heaven ! Be happy , God’s holy people and apostles and prophets ! God has punished her because of what she did to you . ”
66018021	Then a powerful angel picked up a large stone , like one used for grinding grain , and threw it into the sea . He said : “ In the same way , the great city of Babylon will be thrown down , and it will never be found again .
66018022	The music of people playing harps and other instruments , flutes , and trumpets , will never be heard in you again . No workman doing any job will ever be found in you again . The sound of grinding grain will never be heard in you again .
66018023	The light of a lamp will never shine in you again , and the voices of a bridegroom and bride will never be heard in you again . Your merchants were the world’s great people , and all the nations were tricked by your magic .
66018024	You are guilty of the death of the prophets and God’s holy people and all who have been killed on earth . ”
66019001	After this vision and announcement I heard what sounded like a great many people in heaven saying : “ Hallelujah ! Salvation , glory , and power belong to our God ,
66019002	because his judgments are true and right . He has punished the prostitute who made the earth evil with her sexual sin . He has paid her back for the death of his servants . ”
66019003	Again they said : “ Hallelujah ! She is burning , and her smoke will rise forever and ever . ”
66019004	Then the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures bowed down and worshiped God , who sits on the throne . They said : “ Amen , Hallelujah ! ”
66019005	Then a voice came from the throne , saying : “ Praise our God , all you who serve him and all you who honor him , both small and great ! ”
66019006	Then I heard what sounded like a great many people , like the noise of flooding water , and like the noise of loud thunder . The people were saying : “ Hallelujah ! Our Lord God , the Almighty , rules .
66019007	Let us rejoice and be happy and give God glory , because the wedding of the Lamb has come , and the Lamb’s bride has made herself ready .
66019008	Fine linen , bright and clean , was given to her to wear . ” ( The fine linen means the good things done by God’s holy people . )
66019009	And the angel said to me , “ Write this : Blessed are those who have been invited to the wedding meal of the Lamb ! ” And the angel said , “ These are the true words of God . ”
66019010	Then I bowed down at the angel’s feet to worship him , but he said to me , “ Do not worship me ! I am a servant like you and your brothers and sisters who have the message of Jesus . Worship God , because the message about Jesus is the spirit that gives all prophecy . ”
66019011	Then I saw heaven opened , and there before me was a white horse . The rider on the horse is called Faithful and True , and he is right when he judges and makes war .
66019012	His eyes are like burning fire , and on his head are many crowns . He has a name written on him , which no one but himself knows .
66019013	He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood , and his name is the Word of God .
66019014	The armies of heaven , dressed in fine linen , white and clean , were following him on white horses .
66019015	Out of the rider’s mouth comes a sharp sword that he will use to defeat the nations , and he will rule them with a rod of iron . He will crush out the wine in the winepress of the terrible anger of God the Almighty .
66019016	On his robe and on his upper leg was written this name : king of kings and lord of lords .
66019017	Then I saw an angel standing in the sun , and he called with a loud voice to all the birds flying in the sky : “ Come and gather together for the great feast of God
66019018	so that you can eat the bodies of kings , generals , mighty people , horses and their riders , and the bodies of all people — free , slave , small , and great . ”
66019019	Then I saw the beast and the kings of the earth . Their armies were gathered together to make war against the rider on the horse and his army .
66019020	But the beast was captured and with him the false prophet who did the miracles for the beast . The false prophet had used these miracles to trick those who had the mark of the beast and worshiped his idol . The false prophet and the beast were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur .
66019021	And their armies were killed with the sword that came out of the mouth of the rider on the horse , and all the birds ate the bodies until they were full .
66020001	I saw an angel coming down from heaven . He had the key to the bottomless pit and a large chain in his hand .
66020002	The angel grabbed the dragon , that old snake who is the devil and Satan , and tied him up for a thousand years .
66020003	Then he threw him into the bottomless pit , closed it , and locked it over him . The angel did this so he could not trick the people of the earth anymore until the thousand years were ended . After a thousand years he must be set free for a short time .
66020004	Then I saw some thrones and people sitting on them who had been given the power to judge . And I saw the souls of those who had been killed because they were faithful to the message of Jesus and the message from God . They had not worshiped the beast or his idol , and they had not received the mark of the beast on their foreheads or on their hands . They came back to life and ruled with Christ for a thousand years .
66020005	( The others that were dead did not live again until the thousand years were ended . ) This is the first raising of the dead .
66020006	Blessed and holy are those who share in this first raising of the dead . The second death has no power over them . They will be priests for God and for Christ and will rule with him for a thousand years .
66020007	When the thousand years are over , Satan will be set free from his prison .
66020008	Then he will go out to trick the nations in all the earth — Gog and Magog — to gather them for battle . There are so many people they will be like sand on the seashore .
66020009	And Satan’s army marched across the earth and gathered around the camp of God’s people and the city God loves . But fire came down from heaven and burned them up .
66020010	And Satan , who tricked them , was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur with the beast and the false prophet . There they will be punished day and night forever and ever .
66020011	Then I saw a great white throne and the One who was sitting on it . Earth and sky ran away from him and disappeared .
66020012	And I saw the dead , great and small , standing before the throne . Then books were opened , and the book of life was opened . The dead were judged by what they had done , which was written in the books .
66020013	The sea gave up the dead who were in it , and Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them . Each person was judged by what he had done .
66020014	And Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire . The lake of fire is the second death .
66020015	And anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire .
66021001	Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth . The first heaven and the first earth had disappeared , and there was no sea anymore .
66021002	And I saw the holy city , the new Jerusalem , coming down out of heaven from God . It was prepared like a bride dressed for her husband .
66021003	And I heard a loud voice from the throne , saying , “ Now God’s presence is with people , and he will live with them , and they will be his people . God himself will be with them and will be their God .
66021004	He will wipe away every tear from their eyes , and there will be no more death , sadness , crying , or pain , because all the old ways are gone . ”
66021005	The One who was sitting on the throne said , “ Look ! I am making everything new ! ” Then he said , “ Write this , because these words are true and can be trusted . ”
66021006	The One on the throne said to me , “ It is finished . I am the Alpha and the Omega , the Beginning and the End . I will give free water from the spring of the water of life to anyone who is thirsty .
66021007	Those who win the victory will receive this , and I will be their God , and they will be my children .
66021008	But cowards , those who refuse to believe , who do evil things , who kill , who sin sexually , who do evil magic , who worship idols , and who tell lies — all these will have a place in the lake of burning sulfur . This is the second death . ”
66021009	Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last troubles came to me , saying , “ Come with me , and I will show you the bride , the wife of the Lamb . ”
66021010	And the angel carried me away by the Spirit to a very large and high mountain . He showed me the holy city , Jerusalem , coming down out of heaven from God .
66021011	It was shining with the glory of God and was bright like a very expensive jewel , like a jasper , clear as crystal .
66021012	The city had a great high wall with twelve gates with twelve angels at the gates , and on each gate was written the name of one of the twelve tribes of Israel .
66021013	There were three gates on the east , three on the north , three on the south , and three on the west .
66021014	The walls of the city were built on twelve foundation stones , and on the stones were written the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb .
66021015	The angel who talked with me had a measuring rod made of gold to measure the city , its gates , and its wall .
66021016	The city was built in a square , and its length was equal to its width . The angel measured the city with the rod . The city was 1,500 miles long , 1,500 miles wide , and 1,500 miles high .
66021017	The angel also measured the wall . It was 216 feet high , by human measurements , which the angel was using .
66021018	The wall was made of jasper , and the city was made of pure gold , as pure as glass .
66021019	The foundation stones of the city walls were decorated with every kind of jewel . The first foundation was jasper , the second was sapphire , the third was chalcedony , the fourth was emerald ,
66021020	the fifth was onyx , the sixth was carnelian , the seventh was chrysolite , the eighth was beryl , the ninth was topaz , the tenth was chrysoprase , the eleventh was jacinth , and the twelfth was amethyst .
66021021	The twelve gates were twelve pearls , each gate having been made from a single pearl . And the street of the city was made of pure gold as clear as glass .
66021022	I did not see a temple in the city , because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the city’s temple .
66021023	The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it , because the glory of God is its light , and the Lamb is the city’s lamp .
66021024	By its light the people of the world will walk , and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it .
66021025	The city’s gates will never be shut on any day , because there is no night there .
66021026	The glory and the honor of the nations will be brought into it .
66021027	Nothing unclean and no one who does shameful things or tells lies will ever go into it . Only those whose names are written in the Lamb’s book of life will enter the city .
66022001	Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life . It was shining like crystal and was flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb
66022002	down the middle of the street of the city . The tree of life was on each side of the river . It produces fruit twelve times a year , once each month . The leaves of the tree are for the healing of all the nations .
66022003	Nothing that God judges guilty will be in that city . The throne of God and of the Lamb will be there , and God’s servants will worship him .
66022004	They will see his face , and his name will be written on their foreheads .
66022005	There will never be night again . They will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun , because the Lord God will give them light . And they will rule as kings forever and ever .
66022006	The angel said to me , “ These words can be trusted and are true . ” The Lord , the God of the spirits of the prophets , sent his angel to show his servants the things that must happen soon .
66022007	“ Listen ! I am coming soon ! Blessed is the one who obeys the words of prophecy in this book . ”
66022008	I , John , am the one who heard and saw these things . When I heard and saw them , I bowed down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed these things to me .
66022009	But the angel said to me , “ Do not worship me ! I am a servant like you , your brothers the prophets , and all those who obey the words in this book . Worship God ! ”
66022010	Then the angel told me , “ Do not keep secret the words of prophecy in this book , because the time is near for all this to happen .
66022011	Let whoever is doing evil continue to do evil . Let whoever is unclean continue to be unclean . Let whoever is doing right continue to do right . Let whoever is holy continue to be holy . ”
66022012	“ Listen ! I am coming soon ! I will bring my reward with me , and I will repay each one of you for what you have done .
66022013	I am the Alpha and the Omega , the First and the Last , the Beginning and the End .
66022014	“ Blessed are those who wash their robes so that they will receive the right to eat the fruit from the tree of life and may go through the gates into the city .
66022015	Outside the city are the evil people , those who do evil magic , who sin sexually , who murder , who worship idols , and who love lies and tell lies .
66022016	“ I , Jesus , have sent my angel to tell you these things for the churches . I am the descendant from the family of David , and I am the bright morning star . ”
66022017	The Spirit and the bride say , “ Come ! ” Let the one who hears this say , “ Come ! ” Let whoever is thirsty come ; whoever wishes may have the water of life as a free gift .
66022018	I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book : If anyone adds anything to these words , God will add to that person the disasters written about in this book .
66022019	And if anyone takes away from the words of this book of prophecy , God will take away that one’s share of the tree of life and of the holy city , which are written about in this book .
66022020	Jesus , the One who says these things are true , says , “ Yes , I am coming soon . ” Amen . Come , Lord Jesus !
66022021	The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all . Amen .
