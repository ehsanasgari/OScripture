40001001	The book of the genealogy of יהושע Messiah , Son of Dawiḏ , Son of Aḇraham :
40001002	Aḇraham brought forth Yitsḥaq , and Yitsḥaq brought forth Ya‛aqoḇ , and Ya‛aqoḇ brought forth Yehuḏah and his brothers .
40001003	And Yehuḏah brought forth Perets and Zeraḥ by Tamar , and Perets brought forth Ḥetsron , and Ḥetsron brought forth Ram .
40001004	And Ram brought forth Amminaḏaḇ , and Amminaḏaḇ brought forth Naḥshon , and Naḥshon brought forth Salmon .
40001005	And Salmon brought forth Bo‛az by Raḥaḇ , and Bo‛az brought forth Oḇĕḏ by Ruth , and Oḇĕḏ brought forth Yishai .
40001006	And Yishai brought forth Dawiḏ the sovereign , and Dawiḏ the sovereign brought forth Shelomoh by Uriyah’s wife .
40001007	And Shelomoh brought forth Reḥaḇ‛am , and Reḥaḇ‛am brought forth Aḇiyah , and Aḇiyah brought forth Asa .
40001008	And Asa brought forth Yehoshaphat , and Yehoshaphat brought forth Yoram , and Yoram brought forth Uzziyah .
40001009	And Uzziyah brought forth Yotham , and Yotham brought forth Aḥaz , and Aḥaz brought forth Ḥizqiyahu .
40001010	And Ḥizqiyahu brought forth Menashsheh , and Menashsheh brought forth Amon , and Amon brought forth Yoshiyahu .
40001011	And Yoshiyahu brought forth Yeḵonyah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Baḇel .
40001012	And after the exile to Baḇel , Yeḵonyah brought forth She’alti’ĕl , and She’alti’ĕl brought forth Zerubbaḇel .
40001013	And Zerubbaḇel brought forth Aḇihuḏ , and Aḇihuḏ brought forth Elyaqim , and Elyaqim brought forth Azor .
40001014	And Azor brought forth Tsaḏoq , and Tsaḏoq brought forth Aqim , and Aqim brought forth Elihuḏ .
40001015	And Elihuḏ brought forth El‛azar , and El‛azar brought forth Mattan , and Mattan brought forth Ya‛aqoḇ .
40001016	And Ya‛aqoḇ brought forth Yosĕph the husband of Miryam , of whom was born יהושע who is called Messiah .
40001017	So all the generations from Aḇraham to Dawiḏ were fourteen generations , and from Dawiḏ until the exile to Baḇel were fourteen generations , and from the exile to Baḇel until the Messiah were fourteen generations .
40001018	But the birth of יהושע Messiah was as follows : After His mother Miryam was engaged to Yosĕph , before they came together , she was found to be pregnant from the Set-apart Spirit .
40001019	And Yosĕph her husband , being righteous , and not wishing to make a show of her , had in mind to put her away secretly .
40001020	But while he thought about this , see , a messenger of יהוה appeared to him in a dream , saying , “ Yosĕph , son of Dawiḏ , do not be afraid to take Miryam as your wife , for that which is in her was brought forth from the Set-apart Spirit .
40001021	“ And she shall give birth to a Son , and you shall call His Name יהושע for He shall save His people from their sins . ”
40001022	And all this came to be in order to fill what was spoken by יהוה through the prophet , saying ,
40001023	“ See , a maiden shall conceive , and she shall give birth to a Son , and they shall call His Name Immanu’ĕl , ” which translated , means , “ Ěl with us . ”
40001024	And Yosĕph , awaking from his sleep , did as the messenger of יהוה commanded him and took his wife ,
40001025	but knew her not until she gave birth to her Son , the first-born . And he called His Name יהושע .
40002001	And יהושע having been born in Bĕyth Leḥem of Yehuḏah in the days of Herodes the sovereign , see , Magi from the East came to Yerushalayim ,
40002002	saying , “ Where is He who has been born Sovereign of the Yehuḏim ? For we saw His star in the East and have come to do reverence to Him . ”
40002003	And Herodes the sovereign , having heard , was troubled , and all Yerushalayim with him .
40002004	And having gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together , he asked them where the Messiah was to be born .
40002005	And they said to him , “ In Bĕyth Leḥem of Yehuḏah , for thus it has been written by the prophet ,
40002006	‘ But you , Bĕyth Leḥem , in the land of Yehuḏah , you are by no means least among the rulers of Yehuḏah , for out of you shall come a Ruler who shall shepherd My people Yisra’ĕl . ’ ”
40002007	Then Herodes , having called the Magi secretly , learned exactly from them what time the star appeared .
40002008	And having sent them to Bĕyth Leḥem , he said , “ Go and search diligently for the Child , and when you have found Him , bring back word to me , so that I too might go and do reverence to Him . ”
40002009	And having heard the sovereign , they went . And see , the star which they had seen in the East went before them , until it came and stood over where the Child was .
40002010	And seeing the star , they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy .
40002011	And coming into the house , they saw the Child with Miryam His mother , and fell down and did reverence to Him , and opening their treasures , they presented to Him gifts of gold , and frankincense , and myrrh .
40002012	And having been warned in a dream that they should not return to Herodes , they departed for their own country by another way .
40002013	And when they had left , see , a messenger of יהוה appeared to Yosĕph in a dream , saying , “ Arise , take the Child and His mother , and flee to Mitsrayim , and remain there until I bring you word , for Herodes is about to seek the Child to destroy Him . ”
40002014	And rising up , he took the Child and His mother by night and departed for Mitsrayim ,
40002015	and remained there until the death of Herodes , to fill what was spoken by יהוה through the prophet , saying , “ Out of Mitsrayim I have called My Son . ”
40002016	Then Herodes , having seen that he was fooled by the Magi , was greatly enraged , and he sent forth and slew all the male children in Bĕyth Leḥem and in all its borders , from two years old and under , according to the time which he had exactly learnt from the Magi .
40002017	Then was filled what was spoken by Yirmeyahu the prophet , saying ,
40002018	“ A voice was heard in Ramah , wailing and weeping , and great mourning – Raḥĕl weeping for her children , refusing to be comforted , because they were no more . ”
40002019	And Herodes having died , see , a messenger of יהוה appeared in a dream to Yosĕph in Mitsrayim ,
40002020	saying , “ Arise , and take the Child and His mother , and go into the land of Yisra’ĕl , for those seeking the life of the Child are dead . ”
40002021	And rising up , he took the Child and His mother , and came into the land of Yisra’ĕl .
40002022	But hearing that Archelaos was reigning over Yehuḏah instead of his father Herodes , he was afraid to go there . And having been warned in a dream , he departed to the parts of Galil ,
40002023	and came and dwelt in a city called Natsareth – thus to fill what was spoken by the prophets , “ He shall be called a Natsarene . ”
40003001	And in those days Yoḥanan the Immerser came proclaiming in the wilderness of Yehuḏah ,
40003002	and saying , “ Repent , for the reign of the heavens has come near ! ”
40003003	For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Yeshayahu , saying , “ A voice of one crying in the wilderness , ‘ Prepare the way of יהוה , make His paths straight . ’ ”
40003004	And Yoḥanan had a garment of camel’s hair , and a leather girdle around his waist . And his food was locusts and wild honey .
40003005	Then Yerushalayim , and all Yehuḏah , and all the country around the Yardĕn went out to him ,
40003006	and they were immersed by him in the Yardĕn , confessing their sins .
40003007	And seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his immersion , he said to them , “ Brood of adders ! Who has warned you to flee from the coming wrath ?
40003008	“ Bear , therefore , fruits worthy of repentance ,
40003009	and do not think to say to yourselves , ‘ We have Aḇraham as father . ’ For I say to you that Elohim is able to raise up children to Aḇraham from these stones .
40003010	“ And the axe is already laid to the root of the trees . Every tree , then , which does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire .
40003011	“ I indeed immerse you in water unto repentance , but He who is coming after me is mightier than I , whose sandals I am not worthy to bear . He shall immerse you in the Set-apart Spirit and fire .
40003012	“ His winnowing fork is in His hand , and He shall thoroughly cleanse His threshing-floor , and gather His wheat into the storehouse , but the chaff He shall burn with unquenchable fire . ”
40003013	Then יהושע came from Galil to Yoḥanan at the Yardĕn to be immersed by him .
40003014	But Yoḥanan was hindering Him , saying , “ I need to be immersed by You , and You come to me ? ”
40003015	But יהושע answering , said to him , “ Permit it now , for thus it is fitting for us to fill all righteousness . ” Then he permitted Him .
40003016	And having been immersed , יהושע went up immediately from the water , and see , the heavens were opened , and He saw the Spirit of Elohim descending like a dove and coming upon Him ,
40003017	and see , a voice out of the heavens , saying , “ This is My Son , the Beloved , in whom I did delight . ”
40004001	Then יהושע was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tried by the devil .
40004002	And after having fasted forty days and forty nights , He was hungry .
40004003	And the trier came and said to Him , “ If You are the Son of Elohim , command that these stones become bread . ”
40004004	But He answering , said , “ It has been written , ‘ Man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word that comes from the mouth of יהוה . ’ ”
40004005	Then the devil took Him up into the set-apart city , set Him on the edge of the Set-apart Place ,
40004006	and said to Him , “ If You are the Son of Elohim , throw Yourself down . For it has been written , ‘ He shall command His messengers concerning you , ’ and , ‘ In their hands they shall bear you up , so that you do not dash your foot against a stone . ’ ”
40004007	יהושע said to him , “ It has also been written , ‘ You shall not try יהוה your Elohim . ’ ”
40004008	Again , the devil took Him up on a very high mountain , and showed Him all the reigns of the world , and their esteem ,
40004009	and said to Him , “ All these I shall give You if You fall down and worship me . ”
40004010	Then יהושע said to him , “ Go , Satan ! For it has been written , ‘ You shall worship יהוה your Elohim , and Him alone you shall serve . ’ ”
40004011	Then the devil left Him , and see , messengers came and attended Him .
40004012	And יהושע , having heard that Yoḥanan had been put in prison , withdrew into Galil .
40004013	And leaving Natsareth , He came and dwelt in Kephar Naḥum , which is by the sea , in the borders of Zeḇulun and Naphtali ,
40004014	to fill what was spoken by Yeshayahu the prophet , saying ,
40004015	“ Land of Zeḇulun and land of Naphtali , the way of the sea , beyond the Yardĕn , Galil of the gentiles –
40004016	the people who sat in darkness saw a great light , and upon those who sat in the land and shadow of death , light arose to them . ”
40004017	From that time יהושע began to proclaim and to say , “ Repent , for the reign of the heavens has drawn near . ”
40004018	And יהושע , walking by the Sea of Galil , saw two brothers , Shim‛on called Kĕpha , and Andri his brother , casting a net into the sea , for they were fishermen .
40004019	And He said to them , “ Follow Me , and I shall make you fishers of men . ”
40004020	And immediately they left their nets and followed Him .
40004021	And going on from there , He saw two other brothers , Ya‛aqoḇ the son of Zaḇdai , and Yoḥanan his brother , in the boat with Zaḇdai their father , mending their nets . And He called them ,
40004022	and immediately they left the boat and their father , and followed Him .
40004023	And יהושע went about all Galil , teaching in their congregations , and proclaiming the Good News of the reign , and healing every disease and every bodily weakness among the people .
40004024	And news about Him went out into all Syria . And they brought to Him all who were sick , afflicted with various diseases and pains , and those who were demon-possessed , and epileptics , and paralytics . And He healed them .
40004025	And large crowds – from Galil , and Dekapolis , and Yerushalayim , and Yehuḏah , and beyond the Yardĕn – followed Him .
40005001	But when He saw the crowds , He went up on a mountain . And when He was seated His taught ones came to Him .
40005002	And having opened His mouth , He was teaching them , saying ,
40005003	“ Blessed are the poor in spirit , because theirs is the reign of the heavens .
40005004	“ Blessed are those who mourn , because they shall be comforted .
40005005	“ Blessed are the meek , because they shall inherit the earth .
40005006	“ Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness , because they shall be filled .
40005007	“ Blessed are the compassionate , because they shall obtain compassion .
40005008	“ Blessed are the clean in heart , because they shall see Elohim .
40005009	“ Blessed are the peacemakers , because they shall be called sons of Elohim .
40005010	“ Blessed are those persecuted for righteousness’ sake , because theirs is the reign of the heavens .
40005011	“ Blessed are you when they reproach and persecute you , and falsely say every wicked word against you , for My sake .
40005012	“ Rejoice and be glad , because your reward in the heavens is great . For in this way they persecuted the prophets who were before you .
40005013	“ You are the salt of the earth , but if the salt becomes tasteless , how shall it be seasoned ? For it is no longer of any use but to be thrown out and to be trodden down by men .
40005014	“ You are the light of the world . It is impossible for a city to be hidden on a mountain .
40005015	“ Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket , but on a lampstand , and it shines to all those in the house .
40005016	“ Let your light so shine before men , so that they see your good works and praise your Father who is in the heavens .
40005017	“ Do not think that I came to destroy the Torah or the Prophets . I did not come to destroy but to complete .
40005018	“ For truly , I say to you , till the heaven and the earth pass away , one jot or one tittle shall by no means pass from the Torah till all be done .
40005019	“ Whoever , then , breaks one of the least of these commands , and teaches men so , shall be called least in the reign of the heavens ; but whoever does and teaches them , he shall be called great in the reign of the heavens .
40005020	“ For I say to you , that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees , you shall by no means enter into the reign of the heavens .
40005021	“ You heard that it was said to those of old , ‘ You shall not murder , ’ and whoever murders shall be liable to judgment .
40005022	“ But I say to you that whoever is wroth with his brother without a cause shall be liable to judgment . And whoever says to his brother , ‘ Raka ! ’ shall be liable to the Sanhedrin . But whoever says , ‘ You fool ! ’ shall be liable to fire of Gehenna .
40005023	“ If , then , you bring your gift to the altar , and there remember that your brother holds whatever against you ,
40005024	leave your gift there before the altar , and go , first make peace with your brother , and then come and offer your gift .
40005025	“ Be well-minded with your opponent , promptly , while you are on the way with him , lest your opponent deliver you to the judge , and the judge to the officer , and you be thrown into prison .
40005026	“ Truly , I say to you , you shall by no means get out of there till you have paid the last penny .
40005027	“ You heard that it was said to those of old , ‘ You shall not commit adultery . ’
40005028	“ But I say to you that everyone looking at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart .
40005029	“ And if your right eye causes you to stumble , pluck it out and throw it away from you . For it is better for you that one of your members perish , than for your entire body to be thrown into Gehenna .
40005030	“ And if your right hand causes you to stumble , cut it off and throw it away from you . For it is better for you that one of your members perish , than for your entire body to be thrown into Gehenna .
40005031	“ And it has been said , ‘ Whoever puts away his wife , let him give her a certificate of divorce . ’
40005032	“ But I say to you that whoever puts away his wife , except for the matter of whoring , makes her commit adultery . And whoever marries a woman who has been put away commits adultery .
40005033	“ Again , you heard that it was said to those of old , ‘ You shall not swear falsely , but shall perform your oaths to יהוה . ’
40005034	“ But I say to you , do not swear at all , neither by the heaven , because it is Elohim’s throne ;
40005035	nor by the earth , for it is His footstool ; nor by Yerushalayim , for it is the city of the great Sovereign ;
40005036	nor swear by your head , because you are not able to make one hair white or black .
40005037	“ But let your word ‘ Yea’ be ‘ Yea , ’ and your ‘ No’ be ‘ No . ’ And what goes beyond these is from the wicked one .
40005038	“ You heard that it was said , ‘ An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth , ’
40005039	but I say to you , do not resist the wicked . But whoever slaps you on your right cheek , turn the other to him also .
40005040	“ And he who wishes to sue you and take away your inner garment , let him have your outer garment as well .
40005041	“ And whoever compels you to go one mile , go with him two .
40005042	“ Give to him who asks of you , and from him who wishes to borrow from you , do not turn away .
40005043	“ You heard that it was said , ‘ You shall love your neighbour and hate your enemy . ’
40005044	“ But I say to you , love your enemies , bless those cursing you , do good to those hating you , and pray for those insulting you and persecuting you ,
40005045	so that you become sons of your Father in the heavens . Because He makes His sun rise on the wicked and on the good , and sends rain on the righteous and on the unrighteous .
40005046	“ For if you love those loving you , what reward have you ? Are the tax collectors not doing the same too ?
40005047	“ And if you greet your brothers only , what do you do more than others ? Are the tax collectors not doing so too ?
40005048	“ Therefore , be perfect , as your Father in the heavens is perfect .
40006001	“ Beware of doing your kind deeds before men , in order to be seen by them . Otherwise you have no reward from your Father in the heavens .
40006002	“ Thus , when you do a kind deed , do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do , in the congregations and in the streets , to be praised by men . Truly , I say to you , they have their reward .
40006003	“ But when you do a kind deed , do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing ,
40006004	so that your kind deed shall be in secret . And your Father who sees in secret shall Himself reward you openly .
40006005	“ And when you pray , you shall not be like the hypocrites . For they love to pray standing in the congregations and on the corners of the streets , to be seen by men . Truly , I say to you , they have their reward .
40006006	“ But you , when you pray , go into your room , and having shut your door , pray to your Father who is in the secret place . And your Father who sees in secret shall reward you openly .
40006007	“ And when praying , do not keep on babbling like the gentiles . For they think that they shall be heard for their many words .
40006008	“ Therefore do not be like them , for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him .
40006009	“ This , then , is the way you should pray : ‘ Our Father who is in the heavens , let Your Name be set-apart ,
40006010	let Your reign come , let Your desire be done on earth as it is in heaven .
40006011	‘ Give us today our daily bread .
40006012	‘ And forgive us our debts , as we forgive our debtors .
40006013	‘ And do not lead us into trial , but deliver us from the wicked one – because Yours is the reign and the power and the esteem , forever . Amĕn . ’
40006014	“ For if you forgive men their trespasses , your heavenly Father shall also forgive you .
40006015	“ But if you do not forgive men their trespasses , neither shall your Father forgive your trespasses .
40006016	“ And when you fast , do not be sad-faced like the hypocrites . For they disfigure their faces so that they appear to be fasting to men . Truly , I say to you , they have their reward .
40006017	“ But you , when you fast , anoint your head and wash your face ,
40006018	so that you do not appear to men to be fasting , but to your Father who is in the secret place . And your Father who sees in secret shall reward you openly .
40006019	“ Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth , where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal ,
40006020	but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven , where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal .
40006021	“ For where your treasure is , there your heart shall be also .
40006022	“ The lamp of the body is the eye . If therefore your eye is good , all your body shall be enlightened .
40006023	“ But if your eye is evil , all your body shall be darkened . If , then , the light that is within you is darkness , how great is that darkness !
40006024	“ No one is able to serve two masters , for either he shall hate the one and love the other , or else he shall cleave to the one and despise the other . You are not able to serve Elohim and mammon .
40006025	“ Because of this I say to you , do not worry about your life , what you shall eat or drink , or about your body , what you shall put on . Is not life more than the food and the body more than the clothing ?
40006026	“ Look at the birds of the heaven , for they neither sow nor reap nor gather into storehouses , yet your heavenly Father does feed them . Are you not worth more than they ?
40006027	“ And which of you by worrying is able to add one cubit to his life’s span ?
40006028	“ So why do you worry about clothing ? Note well the lilies of the field , how they grow . They neither toil nor spin ,
40006029	and I say to you that even Shelomoh in all his esteem was not dressed like one of these .
40006030	“ But if Elohim so clothes the grass of the field , which exists today , and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace , how much more you , O you of little belief ?
40006031	“ Do not worry then , saying , ‘ What shall we eat ? ’ or ‘ What shall we drink ? ’ or ‘ What shall we wear ? ’
40006032	“ For all these the gentiles seek for . And your heavenly Father knows that you need all these .
40006033	“ But seek first the reign of Elohim , and His righteousness , and all these matters shall be added to you .
40006034	“ Do not , then , worry about tomorrow , for tomorrow shall have its own worries . Each day has enough evil of itself .
40007001	“ Do not judge , lest you be judged .
40007002	“ For with what judgment you judge , you shall be judged . And with the same measure you use , it shall be measured to you .
40007003	“ And why do you look at the splinter in your brother’s eye , but do not notice the plank in your own eye ?
40007004	“ Or how is it that you say to your brother , ‘ Let me remove the splinter out of your eye , ’ and see , a plank is in your own eye ?
40007005	“ Hypocrite ! First remove the plank from your own eye , and then you shall see clearly to remove the splinter out of your brother’s eye .
40007006	“ Do not give what is set-apart to the dogs , nor throw your pearls before the pigs , lest they trample them under their feet , and turn and tear you in pieces .
40007007	“ Ask and it shall be given to you , seek and you shall find , knock and it shall be opened to you .
40007008	“ For everyone who asks receives , and he who seeks finds , and to him who knocks it shall be opened .
40007009	“ Or is there a man among you who , if his son asks for bread , shall give him a stone ?
40007010	“ Or if he asks for a fish , shall he give him a snake ?
40007011	“ If you then , being wicked , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more shall your Father who is in the heavens give what is good to those who ask Him !
40007012	“ Therefore , whatever you wish men to do to you , do also to them , for this is the Torah and the Prophets .
40007013	“ Enter in through the narrow gate ! Because the gate is wide – and the way is broad – that leads to destruction , and there are many who enter in through it .
40007014	“ Because the gate is narrow and the way is hard pressed which leads to life , and there are few who find it .
40007015	“ But beware of the false prophets , who come to you in sheep’s clothing , but inwardly they are savage wolves .
40007016	“ By their fruits you shall know them . Are grapes gathered from thornbushes or figs from thistles ?
40007017	“ So every good tree yields good fruit , but a rotten tree yields wicked fruit .
40007018	“ A good tree is unable to yield wicked fruit , and a rotten tree to yield good fruit .
40007019	“ Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire .
40007020	“ So then , by their fruits you shall know them –
40007021	“ Not everyone who says to Me , ‘ Master , Master , ’ shall enter into the reign of the heavens , but he who is doing the desire of My Father in the heavens .
40007022	“ Many shall say to Me in that day , ‘ Master , Master , have we not prophesied in Your Name , and cast out demons in Your Name , and done many mighty works in Your Name ? ’
40007023	“ And then I shall declare to them , ‘ I never knew you , depart from Me , you who work lawlessness ! ’
40007024	“ Therefore everyone who hears these words of Mine , and does them , shall be like a wise man who built his house on the rock ,
40007025	and the rain came down , and the floods came , and the winds blew and beat on that house , and it did not fall , for it was founded on the rock .
40007026	“ And everyone who hears these words of Mine , and does not do them , shall be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand ,
40007027	and the rain came down , and the floods came , and the winds blew , and they beat on that house , and it fell , and great was its fall . ”
40007028	And it came to be , when יהושע had ended these words , that the people were astonished at His teaching ,
40007029	for He was teaching them as one possessing authority , and not as the scribes .
40008001	And when He came down from the mountain , large crowds followed Him .
40008002	And see , a leper came , and bowed before Him , saying , “ Master , if You desire , You are able to make me clean . ”
40008003	And stretching out His hand יהושע touched him , saying , “ I desire it . Be cleansed ! ” And immediately his leprosy was cleansed .
40008004	And יהושע said to him , “ See , mention it to no one . But go your way , show yourself to the priest , and offer the gift that Mosheh commanded , as a witness to them . ”
40008005	And when יהושע had entered Kephar Naḥum , a captain came to Him , appealing to Him ,
40008006	saying , “ Master , my servant is lying in the house paralysed , grievously tortured . ”
40008007	And יהושע said to him , “ I shall come and heal him . ”
40008008	And the captain answering , said , “ Master , I am not worthy that You should come under my roof . But only say a word , and my servant shall be healed .
40008009	“ For I too am a man under authority , having soldiers under me . And I say to this one , ‘ Go , ’ and he goes , and to another , ‘ Come , ’ and he comes , and to my servant , ‘ Do this , ’ and he does it . ”
40008010	And when יהושע heard , He marvelled , and said to those who followed , “ Truly , I say to you , not even in Yisra’ĕl have I found such great belief !
40008011	“ And I say to you that many shall come from east and west , and sit down with Aḇraham , and Yitsḥaq , and Ya‛aqoḇ in the reign of the heavens ,
40008012	but the sons of the reign shall be cast out into outer darkness – there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth . ”
40008013	And יהושע said to the captain , “ Go , and as you have believed , so let it be done for you . ” And his servant was healed that hour .
40008014	And when יהושע had come into the house of Kĕpha , He saw his wife’s mother lying sick with inflammation .
40008015	And He touched her hand , and the inflammation left her . And she arose and served them .
40008016	And when evening had come , they brought to Him many who were demon-possessed . And He cast out the spirits with a word , and healed all who were sick ,
40008017	that it might be filled what was spoken by Yeshayahu the prophet , saying , “ He Himself took our weaknesses and bore our sicknesses . ”
40008018	And when יהושע saw large crowds about Him , He gave a command to go off to the other side .
40008019	And a certain scribe , having come near , said to Him , “ Teacher , I shall follow You wherever You go . ”
40008020	And יהושע said to him , “ The foxes have holes and the birds of the heaven nests , but the Son of Aḏam has nowhere to lay His head . ”
40008021	And another of His taught ones said to Him , “ Master , first let me go and bury my father . ”
40008022	But יהושע said to him , “ Follow Me , and leave the dead to bury their own dead . ”
40008023	And when He entered into a boat , His taught ones followed Him .
40008024	And see , a great gale arose on the sea , so that the boat was covered by the waves . But He was sleeping .
40008025	And His taught ones came to Him and woke Him up , saying , “ Master , save us ! We are perishing ! ”
40008026	And He said to them , “ Why are you afraid , O you of little belief ? ” Then , having risen , He rebuked the winds and the sea . And there was a great calm .
40008027	And the men marvelled , saying , “ What is this , that even the winds and the sea obey Him ? ”
40008028	And when He came to the other side , to the country of the Girgashites , two demon-possessed ones met Him , coming out of the tombs , very fierce , so that no one was able to pass that way .
40008029	And see , they cried out , saying , “ What have we to do with You , יהושע , Son of Elohim ? Have You come here to torture us , before the appointed time ? ”
40008030	And at a distance from them there was a herd of many pigs feeding ,
40008031	and the demons begged Him , saying , “ If You cast us out , send us into the herd of pigs . ”
40008032	And He said to them , “ Go . ” And they , coming out , went into the herd of pigs . And see , the entire herd of pigs rushed down the steep place into the sea , and died in the water .
40008033	And the herdsmen fled , and went away into the city and reported all this , and about those possessed by demons .
40008034	And see , all the city came out to meet יהושע . And when they saw Him , they begged Him to leave their borders .
40010001	And having called His twelve taught ones near , He gave them authority over unclean spirits , to cast them out , and to heal every disease and every bodily weakness .
40010002	And these are the names of the twelve emissaries : first , Shim‛on , who is called Kĕpha , and Andri his brother ; Ya‛aqoḇ the son of Zaḇdai , and Yoḥanan his brother ;
40010003	Philip and Bartholomi ; T’oma and Mattithyahu the tax collector ; Ya‛aqoḇ the son of Alphai , and Laḇai whose last name was Taddai ;
40010004	Shim‛on the Kena‛anite , and Yehuḏah from Qerioth , who did also deliver Him up .
40010005	יהושע sent these twelve out , having commanded them , saying , “ Do not go into the way of the gentiles , and do not enter a city of the Shomeronites ,
40010006	but rather go to the lost sheep of the house of Yisra’ĕl .
40010007	“ And as you go , proclaim , saying , ‘ The reign of the heavens has drawn near . ’
40010008	“ Heal the sick , cleanse the lepers , raise the dead , cast out demons . You have received without paying , give without being paid .
40010009	“ Do not acquire gold or silver or copper for your moneybelts ,
40010010	or a bag for the journey , or two undergarments , or sandals , or staffs , for the worker is worthy of his food .
40010011	“ And into whatever city or village you enter , ask who is worthy in it , and stay there until you leave .
40010012	“ And as you enter into a house , greet it .
40010013	“ And if the house is worthy , let your peace come upon it . But if it is not worthy , let your peace return to you .
40010014	“ And whoever does not receive you nor hear your words , when you leave that house or city , shake off the dust from your feet .
40010015	“ Truly , I say to you , it shall be more bearable for the land of Seḏom and Amorah in the day of judgment than for that city !
40010016	“ See , I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves . Therefore be wise as serpents and innocent as doves .
40010017	“ But beware of men , for they shall deliver you up to sanhedrins and flog you in their congregations .
40010018	“ And you shall be brought before governors and sovereigns for My sake , as a witness to them and to the gentiles .
40010019	“ But when they deliver you up , do not worry about how or what you should speak . For it shall be given to you in that hour what you shall speak ,
40010020	for it is not you who speak , but the Spirit of your Father speaking in you .
40010021	“ And brother shall deliver up brother to death , and a father his child . And children shall rise up against parents and shall put them to death .
40010022	“ And you shall be hated by all for My Name’s sake . But he who shall have endured to the end shall be saved .
40010023	“ And when they persecute you in this city , flee to another . For truly , I say to you , you shall by no means have gone through the cities of Yisra’ĕl before the Son of Aḏam comes .
40010024	“ A taught one is not above his teacher , nor a servant above his master .
40010025	“ It is enough for the taught one to become like his teacher , and a servant like his master . If they have called the master of the house Be‛elzebul , how much more those of his household !
40010026	“ Therefore do not fear them . For whatever is covered shall be revealed , and whatever is hidden shall be made known .
40010027	“ What I say to you in the dark , speak in the light . And what you hear in the ear , proclaim on the house-tops .
40010028	“ And do not fear those who kill the body but are unable to kill the being . But rather fear Him who is able to destroy both being and body in Gehenna .
40010029	“ Are not two sparrows sold for a copper coin ? And not one of them falls to the ground without your Father .
40010030	“ And even the hairs of your head are all numbered .
40010031	“ So do not fear , you are worth more than many sparrows .
40010032	“ Everyone , therefore , who shall confess Me before men , him I shall also confess before My Father who is in the heavens .
40010033	“ But whoever shall deny Me before men , him I shall also deny before My Father who is in the heavens .
40010034	“ Do not think that I have come to bring peace on earth . I did not come to bring peace but a sword ,
40010035	for I have come to bring division , a man against his father , a daughter against her mother , and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law –
40010036	and a man’s enemies are those of his own household .
40010037	“ He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me , and he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me .
40010038	“ And he who does not take up his stake and follow after Me is not worthy of Me .
40010039	“ He who has found his life shall lose it , and he that has lost his life for My sake shall find it .
40010040	“ He who receives you receives Me , and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me .
40010041	“ He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward . And he who receives a righteous one in the name of a righteous one shall receive a righteous one’s reward .
40010042	“ And whoever gives one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a taught one , truly , I say to you , he shall by no means lose his reward . ”
40011001	And it came to be , when יהושע ended instructing His twelve taught ones , that He set out from there to teach and to proclaim in their cities .
40011002	And when Yoḥanan had heard in the prison of the works of Messiah , he sent two of his taught ones
40011003	and said to Him , “ Are You the Coming One , or do we look for another ? ”
40011004	And יהושע answering , said to them , “ Go , report to Yoḥanan what you hear and see :
40011005	“ Blind receive sight and lame walk , lepers are cleansed and deaf hear , dead are raised up and poor are brought the Good News .
40011006	“ And blessed is he who does not stumble in Me . ”
40011007	And as these were going , יהושע began to say to the crowds concerning Yoḥanan , “ What did you go out into the wilderness to see ? A reed shaken by the wind ?
40011008	“ But what did you go out to see ? A man dressed in soft garments ? Look , those wearing soft garments are in the houses of sovereigns .
40011009	“ But what did you go out to see ? A prophet ? Yea , I say to you , and more than a prophet .
40011010	“ For this is he of whom it was written , ‘ See , I send My messenger before Your face , who shall prepare Your way before You . ’
40011011	“ Truly , I say to you , among those born of women there has not risen one greater than Yoḥanan the Immerser , yet the least one in the reign of the heavens is greater than he .
40011012	“ And from the days of Yoḥanan the Immerser till now the reign of the heavens is violated , and the violent seize it .
40011013	“ For all the prophets and the Torah prophesied till Yoḥanan .
40011014	“ And if you wish to accept it , he is Ěliyahu who was about to come .
40011015	“ He who has ears to hear , let him hear !
40011016	“ And to what shall I compare this generation ? It is like children sitting in the market-places and calling to their companions ,
40011017	and saying , ‘ We played the flute for you , and you did not dance ; we lamented to you , and you did not beat the breast . ’
40011018	“ For Yoḥanan came neither eating nor drinking , and they say , ‘ He has a demon . ’
40011019	“ The Son of Aḏam came eating and drinking , and they say , ‘ See , a man , a glutton and a winedrinker , a friend of tax collectors and sinners ! ’ And wisdom was declared right by her works . ”
40011020	Then He began to reproach the cities in which most of His miracles had been done , because they did not repent :
40011021	“ Woe to you , Korazin ! Woe to you , Bĕyth Tsaiḏa ! Because if the miracles which were done in you had been done in Tsor and Tsiḏon , they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes .
40011022	“ But I say to you , it shall be more bearable for Tsor and Tsiḏon in the day of judgment than for you .
40011023	“ And you , Kephar Naḥum , who were exalted to the heaven , shall be brought down to the grave ! Because if the miracles which were done in you had been done in Seḏom , it would have remained until this day .
40011024	“ But I say to you that it shall be more bearable for the land of Seḏom in the day of judgment than for you . ”
40011025	At that time יהושע responding , said , “ I thank You , Father , Master of the heavens and earth , because You have hidden these matters from clever and learned ones and have revealed them to babes .
40011026	“ Yea , Father , because so it was well-pleasing in Your sight .
40011027	“ All have been handed over to Me by My Father , and no one knows the Son except the Father . Nor does anyone know the Father except the Son , and he to whom the Son wishes to reveal Him .
40011028	“ Come to Me , all you who labour and are burdened , and I shall give you rest .
40011029	“ Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me , for I am meek and humble in heart , and you shall find rest for your beings .
40011030	“ For My yoke is gentle and My burden is light . ”
40012001	At that time יהושע went through the grain fields on the Sabbath . And His taught ones were hungry , and began to pluck heads of grain , to eat .
40012002	And when the Pharisees saw it , they said to Him , “ Look , Your taught ones are doing what is not right to do on the Sabbath ! ”
40012003	But He said to them , “ Have you not read what Dawiḏ did when he was hungry , he and those who were with him :
40012004	how he went into the House of Elohim and ate the showbread which was not right for him to eat , nor for those who were with him , but only for the priests ?
40012005	“ Or did you not read in the Torah that on the Sabbath the priests in the Set-apart Place profane the Sabbath , and are blameless ?
40012006	“ But I say to you that in this place there is One greater than the Set-apart Place .
40012007	“ And if you had known what this means , ‘ I desire compassion and not offering , ’ you would not have condemned the blameless .
40012008	“ For the Son of Aḏam is Master of the Sabbath . ”
40012009	And having left there , He went into their congregation .
40012010	And see , there was a man having a withered hand . And they asked Him , saying , “ Is it right to heal on the Sabbath ? ” – so as to accuse Him .
40012011	And He said to them , “ What man is there among you who has one sheep , and if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath , shall not take hold of it and lift it out ?
40012012	“ How much more worth is a man than a sheep ! So it is right to do good on the Sabbath . ”
40012013	Then He said to the man , “ Stretch out your hand . ” And he stretched it out , and it was restored , as healthy as the other .
40012014	But the Pharisees went out and took counsel against Him , so as to destroy Him .
40012015	But יהושע , knowing it , withdrew from there . And large crowds followed Him , and He healed them all ,
40012016	and warned them not to make Him known ,
40012017	in order that what was spoken by Yeshayahu the prophet , might be filled , saying ,
40012018	“ See , My Servant whom I have chosen , My Beloved in whom My being did delight . I shall put My Spirit upon Him , and He shall declare right-ruling to the nations .
40012019	“ He shall not strive nor cry out , nor shall anyone hear His voice in the streets .
40012020	“ A crushed reed He shall not break , and smoking flax He shall not quench , till He brings forth right-ruling forever .
40012021	“ And the nations shall trust in His Name . ”
40012022	Then they brought to Him one who was demon-possessed , blind and dumb . And He healed him , so that the blind and dumb man both spoke and saw .
40012023	And all the crowds were amazed and said , “ Is this the Son of Dawiḏ ? ”
40012024	But when the Pharisees heard it they said , “ This one does not cast out demons except by Be‛elzebul , the ruler of the demons . ”
40012025	And יהושע knew their thoughts , and said to them , “ Every reign divided against itself is laid waste , and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand .
40012026	“ And if Satan casts out Satan , he is divided against himself . How then does his reign stand ?
40012027	“ And if I , by Be‛elzebul , do cast out demons , by whom do your sons cast them out ? Because of this they shall be your judges .
40012028	“ But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of Elohim , then the reign of Elohim has come upon you .
40012029	“ Or how is one able to enter a strong man’s house and plunder his goods , unless he first binds the strong man ? And then he shall plunder his house .
40012030	“ He who is not with Me is against Me , and he who does not gather with Me scatters abroad .
40012031	“ Because of this I say to you , all sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven men , but the blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven men .
40012032	“ And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Aḏam , it shall be forgiven him , but whoever speaks against the Set-apart Spirit , it shall not be forgiven him , either in this age or in the age to come .
40012033	“ Either make the tree good and its fruit good , or else make the tree rotten and its fruit rotten , for a tree is known by its fruit .
40012034	“ Brood of adders ! How are you able to speak what is good – being wicked ? For the mouth speaks from the overflow of the heart .
40012035	“ The good man brings forth what is good from the good treasures of his heart , and the wicked man brings forth what is wicked from the wicked treasure .
40012036	“ And I say to you that for every idle word men speak , they shall give an account of it in the day of judgment .
40012037	“ For by your words you shall be declared righteous , and by your words you shall be declared unrighteous . ”
40012038	Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered , saying , “ Teacher , we wish to see a sign from You . ”
40012039	But He answering , said to them , “ A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign , and no sign shall be given to it except the sign of the prophet Yonah .
40012040	“ For as Yonah was three days and three nights in the stomach of the great fish , so shall the Son of Aḏam be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth .
40012041	“ Men of Ninewĕh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it , because they repented at the preaching of Yonah , and look , a greater than Yonah is here .
40012042	“ The sovereigness of the South shall rise up in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it , for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Shelomoh , and look , a greater than Shelomoh is here .
40012043	“ Now when the unclean spirit goes out of a man , he goes through dry places , seeking rest , and finds none .
40012044	“ Then it says , ‘ I shall return to my house from which I came . ’ And when it comes , it finds it empty , swept , and decorated .
40012045	“ Then it goes and takes with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself , and they enter and dwell there . And the last of that man is worse than the first . So shall it also be with this wicked generation . ”
40012046	And while He was still talking to the crowds , see , His mother and brothers stood outside , seeking to speak with Him .
40012047	And one said to Him , “ See , Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside , seeking to speak with You . ”
40012048	But He answering , said to the one who spoke to Him , “ Who is My mother and who are My brothers ? ”
40012049	And having stretched out His hand toward His taught ones , He said , “ See My mother and My brothers !
40012050	“ For whoever does the desire of My Father who is in the heavens is My brother and sister and mother . ”
40013001	And on that day יהושע went out of the house and sat by the sea .
40013002	And large crowds were gathered together to Him , so that He went into a boat and sat down . And all the crowd stood on the beach .
40013003	And He spoke to them much in parables , saying , “ See , the sower went out to sow .
40013004	“ And as he sowed , some indeed fell by the wayside , and the birds came and devoured them .
40013005	“ And others fell on rocky places , where they did not have much soil , and immediately they sprang up , because they had no depth of soil .
40013006	“ But when the sun was up they were scorched , and because they had no root they withered .
40013007	“ And others fell among thorns , and the thorns came up and choked them .
40013008	“ And others fell on good soil and yielded a crop , some a hundredfold , some sixty , some thirty .
40013009	“ He who has ears to hear , let him hear ! ”
40013010	And the taught ones came and said to Him , “ Why do You speak to them in parables ? ”
40013011	And He answering , said to them , “ Because it has been given to you to know the secrets of the reign of the heavens , but to them it has not been given .
40013012	“ For whoever possesses , to him more shall be given , and he shall have overflowingly ; but whoever does not possess , even what he possesses shall be taken away from him .
40013013	“ Because of this I speak to them in parables , because seeing they do not see , and hearing they do not hear , nor do they understand .
40013014	“ And in them the prophecy of Yeshayahu is completely filled , which says , ‘ Hearing you shall hear and by no means understand , and seeing you shall see and by no means perceive ,
40013015	for the heart of this people has become thickened , and their ears are hard of hearing , and their eyes they have closed , lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears , lest they should understand with their heart , and turn back , and I heal them . ’
40013016	“ And blessed are your eyes because they see , and your ears because they hear ,
40013017	for truly I say to you , that many prophets and righteous ones longed to see what you see , and did not see it , and to hear what you hear , and did not hear it .
40013018	“ You , then , hear the parable of the sower :
40013019	“ When anyone hears the word of the reign , and does not understand it , then the wicked one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart . This is that sown by the wayside .
40013020	“ And that sown on rocky places , this is he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy ,
40013021	yet he has no root in himself , but is short-lived , and when pressure or persecution arises because of the word , immediately he stumbles .
40013022	“ And that sown among the thorns is he who hears the word , and the worry of this age and the deceit of riches choke the word , and it becomes fruitless .
40013023	“ And that sown on the good soil is he who hears the word and understands it , who indeed bears fruit and yields – some a hundredfold , some sixty , some thirty . ”
40013024	Another parable He put before them , saying , “ The reign of the heavens has become like a man who sowed good seed in his field ,
40013025	but while men slept , his enemy came and sowed darnel among the wheat and went away .
40013026	“ And when the blade sprouted and bore fruit , then the darnel also appeared .
40013027	“ And the servants of the master of the house came and said to him , ‘ Master , did you not sow good seed in your field ? From where then does it have the darnel ? ’
40013028	“ And he said to them , ‘ A man , an enemy did this . ’ And the servants said to him , ‘ Do you wish then , that we go and gather them up ? ’
40013029	“ But he said , ‘ No , lest while you gather up the darnel you also uproot the wheat with them .
40013030	‘ Let both grow together until the harvest , and at the time of harvest I shall say to the reapers , “ First gather the darnel and bind them in bundles to burn them , but gather the wheat into my granary . ” ’ ”
40013031	Another parable He put before them , saying , “ The reign of the heavens is like a mustard seed , which a man took and sowed in his field ,
40013032	which indeed is less than all the seeds , but when it is grown it is greater than the plants and becomes a tree , so that the birds of the heaven come and dwell in its branches . ”
40013033	Another parable He spoke to them , “ The reign of the heavens is like leaven , which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until all was leavened . ”
40013034	יהושע said all this to the crowds in parables , and He did not speak to them without a parable ,
40013035	so that what was spoken by the prophet might be filled , saying , “ I shall open My mouth in parables , I shall pour forth what has been hidden from the foundation of the world . ”
40013036	Then , having sent the crowds away , יהושע went into the house . And His taught ones came to Him , saying , “ Explain to us the parable of the darnel of the field . ”
40013037	And He answering , said to them , “ He who is sowing the good seed is the Son of Aḏam ,
40013038	and the field is the world . And the good seed , these are the sons of the reign , but the darnel are the sons of the wicked one ,
40013039	and the enemy who sowed them is the devil . And the harvest is the end of the age , and the reapers are the messengers .
40013040	“ As the darnel , then , is gathered and burned in the fire , so it shall be at the end of this age .
40013041	“ The Son of Aḏam shall send out His messengers , and they shall gather out of His reign all the stumbling-blocks , and those doing lawlessness ,
40013042	and shall throw them into the furnace of fire – there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth .
40013043	“ Then the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the reign of their Father . He who has ears to hear , let him hear !
40013044	“ Again , the reign of the heavens is like treasure hidden in a field , which a man having found it , hid , and for joy over it he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field .
40013045	“ Again , the reign of the heavens is like a man , a merchant , seeking fine pearls ,
40013046	who , when he had found one pearl of great price , went and sold all that he had and bought it .
40013047	“ Again , the reign of the heavens is like a dragnet that was thrown into the sea and gathered some of every kind ,
40013048	which , when it was filled , they drew to shore . And they sat down and gathered the good into containers , but threw the rotten away .
40013049	“ Thus shall it be at the end of the age : the messengers shall come forth , and separate the wicked out of the midst of the righteous ,
40013050	and shall throw them into the furnace of fire – there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth . ”
40013051	יהושע said to them , “ Have you understood all this ? ” They said to Him , “ Yea , Master . ”
40013052	And He said to them , “ Therefore every scholar of Scripture taught in the reign of the heavens is like a householder who brings out of his treasure matters , renewed , and old . ”
40013053	And it came to be , when יהושע had ended these parables , that He left there .
40013054	And when He had come to His own country , He taught them in their congregation , so that they were astonished and said , “ Where did this One get this wisdom and miracles ?
40013055	“ Is this not the son of the carpenter ? Is not His mother called Miryam ? And His brothers Ya‛aqoḇ and Yosĕph and Shim‛on and Yehuḏah ?
40013056	“ And His sisters , are they not all with us ? Where then did this One get all this ? ”
40013057	And they stumbled at Him . But יהושע said to them , “ A prophet is not unappreciated except in his own country and in his own house . ”
40013058	And He did not do many miracles there because of their unbelief .
40014001	At that time Herodes the district ruler heard the report about יהושע ,
40014002	and said to his servants , “ This is Yoḥanan the Immerser . He has risen from the dead , and that is why these mighty powers are at work in him . ”
40014003	For Herodes had arrested Yoḥanan , bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias , his brother Philip’s wife ,
40014004	for Yoḥanan had said to him , “ It is not right for you to have her . ”
40014005	And wishing to kill him , he feared the crowd , because they held him as a prophet .
40014006	But as Herodes’ birthday was being held , the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herodes ,
40014007	so he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked .
40014008	And she , being urged on by her mother , said , “ Give me here the head of Yoḥanan the Immerser on a dish . ”
40014009	And the sovereign was sad , but because of the oaths and the guests he commanded it to be given ,
40014010	and sent and beheaded Yoḥanan in prison .
40014011	And his head was brought on a dish and given to the girl , and she brought it to her mother .
40014012	And his taught ones came and took away the body and buried it , and went and reported to יהושע .
40014013	Now when יהושע heard it , He withdrew from there by boat to a deserted place , by Himself . And when the crowds heard it , they followed Him on foot from the cities .
40014014	And when יהושע came out , He saw a large crowd and was moved with compassion for them , and healed their sick .
40014015	And when evening came , His taught ones came to Him , saying , “ This is a deserted place , and the hour is already late . Dismiss the crowds , so that they might go into the villages and buy food for themselves . ”
40014016	But יהושע said to them , “ They do not need to go away , give them to eat yourselves . ”
40014017	And they said to Him , “ We have here only five loaves and two fish . ”
40014018	And He said , “ Bring them here to Me . ”
40014019	And commanding the crowds to sit down on the grass , and taking the five loaves and the two fish , and looking up to the heaven , He blessed and broke and gave the loaves to the taught ones . And the taught ones gave to the crowds ,
40014020	and all ate and were satisfied . And they picked up the pieces left over – twelve baskets , filled .
40014021	And those who ate were about five thousand men , besides women and children .
40014022	And immediately יהושע made His taught ones enter into the boat and go before Him to the other side , while He dismissed the crowds .
40014023	And having dismissed the crowds , He went up to the mountain by Himself to pray . And when evening had come , He was alone there .
40014024	But the boat was now in the middle of the sea , agitated by the waves , for the wind was against it .
40014025	And in the fourth watch of the night יהושע went to them , walking on the sea .
40014026	And when the taught ones saw Him walking on the sea , they were troubled , saying , “ It is a phantom ! ” And from fear they cried .
40014027	But immediately יהושע spoke to them , saying , “ Take courage , it is I , do not be afraid . ”
40014028	And Kĕpha answered Him and said , “ Master , if it is You , command me to come to You on the water . ”
40014029	And He said , “ Come . ” And when Kĕpha had come down out of the boat , he walked on the water to go to יהושע .
40014030	But when he saw that the wind was strong , he was afraid . And beginning to sink , he cried out , saying , “ Master , save me ! ”
40014031	And immediately יהושע stretched out His hand and took hold of him , and said to him , “ O you of little belief , why did you doubt ? ”
40014032	And when they came into the boat , the wind ceased .
40014033	And those in the boat came and did bow to Him , saying , “ Truly You are the Son of Elohim . ”
40014034	And having passed over , they came to the land of Gennĕsar .
40014035	And when the men of that place recognised Him , they sent out into all that surrounding country , and brought to Him all who were sick ,
40014036	and begged Him to let them only touch the tzitzit of His garment . And as many as touched it were completely healed .
40015001	Then there came to יהושע scribes and Pharisees from Yerushalayim , saying ,
40015002	“ Why do Your taught ones transgress the tradition of the elders ? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread . ”
40015003	But He answering , said to them , “ Why do you also transgress the command of Elohim because of your tradition ?
40015004	“ For Elohim has commanded , saying , ‘ Respect your father and your mother , ’ and , ‘ He who curses father or mother , let him be put to death . ’
40015005	“ But you say , ‘ Whoever says to his father or mother , “ Whatever profit you might have received from me has been dedicated , ”
40015006	is certainly released from respecting his father or mother . ’ So you have nullified the command of Elohim by your tradition .
40015007	“ Hypocrites ! Yeshayahu rightly prophesied about you , saying ,
40015008	‘ This people draw near to Me with their mouth , and respect Me with their lips , but their heart is far from Me .
40015009	‘ But in vain do they worship Me , teaching as teachings the commands of men . ’ ”
40015010	And calling the crowd near , He said to them , “ Hear and understand :
40015011	“ Not that which goes into the mouth defiles the man , but that which comes out of the mouth , this defiles the man . ”
40015012	Then His taught ones came and said to Him , “ Do You know that the Pharisees stumbled when they heard this word ? ”
40015013	But He answering , said , “ Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted shall be uprooted .
40015014	“ Leave them alone . They are blind leaders of the blind . And if the blind leads the blind , both shall fall into a ditch . ”
40015015	And Kĕpha answering , said to Him , “ Explain this parable to us . ”
40015016	And יהושע said , “ Are you also still without understanding ?
40015017	“ Do you not understand that whatever enters into the mouth goes into the stomach , and is cast out in the sewer ?
40015018	“ But what comes out of the mouth comes from the heart , and these defile the man .
40015019	“ For out of the heart come forth wicked reasonings , murders , adulteries , whorings , thefts , false witnessings , slanders .
40015020	“ These defile the man , but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile the man . ”
40015021	And יהושע went out from there and withdrew to the parts of Tsor and Tsiḏon .
40015022	And see , a woman of Kena‛an came from those borders and cried out to Him , saying , “ Have compassion on me , O Master , Son of Dawiḏ ! My daughter is badly demon-possessed . ”
40015023	But He did not answer her a word . And His taught ones came and asked Him , saying , “ Send her away , because she cries after us . ”
40015024	And He answering , said , “ I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Yisra’ĕl . ”
40015025	But she came and was bowing to Him , saying , “ Master , help me ! ”
40015026	And He answering , said , “ It is not good to take the children’s bread and throw it to the little dogs . ”
40015027	But she said , “ Yea Master , for even the little dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table . ”
40015028	And יהושע answering , said to her , “ O woman , your belief is great ! Let it be to you as you desire . ” And her daughter was healed from that hour .
40015029	And moving from there , יהושע came toward the Sea of Galil , and going up on the mountain , He was sitting there .
40015030	And large crowds came to Him , having with them those who were lame , blind , dumb , crippled , and many others . And they laid them down at the feet of יהושע , and He healed them ,
40015031	so that the crowd marvelled when they saw the dumb speaking , the crippled well , the lame walking , and the blind seeing . And they praised the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl .
40015032	And יהושע , having called His taught ones near , said , “ I have compassion on the crowd , because they have now continued with Me three days and do not have whatever to eat . And I do not wish to send them away hungry , lest they faint on the way . ”
40015033	And His taught ones said to Him , “ Where are we to get enough bread in the desert to satisfy such a large crowd ? ”
40015034	And יהושע said to them , “ How many loaves do you have ? ” And they said , “ Seven , and a few little fish . ”
40015035	And He commanded the crowd to sit down on the ground ,
40015036	and taking the seven loaves and the fish , giving thanks , He broke them and gave to His taught ones , and the taught ones to the crowd .
40015037	And all ate and were satisfied , and they picked up what was left over of the broken pieces – seven large baskets , filled .
40015038	And those who ate were four thousand men , besides women and children .
40015039	And dismissing the crowd , He went into the boat , and came to the borders of Mag̅dala .
40016001	And the Pharisees and Sadducees came , and trying Him asked that He would show them a sign from heaven .
40016002	And He answering , said to them , “ When it is evening you say , ‘ Fair weather , for the heaven is red , ’
40016003	and in the morning , ‘ Stormy weather today , for the heaven is red and overcast . ’ You know how to discern the face of the heaven , but you are unable to discern the signs of the times !
40016004	“ A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign , and no sign shall be given to it except the sign of the prophet Yonah . ” And He left them and went away .
40016005	And His taught ones came to the other side , and had forgotten to take bread .
40016006	And יהושע said to them , “ Mind ! And beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees . ”
40016007	And they reasoned among themselves , saying , “ Because we brought no bread ! ”
40016008	But יהושע , aware of this , said to them , “ O you of little belief , why do you reason among yourselves because you brought no bread ?
40016009	“ Do you still not understand , neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand and how many baskets you picked up ?
40016010	“ Or the seven loaves of the four thousand and how many large baskets you picked up ?
40016011	“ How is it that you do not understand that I did not speak to you concerning bread , but to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees ? ”
40016012	Then they understood that He did not say to beware of the leaven of bread , but of the teaching of the Pharisees and the Sadducees .
40016013	Now when יהושע came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi , He asked His taught ones , saying , “ Who do men say the Son of Aḏam is ? ”
40016014	And they said , “ Some say Yoḥanan the Immerser , and others Ěliyahu , and others Yirmeyahu or one of the prophets . ”
40016015	He said to them , “ And you , who do you say I am ? ”
40016016	And Shim‛on Kĕpha answering , said , “ You are the Messiah , the Son of the living Elohim . ”
40016017	And יהושע answering , said to him , “ Blessed are you , Shim‛on Bar-Yonah , for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you , but My Father in the heavens .
40016018	“ And I also say to you that you are Kĕpha , and on this rock I shall build My assembly , and the gates of the grave shall not overcome it .
40016019	“ And I shall give you the keys of the reign of the heavens , and whatever you bind on earth shall be having been bound in the heavens , and whatever you loosen on earth shall be having been loosened in the heavens . ”
40016020	Then He warned His taught ones that they should say to no one that He is יהושע the Messiah .
40016021	From that time יהושע began to show to His taught ones that it was necessary for Him to go to Yerushalayim , and to suffer much from the elders and chief priests and scribes , and be killed , and to be raised again the third day .
40016022	And Kĕpha took Him aside and began to rebuke Him , saying , “ Be kind to Yourself , Master , this shall not be to You ! ”
40016023	But He turned and said to Kĕpha , “ Get behind Me , Satan ! You are a stumbling-block to Me , for your thoughts are not those of Elohim , but those of men . ”
40016024	Then יהושע said to His taught ones , “ If anyone wishes to come after Me , let him deny himself , and take up his stake , and follow Me .
40016025	“ For whoever wishes to save his life shall lose it , and whoever loses his life for My sake shall find it .
40016026	“ For what is a man profited if he gains all the world , and loses his own life ? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his life ?
40016027	“ For the Son of Aḏam is going to come in the esteem of His Father with His messengers , and then He shall reward each according to his works .
40016028	“ Truly , I say to you , there are some standing here who shall not taste death at all until they see the Son of Aḏam coming in His reign : ”
40017001	And after six days יהושע took Kĕpha , and Ya‛aqoḇ , and Yoḥanan his brother , and brought them up on a high mountain by themselves ,
40017002	and He was transformed before them , and His face shone like the sun , and His garments became as white as the light .
40017003	And see , Mosheh and Ěliyahu appeared to them , talking with Him .
40017004	And Kĕpha answering , said to יהושע , “ Master , it is good for us to be here . If You wish , let us make here three booths : one for You , one for Mosheh , and one for Ěliyahu . ”
40017005	While he was still speaking , see , a bright cloud overshadowed them . And see , a voice came out of the cloud , saying , “ This is My Son , the Beloved , in whom I did delight . Hear Him ! ”
40017006	And when the taught ones heard , they fell on their faces and were much afraid .
40017007	But יהושע came near and touched them and said , “ Rise , and do not be afraid . ”
40017008	And having lifted up their eyes , they saw no one but יהושע only .
40017009	And as they were coming down from the mountain , יהושע commanded them , saying , “ Do not mention the vision to anyone until the Son of Aḏam is raised from the dead . ”
40017010	And His taught ones asked Him , saying , “ Why then do the scribes say that Ěliyahu has to come first ? ”
40017011	And יהושע answering , said to them , “ Ěliyahu is indeed coming first , and shall restore all matters .
40017012	“ But I say to you that Ěliyahu has already come , and they did not recognise him but did to him whatever they wished . In this way the Son of Aḏam is also about to suffer by them . ”
40017013	Then the taught ones understood that He had spoken to them about Yoḥanan the Immerser .
40017014	And when they came to the crowd , a man came up to Him , kneeling down to Him and saying ,
40017015	“ Master , have compassion on my son , for he is an epileptic and suffers badly , for he often falls into the fire and often into the water .
40017016	“ And I brought him to Your taught ones , but they were unable to heal him . ”
40017017	And יהושע answering , said , “ O generation , unbelieving and perverted , how long shall I be with you ? How long shall I put up with you ? Bring him here to Me . ”
40017018	And יהושע rebuked the demon , and he came out of him . And the child was healed from that hour .
40017019	Then the taught ones came to יהושע by Himself and said , “ Why were we unable to cast him out ? ”
40017020	And יהושע said to them , “ Because of your unbelief , for truly , I say to you , if you have belief as a mustard seed , you shall say to this mountain , ‘ Move from here to there , ’ and it shall move . And no matter shall be impossible for you .
40017021	“ But this kind does not go out except through prayer and fasting . ”
40017022	And while they were staying in Galil , יהושע said to them , “ The Son of Aḏam is about to be delivered up into the hands of men ,
40017023	and they shall kill Him , and the third day He shall be raised up . ” And they were deeply grieved .
40017024	And when they came into Kephar Naḥum , those who received the tax came to Kĕpha and said , “ Does your Teacher not pay the tax ? ”
40017025	He said , “ Yea . ” And when he came into the house , יהושע spoke to him first , saying , “ What do you think , Shim‛on ? From whom do the sovereigns of the earth take toll or tax , from their own sons or from the strangers ? ”
40017026	Kĕpha then said to Him , “ From the strangers . ” יהושע said to him , “ Then the sons are exempt .
40017027	“ But , lest we cause them to stumble , go to the sea , cast in a hook , and take the fish that comes up first . And when you have opened its mouth , you shall find a piece of money . Take that and give it to them for Me and you . ”
40018001	At that time the taught ones came to יהושע , saying , “ Who , then , is greatest in the reign of the heavens ? ”
40018002	And יהושע called a little child to Him , set him in their midst ,
40018003	and said , “ Truly , I say to you , unless you turn and become as little children , you shall by no means enter into the reign of the heavens .
40018004	“ Whoever then humbles himself as this little child is the greatest in the reign of the heavens .
40018005	“ And whoever receives one little child like this in My Name receives Me .
40018006	“ But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble , it is better for him that a millstone be hung around his neck , and that he be drowned in the depth of the sea .
40018007	“ Woe to the world because of stumbling-blocks ! For it is necessary that stumbling-blocks come , but woe to that man by whom the stumbling-block comes !
40018008	“ And if your hand or foot causes you to stumble , cut it off and throw it away from you . It is better for you to enter into life lame or crippled , rather than having two hands or two feet , to be thrown into the everlasting fire .
40018009	“ And if your eye causes you to stumble , pluck it out and throw it away from you . It is better for you to enter into life with one eye , rather than having two eyes , to be thrown into the fire of Gehenna .
40018010	“ See that you do not despise one of these little ones , for I say to you that in the heavens their messengers always see the face of My Father who is in the heavens .
40018011	“ For the Son of Aḏam has come to save what was lost .
40018012	“ What do you think ? If a man has a hundred sheep , and one of them goes astray , would he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains , going to seek the one that is straying ?
40018013	“ And if he should find it , truly , I say to you , he rejoices more over that sheep than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray .
40018014	“ Thus it is not the desire of your Father who is in the heavens that one of these little ones should be lost .
40018015	“ And if your brother sins against you , go and reprove him , between you and him alone . If he hears you , you have gained your brother .
40018016	“ But if he does not hear , take with you one or two more , that ‘ by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word might be established . ’
40018017	“ And if he refuses to hear them , say it to the assembly . And if he refuses even to hear the assembly , let him be to you like a gentile and a tax collector .
40018018	“ Truly , I say to you , whatever you bind on earth shall be having been bound in heaven , and whatever you loosen on earth shall be having been loosened in heaven .
40018019	“ Again I say to you that if two of you agree on earth concerning any matter that they ask , it shall be done for them by My Father in the heavens .
40018020	“ For where two or three are gathered together in My Name , there I am in their midst . ”
40018021	Then Kĕpha came to Him and said , “ Master , how often shall my brother sin against me , and I forgive him ? Up to seven times ? ”
40018022	יהושע said to him , “ I do not say to you , up to seven times , but up to seventy times seven .
40018023	“ Because of this the reign of the heavens is like a certain man , a sovereign who wished to settle accounts with his servants .
40018024	“ And when he had begun to settle , one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents ,
40018025	but as he was unable to pay , his master commanded that he be sold , with his wife and children and all that he had , and payment to be made .
40018026	“ Then the servant fell down before him , saying , ‘ Master , have patience with me , and I shall pay you all . ’
40018027	“ And the master of that servant was moved with compassion , released him , and forgave him the debt .
40018028	“ And that servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred pieces of money . And he laid hands on him and took him by the throat , saying , ‘ Pay me what you owe ! ’
40018029	“ Then his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him , saying , ‘ Have patience with me , and I shall pay you all . ’
40018030	“ But he would not , and went and threw him into prison till he should pay the debt .
40018031	“ And when his fellow servants saw what had been done , they were deeply grieved , and came and reported to their master all that had taken place .
40018032	“ Then his master called him and said to him , ‘ Wicked servant ! I forgave you all that debt seeing you begged me .
40018033	‘ Should you not also have had compassion on your fellow servant , as I also had compassion on you ? ’
40018034	“ And his master was wroth , and delivered him to the torturers until he should pay all that was due to him .
40018035	“ So also My heavenly Father shall do to you if each of you , from his heart , does not forgive his brother his trespasses . ”
40019001	And it came to be , when יהושע had ended these words , that He left Galil and came to the borders of Yehuḏah beyond the Yardĕn .
40019002	And large crowds followed Him , and He healed them there .
40019003	And the Pharisees came to Him , trying Him , and saying to Him , “ Is it right for a man to put away his wife for every reason ? ”
40019004	And He answering , said to them , “ Did you not read that He who made them at the beginning made them male and female ,
40019005	and said , ‘ For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife , and the two shall become one flesh’ ?
40019006	“ So that they are no longer two , but one flesh . Therefore , what Elohim has joined together , let man not separate . ”
40019007	They said to Him , “ Why then did Mosheh command to give a certificate of divorce , and to put her away ? ”
40019008	He said to them , “ Because of the hardness of your hearts , Mosheh allowed you to put away your wives , but from the beginning it was not so .
40019009	“ And I say to you , whoever puts away his wife , except on the ground of whoring , and marries another , commits adultery . And whoever marries her who has been put away commits adultery . ”
40019010	His taught ones said to Him , “ If such is the case of the man with his wife , it is good not to marry . ”
40019011	And He said to them , “ Not all receive this word , but only those to whom it has been given ,
40019012	for there are eunuchs who were so born from their mother’s womb , and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men , and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the reign of the heavens . He who is able to receive it , let him receive it . ”
40019013	Then young children were brought to Him to lay His hands on them and pray , and the taught ones rebuked them .
40019014	But יהושע said , “ Allow the young children and do not stop them from coming to Me , for of such is the reign of the heavens . ”
40019015	And having laid hands on them He went from there .
40019016	And see , one came and said to Him , “ Good Teacher , what good shall I do to have everlasting life ? ”
40019017	And He said to him , “ Why do you call Me good ? No one is good except One – Elohim . But if you wish to enter into life , guard the commands . ”
40019018	He said to Him , “ Which ? ” And יהושע said , “ ‘ You shall not murder , ’ ‘ You shall not commit adultery , ’ ‘ You shall not steal , ’ ‘ You shall not bear false witness , ’
40019019	‘ Respect your father and your mother , ’ and ‘ You shall love your neighbour as yourself . ’ ”
40019020	The young man said to Him , “ All these I have watched over from my youth , what do I still lack ? ”
40019021	יהושע said to him , “ If you wish to be perfect , go , sell what you have and give to the poor , and you shall have treasure in heaven . And come , follow Me . ”
40019022	And when the young man heard the word , he went away sad , because he had many possessions .
40019023	And יהושע said to His taught ones , “ Truly , I say to you that it is hard for a rich man to enter into the reign of the heavens .
40019024	And again I say to you , it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the reign of Elohim . ”
40019025	And when His taught ones heard it , they were very astonished , saying , “ Who then is able to be saved ? ”
40019026	And looking intently יהושע said to them , “ With men this is impossible , but with Elohim all is possible . ”
40019027	Then Kĕpha answering , said to Him , “ See , we have left all and followed You . What then shall we have ? ”
40019028	And יהושע said to them , “ Truly I say to you , when the Son of Aḏam sits on the throne of His esteem , you who have followed Me in the rebirth , shall also sit on twelve thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Yisra’ĕl .
40019029	“ And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands , for My Name’s sake , shall receive a hundredfold , and shall inherit everlasting life .
40019030	“ But many who are first shall be last , and the last first .
40020001	“ For the reign of the heavens is like a man , a householder who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard .
40020002	“ And when he had agreed with the workers for a silver piece a day , he sent them into his vineyard .
40020003	“ And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the market-place ,
40020004	and said to them , ‘ You too go into the vineyard , and whatever is right I shall give you . ’ And they went .
40020005	“ Having gone out again about the sixth and the ninth hour , he did likewise .
40020006	“ And about the eleventh hour , having gone out , he found others standing idle , and said to them , ‘ Why do you stand here idle all day ? ’
40020007	“ They said to him , ‘ Because no one hired us . ’ He said to them , ‘ You too go into the vineyard , and whatever is right you shall receive . ’
40020008	“ And when evening came , the master of the vineyard said to his manager , ‘ Call the workers and pay them their wages , beginning with the last to the first . ’
40020009	“ And when those came who were hired about the eleventh hour , they each received a silver piece .
40020010	“ And when the first came , they thought they would receive more . But they too received each a silver piece .
40020011	“ And when they received it , they grumbled against the householder ,
40020012	saying , ‘ These last have worked only one hour , and you made them equal to us who have borne the burden and the heat of the day . ’
40020013	“ But he answering , said to one of them , ‘ Friend , I do you no wrong . Did you not agree with me for a silver piece ?
40020014	‘ Take yours and go . But I wish to give to this last man as also to you .
40020015	‘ Is it not right for me to do what I wish with my own ? Or is your eye evil because I am good ? ’
40020016	“ Thus the last shall be first , and the first last . For many are called , but few chosen . ”
40020017	And יהושע , going up to Yerushalayim , took the twelve taught ones aside on the way and said to them ,
40020018	“ See , we are going up to Yerushalayim , and the Son of Aḏam shall be delivered up to the chief priests and to the scribes . And they shall condemn Him to death ,
40020019	and deliver Him to the gentiles to mock and to flog and to impale . And the third day He shall be raised . ”
40020020	Then the mother of the sons of Zaḇdai came to Him with her sons , bowing down and making a request of Him .
40020021	And He said to her , “ What do you wish ? ” She said to Him , “ Command that these two sons of mine might sit , one on Your right hand and the other on the left , in Your reign . ”
40020022	But יהושע answering , said , “ You do not know what you ask . Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink , and to be immersed with the immersion that I am immersed with ? ” They said to Him , “ We are able . ”
40020023	And He said to them , “ You shall indeed drink My cup , and you shall be immersed with the immersion that I am immersed with . But to sit on My right hand and on My left is not Mine to give , but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by My Father . ”
40020024	And when the ten heard it , they were displeased at the two brothers .
40020025	But יהושע called them near and said , “ You know that the rulers of the gentiles are masters over them , and those who are great exercise authority over them .
40020026	“ But it shall not be so among you , but whoever wishes to become great among you , let him be your servant .
40020027	“ And whoever wishes to be first among you , let him be your servant ,
40020028	even as the Son of Aḏam did not come to be served , but to serve , and to give His life as a ransom for many . ”
40020029	And as they were leaving Yeriḥo , a large crowd followed Him .
40020030	And see , two blind men sitting by the way , having heard that יהושע was passing by , cried out , saying , “ Have compassion on us , O Master , Son of Dawiḏ ! ”
40020031	And the crowd rebuked them that they should be silent , but they cried out all the more , saying , “ Have compassion on us , O Master , Son of Dawiḏ ! ”
40020032	And יהושע stopped and called them , and said , “ What do you wish Me to do for you ? ”
40020033	They said to Him , “ Master , that our eyes be opened . ”
40020034	And having been moved with compassion , יהושע touched their eyes . And immediately their eyes received sight , and they followed Him .
40021001	And when they came near to Yerushalayim , and came to Bĕyth Phag̅i , at the Mount of Olives , then יהושע sent two taught ones ,
40021002	saying to them , “ Go into the village opposite you , and straightaway you shall find a donkey tied , and a colt with her , loosen them , and bring them to Me .
40021003	“ And if anyone says whatever to you , you shall say , ‘ The Master needs them , ’ and immediately he shall send them . ”
40021004	And all this took place that it might be filled what was spoken by the prophet , saying ,
40021005	“ Say to the daughter of Tsiyon , ‘ See , your Sovereign is coming to you , meek , and sitting on a donkey , even a colt , the foal of a donkey . ’ ”
40021006	And the taught ones went , and having done as יהושע ordered them ,
40021007	they brought the donkey and the colt , and laid their garments on them , and He sat on them .
40021008	And most of the crowd spread their garments on the way , while others cut down branches from the trees and spread them on the way .
40021009	And the crowds who went before and those who followed cried out , saying , “ Hoshia-na to the Son of Dawiḏ ! Blessed is He who is coming in the Name of יהוה ! Hoshia-na in the highest ! ”
40021010	And as He entered into Yerushalayim , all the city was stirred , saying , “ Who is this ? ”
40021011	And the crowds said , “ This is יהושע , the prophet from Natsareth of Galil . ”
40021012	And יהושע went into the Set-apart Place of Elohim and drove out all those buying and selling in the Set-apart Place , and overturned the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of those who sold doves .
40021013	And He said to them , “ It has been written , ‘ My House shall be called a house of prayer , ’ but you have made it a ‘ den of robbers . ’ ”
40021014	And blind and lame ones came to Him in the Set-apart Place , and He healed them .
40021015	But when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonders which He did , and the children crying out in the Set-apart Place and saying , “ Hoshia-na to the Son of Dawiḏ ! ” they were greatly displeased ,
40021016	and said to Him , “ Do You hear what these say ? ” And יהושע said to them , “ Yea , have you never read , ‘ Out of the mouth of babes and nurslings You have perfected praise’ ? ”
40021017	And having left them He went out of the city to Bĕyth Anyah , and spent the night there .
40021018	And returning to the city early in the morning , He became hungry .
40021019	And seeing a single fig tree by the way , He came to it and found naught on it but leaves , and said to it , “ Let no fruit grow on you ever again . ” And immediately the fig tree withered .
40021020	And the taught ones , seeing it , marvelled , saying , “ How did the fig tree wither so soon ? ”
40021021	And יהושע answering , said to them , “ Truly , I say to you , if you have belief and do not doubt , you shall not only do what was done to the fig tree , but even if you say to this mountain , ‘ Be removed and be thrown into the sea , ’ it shall be done .
40021022	“ And whatever you ask in prayer , believing , you shall receive . ”
40021023	And when He had come into the Set-apart Place , the chief priests and the elders of the people came to Him as He was teaching , and said , “ By what authority are You doing these ? And who gave You this authority ? ”
40021024	And יהושע answering , said to them , “ I shall ask you one question too , which if you answer Me , I also shall say to you by what authority I do these :
40021025	“ The immersion of Yoḥanan , where did it come from ? From heaven or from men ? ” So they reasoned among themselves , saying , “ If we say , ‘ From heaven , ’ He shall say to us , ‘ Then why did you not believe him ? ’
40021026	“ But if we say , ‘ From men , ’ we fear the crowd , for all hold Yoḥanan as a prophet . ”
40021027	And they answered יהושע and said , “ We do not know . ” And He said to them , “ Neither do I say to you by what authority I do these .
40021028	“ But what do you think ? A man had two sons , and he came to the first and said , ‘ Son , go , work today in my vineyard . ’
40021029	“ And he answering , said , ‘ I do not wish to , ’ but afterwards he repented and went .
40021030	“ And having come to the second , he said similarly . And he answering , said , ‘ I go , master , ’ but he did not go .
40021031	“ Which of the two did the desire of the father ? ” They said to Him , “ The first . ” יהושע said to them , “ Truly , I say to you that tax collectors and whores are entering into the reign of Elohim before you ,
40021032	for Yoḥanan came to you in the way of righteousness , and you did not believe him , but tax collectors and whores believed him . And when you saw it , you did not repent afterwards , to believe him .
40021033	“ Hear another parable : There was a certain man , a householder who planted a vineyard and placed a hedge around it , and dug a winepress in it and built a watchtower . And he leased it to farmers and went abroad .
40021034	“ And when the season of the fruits drew near , he sent his servants to the farmers , to receive its fruit .
40021035	“ And the farmers took his servants and beat one , and they killed one , and they stoned another .
40021036	“ Again he sent other servants , more than the first , and they did likewise to them .
40021037	“ And at last he sent his son to them , saying , ‘ They shall respect my son . ’
40021038	“ But when the farmers saw the son , they said among themselves , ‘ This is the heir . Come , let us kill him , and let us possess his inheritance . ’
40021039	“ And they took him , and threw him out of the vineyard , and killed him .
40021040	“ Therefore , when the master of the vineyard comes , what shall he do to those farmers ? ”
40021041	They said to Him , “ Evil ones ! He shall bring them to evil destruction , and lease the vineyard to other farmers who shall give to him the fruits in their seasons . ”
40021042	יהושע said to them , “ Did you never read in the Scriptures , ‘ The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief corner-stone . This was from יהוה , and it is marvellous in our eyes’ ?
40021043	“ Because of this I say to you : the reign of Elohim shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits of it .
40021044	“ And he who falls on this stone shall be broken , but on whomever it falls , he shall be pulverised . ”
40021045	And the chief priests and Pharisees , having heard His parables , knew that He was speaking of them .
40021046	And seeking to lay hands on Him , they feared the crowds , seeing they held Him to be a prophet .
40022001	And יהושע responded and spoke to them again by parables and said ,
40022002	“ The reign of the heavens is like a man , a sovereign , who made a wedding feast for his son ,
40022003	and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding feast . But they would not come .
40022004	“ Again he sent out other servants , saying , ‘ Say to those who are invited , “ See , I have prepared my dinner . My oxen and fattened cattle are slaughtered , and all is ready . Come to the wedding feast . ” ’
40022005	“ But they disregarded it and went their way – this one to his field , that one to his trade .
40022006	“ And the rest , having seized his servants , insulted and killed them .
40022007	“ But when the sovereign heard , he was wroth , and sent out his soldiers , destroyed those murderers , and set their city on fire .
40022008	“ Then he said to his servants , ‘ The wedding feast , indeed , is ready , but those who were invited were not worthy .
40022009	‘ Therefore go into the street corners , and as many as you find , invite to the wedding feast . ’
40022010	“ And those servants went out into the street corners and gathered all whom they found , both wicked and good . And the wedding hall was filled with guests .
40022011	“ And when the sovereign came in to view the guests , he saw there a man who had not put on a wedding garment ,
40022012	and he said to him , ‘ Friend , how did you come in here not having a wedding garment ? ’ And he was speechless .
40022013	“ Then the sovereign said to the servants , ‘ Bind him hand and foot , take him away , and throw him out into the outer darkness – there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth . ’
40022014	“ For many are called , but few are chosen . ”
40022015	Then the Pharisees went and plotted how to trap Him in His words .
40022016	And they sent to Him their taught ones with the Herodians , saying , “ Teacher , we know that You are true , and teach the way of Elohim in truth , and it does not concern You about anyone , for You are not partial to any man .
40022017	“ Then say to us , what do You think ? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar , or not ? ”
40022018	But knowing their wickedness , יהושע said , “ Why do you try Me , you hypocrites ?
40022019	“ Show Me the coin of the tax . ” And they brought Him a silver piece .
40022020	And He said to them , “ Whose likeness and inscription is this ? ”
40022021	They said to Him , “ Caesar’s . ” And He said to them , “ Then give to Caesar what is Caesar’s , and to Elohim what is Elohim’s . ”
40022022	And having heard , they marvelled , and left Him and went away .
40022023	On that day Sadducees , who say there is no resurrection , came to Him and asked Him ,
40022024	saying , “ Teacher , Mosheh said that if anyone should die , having no children , his brother shall marry his wife and raise offspring for his brother .
40022025	“ And there were with us seven brothers , and the first died after he had married , and having no children , left his wife to his brother .
40022026	“ In the same way the second also , and the third , unto the seventh .
40022027	“ And last of all the woman died too .
40022028	“ At the resurrection , then , whose wife of the seven shall she be – for all had her ? ”
40022029	And יהושע answering , said to them , “ You go astray , not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of Elohim .
40022030	“ For in the resurrection they do not marry , nor are they given in marriage , but are as messengers of Elohim in heaven .
40022031	“ And concerning the resurrection of the dead , have you not read what was spoken to you by Elohim , saying ,
40022032	‘ I am the Elohim of Aḇraham , and the Elohim of Yitsḥaq , and the Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ’ ? Elohim is not the Elohim of the dead , but of the living . ”
40022033	And when the crowds heard , they were astonished at His teaching .
40022034	But the Pharisees , having heard that He had silenced the Sadducees , were gathered together ,
40022035	and one of them , one learned in the Torah , did question , trying Him , and saying ,
40022036	“ Teacher , which is the great command in the Torah ? ”
40022037	And יהושע said to him , “ ‘ You shall love יהוה your Elohim with all your heart , and with all your being , and with all your mind . ’
40022038	“ This is the first and great command .
40022039	“ And the second is like it , ‘ You shall love your neighbour as yourself . ’
40022040	“ On these two commands hang all the Torah and the Prophets . ”
40022041	And when the Pharisees were gathered together , יהושע asked them ,
40022042	saying , “ What do you think concerning the Messiah ? Whose Son is He ? ” They said to Him , “ The Son of Dawiḏ . ”
40022043	He said to them , “ Then how does Dawiḏ in the Spirit call Him ‘ Master , ’ saying ,
40022044	‘ יהוה said to my Master , “ Sit at My right hand , until I make Your enemies a footstool of Your feet ” ’ ?
40022045	“ If then Dawiḏ calls Him ‘ Master , ’ how is He his Son ? ”
40022046	And no one was able to answer Him a word , and from that day on no one was bold enough to ask Him any more questions .
40023001	Then יהושע spoke to the crowds and to His taught ones ,
40023002	saying , “ The scribes and the Pharisees sit on the seat of Mosheh .
40023003	“ Therefore , whatever they say to you to guard , guard and do . But do not do according to their works , for they say , and do not do .
40023004	“ For they bind heavy burdens , hard to bear , and lay them on men’s shoulders , but with their finger they do not wish to move them .
40023005	“ And they do all their works to be seen by men , and they make their t’fillen wide and lengthen the tzitziyot of their garments ,
40023006	and they love the best place at feasts , and the best seats in the congregations ,
40023007	and the greetings in the market-places , and to be called by men , ‘ Rabbi , Rabbi . ’
40023008	“ But you , do not be called ‘ Rabbi , ’ for One is your Teacher , the Messiah , and you are all brothers .
40023009	“ And do not call anyone on earth your father , for One is your Father , He who is in the heavens .
40023010	“ Neither be called leaders , for One is your Leader , the Messiah .
40023011	“ But the greatest among you shall be your servant .
40023012	“ And whoever exalts himself shall be humbled , and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted .
40023013	“ But woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! Because you shut up the reign of the heavens before men , for you do not go in , nor do you allow those who are entering to go in .
40023014	“ Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! Because you eat up widows’ houses , and for a show make long prayers . Because of this you shall receive greater judgment .
40023015	“ Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! Because you go about the land and the sea to win one convert , and when he is won , you make him a son of Gehenna twofold more than yourselves .
40023016	“ Woe to you , blind guides , who say , ‘ Whoever swears by the Dwelling Place , it does not matter , but whoever swears by the gold of the Dwelling Place , is bound by oath . ’
40023017	“ Fools and blind ! For which is greater , the gold or the Dwelling Place that sets the gold apart ?
40023018	“ And , ‘ Whoever swears by the altar , it does not matter , but whoever swears by the gift that is on it , is bound by oath . ’
40023019	“ Fools and blind ! For which is greater , the gift or the altar that sets the gift apart ?
40023020	“ He , then , who swears by the altar , swears by it and by all that is upon it .
40023021	“ And he who swears by the Dwelling Place , swears by it and by Him who is dwelling in it .
40023022	“ And he who swears by the heaven , swears by the throne of Elohim and by Him who is sitting upon it .
40023023	“ Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! Because you tithe the mint and the anise and the cumin , and have neglected the weightier matters of the Torah : the right-ruling and the compassion and the belief . These need to have been done , without neglecting the others .
40023024	“ Blind guides – straining out a gnat and swallowing a camel !
40023025	“ Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! Because you clean the outside of the cup and dish , but inside they are filled with plunder and unrighteousness .
40023026	“ Blind Pharisee , first clean the inside of the cup and dish , so that the outside of them becomes clean too .
40023027	“ Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! Because you are like whitewashed tombs which outwardly indeed look well , but inside are filled with dead men’s bones and all uncleanness .
40023028	“ So you too outwardly indeed appear righteous to men , but inside you are filled with hypocrisy and lawlessness .
40023029	“ Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! Because you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the monuments of the righteous ,
40023030	and say , ‘ If we had lived in the days of our fathers , we would not have taken part with them in the blood of the prophets . ’
40023031	“ Thus you bear witness against yourselves that you are sons of those who did murder the prophets –
40023032	and you fill up the measure of your fathers !
40023033	“ Serpents , brood of adders ! How would you escape the judgment of Gehenna ?
40023034	“ Because of this , see , I send you prophets , and wise men , and scholars of Scripture . Some of them you shall kill and impale , and some of them you shall flog in your congregations and persecute from city to city ,
40023035	so that on you should come all the righteous blood shed on the earth , from the blood of righteous Heḇel to the blood of Zeḵaryah , son of Bereḵyah , whom you murdered between the Dwelling Place and the altar .
40023036	“ Truly , I say to you , all this shall come upon this generation .
40023037	“ Yerushalayim , Yerushalayim , killing the prophets and stoning those who are sent to her ! How often I wished to gather your children together , the way a hen gathers her chickens under her wings , but you would not !
40023038	“ See ! Your house is left to you laid waste ,
40023039	for I say to you , from now on you shall by no means see Me , until you say , ‘ Blessed is He who is coming in the Name of יהוה ! ’ ”
40024001	And going out , יהושע went away from the Set-apart Place , and His taught ones came near to point out to Him the buildings of the Set-apart Place .
40024002	And יהושע said to them , “ Do you not see all these ? Truly , I say to you , not one stone shall be left here upon another , at all , which shall not be thrown down . ”
40024003	And as He sat on the Mount of Olives , the taught ones came to Him separately , saying , “ Say to us , when shall this be , and what is the sign of Your coming , and of the end of the age ? ”
40024004	And יהושע answering , said to them , “ Take heed that no one leads you astray .
40024005	“ For many shall come in My Name , saying , ‘ I am the Messiah , ’ and they shall lead many astray .
40024006	“ And you shall begin to hear of fightings and reports of fightings . See that you are not troubled , for these have to take place , but the end is not yet .
40024007	“ For nation shall rise against nation , and reign against reign . And there shall be scarcities of food , and deadly diseases , and earthquakes in places .
40024008	“ And all these are the beginning of birth pains .
40024009	“ Then they shall deliver you up to affliction and kill you , and you shall be hated by all nations for My Name’s sake .
40024010	“ And then many shall stumble , and they shall deliver up one another , and shall hate one another .
40024011	“ And many false prophets shall rise up and lead many astray .
40024012	“ And because of the increase in lawlessness , the love of many shall become cold .
40024013	“ But he who shall have endured to the end shall be saved .
40024014	“ And this Good News of the reign shall be proclaimed in all the world as a witness to all the nations , and then the end shall come .
40024015	“ So when you see the ‘ abomination that lays waste , ’ spoken of by Dani’ĕl the prophet , set up in the set-apart place ” – he who reads , let him understand –
40024016	“ then let those who are in Yehuḏah flee to the mountains .
40024017	“ Let him who is on the house-top not come down to take whatever out of his house .
40024018	“ And let him who is in the field not turn back to get his garments .
40024019	“ And woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing children in those days !
40024020	“ And pray that your flight does not take place in winter or on the Sabbath .
40024021	“ For then there shall be great distress , such as has not been since the beginning of the world until this time , no , nor ever shall be .
40024022	“ And if those days were not shortened , no flesh would be saved , but for the sake of the chosen ones those days shall be shortened .
40024023	“ If anyone then says to you , ‘ Look , here is the Messiah ! ’ or ‘ There ! ’ do not believe .
40024024	“ For false messiahs and false prophets shall arise , and they shall show great signs and wonders , so as to lead astray , if possible , even the chosen ones .
40024025	“ See , I have forewarned you .
40024026	“ So if they say to you , ‘ Look , He is in the desert ! ’ do not go out ; or ‘ Look , He is in the inner rooms ! ’ do not believe .
40024027	“ For as the lightning comes from the east and shines to the west , so also shall the coming of the Son of Aḏam be .
40024028	“ For wherever the dead body is , there the eagles shall be gathered together .
40024029	“ And immediately after the distress of those days the sun shall be darkened , and the moon shall not give its light , and the stars shall fall from the heaven , and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken .
40024030	“ And then the sign of the Son of Aḏam shall appear in the heaven , and then all the tribes of the earth shall mourn , and they shall see the Son of Aḏam coming on the clouds of the heaven with power and much esteem .
40024031	“ And He shall send His messengers with a great sound of a trumpet , and they shall gather together His chosen ones from the four winds , from one end of the heavens to the other .
40024032	“ And learn this parable from the fig tree : When its branch has already become tender and puts forth leaves , you know that the summer is near .
40024033	“ So you also , when you see all these , know that He is near , at the doors .
40024034	“ Truly , I say to you , this generation shall by no means pass away until all this takes place .
40024035	“ The heaven and the earth shall pass away , but My words shall by no means pass away .
40024036	“ But concerning that day and the hour no one knows , not even the messengers of the heavens , but My Father only .
40024037	“ And as the days of Noaḥ , so also shall the coming of the Son of Aḏam be .
40024038	“ For as they were in the days before the flood , eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , until the day that Noaḥ entered into the ark ,
40024039	and they did not know until the flood came and took them all away , so also shall the coming of the Son of Aḏam be .
40024040	“ Then two shall be in the field , the one is taken and the one is left .
40024041	“ Two shall be grinding at the mill , one is taken and one is left .
40024042	“ Watch therefore , for you do not know what hour your Master is coming .
40024043	“ And know this , that if the master of the house had known what hour the thief would come , he would have watched and not allowed his house to be broken into .
40024044	“ Because of this , be ready too , for the Son of Aḏam is coming at an hour when you do not expect Him .
40024045	“ Who then is a trustworthy and wise servant , whom his master set over his household , to give them food in season ?
40024046	“ Blessed is that servant whom his master , having come , shall find so doing .
40024047	“ Truly , I say to you that he shall set him over all his possessions .
40024048	“ But if that evil servant says in his heart , ‘ My master is delaying his coming , ’
40024049	and begins to beat his fellow servants , and to eat and drink with the drunkards ,
40024050	the master of that servant shall come on a day when he does not expect it , and at an hour he does not know ,
40024051	and shall cut him in two and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites – there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
40025001	“ Then the reign of the heavens shall be compared to ten maidens who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom .
40025002	“ And five of them were wise , and five foolish .
40025003	“ Those who were foolish , having taken their lamps , took no oil with them ,
40025004	but the wise took oil in their containers with their lamps .
40025005	“ Now while the bridegroom took time , they all slumbered and slept .
40025006	“ And at midnight a cry was heard , ‘ See , the bridegroom is coming , go out to meet him ! ’
40025007	“ Then all those maidens rose up and trimmed their lamps .
40025008	“ And the foolish said to the wise , ‘ Give us of your oil , because our lamps are going out . ’
40025009	“ But the wise answered , saying , ‘ No , indeed , there would not be enough for us and you . Instead , go to those who sell , and buy for yourselves . ’
40025010	“ And while they went to buy , the bridegroom came , and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast , and the door was shut .
40025011	“ And later the other maidens also came , saying , ‘ Master , Master , open up for us ! ’
40025012	“ But he answering , said , ‘ Truly , I say to you , I do not know you . ’
40025013	“ Watch therefore , because you do not know the day nor the hour in which the Son of Aḏam is coming ,
40025014	for it is like a man going from home , who called his own servants and delivered his possessions to them .
40025015	“ And to one he gave five talents , and to another two , and to another one , to each according to his own ability , and went from home .
40025016	“ And he who had received the five talents went and worked with them , and made another five talents .
40025017	“ In the same way , he with the two also , he gained two more .
40025018	“ But he who had received the one went away and dug in the ground , and hid the silver of his master .
40025019	“ And after a long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them .
40025020	“ And he who had received five talents came and brought five other talents , saying , ‘ Master , you delivered to me five talents . See , I have gained five more talents besides them . ’
40025021	“ And his master said to him , ‘ Well done , good and trustworthy servant . You were trustworthy over a little , I shall set you over much . Enter into the joy of your master . ’
40025022	“ Then he who had received two talents came and said , ‘ Master , you delivered to me two talents . See , I have gained two more talents besides them . ’
40025023	“ His master said to him , ‘ Well done , good and trustworthy servant . You were trustworthy over a little , I shall set you over much . Enter into the joy of your master . ’
40025024	“ And the one who had received the one talent also came and said , ‘ Master , I knew you to be a hard man , reaping where you have not sown , and gathering where you have not scattered seed ,
40025025	and being afraid , I went and hid your talent in the ground . See , you have what is yours . ’
40025026	“ And his master answering , said to him , ‘ You wicked and lazy servant , you knew that I reap where I have not sown , and gather where I have not scattered seed .
40025027	‘ Then you should have put my silver with the bankers , and at my coming I would have received back my own with interest .
40025028	‘ Therefore take away the talent from him , and give it to him who possesses ten talents .
40025029	‘ For to everyone who possesses , more shall be given , and he shall have overflowingly ; but from him who does not possess , even what he possesses shall be taken away .
40025030	‘ And throw the worthless servant out into the outer darkness – there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth . ’
40025031	“ And when the Son of Aḏam comes in His esteem , and all the set-apart messengers with Him , then He shall sit on the throne of His esteem .
40025032	“ And all the nations shall be gathered before Him , and He shall separate them one from another , as a shepherd separates his sheep from the goats .
40025033	“ And He shall set the sheep on His right hand , but the goats on the left .
40025034	“ Then the Sovereign shall say to those on His right hand , ‘ Come , you blessed of My Father , inherit the reign prepared for you from the foundation of the world –
40025035	for I was hungry and you gave Me food , I was thirsty and you gave Me drink , I was a stranger and you took Me in ,
40025036	was naked and you clothed Me , I was sick and you visited Me , I was in prison and you came to Me . ’
40025037	“ Then the righteous shall answer Him , saying , ‘ Master , when did we see You hungry and we fed You , or thirsty and gave You to drink ?
40025038	‘ And when did we see You a stranger and took You in , or naked and clothed You ?
40025039	‘ And when did we see You sick , or in prison , and we came to You ? ’
40025040	“ And the Sovereign shall answer and say to them , ‘ Truly , I say to you , in so far as you did it to one of the least of these My brothers , you did it to Me . ’
40025041	“ He shall then also say to those on the left hand , ‘ Go away from Me , accursed ones , into the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his messengers –
40025042	for I was hungry and you gave Me no food , I was thirsty and you gave Me no drink ,
40025043	‘ I was a stranger and you did not take Me in , was naked and you did not clothe Me , sick and in prison and you did not visit Me . ’
40025044	“ Then they also shall answer Him , saying , ‘ Master , when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison , and did not serve You ? ’
40025045	“ Then He shall answer them , saying , ‘ Truly , I say to you , in so far as you did not do it to one of the least of these , you did not do it to Me . ’
40025046	“ And these shall go away into everlasting punishment , but the righteous into everlasting life . ”
40026001	And it came to be , when יהושע ended all these words , He said to His taught ones ,
40026002	“ You know that after two days the Passover takes place , and the Son of Aḏam is to be delivered up to be impaled . ”
40026003	Then the chief priests , and the scribes , and the elders of the people came together at the court of the high priest , who was called Qayapha ,
40026004	and plotted to seize יהושע by trickery and kill Him .
40026005	But they said , “ Not at the festival lest there be an uproar among the people . ”
40026006	And when יהושע was in Bĕyth Anyah at the house of Shim‛on the leper ,
40026007	a woman came to Him , having an alabaster flask of costly perfume , and she poured it on His head as He sat at the table .
40026008	And when His taught ones saw it , they were much displeased saying , “ To what purpose is this waste ?
40026009	“ For this perfume could have been sold for much and given to the poor . ”
40026010	However , when יהושע noticed it , He said to them , “ Why do you trouble the woman ? For she has done a good work toward Me .
40026011	“ For you always have the poor with you , but Me you do not have always .
40026012	“ For in pouring this perfume on My body , she did it for My burial .
40026013	“ Truly , I say to you , wherever this Good News is proclaimed in all the world , what this woman has done shall be spoken of also , to her remembrance . ”
40026014	Then one of the twelve , called Yehuḏah from Qerioth , went to the chief priests ,
40026015	and said , “ What would you give me to deliver Him to you ? ” And they counted out to him thirty pieces of silver .
40026016	And from then on he was seeking an occasion to deliver Him up .
40026017	And on the first day of Unleavened Bread the taught ones came to יהושע , saying to Him , “ Where do You wish us to prepare for You to eat the Passover ? ”
40026018	And He said , “ Go into the city to a certain man , and say to him , ‘ The Teacher says , “ My time is near . I am to observe the Passover at your house with My taught ones . ” ’ ”
40026019	And the taught ones did as יהושע had ordered them , and prepared the Passover .
40026020	And when evening came , He sat down with the twelve .
40026021	And while they were eating , He said , “ Truly , I say to you , one of you shall deliver Me up . ”
40026022	And they were deeply grieved , and began to say to Him , each of them , “ Master , is it I ? ”
40026023	And He answering , said , “ He who has dipped his hand with Me in the dish , he shall deliver Me up .
40026024	“ Indeed , the Son of Aḏam goes as it has been written concerning Him , but woe to that man by whom the Son of Aḏam is delivered up ! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born . ”
40026025	And Yehuḏah – he who delivered Him up – answering , said , “ Rabbi , is it I ? ” He said to him , “ You have said it . ”
40026026	And as they were eating , יהושע took bread , and having blessed , broke and gave it to the taught ones and said , “ Take , eat , this is My body . ”
40026027	And taking the cup , and giving thanks , He gave it to them , saying , “ Drink from it , all of you .
40026028	“ For this is My blood , that of the renewed covenant , which is shed for many for the forgiveness of sins .
40026029	“ But I say to you , I shall certainly not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on till that day when I drink it anew with you in the reign of My Father . ”
40026030	And having sung a song , they went out to the Mount of Olives .
40026031	Then יהושע said to them , “ All of you shall stumble in Me this night , for it has been written , ‘ I shall strike the Shepherd , and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered . ’
40026032	“ But after I have been raised , I shall go before you into Galil . ”
40026033	And Kĕpha answering , said to Him , “ Even if all stumble in You , I shall never stumble . ”
40026034	יהושע said to him , “ Truly , I say to you that this night , before the cock crows , you shall deny Me three times . ”
40026035	Kĕpha said to Him , “ Even if I have to die with You , I shall not deny You ! ” All the taught ones said the same too .
40026036	Then יהושע came with them to a place called Gethsemane , and said to the taught ones , “ Sit here while I go over there and pray . ”
40026037	And He took with Him Kĕpha and the two sons of Zaḇdai , and He began to be grieved and deeply distressed .
40026038	Then He said to them , “ My being is exceedingly grieved , even to death . Stay here and watch with Me . ”
40026039	And going forward a little , He fell on His face , and prayed , saying , “ O My Father , if it is possible , let this cup pass from Me . Yet not as I desire , but as You desire . ”
40026040	And He came to the taught ones and found them asleep , and said to Kĕpha , “ So , were you not able to watch with Me one hour ?
40026041	“ Watch and pray , lest you enter into trial . The spirit indeed is eager , but the flesh is weak . ”
40026042	Again He went away , a second time , and prayed , saying , “ O My Father , if it is impossible for this to pass unless I drink it , let Your desire be done . ”
40026043	And He came and found them asleep again , for their eyes were heavy .
40026044	And He left them , went away again , and prayed the third time , saying the same words .
40026045	Then He came to His taught ones and said to them , “ Still sleeping and taking rest ? See , the hour has come near , and the Son of Aḏam is delivered up into the hands of sinners .
40026046	“ Rise , let us go . See , he who delivers Me up has come near . ”
40026047	And while He was still speaking , see , Yehuḏah , one of the twelve , with a large crowd with swords and clubs , came from the chief priests and elders of the people .
40026048	And he who was delivering Him up gave them a sign , saying , “ Whomever I kiss , it is He , seize Him . ”
40026049	And going straight up to יהושע he said , “ Greetings , Rabbi ! ” and kissed Him .
40026050	And יהושע said to him , “ Friend , why have you come ? ” Then they came and laid hands on יהושע and seized Him .
40026051	And look , one of those with יהושע put out his hand and drew his sword , and striking the servant of the high priest he cut off his ear .
40026052	Then יהושע said to him , “ Return your sword to its place , for all who take the sword shall die by the sword .
40026053	“ Or do you think that I am not able to pray to My Father now , and He shall provide Me with more than twelve legions of messengers ?
40026054	“ How then would the Scriptures be filled that it has to be this way ? ”
40026055	In that hour יהושע said to the crowds , “ Have you come out , as against a robber , with swords and clubs to arrest Me ? Daily I sat with you , teaching in the Set-apart Place , and you did not seize Me .
40026056	“ But all this came to be , so that the Scriptures of the prophets might be filled . ” Then all the taught ones left Him and fled .
40026057	And those who had seized יהושע led Him away to Qayapha the high priest , where the scribes and the elders were gathered together .
40026058	But Kĕpha followed Him at a distance to the courtyard of the high priest , and he went in and sat with the servants to see the end .
40026059	And the chief priests , and the elders , and all the council were seeking false witness against יהושע to put Him to death ,
40026060	but found none . Although many false witnesses came forward , they found none . But at last two false witnesses came forward ,
40026061	and said , “ This one said , ‘ I am able to destroy the Dwelling Place of Elohim and to build it in three days . ’ ”
40026062	And the high priest stood up and said to Him , “ Have You no answer to make ? What do these witness against You ? ”
40026063	But יהושע remained silent . So the high priest said to Him , “ I put You to oath , by the living Elohim that You say to us if You are the Messiah , the Son of Elohim . ”
40026064	יהושע said to him , “ You have said it . Besides I say to you , from now you shall see the Son of Aḏam sitting at the right hand of the Power , and coming on the clouds of the heaven . ”
40026065	Then the high priest tore his garments , saying , “ He has blasphemed ! Why do we need any more witnesses ? See , now you have heard His blasphemy !
40026066	“ What do you think ? ” And they answering , said , “ He is liable to death . ”
40026067	Then they spat in His face and beat Him , and others slapped Him ,
40026068	saying , “ Prophesy to us , Messiah ! Who is the one who struck You ? ”
40026069	And Kĕpha sat outside in the courtyard , and a servant girl came to him , saying , “ And you were with יהושע of Galil . ”
40026070	But he denied it before them all , saying , “ I do not know what you say . ”
40026071	And as he was going out into the porch , another girl saw him and said to those there , “ And this one was with יהושע of Natsareth . ”
40026072	But again he denied with an oath , “ I do not know the Man ! ”
40026073	And after a while those who stood by came to him and said to Kĕpha , “ Truly you are one of them too , for even your speech gives you away . ”
40026074	Then he began to curse and to swear , saying , “ I do not know the Man ! ” And immediately a cock crowed .
40026075	And Kĕpha remembered the word of יהושע who had said to him , “ Before a cock crows , you shall deny Me three times . ” And going out , he wept bitterly .
40027001	And morning having come , all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against יהושע , so as to put Him to death .
40027002	And having bound Him , they led Him away and delivered Him to Pontius Pilate the governor .
40027003	Then Yehuḏah – he who delivered Him up – having seen that He had been condemned , repented , returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and to the elders ,
40027004	saying , “ I have sinned in delivering up innocent blood . ” And they said , “ What is that to us ? You see to it ! ”
40027005	And throwing down the pieces of silver in the Dwelling Place he left , and went and hanged himself .
40027006	And the chief priests took the silver pieces and said , “ It is not right to put them into the treasury , seeing they are the price of blood . ”
40027007	So they took counsel and bought with them the potter’s field , for the burial of strangers .
40027008	Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood , until today .
40027009	Then was filled what was spoken by Yirmeyahu the prophet , saying , “ And they took the thirty pieces of silver , the price of Him who was pierced , on whom they of the children of Yisra’ĕl set a price ,
40027010	and gave them for the potter’s field , as יהוה had ordered me . ”
40027011	And יהושע stood before the governor , and the governor asked Him , saying , “ Are You the Sovereign of the Yehuḏim ? ” And יהושע said to him , “ You say it . ”
40027012	And as He was accused by the chief priests and the elders , He answered not .
40027013	Then Pilate said to Him , “ Do You not hear how much they witness against You ? ”
40027014	And He did not answer him , not one word , so that the governor wondered much .
40027015	And at the festival the governor used to release to the crowd one prisoner whom they wished .
40027016	And they had then a well-known prisoner called Barabba .
40027017	So when they were assembled , Pilate said to them , “ Whom do you wish I release to you ? Barabba , or יהושע who is called Messiah ? ”
40027018	For he knew that because of envy they had delivered Him up .
40027019	And as he was sitting on the judgment seat , his wife sent to him , saying , “ Have none at all to do with that righteous Man , for I have suffered much today in a dream because of Him . ”
40027020	But the chief priests and elders persuaded the crowds that they should ask for Barabba and to destroy יהושע .
40027021	And the governor answering , said to them , “ Which of the two do you wish I release to you ? ” They said , “ Barabba ! ”
40027022	Pilate said to them , “ What then shall I do with יהושע who is called Messiah ? ” They all said to him , “ Let Him be impaled ! ”
40027023	And the governor said , “ Indeed , what evil has He done ? ” And they were crying out all the more , saying , “ Let Him be impaled ! ”
40027024	And when Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere , but rather an uproar was starting , he took water and washed his hands before the crowd , saying , “ I am innocent of the blood of this Righteous One . You shall see to it . ”
40027025	And all the people answering , said , “ His blood be on us and on our children . ”
40027026	Then he released Barabba to them , but having יהושע whipped , he delivered Him over to be impaled .
40027027	Then the soldiers of the governor took יהושע into the court and gathered the entire company of soldiers around Him .
40027028	And having stripped Him , they put a scarlet robe on Him .
40027029	And plaiting a crown of thorns , they put it on His head , and a reed in His right hand . And they kneeled down before Him and mocked Him , saying , “ Greetings , Sovereign of the Yehuḏim ! ”
40027030	And spitting on Him they took the reed and struck Him on the head .
40027031	And when they had mocked Him , they took the robe off Him , then put His own garments on Him , and led Him away to be impaled .
40027032	And as they were going out , they found a man of Cyrene , Shim‛on by name – they compelled him to bear His stake .
40027033	And when they came to a place called Golgotha , that is to say , Place of a Skull ,
40027034	they gave Him wine mixed with bile to drink . And after tasting , He would not drink it .
40027035	And having impaled Him , they divided His garments , casting lots , that it might be filled what was spoken by the prophet , “ They divided My garments among them , and for My clothing they cast lots . ”
40027036	And sitting down , they guarded Him there .
40027037	And they put up over His head the written charge against Him : THIS IS יהושע , THE SOVEREIGN OF THE YEHUḎIM .
40027038	Then two robbers were impaled with Him , one on the right and another on the left .
40027039	And those passing by were blaspheming Him , shaking their heads ,
40027040	and saying , “ You who destroy the Dwelling Place and build it in three days , save Yourself ! If You are the Son of Elohim , come down from the stake . ”
40027041	And likewise the chief priests , with the scribes and elders , mocking , said ,
40027042	“ He saved others – He is unable to save Himself . If He is the Sovereign of Yisra’ĕl , let Him now come down from the stake , and we shall believe Him .
40027043	“ He trusted in Elohim , let Him rescue Him now if He desires Him , for He said , ‘ I am the Son of Elohim . ’ ”
40027044	And also the robbers who were impaled with Him reviled Him , saying the same .
40027045	And from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land , until the ninth hour .
40027046	And about the ninth hour יהושע cried out with a loud voice , saying , “ Ěli , Ěli , lemah sheḇaqtani ? ” that is , “ My Ěl , My Ěl , why have You forsaken Me ? ”
40027047	Some of those standing there , having heard , said , “ This One calls Ěliyahu ! ”
40027048	And immediately one of them ran and took a sponge , and filled it with sour wine and put it on a reed , and gave it to Him to drink .
40027049	But the rest said , “ Leave it , let us see if Ěliyahu comes to save Him . ”
40027050	And יהושע cried out again with a loud voice , and gave up His spirit .
40027051	And see , the veil of the Dwelling Place was torn in two from top to bottom , and the earth was shaken , and the rocks were split ,
40027052	and the tombs were opened , and many bodies of the set-apart ones who had fallen asleep were raised ,
40027053	and coming out of the tombs after His resurrection , they went into the set-apart city and appeared to many .
40027054	And when the captain and those with him , who were guarding יהושע , saw the earthquake and all that took place , they feared exceedingly , saying , “ Truly this was the Son of Elohim ! ”
40027055	And many women who followed יהושע from Galil , attending Him , were there , watching from a distance ,
40027056	among whom were Miryam from Mag̅dala , and Miryam the mother of Ya‛aqoḇ and Yosĕph , and the mother of Zaḇdai’s sons .
40027057	And when evening came , there came a rich man from Ramathayim , named Yosĕph , who himself had also become a taught one of יהושע .
40027058	He went to Pilate and asked for the body of יהושע . Then Pilate commanded the body to be given .
40027059	And having taken the body , Yosĕph wrapped it in clean linen ,
40027060	and laid it in his new tomb which he had hewn out of the rock . And he rolled a large stone against the door of the tomb , and went away .
40027061	And Miryam from Mag̅dala was there , and the other Miryam , sitting opposite the tomb .
40027062	On the next day , which was after the preparation , the chief priests and Pharisees gathered together to Pilate ,
40027063	saying , “ Master , we remember , while He was still alive , how that deceiver said , ‘ After three days I am raised . ’
40027064	“ Command , then , that the tomb be safeguarded until the third day , lest His taught ones come by night and steal Him away , and should say to the people , ‘ He was raised from the dead . ’ And the last deception shall be worse than the first . ”
40027065	So Pilate said to them , “ You have a watch , go , safeguard it as you know how . ”
40027066	And they went and safeguarded the tomb , sealing the stone and setting the watch .
40028001	Now after the Sabbath , toward dawn on the first day of the week , Miryam from Mag̅dala and the other Miryam came to see the tomb .
40028002	And see , there was a great earthquake , for a messenger of יהוה came down out of heaven , and came and rolled back the stone from the door , and sat on it .
40028003	And his appearance was like lightning , and his garments as white as snow .
40028004	And the guards trembled for fear of him , and became like dead men .
40028005	And the messenger responding , said to the women , “ Do not be afraid , for I know that you seek יהושע who was impaled .
40028006	“ He is not here , for He was raised , as He said . Come , see the place where the Master lay .
40028007	“ And go quickly , say to His taught ones that He was raised from the dead , and see , He is going before you to Galil . There you shall see Him . See , I have told you . ”
40028008	And they left the tomb quickly , with fear and great joy , and ran to report to His taught ones .
40028009	And as they were going to report to His taught ones , see , יהושע met them , saying , “ Greetings ! ” And they came and held Him by the feet and did bow to Him .
40028010	Then יהושע said to them , “ Do not be afraid . Go , report to My brothers , to go to Galil , and they shall see Me there . ”
40028011	And while they were going , see , some of the watch having gone into the city , reported to the chief priests all that took place .
40028012	And when they came together with the elders and taken counsel , they gave enough silver to the soldiers ,
40028013	saying , “ Say that His taught ones came at night and stole Him away while we slept .
40028014	“ And if this should be reported to the governor , we shall win him over and keep you out of trouble . ”
40028015	And having taken the silver they did as they were instructed . And this account was widely spread among the Yehuḏim , to this day .
40028016	And the eleven taught ones went away into Galil , to the mountain which יהושע had appointed for them .
40028017	And when they saw Him , they bowed to Him , but some doubted .
40028018	And יהושע came up and spoke to them , saying , “ All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth .
40028019	“ Therefore , go and make taught ones of all the nations , immersing them in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Set-apart Spirit ,
40028020	teaching them to guard all that I have commanded you . And see , I am with you always , until the end of the age . ” Amĕn .
41001001	The beginning of the Good News of יהושע Messiah , the Son of Elohim .
41001002	As it has been written in the Prophets , “ See , I send My messenger before Your face , who shall prepare Your way before You ,
41001003	a voice of one crying in the wilderness , ‘ Prepare the way of יהוה , make His paths straight . ’ ”
41001004	Yoḥanan came immersing in the wilderness and proclaiming an immersion of repentance for the forgiveness of sins .
41001005	And all the country of Yehuḏah , and those of Yerushalayim , went out to him and were all immersed by him in the Yardĕn River , confessing their sins .
41001006	And Yoḥanan was clothed with camel’s hair and a leather girdle around his waist , and eating locusts and wild honey .
41001007	And he proclaimed , saying , “ After me comes One who is mightier than I , whose sandal strap I am not worthy to stoop down and loosen .
41001008	“ I indeed did immerse you in water , but He shall immerse you in the Set-apart Spirit . ”
41001009	And it came to be in those days that יהושע came from Natsareth of Galil , and was immersed by Yoḥanan in the Yardĕn .
41001010	And immediately , coming up from the water , He saw the heavens being torn open and the Spirit coming down on Him like a dove .
41001011	And a voice came out of the heavens , “ You are My Son , the Beloved , in whom I did delight . ”
41001012	And immediately the Spirit drove Him into the wilderness .
41001013	And He was there in the wilderness forty days , tried by Satan , and was with the wild beasts . And the messengers attended Him .
41001014	And after Yoḥanan was delivered up , יהושע came to Galil , proclaiming the Good News of the reign of Elohim ,
41001015	and saying , “ The time has been filled , and the reign of Elohim has come near . Repent , and believe in the Good News . ”
41001016	And walking by the Sea of Galil , He saw Shim‛on , and Andri his brother , casting a net into the sea , for they were fishers .
41001017	And יהושע said to them , “ Come , follow Me , and I shall make you become fishers of men . ”
41001018	And immediately they left their nets and followed Him .
41001019	And having gone on a little from there , He saw Ya‛aqoḇ the son of Zaḇdai , and Yoḥanan his brother , and they were in the boat mending their nets .
41001020	And immediately He called them , and leaving their father Zaḇdai in the boat with the hired servants , they went after Him .
41001021	And they went into Kephar Naḥum , and immediately on the Sabbath He went into the congregation and taught .
41001022	And they were astonished at His teaching , for He was teaching them as possessing authority , and not as the scribes .
41001023	And there was a man in their congregation with an unclean spirit , and he cried out ,
41001024	saying , “ Ha ! What have we to do with You , יהושע of Natsareth ? Did You come to destroy us ? I know who You are : the Set-apart One of Elohim ! ”
41001025	And יהושע rebuked him , saying , “ Be silenced , and come out of him ! ”
41001026	And throwing him into convulsions , the unclean spirit called out with a loud voice , and came out of him .
41001027	And they were all so amazed , as to reason among themselves , saying , “ What is this , a fresh teaching ? With authority He commands even the unclean spirits , and they obey Him ! ”
41001028	And news about Him immediately spread into all the country around Galil .
41001029	And coming out of the congregation , they went straight to the house of Shim‛on and Andri , with Ya‛aqoḇ and Yoḥanan .
41001030	And the mother-in-law of Shim‛on lay sick with inflammation , and immediately they spoke to Him about her .
41001031	And having come , He took her by the hand and lifted her up , and immediately the inflammation left her , and she served them .
41001032	And when evening came , when the sun had set , they brought to Him all who were sick and those who were demon-possessed .
41001033	And the entire city had gathered at the door .
41001034	And He healed many who were sick with various diseases , and cast out many demons , and was not allowing the demons to speak , because they knew Him .
41001035	And having risen very early in the morning , while still dark , He went out , and went away to a lonely place , and there He prayed .
41001036	And Shim‛on and those who were with Him searched for Him ,
41001037	and when they found Him , they said to Him , “ All are seeking You . ”
41001038	And He said to them , “ Let us go into the neighbouring towns , so that I proclaim there also , because for this I have come forth . ”
41001039	And He was proclaiming in their congregations , in all Galil , and casting out demons .
41001040	And a leper came to Him , calling upon Him , kneeling down to Him and saying to Him , “ If You desire , You are able to make me clean . ”
41001041	And יהושע , moved with compassion , stretched out His hand and touched him , and said to him , “ I desire it . Be cleansed . ”
41001042	And immediately the leprosy left him , and he was cleansed .
41001043	And having strictly warned him , He immediately sent him away ,
41001044	and said to him , “ See , say none at all to anyone , but go show yourself to the priest , and offer for your cleansing what Mosheh ordered , as a witness to them . ”
41001045	But he went out and began to publish it so much , and to spread the word , that יהושע was no longer able to openly enter the city , but was outside in lonely places . Yet they came to Him from all directions .
41002001	And some days later He again entered into Kephar Naḥum , and it was heard that He was in the house .
41002002	And so many gathered together , that there was no more room , not even at the door . And He spoke the Word to them .
41002003	And they came to Him , bringing a paralytic , carried by four .
41002004	And not being able to come near Him because of the crowd , they uncovered the roof where He was . And when they had broken through , they let down the bed on which the paralytic was lying .
41002005	And when יהושע saw their belief , He said to the paralytic , “ Son , your sins are forgiven you . ”
41002006	Now some of the scribes were sitting there , and reasoning in their hearts ,
41002007	“ Why does this One talk like this ? He is blaspheming ! Who is able to forgive sins but Elohim alone ? ”
41002008	And immediately יהושע , knowing in His spirit that they were reasoning that way within themselves , said to them , “ Why do you reason about all this in your hearts ?
41002009	“ Which is easier , to say to the paralytic , ‘ Your sins are forgiven , ’ or to say , ‘ Rise , take up your bed and walk’ ?
41002010	“ But in order for you to know that the Son of Aḏam possesses authority on earth to forgive sins . . . ” He said to the paralytic ,
41002011	“ I say to you , rise , take up your bed , and go to your house . ”
41002012	And he rose straightaway , and took up the bed , and went out before all , so that all were amazed and praised Elohim , saying , “ We have never seen the like of it ! ”
41002013	And He went out again by the sea , and all the crowd was coming to Him , and He taught them .
41002014	And passing by , He saw Lĕwi the son of Alphai sitting at the tax office , and said to him , “ Follow Me . ” And having risen he followed Him .
41002015	And it came to be , as He sat at the table at his house , that many tax collectors and sinners also sat with יהושע and His taught ones , for there were many , and they followed Him .
41002016	And when the scribes and Pharisees saw Him eating with the tax collectors and sinners , they said to His taught ones , “ Why does He eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners ? ”
41002017	And hearing this , יהושע said to them , “ Those who are strong have no need of a physician , but those who are sick . I did not come to call the righteous to repentance , but sinners . ”
41002018	And the taught ones of Yoḥanan and of the Pharisees were fasting . And they came and said to Him , “ Why do the taught ones of Yoḥanan and of the Pharisees fast , but Your taught ones do not fast ? ”
41002019	And יהושע said to them , “ Are the friends of the bridegroom able to fast while the bridegroom is with them ? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they are not able to fast .
41002020	“ But the days shall come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them , and then they shall fast in those days .
41002021	“ And no one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment , otherwise the renewed piece pulls away from the old , and the tear is made worse .
41002022	“ And no one puts new wine into old wineskins , otherwise the new wine bursts the wineskins , and the wine runs out , and the wineskins are ruined . But new wine is to be put into fresh wineskins . ”
41002023	And it came to be that He went through the grainfields on the Sabbath . And as they went His taught ones began to pluck heads of grain ,
41002024	and the Pharisees said to Him , “ Look , why do they do what is not right on the Sabbath ? ”
41002025	And He said to them , “ Have you never read what Dawiḏ did when he had need and was hungry , he and those with him ?
41002026	“ How he went into the House of Elohim , while Eḇyathar was high priest , and ate the showbread , which is not right to eat , except for the priests , and he gave it also to those who were with him ? ”
41002027	And He said to them , “ The Sabbath was made for man , and not man for the Sabbath .
41002028	“ So the Son of Aḏam is also Master of the Sabbath . ”
41003001	And He went into the congregation again , and a man who had a withered hand was there .
41003002	And they were watching Him , whether He would heal him on the Sabbath , so as to accuse Him .
41003003	And He said to the man who had the withered hand , “ Get up to the middle . ”
41003004	And He said to them , “ Is it right to do good on the Sabbath , or to do evil , to save life or to kill ? ” But they remained silent .
41003005	And having looked around on them with displeasure , being grieved at the hardness of their hearts , He said to the man , “ Stretch out your hand . ” And he stretched it out , and his hand was restored as healthy as the other .
41003006	And the Pharisees went out and immediately plotted with the Herodians against Him , how to destroy Him .
41003007	But יהושע withdrew with His taught ones to the sea . And a great crowd from Galil followed Him , and from Yehuḏah .
41003008	Even from Yerushalayim , and from Eḏom and beyond the Yardĕn , and those around Tsor and Tsiḏon , a large crowd came to Him when they heard how much He was doing .
41003009	And He spoke to His taught ones , that a small boat should be kept ready for Him because of the crowd , lest they should press upon Him .
41003010	For He healed many , so that as many as had afflictions fell upon Him to touch Him .
41003011	And the unclean spirits , whenever they saw Him , fell down before Him and cried out , saying , “ You are the Son of Elohim . ”
41003012	But He warned them many times that they should not make Him known .
41003013	And He went up on the mountain and called to Him whom He wished , and they came to Him .
41003014	And He appointed twelve to be with Him , and to be sent out to proclaim ,
41003015	and to possess authority to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons .
41003016	And He appointed the twelve : Shim‛on , to whom He added the name Kĕpha ;
41003017	and Ya‛aqoḇ the son of Zaḇdai , and Yoḥanan the brother of Ya‛aqoḇ , to whom He added the name Beni-Reg̅es , that is , “ Sons of Thunder , ”
41003018	and Andri , and Philip , and Bartholomi , and Mattithyahu , and T’oma , and Ya‛aqoḇ son of Alphai , and Taddai , and Shim‛on the Kena‛anite ;
41003019	and Yehuḏah from Qerioth , who did also deliver Him up . And they went into a house ,
41003020	and again the crowd came together , so that they were unable even to eat bread .
41003021	And when His relatives heard about this , they went out to seize Him , for they said , “ He is out of His mind . ”
41003022	And the scribes who came down from Yerushalayim said , “ He has Be‛elzebul , ” and , “ He casts out demons by the ruler of the demons . ”
41003023	And calling them near He said to them in parables , “ How is Satan able to cast out Satan ?
41003024	“ And if a reign is divided against itself , that reign is unable to stand .
41003025	“ And if a house is divided against itself , that house is unable to stand .
41003026	“ And if Satan has risen up against himself , and is divided , he is unable to stand , but has an end .
41003027	“ No one is able to enter a strong man’s house and plunder his goods , unless he first binds the strong man , and then he shall plunder his house .
41003028	“ Truly , I say to you , all the sins shall be forgiven the sons of men , and whatever blasphemies they speak ,
41003029	but he who blasphemes against the Set-apart Spirit has no forgiveness forever , but is subject to everlasting judgment , ”
41003030	because they said , “ He has an unclean spirit . ”
41003031	And His brothers and His mother came , and standing outside they sent to Him , calling Him .
41003032	And a crowd was sitting around Him . And they said to Him , “ See , Your mother and Your brothers are outside seeking You . ”
41003033	But He answered them , saying , “ Who is My mother , or My brothers ? ”
41003034	And looking about on those sitting round Him , He said , “ See My mother and My brothers !
41003035	“ For whoever does the desire of Elohim is My brother and My sister and mother . ”
41004001	And He began to teach again by the sea , and a large crowd was gathered to Him , so that He entered into a boat , to sit in the sea . And all the crowd was on the land facing the sea .
41004002	And He taught them much in parables , and said to them in His teaching :
41004003	“ Listen ! See , a sower went out to sow .
41004004	“ And it came to be , as he sowed , some fell by the wayside , and the birds of the heaven came and devoured it .
41004005	“ And other fell on rocky places , where it had not much soil . And immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of soil .
41004006	“ But when the sun was up it was scorched , and because it had no root it withered away .
41004007	“ And other fell among thorns . And the thorns grew up and choked it , and it yielded no crop .
41004008	“ And other fell on good soil and yielded a crop that came up , grew and yielded a crop , some thirtyfold , and some sixty , and some a hundred . ”
41004009	And He said to them , “ He who has ears to hear , let him hear ! ”
41004010	And when He was alone , those about Him , with the twelve , asked Him about the parable .
41004011	And He said to them , “ To you it has been given to know the secret of the reign of Elohim , but to those who are outside , all are done in parables ,
41004012	so that ‘ seeing they see but do not perceive , and hearing they hear but do not understand , lest they should turn and their sins be forgiven them . ’ ”
41004013	And He said to them , “ Do you not understand this parable ? How then shall you understand all the parables ?
41004014	“ The sower sows the word .
41004015	“ These , then , are the ones by the wayside where the word is sown . And when they hear , Satan comes immediately and takes away the word that was sown in their hearts .
41004016	“ And likewise these are the ones sown on rocky places , who , when they hear the word , immediately receive it with joy ,
41004017	and they have no root in themselves , but are short-lived . Then when pressure or persecution arises because of the word , immediately they stumble .
41004018	“ And others are those sown among thorns , these are they who hear the word ,
41004019	and the worries of this age , and the deceit of riches , and the desires for other matters , entering in , choke the word , and it becomes fruitless .
41004020	“ And those sown on good soil , are those who hear the word , and accept it , and bear fruit , some thirtyfold , and some sixty , and some a hundred . ”
41004021	And He said to them , “ Would a lamp be brought to be put under a basket or under a bed ? Is it not to be put on a lampstand ?
41004022	“ For whatever is hidden shall be revealed , and whatever has been kept secret , shall come to light .
41004023	“ If anyone has ears to hear , let him hear . ”
41004024	And He said to them , “ Take heed what you hear . With the same measure you use , it shall be measured to you , and more shall be added to you who hear .
41004025	“ For whoever possesses , to him more shall be given ; but whoever does not possess , even what he possesses shall be taken away from him . ”
41004026	And He said , “ The reign of Elohim is as when a man scatters seed on the ground ,
41004027	then sleeps by night and rises by day , while the seed sprouts and grows , he himself does not know how .
41004028	“ For the soil yields crops by itself : first the blade , then the head , after that the completed grain in the head .
41004029	“ And when the crop is ready , immediately he puts in the sickle , because the harvest has come . ”
41004030	And He said , “ To what shall we compare the reign of Elohim ? Or with what parable shall we present it ?
41004031	“ Like a mustard seed , which , when it is sown on the ground , is smaller than all the seeds on earth ,
41004032	and when it is sown , it grows up and becomes greater than all plants , and forms large branches , so that the birds of the heaven are able to nest under its shade . ”
41004033	And with many such parables He was speaking to them the word as they were able to hear ,
41004034	and He was not speaking to them without parables . And when they were alone , He explained all to His taught ones .
41004035	And on the same day , when evening had come , He said to them , “ Let us pass over to the other side . ”
41004036	And having left the crowd , they took Him along in the boat , as He was . And other little boats were also with Him .
41004037	And there came a great windstorm , and the waves beat into the boat , so that it was already being filled .
41004038	And He was in the stern , asleep on a cushion . And they woke Him up and said to Him , “ Teacher , is it no concern to You that we perish ? ”
41004039	And having been awakened He rebuked the wind , and said to the sea , “ Peace , be still ! ” And the wind ceased and there was a great calm .
41004040	And He said to them , “ Why are you so afraid ? Have you not yet belief ? ”
41004041	And they feared exceedingly , and asked each other , “ Who then is this , that even the wind and the sea obey Him ! ”
41005001	And they came to the other side of the sea , to the country of the Gaḏarenes .
41005002	And when He came out of the boat , immediately there met Him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit ,
41005003	who had his dwelling among the tombs . And no one was able to bind him , not even with chains ,
41005004	because he had often been bound with shackles and chains but the chains had been pulled apart by him , and the shackles broken in pieces , and no one was able to tame him .
41005005	And continually , night and day , he was in the mountains and in the tombs , crying out and cutting himself with stones .
41005006	And seeing יהושע from a distance , he ran and bowed down to Him ,
41005007	and having called out with a loud voice , said , “ What have I to do with You , יהושע , Son of the Most High Ěl ? Swear to Elohim not to torture me . ”
41005008	For He had said to him , “ Come out of the man , unclean spirit ! ”
41005009	And He was asking him , “ What is your name ? ” And he answered , saying , “ My name is Legion , because we are many . ”
41005010	And he begged Him very much that He would not send them out of the country .
41005011	Now a great herd of pigs was there , feeding near the mountains .
41005012	And all the demons begged Him , saying , “ Send us to the pigs , so that we enter into them . ”
41005013	And He gave them permission . And the unclean spirits came out and entered into the pigs – they were about two thousand – and the herd rushed down the steep place into the sea , and drowned in the sea .
41005014	And those who fed the pigs fled , and reported it in the city and in the country . And they went out to see what had taken place .
41005015	So they came to יהושע , and saw the demon-possessed one , him who had the legion , sitting , and dressed , and in his right mind . And they were afraid .
41005016	And those who saw it related to them what was done to the demon-possessed one , and about the pigs .
41005017	And they began to plead with Him to leave their borders .
41005018	And as He was entering into the boat , he who had been demon-possessed begged Him that he might be with Him .
41005019	And יהושע did not allow him , but said to him , “ Go home to your friends , and report to them what the Master has done for you , and how He had compassion on you . ”
41005020	And he left and began to proclaim in Dekapolis all that יהושע had done for him , and all marvelled .
41005021	And when יהושע had passed over again by boat to the other side , a large crowd assembled to Him , and He was by the sea .
41005022	And see , one of the rulers of the congregation came , Ya’ir by name . And when he saw Him , he fell at His feet ,
41005023	and begged Him strongly , saying , “ My little daughter lies at the point of death . Come , lay Your hands on her to heal her , and she shall live . ”
41005024	And He went with him . And a large crowd was following Him , and they were thronging Him .
41005025	And a certain woman had a flow of blood for twelve years ,
41005026	and had suffered much from many physicians , and spent all that she had and was no better , but rather became worse .
41005027	Having heard about יהושע , she came behind Him in the crowd and touched His garment ,
41005028	for she said , “ If I only touch His garments , I shall be made well . ”
41005029	And immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up , and she felt in her body that she was healed of the affliction .
41005030	And immediately יהושע , knowing in Himself that power had gone out of Him , turned around in the crowd and said , “ Who touched My garments ? ”
41005031	And His taught ones said to Him , “ You see the crowd is thronging You , and You say , ‘ Who touched Me ? ’ ”
41005032	And He was looking around to see her who did this .
41005033	And the woman , fearing and trembling , knowing what was done to her , came and fell down before Him and spoke to Him all the truth .
41005034	And He said to her , “ Daughter , your belief has healed you . Go in peace , and be relieved from your affliction . ”
41005035	As He was speaking , they came from the ruler of the congregation’s house , saying to him , “ Your daughter is dead . Why trouble the Teacher any further ? ”
41005036	But having heard the word that was spoken , יהושע said to the ruler of the congregation , “ Do not be afraid – only believe . ”
41005037	And He allowed no one to follow Him except Kĕpha , and Ya‛aqoḇ , and Yoḥanan the brother of Ya‛aqoḇ .
41005038	So they came to the house of the ruler of the congregation , and saw a commotion , and much weeping and lamenting .
41005039	And coming in He said to them , “ Why make this commotion and weep ? The child has not died , but is sleeping . ”
41005040	And they were laughing at Him . And when He had put them all out , He took the father and the mother of the child , and those who were with Him , and went in where the child was lying .
41005041	And taking the child by the hand He said to her , “ Talitha , qumi , ” which is translated , “ Little girl , I say to you , arise . ”
41005042	And immediately the girl rose up and was walking , for she was twelve years old . And they were completely astonished .
41005043	But He ordered them many times that no one should know it , and said that she should be given food to eat .
41006001	And He went away from there and came to His own country , and His taught ones followed Him .
41006002	And Sabbath having come , He began to teach in the congregation . And many who heard Him were astonished , saying , “ Where did He get all this ? And what wisdom is this which is given to Him , that such miracles are done through His hands ?
41006003	“ Is this not the carpenter , the Son of Miryam , and brother of Ya‛aqoḇ , and Yosĕph , and Yehuḏah , and Shim‛on ? And are not His sisters here with us ? ” And they stumbled in Him .
41006004	And יהושע said to them , “ A prophet is not unappreciated except in his own country , and among his own relatives , and in his own house . ”
41006005	And He was unable to do any miracle there , except that He laid His hands on a few sick ones and healed them .
41006006	And He marvelled because of their unbelief . And He was going around among the villages , teaching .
41006007	And He called the twelve near , and began to send them out two by two , and gave them authority over unclean spirits .
41006008	And He instructed them to take none at all for the journey except a staff – no bag , no bread , no copper in their money belts ,
41006009	but to wear sandals , and not to wear two undergarments .
41006010	And He said to them , “ Wherever you enter into a house , stay there until you leave that place .
41006011	“ And any place that does not receive you or listen to you , when you leave there , shake off the dust under your feet as a witness against them . Truly , I say to you , it shall be more bearable for Seḏom and Amorah in the day of judgment than for that city ! ”
41006012	And they went out and proclaimed that men should repent .
41006013	And they were casting out many demons , and they were anointing with oil many who were sick , and they were healing them .
41006014	And Sovereign Herodes heard , for His Name had become well-known . And he said , “ Yoḥanan the Immerser has been raised from the dead , and because of this these powers are at work in him . ”
41006015	Others said , “ He is Ěliyahu . ” And others said , “ He is a prophet – like one of the prophets . ”
41006016	But when Herodes heard , he said , “ This one is Yoḥanan whom I beheaded , he has been raised from the dead ! ”
41006017	For Herodes himself had sent and seized Yoḥanan , and bound him in prison because of Herodias , his brother Philip’s wife , because he had married her ,
41006018	for Yoḥanan had said to Herodes , “ It is not right for you to have your brother’s wife . ”
41006019	So Herodias held a grudge against him and wished to kill him , but was unable ,
41006020	for Herodes feared Yoḥanan , knowing that he was a righteous and set-apart man , and he protected him . And when he heard him , he was much perplexed , yet heard him gladly .
41006021	And a suitable day came when Herodes on his birthday gave a feast for his great men , and the high officers , and the chief men of Galil .
41006022	And when the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced , and pleased Herodes and those who sat with him , the sovereign said to the girl , “ Ask me whatever you wish , and I shall give it to you . ”
41006023	And he swore to her , “ Whatever you ask me , I shall give you , up to half of my reign . ”
41006024	And she went out and said to her mother , “ What shall I ask ? ” And she said , “ The head of Yoḥanan the Immerser ! ”
41006025	And coming in immediately with haste to the sovereign she asked , saying , “ I wish that you give me at once the head of Yoḥanan the Immerser on a dish . ”
41006026	And the sovereign , becoming deeply grieved , because of the oaths , and because of those who sat with him , did not wish to refuse her .
41006027	And the sovereign straightaway sent an executioner and commanded his head to be brought . And he went and beheaded him in prison ,
41006028	and brought his head on a dish , and gave it to the girl . And the girl gave it to her mother .
41006029	And when his taught ones heard of it , they came and took away his dead body and laid it in a tomb .
41006030	And the emissaries gathered to יהושע and reported to Him all , both what they had done and what they had taught .
41006031	And He said to them , “ Come aside by yourselves to a lonely place and rest a little ” – for there were many coming and going , and they did not even have time to eat .
41006032	And they went away to a lonely place in the boat by themselves .
41006033	But they saw them going , and many recognised Him and ran there on foot from all the cities , and came before them and came together to Him .
41006034	And having gone out , יהושע saw a large crowd and was moved with compassion for them because they were like sheep not having a shepherd . And He began to teach them many matters .
41006035	And as the hour grew late , His taught ones came to Him and said , “ This is a lonely place , and now the hour is late .
41006036	“ Send them away , so that they go into the surrounding country and villages and buy themselves bread , since they have no food to eat . ”
41006037	But He answering , said to them , “ You give them to eat . ” And they said to Him , “ Should we go and buy two hundred silver pieces worth of bread and give them to eat ? ”
41006038	Then He said to them , “ How many loaves do you have ? Go and see . ” And when they found out they said , “ Five , and two fishes . ”
41006039	And He ordered them to make them all sit down in groups on the green grass .
41006040	And they sat down in groups , in hundreds and in fifties .
41006041	And taking the five loaves and the two fishes , looking up to the heaven , He blessed and broke the loaves , and gave them to His taught ones to set before them . And the two fishes He divided among them all .
41006042	And all ate and were satisfied .
41006043	And they picked up twelve baskets , filled with pieces , also from the fishes .
41006044	Now those who ate the loaves were about five thousand men .
41006045	And immediately He made His taught ones enter into the boat , and to go before Him to the other side , to Bĕyth Tsaiḏa , while He was dismissing the crowd .
41006046	And having sent them away , He went away to the mountain to pray .
41006047	And when evening came , the boat was in the middle of the sea . And He was alone on the land .
41006048	And seeing them straining at rowing – for the wind was against them – at about the fourth watch of the night , He came to them walking on the sea , and He wished to pass them by .
41006049	And when they saw Him walking on the sea , they thought it was a phantom , and cried out ,
41006050	for they all saw Him and were troubled . And immediately He spoke to them and said to them , “ Take courage , it is I . Do not be afraid . ”
41006051	And He went up to them , into the boat , and the wind ceased . And they were exceedingly amazed in themselves , and marvelled .
41006052	For they did not understand about the loaves , because their heart was hardened .
41006053	And having passed over , they came to the land of Gennĕsar and drew to shore .
41006054	And when they came out of the boat , He was immediately recognised ,
41006055	and all that neighbourhood ran about , and began to carry about on beds those who were sick to wherever they heard He was .
41006056	And wherever He went , into villages , or cities , or the country , they were laying the sick in the market-places , and begged Him to let them touch if only the tzitzit of His garment . And as many as touched Him were healed .
41007001	And the Pharisees and some of the scribes assembled to Him , having come from Yerushalayim .
41007002	And seeing some of His taught ones eat bread with defiled , that is , with unwashed hands , they found fault .
41007003	For the Pharisees , and all the Yehuḏim , do not eat unless they wash their hands thoroughly , holding fast the tradition of the elders ,
41007004	and coming from the market-place , they do not eat unless they wash . And there are many other traditions which they have received and hold fast – the washing of cups and utensils and copper vessels and couches .
41007005	Then the Pharisees and scribes asked Him , “ Why do Your taught ones not walk according to the tradition of the elders , but eat bread with unwashed hands ? ”
41007006	And He answering , said to them , “ Well did Yeshayahu prophesy concerning you hypocrites , as it has been written , ‘ This people respect Me with their lips , but their heart is far from Me .
41007007	And in vain do they worship Me , teaching as teachings the commands of men . ’
41007008	“ Forsaking the command of Elohim , you hold fast the tradition of men . ”
41007009	And He said to them , “ Well do you set aside the command of Elohim , in order to guard your tradition .
41007010	“ For Mosheh said , ‘ Respect your father and your mother , ’ and , ‘ He who curses father or mother , let him be put to death . ’
41007011	“ But you say , ‘ If a man says to his father or mother , “ Whatever profit you might have received from me , is Qorban ( that is , a gift ) , ” ’
41007012	you no longer let him do any matter at all for his father or his mother ,
41007013	nullifying the Word of Elohim through your tradition which you have handed down . And many such traditions you do . ”
41007014	And calling the crowd to Him , He said to them , “ Hear Me , everyone , and understand :
41007015	“ There is no matter that enters a man from outside which is able to defile him , but it is what comes out of him that defiles the man .
41007016	“ If anyone has ears to hear , let him hear ! ”
41007017	And when He went from the crowd into a house , His taught ones asked Him concerning the parable .
41007018	And He said to them , “ Are you also without understanding ? Do you not perceive that whatever enters a man from outside is unable to defile him ,
41007019	because it does not enter his heart but his stomach , and is eliminated , thus purging all the foods ? ”
41007020	And He said , “ What comes out of a man , that defiles a man .
41007021	“ For from within , out of the heart of men , proceed evil reasonings , adulteries , whorings , murders ,
41007022	thefts , greedy desires , wickednesses , deceit , indecency , an evil eye , blasphemy , pride , foolishness .
41007023	“ All these wicked matters come from within and defile a man . ”
41007024	And rising up from there He went to the borders of Tsor and Tsiḏon . And entering into a house He wished no one to know it , but it was impossible to be hidden .
41007025	For a woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit heard about Him , and she came and fell at His feet .
41007026	Now the woman was a Greek , a Syro-Phoenician by birth , and she kept asking Him to cast the demon out of her daughter .
41007027	And יהושע said to her , “ Let the children be satisfied first , for it is not good to take the children’s bread and throw it to the little dogs . ”
41007028	But she answering , said to Him , “ Yea , Master , for even the little dogs under the table eat from the children’s crumbs . ”
41007029	And He said to her , “ Because of this word go , the demon has gone out of your daughter . ”
41007030	And having come into her house , she found the demon gone out , and her daughter lying on the bed .
41007031	And again , going out from the borders of Tsor and Tsiḏon , He came to the Sea of Galil , through the midst of the borders of Dekapolis .
41007032	And they brought to Him one who was deaf and spoke with difficulty , and they begged Him to lay His hand upon him .
41007033	And taking him away from the crowd , He put His fingers in his ears , and having spit , He touched his tongue .
41007034	And looking up to the heaven , He sighed , and said to him , “ Ephphatha , ” that is , “ Be opened . ”
41007035	And immediately his ears were opened , and the binding of his tongue was loosed , and he was speaking plainly .
41007036	And He ordered them , that they should say it to no one , but the more He ordered them , the more they published it .
41007037	And they were immeasurably astonished , saying , “ He has done all well . He makes even the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak . ”
41008001	In those days , the crowd being very great and not having any to eat , יהושע called His taught ones near and said to them ,
41008002	“ I have compassion on the crowd , for they have now been with Me three days and do not have food to eat .
41008003	“ And if I dismiss them unfed to their home , they shall faint on the way , for some of them have come from far . ”
41008004	And His taught ones answered Him , “ How shall anyone be able to feed these people with bread here in the desert ? ”
41008005	And He asked them , “ How many loaves do you have ? ” And they said , “ Seven . ”
41008006	And He commanded the crowd to sit down on the ground . And taking the seven loaves , giving thanks , He broke them and gave them to His taught ones to set before them . And they set them before the crowd .
41008007	And they had a few small fishes . And having blessed , He said to set them also before them .
41008008	And they ate and were satisfied , and they picked up seven large baskets of broken pieces .
41008009	And those eating were about four thousand , and He dismissed them .
41008010	And immediately entering into the boat with His taught ones , He came to the parts of Dalmanutha .
41008011	And the Pharisees came out and began to dispute with Him , seeking from Him a sign from heaven , trying Him .
41008012	And sighing deeply in His spirit He said , “ Why does this generation seek a sign ? Truly , I say to you , no sign shall be given to this generation . ”
41008013	And leaving them , again entering into the boat , He went away to the other side .
41008014	And they had forgotten to take bread , and they did not have more than one loaf with them in the boat .
41008015	And He was warning them , saying , “ Mind ! Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the leaven of Herodes . ”
41008016	And they were reasoning with one another , saying , “ Because we have no bread . ”
41008017	And יהושע , being aware of it , said to them , “ Why do you reason because you have no bread ? Do you not yet perceive nor understand ? Is your heart still hardened ?
41008018	“ Having eyes , do you not see ? And having ears , do you not hear ? And do you not remember ?
41008019	“ When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand , how many baskets filled with broken pieces did you pick up ? ” They said to Him , “ Twelve . ”
41008020	“ And when I broke the seven for the four thousand , how many large baskets filled with broken pieces did you pick up ? ” And they said , “ Seven . ”
41008021	And He said to them , “ How do you not understand ? ”
41008022	And He came to Bĕyth Tsaiḏa , and they brought a blind man to Him , and begged Him to touch him .
41008023	And taking the blind man by the hand He led him out of the village . And having spit on his eyes , laying hands on him , He asked him , “ Do you see at all ? ”
41008024	And he looked up and said , “ I see men like trees , walking . ”
41008025	Then He placed His hands on his eyes again and made him look up . And he was restored , and saw all clearly .
41008026	And He sent him away to his home , saying , “ Do not go into the village . ”
41008027	And יהושע and His taught ones went out to the villages of Caesarea Philippi . And on the way He asked His taught ones , saying to them , “ Who do men say I am ? ”
41008028	And they said to Him , “ Yoḥanan the Immerser , and others , Ěliyahu , but others , one of the prophets . ”
41008029	And He asked them , “ And you , who do you say I am ? ” And Kĕpha answering , said to Him , “ You are the Messiah . ”
41008030	And He warned them that they should speak to no one about Him .
41008031	And He began to teach them that the Son of Aḏam has to suffer much , and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes , and be killed , and after three days to rise again .
41008032	And He was speaking about this openly . Then Kĕpha , taking Him aside , began to rebuke Him .
41008033	And turning around and seeing His taught ones , He rebuked Kĕpha , saying , “ Get behind Me , Satan ! For your thoughts are not those of Elohim , but those of men . ”
41008034	And calling near the crowd with His taught ones , He said to them , “ Whoever desires to come after Me , let him deny himself , and take up his stake , and follow Me .
41008035	“ For whoever desires to save his life shall lose it , but whoever loses his life for the sake of Me and the Good News , he shall save it .
41008036	“ For what shall it profit a man if he gains all the world , and loses his own life ?
41008037	“ Or what shall a man give in exchange for his life ?
41008038	“ For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words in this adulterous and sinning generation , of him the Son of Aḏam also shall be ashamed when He comes in the esteem of His Father with the set-apart messengers . ”
41010001	And rising up from there He came into the borders of Yehuḏah by the other side of the Yardĕn . And crowds gathered to Him again , and as He usually did , He was teaching them again .
41010002	And Pharisees came and asked Him , “ Is it right for a man to put away his wife ? ” – trying Him .
41010003	And He answering , said to them , “ What did Mosheh command you ? ”
41010004	And they said , “ Mosheh allowed a man to write a certificate of divorce , and to put her away . ”
41010005	And יהושע said to them , “ Because of the hardness of your heart he wrote you this command .
41010006	“ However , from the beginning of the creation , Elohim ‘ made them male and female . ’
41010007	‘ For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife ,
41010008	and the two shall become one flesh , ’ so that they are no longer two , but one flesh .
41010009	“ Therefore what Elohim has joined together , let man not separate . ”
41010010	And in the house His taught ones asked Him about this again .
41010011	And He said to them , “ Whoever puts away his wife and marries another commits adultery against her .
41010012	“ And if a woman puts away her husband and marries another , she commits adultery . ”
41010013	And they were bringing little children for Him to touch them , but the taught ones were rebuking those who were bringing them .
41010014	And when יהושע saw it , He was much displeased and said to them , “ Let the little children come to Me , and do not forbid them , for of such is the reign of Elohim .
41010015	“ Truly , I say to you , whoever does not receive the reign of Elohim as a little child , shall certainly not enter into it . ”
41010016	And taking them up in His arms , laying His hands on them , He blessed them .
41010017	And as He was setting out on the way , one came running , and knelt before Him , and asked Him , “ Good Teacher , what shall I do to inherit everlasting life ? ”
41010018	And יהושע said to him , “ Why do you call Me good ? No one is good except One – Elohim .
41010019	“ You know the commands , ‘ Do not commit adultery , ’ ‘ Do not murder , ’ ‘ Do not steal , ’ ‘ Do not bear false witness , ’ ‘ Do not rob , ’ ‘ Respect your father and your mother . ’ ”
41010020	And he answering , said to Him , “ Teacher , all these I have watched over from my youth . ”
41010021	And יהושע , looking at him , loved him , and said to him , “ One matter you lack : Go , sell all you possess and give to the poor , and you shall have treasure in heaven . And come , follow Me , taking up the stake . ”
41010022	But he , being sad at this word , went away grieved , for he had many possessions .
41010023	And יהושע , looking around , said to His taught ones , “ How hard it is for those who have riches to enter into the reign of Elohim ! ”
41010024	And the taught ones were astonished at His words . And יהושע responding , said to them again , “ Children , how hard it is for those who trust in riches to enter into the reign of Elohim !
41010025	“ It is easier for a camel to enter through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the reign of Elohim . ”
41010026	And they were immeasurably astonished , saying among themselves , “ Who then is able to be saved ? ”
41010027	And looking at them , יהושע said , “ With men it is impossible , but not with Elohim , for with Elohim all is possible . ”
41010028	And Kĕpha began to say to Him , “ See , we have left all and we have followed You . ”
41010029	יהושע said , “ Truly , I say to you , there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands , for the sake of Me and the Good News ,
41010030	who shall not receive a hundredfold now in this time , houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands , with persecutions , and in the age to come , everlasting life .
41010031	“ But many who are first shall be last , and the last first . ”
41010032	And they were on the way , going up to Yerushalayim , and יהושע was going before them . And they were astonished , and those who followed were afraid . And again He took the twelve aside and began to say to them what was about to befall Him :
41010033	“ See , we are going up to Yerushalayim , and the Son of Aḏam shall be delivered to the chief priests and to the scribes , and they shall condemn Him to death and shall deliver Him to the gentiles ,
41010034	and they shall mock Him , and flog Him , and spit on Him , and kill Him . And the third day He shall rise again . ”
41010035	And Ya‛aqoḇ and Yoḥanan , the sons of Zaḇdai , came up to Him , saying , “ Teacher , we wish that You would do for us whatever we ask . ”
41010036	And He said to them , “ What do you wish Me to do for you ? ”
41010037	And they said to Him , “ Grant us to be seated in Your esteem , one on Your right hand and the other on Your left . ”
41010038	But יהושע said to them , “ You do not know what you ask . Are you able to drink the cup that I drink , and be immersed with the immersion that I am immersed with ? ”
41010039	And they said to Him , “ We are able . ” And יהושע said to them , “ You shall indeed drink the cup that I drink , and with the immersion I am immersed with you shall be immersed ,
41010040	but to sit on My right hand and on My left is not Mine to give , but it is for those for whom it has been prepared . ”
41010041	And when the ten heard it , they began to be sorely displeased with Ya‛aqoḇ and Yoḥanan .
41010042	And יהושע , calling them near , said to them , “ You know that those who think to rule the gentiles are masters over them , and their great ones exercise authority over them .
41010043	“ But it is not so among you , but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant .
41010044	“ And whoever wishes to be first among you , shall be servant of all .
41010045	“ For even the Son of Aḏam did not come to be served , but to serve , and to give His life a ransom for many . ”
41010046	And they came to Yeriḥo . And as He was leaving Yeriḥo with His taught ones and a large crowd , blind Bartimai , the son of Timai , was sitting by the way begging .
41010047	And when he heard that it was יהושע of Natsareth , he began to cry out and to say , “ יהושע , Son of Dawiḏ , have compassion on me ! ”
41010048	And many were reprimanding him to be silent , but he cried out all the more , “ Son of Dawiḏ , have compassion on me ! ”
41010049	And יהושע stopped and said , “ Call him . ” And they called the blind man , saying to him , “ Take courage , arise , He is calling you . ”
41010050	And he , throwing aside his garment , rose and came to יהושע .
41010051	And יהושע responding , said to him , “ What do you desire I do for you ? ” And the blind man said to Him , “ Rabboni , that I receive my sight . ”
41010052	And יהושע said to him , “ Go , your belief has healed you . ” And immediately he saw again and followed יהושע on the way .
41011001	And when they came near Yerushalayim , to Bĕyth Phag̅i and Bĕyth Anyah , at the Mount of Olives , He sent out two of His taught ones ,
41011002	and said to them , “ Go into the village opposite you , and immediately entering into it , you shall find a colt tied , on which no one has sat . Loosen it and bring it .
41011003	“ And if anyone says to you , ‘ Why are you doing this ? ’ say , ‘ The Master needs it and shall send it back straightaway . ’ ”
41011004	So they went away , and found the colt tied by the door outside on the street , and they loosened it .
41011005	And some of those standing there said to them , “ What are you doing , loosening the colt ? ”
41011006	And they said to them , as יהושע had said . So they let them go .
41011007	And they brought the colt to יהושע and threw their garments on it , and He sat on it .
41011008	And many spread their garments on the way , and others were cutting down branches from the trees and were spreading them on the way .
41011009	And those going before and those following cried out , saying , “ Hoshia-na ! ‘ Blessed is He who is coming in the Name of יהוה ! ’
41011010	Blessed is the coming reign of our father Dawiḏ – in the Name of יהוה ! Hoshia-na in the highest ! ”
41011011	And יהושע went into Yerushalayim and into the Set-apart Place . And having looked around on all , He went out to Bĕyth Anyah with the twelve , as the hour was already late .
41011012	And on the next day , when they had come out from Bĕyth Anyah , He was hungry .
41011013	And seeing at a distance a fig tree having leaves , He went to see whether He would find any fruit on it . And when He came to it , He found none but leaves , for it was not the season for figs .
41011014	And יהושע , responding , said to it , “ Let no one eat fruit from you ever again . ” And His taught ones heard it .
41011015	And they came to Yerushalayim . יהושע , entering into the Set-apart Place , began to drive out those who bought and sold in the Set-apart Place , and overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those selling doves .
41011016	And He did not allow anyone to carry a vessel through the Set-apart Place .
41011017	And He was teaching , saying to them , “ Has it not been written , ‘ My House shall be called a house of prayer for all nations’ ? But you have made it a ‘ den of robbers . ’ ”
41011018	And the scribes and the chief priests heard it and they were seeking how to destroy Him , for they feared Him , because all the crowd was astonished at His teaching .
41011019	And when evening came , He went out of the city .
41011020	And in the morning , passing by , they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots .
41011021	Then Kĕpha , remembering , said to Him , “ Rabbi , look ! The fig tree which You cursed has withered . ”
41011022	And יהושע answering , said to them , “ Have belief in Elohim .
41011023	“ For truly , I say to you , whoever says to this mountain , ‘ Be removed and be thrown into the sea , ’ and does not doubt in his heart , but believes that what he says , shall be done , he shall have whatever he says .
41011024	“ Because of this I say to you , whatever you ask when you pray , believe that you receive them , and you shall have them .
41011025	“ And whenever you stand praying , if you hold whatever against anyone , forgive , so that your Father in the heavens shall also forgive you your trespasses .
41011026	“ But if you do not forgive , neither shall your Father in the heavens forgive your trespasses . ”
41011027	And they came again to Yerushalayim . And as He was walking in the Set-apart Place , the chief priests , and the scribes , and the elders came to Him ,
41011028	and they said to Him , “ By what authority are You doing these ? And who gave You this authority to do these ? ”
41011029	And יהושע answering , said to them , “ I shall ask you one question , and answer Me , and I shall say to you by what authority I do these :
41011030	“ The immersion of Yoḥanan – was it from heaven or from men ? Answer Me . ”
41011031	And they reasoned among themselves , saying , “ If we say , ‘ From heaven , ’ He shall say , ‘ Then why did you not believe him ? ’
41011032	“ But if we say , ‘ From men’ ” – they feared the people , for all held that Yoḥanan was a prophet indeed .
41011033	And answering they said to יהושע , “ We do not know . ” And יהושע answering , said to them , “ Neither do I say to you by what authority I do these . ”
41012001	And He began to speak to them in parables , “ A man planted a vineyard and put a hedge around it , and dug a vat for the winepress and built a watchtower , and let it out to farmers and went away .
41012002	“ And at harvest time he sent a servant to the farmers , to receive some of the fruit of the vineyard from the farmers .
41012003	“ And they seized him and beat him and sent him away empty-handed .
41012004	“ And again he sent them another servant , and throwing stones at him , they wounded him in the head , and sent him away , having insulted him .
41012005	“ And again he sent another , and they killed him ; and many others , beating some and killing some .
41012006	“ He had one more son , his beloved . He sent him last of all , saying , ‘ They shall respect my son . ’
41012007	“ But those farmers said among themselves , ‘ This is the heir . Come , let us kill him , and the inheritance shall be ours . ’
41012008	“ So they took him and killed him and threw him out of the vineyard .
41012009	“ What then shall the owner of the vineyard do ? He shall come and destroy the farmers , and give the vineyard to others .
41012010	“ Have you not read this Scripture , ‘ The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief corner-stone .
41012011	‘ This was from יהוה , and it is marvellous in our eyes’ ? ”
41012012	And they were seeking to seize Him , but feared the crowd , for they knew He had spoken the parable against them . And leaving Him , they went away .
41012013	And they sent to Him some of the Pharisees and the Herodians , to catch Him in a word .
41012014	And when they came , they said to Him , “ Teacher , we know that You are true , and it does not concern You about anyone , for You are not partial to any , but teach the way of Elohim in truth . Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar , or not ?
41012015	“ Should we pay , or should we not pay ? ” And He , knowing their hypocrisy , said to them , “ Why do you try Me ? Bring Me a silver piece to look at . ”
41012016	And they brought it , and He said to them , “ Whose likeness and inscription is this ? ” And they said to Him , “ Caesar’s . ”
41012017	So יהושע said to them , “ Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s , and to Elohim what is Elohim’s . ” And they marvelled at Him .
41012018	And Sadducees , who say there is no resurrection , came to Him . And they asked Him , saying ,
41012019	“ Teacher , Mosheh wrote to us that if a brother of anyone dies , and leaves his wife behind , and leaves no children , his brother should take his wife and raise up offspring for his brother .
41012020	“ There were seven brothers , and the first took a wife , and died , leaving no offspring .
41012021	“ And the second took her , and he died , leaving behind no offspring . And the third likewise .
41012022	“ And the seven left no offspring . Last of all the woman died too .
41012023	“ In the resurrection then , when they rise , whose wife shall she be ? For seven had her as wife . ”
41012024	And יהושע answering , said to them , “ Is this not why you go astray , because you do not know the Scriptures nor the power of Elohim ?
41012025	“ For when they rise from the dead , they neither marry nor are given in marriage , but are as messengers in the heavens .
41012026	“ And concerning the dead , that they rise – have you not read in the book of Mosheh , at the bush , how Elohim spoke to him , saying , ‘ I am the Elohim of Aḇraham , and the Elohim of Yitsḥaq , and the Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ’ ?
41012027	“ He is not the Elohim of the dead , but Elohim of the living . You , then , go greatly astray . ”
41012028	And one of the scribes coming near , hearing them reasoning together , knowing that He had answered them well , asked Him , “ Which is the first command of all ? ”
41012029	And יהושע answered him , “ The first of all the commands is , ‘ Hear , O Yisra’ĕl , יהוה our Elohim , יהוה is one .
41012030	‘ And you shall love יהוה your Elohim with all your heart , and with all your being , and with all your mind , and with all your strength . ’ This is the first command .
41012031	“ And the second , like it , is this , ‘ You shall love your neighbour as yourself . ’ There is no other command greater than these . ”
41012032	And the scribe said to Him , “ Well said , Teacher . You have spoken the truth , for there is one Elohim , and there is no other besides Him .
41012033	“ And to love Him with all the heart , and with all the understanding , and with all the being , and with all the strength , and to love one’s neighbour as oneself , is more than all the burnt offerings and offerings . ”
41012034	And when יהושע saw that he answered wisely , He said to him , “ You are not far from the reign of Elohim . ” And after that no one was bold enough to question Him .
41012035	And יהושע responding , said , while teaching in the Set-apart Place , “ How is it that the scribes say that the Messiah is the Son of Dawiḏ ?
41012036	“ Dawiḏ himself said by the Set-apart Spirit , ‘ יהוה said to my Master , “ Sit at My right hand , until I make Your enemies a footstool of Your feet . ” ’
41012037	“ Dawiḏ himself calls Him ‘ Master . ’ In what way then is He his Son ? ” And the large crowd heard Him gladly .
41012038	And in His teaching He was saying to them , “ Beware of the scribes , who like to walk around in long robes , and like greetings in the market-places ,
41012039	and the best seats in the congregations , and the best places at feasts ,
41012040	who are devouring widows’ houses , and for a show make long prayers . These shall receive greater judgment . ”
41012041	And sitting opposite the treasury He saw how the people put copper into the treasury . And many rich ones put in much .
41012042	And a poor widow came and threw in two small copper coins , which amount to a cent .
41012043	And calling near His taught ones He said to them , “ Truly , I say to you that this poor widow has put in more than all those putting into the treasury ,
41012044	for they all put in out of their excess , but she out of her poverty put in all that she had , her entire livelihood . ”
41014001	Now the Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread was after two days . And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to take Him through treachery and put Him to death .
41014002	And they said , “ Not at the festival , lest there shall be an uproar of the people . ”
41014003	And while He was in Bĕyth Anyah in the house of Shim‛on the leper , and sitting at the table , a woman came having an alabaster flask of perfume , genuine nard , very costly . And breaking the flask she poured it on His head .
41014004	But there were some who were much displeased among themselves , and said , “ Why was this perfume wasted ?
41014005	“ For it could have been sold for more than three hundred pieces of silver and given to the poor . ” And they were scolding her .
41014006	But יהושע said , “ Leave her alone . Why do you trouble her ? She has done a good work for Me .
41014007	“ For you have the poor with you always , and you are able do good to them , whenever you wish . But you do not always have Me .
41014008	“ What she had , she used . She took it beforehand to anoint My body for the burial .
41014009	“ Truly , I say to you , wherever this Good News is proclaimed in all the world , what this woman did shall also be spoken of , to her remembrance . ”
41014010	And Yehuḏah from Qerioth , one of the twelve , went to the chief priests to deliver Him up to them .
41014011	And when they heard it , they were glad , and promised to give him silver . And he was seeking how to deliver Him up , conveniently .
41014012	And on the first day of Unleavened Bread , when they were slaughtering the Passover lamb , His taught ones said to Him , “ Where do You wish us to go and prepare , for You to eat the Passover ? ”
41014013	And He sent out two of His taught ones and said to them , “ Go into the city , and there a man bearing a jar of water shall meet you , follow him .
41014014	“ And wherever he enters , say to the master of the house , ‘ The Teacher says , “ Where is the guest room in which I am to eat the Passover with My taught ones ? ” ’
41014015	“ And he shall show you a large upper room , furnished , ready . Prepare for us there . ”
41014016	And His taught ones went out and came into the city , and found it as He said to them , and they prepared the Passover .
41014017	And evening having come , He came with the twelve .
41014018	And as they sat and ate , יהושע said , “ Truly , I say to you , one of you who is eating with Me shall deliver Me up . ”
41014019	And they began to be grieved , and to say to Him one by one , “ Is it I ? ” And another , “ Is it I ? ”
41014020	And He answering , said to them , “ It is one of the twelve , he who is dipping with Me in the dish .
41014021	“ The Son of Aḏam is indeed going , as it has been written of Him , but woe to that man by whom the Son of Aḏam is delivered up ! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born . ”
41014022	And as they were eating , יהושע took bread , having blessed , broke it , gave it to them and said , “ Take , eat , this is My body . ”
41014023	And taking the cup , giving thanks , He gave it to them , and they all drank from it .
41014024	And He said to them , “ This is My blood , that of the renewed covenant , which is shed for many .
41014025	“ Truly , I say to you , I shall certainly no more drink of the fruit of the vine till that day when I drink it anew in the reign of Elohim . ”
41014026	And having sung a song , they went out to the Mount of Olives .
41014027	And יהושע said to them , “ All of you shall stumble in Me this night , for it has been written , ‘ I shall strike the shepherd , and the sheep shall be scattered . ’
41014028	“ But after I am raised , I shall go before you to Galil . ”
41014029	And Kĕpha said to Him , “ Even if all shall stumble , yet not I . ”
41014030	And יהושע said to him , “ Truly , I say to you that today , this night , before the cock shall crow twice , you shall deny Me three times . ”
41014031	But he spoke more strongly , “ If I have to die with You , I shall not deny You ! ” And they all said the same .
41014032	And they came to a place called Gethsemane . And He said to His taught ones , “ Sit here while I pray . ”
41014033	And He took with Him Kĕpha , and Ya‛aqoḇ , and Yoḥanan , and He began to be greatly amazed , and to be deeply distressed .
41014034	And He said to them , “ My being is exceedingly grieved , even to death . Stay here and watch . ”
41014035	And He went on a little , and fell on the ground , and was praying that if it were possible , the hour might pass from Him .
41014036	And He said , “ Abba , Father , all is possible for You . Make this cup pass from Me . Yet not what I desire , but what You desire . ”
41014037	And He came and found them sleeping , and said to Kĕpha , “ Shim‛on , are you sleeping ? You were not able to watch one hour !
41014038	“ Watch and pray , lest you enter into trial . The spirit indeed is eager , but the flesh is weak . ”
41014039	And again He went away and prayed , and spoke the same words .
41014040	And having returned , He found them asleep again , for their eyes were heavy . And they did not know what to answer Him .
41014041	And He came the third time and said to them , “ Are you still sleeping and resting ? It is enough ! The hour has come . See , the Son of Aḏam is being delivered up into the hands of the sinners .
41014042	“ Rise up , let us go . See , he who is delivering Me up has drawn near . ”
41014043	And immediately , while He was still speaking , Yehuḏah , one of the twelve , with a large crowd with swords and clubs , came from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders .
41014044	And the one who was delivering Him up had given them a signal , saying , “ Whomever I kiss , it is He – seize Him and lead Him away safely . ”
41014045	And coming , going straight up to Him , he said to Him , “ Rabbi , Rabbi ! ” and kissed Him .
41014046	And they laid their hands on Him and seized Him .
41014047	And one of those standing by drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest , and cut off his ear .
41014048	And יהושע answering , said to them , “ Have you come out as against a robber , with swords and clubs , to take Me ?
41014049	“ Daily I was with you in the Set-apart Place teaching , and you did not seize Me . But let the Scriptures be filled . ”
41014050	And they all left Him and fled .
41014051	And a certain young man was following Him , having a linen cloth thrown around his naked body . And when they seized him ,
41014052	he left the linen cloth and fled from them naked .
41014053	And they led יהושע away to the high priest . And all the chief priests , and the elders , and the scribes came together to Him .
41014054	And Kĕpha followed Him at a distance , even into the courtyard of the high priest . And he was sitting with the officers and warming himself at the fire .
41014055	And the chief priests and all the council were seeking witness against יהושע to put Him to death , and they were finding none .
41014056	For many bore false witness against Him , but their evidences did not agree .
41014057	And some rose up and bore false witness against Him , saying ,
41014058	“ We heard Him saying , ‘ I shall destroy this Dwelling Place that is made with hands , and within three days I shall build another made without hands . ’ ”
41014059	And not even then did their witness agree .
41014060	Then the high priest stood up in the centre and asked יהושע , saying , “ Have You no answer to make ? What do these witness against You ? ”
41014061	But He remained silent and gave no answer . Again the high priest asked Him , saying to Him , “ Are You the Messiah , the Son of the Blessed ? ”
41014062	And יהושע said , “ I am , and you shall see the Son of Aḏam sitting at the right hand of the Power , and coming with the clouds of the heaven . ”
41014063	And tearing his garments , the high priest said , “ What further need do we have of witnesses ?
41014064	“ You have heard the blasphemy ! What do you think ? ” And they all condemned Him to be liable to death .
41014065	And some began to spit on Him , and to blindfold Him , and to beat Him , and to say to Him , “ Prophesy ! ” And the officers struck Him with the palms of their hands .
41014066	And as Kĕpha was below in the courtyard , one of the servant girls of the high priest came ,
41014067	and seeing Kĕpha warming himself , she looked at him and said , “ And you were with יהושע of Natsareth . ”
41014068	But he denied it , saying , “ I do not know nor understand what you are saying . ” And he went out onto the porch , and a cock crowed .
41014069	And the servant girl saw him again , and began to say to those who stood by , “ This is one of them . ”
41014070	And again he was denying it . And after a little while those who stood by again said to Kĕpha , “ Truly you are one of them , for you are a Galilean too , and your speech is alike . ”
41014071	And he began to curse and swear , “ I do not know this Man of whom you speak ! ”
41014072	And a second time the cock crowed . And Kĕpha remembered the word that יהושע had said to him , “ Before the cock crows twice , you shall deny Me three times . ” And thinking on it , he wept .
41015001	And immediately , in the morning , the chief priests had a council meeting with the elders and scribes and all the council . Having bound יהושע , they led Him away , and delivered Him to Pilate .
41015002	And Pilate asked Him , “ Are You the Sovereign of the Yehuḏim ? ” And He answering , said to him , “ You say it . ”
41015003	And the chief priests accused Him of much , but He made no answer .
41015004	And Pilate again asked Him , saying , “ Have You no answer ? See how much they witness against You ! ”
41015005	But יהושע still gave no answer , so that Pilate marvelled .
41015006	And at a festival he released to them one prisoner , whomever they were asking .
41015007	And there was one called Barabba , chained with his fellow rebels , who had committed murder in the uprising .
41015008	And the crowd , crying aloud , began to ask , as he had always done for them .
41015009	But Pilate answered them , saying , “ Do you wish me to release for you the Sovereign of the Yehuḏim ? ”
41015010	For he knew that the chief priests had handed Him over because of envy .
41015011	And the chief priests stirred up the crowd , that he should rather release Barabba to them .
41015012	And Pilate answered and again said to them , “ What then do you wish me to do to Him whom you call the Sovereign of the Yehuḏim ? ”
41015013	And again they cried out , “ Impale Him ! ”
41015014	And Pilate said to them , “ Why , what evil has He done ? ” And they vehemently cried out , “ Impale Him ! ”
41015015	And Pilate , wishing to satisfy the crowd , released Barabba to them , and having whipped Him , he delivered יהושע over to be impaled .
41015016	And the soldiers led Him away into the court , which is the palace , and they called together the entire company of soldiers ,
41015017	and decked Him with purple . And they plaited a crown of thorns , put it on Him ,
41015018	and they began to call out to Him , “ Greetings , Sovereign of the Yehuḏim ! ”
41015019	And they kept beating Him on the head with a reed and were spitting on Him . And bending the knee , they were bowing down to Him .
41015020	And when they had mocked Him , they took the purple off Him , and put His own garments on Him , and led Him out to impale Him .
41015021	And they compelled a passer-by , Shim‛on , a Cyrenian , coming from a field , the father of Alexander and Rufus , to bear His stake .
41015022	And they brought Him to the place Golgotha , which is translated , Place of a Skull .
41015023	And they were giving Him wine mixed with myrrh to drink , but He did not take it .
41015024	And when they impaled Him , they divided His garments , casting lots for them , what each one should take .
41015025	And it was the third hour , and they impaled Him .
41015026	And the inscription of His accusation was written above : THE SOVEREIGN OF THE YEHUḎIM .
41015027	And with Him they impaled two robbers , one on His right and the other on His left .
41015028	And the Scripture was filled which says , “ And He was reckoned with the lawless . ”
41015029	And those passing by were blaspheming Him , shaking their heads and saying , “ Ah ! You who destroy the Dwelling Place and build it in three days ,
41015030	save Yourself , and come down from the stake ! ”
41015031	And likewise the chief priests and the scribes , mocking to one another said , “ He saved others , He is unable to save Himself .
41015032	“ The Messiah ? The Sovereign of Yisra’ĕl ? Come down now from the stake , so that we see and believe . ” And those who were impaled with Him were reproaching Him .
41015033	And when the sixth hour came , darkness came over all the land until the ninth hour .
41015034	And at the ninth hour יהושע cried out with a loud voice , saying , “ Ěli , Ěli , lamah sheḇaqtani ? ” which is translated , “ My Ěl , My Ěl , why have You forsaken Me ? ”
41015035	And some of those standing by , when they heard it , said , “ See , He is calling for Ěliyahu ! ”
41015036	And someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine , and put it on a reed , and offered it to Him to drink , saying , “ Leave Him , let us see if Ěliyahu does come to take Him down . ”
41015037	And יהושע cried out with a loud voice , and breathed His last .
41015038	And the veil of the Dwelling Place was torn in two from top to bottom .
41015039	And when the captain , who was standing opposite Him , saw that He cried out like this and breathed His last , he said , “ Truly this Man was the Son of Elohim ! ”
41015040	And there were also women watching from a distance , among whom was also Miryam from Mag̅dala , and Miryam the mother of Ya‛aqoḇ the Less and of Yosĕph , and Shelomah ,
41015041	who also followed Him and attended Him when He was in Galil , and many other women who came up with Him to Yerushalayim .
41015042	And when evening had come , because it was the Preparation Day , that is , the day before the Sabbath ,
41015043	Yosĕph of Ramathayim , a prominent council member , who was himself waiting for the reign of Elohim , came , boldly went in to Pilate and asked for the body of יהושע .
41015044	But Pilate wondered whether He was already dead , so summoning the captain , he asked him if He was already dead .
41015045	And when he learned this from the captain , he gave the body to Yosĕph .
41015046	And he , having bought fine linen , took Him down , and wrapped Him in the linen . And he laid Him in a tomb which had been hewn out of the rock , and rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb .
41015047	And Miryam from Mag̅dala , and Miryam the mother of Yosĕph , saw where He was laid .
41016001	And when the Sabbath was past , Miryam from Mag̅dala , and Miryam the mother of Ya‛aqoḇ , and Shelomah bought spices , to go and anoint Him .
41016002	And very early on the first day of the week , they came to the tomb when the sun had risen .
41016003	And they said among themselves , “ Who shall roll away the stone from the entrance of the tomb for us ? ”
41016004	And looking up , they saw that the stone had been rolled away , for it was extremely large .
41016005	And having entered into the tomb , they saw a young man sitting on the right , wearing a white robe , and they were greatly astonished .
41016006	And he said to them , “ Do not be much astonished . You seek יהושע of Natsareth , who was impaled . He was raised – He is not here ! See the place where they laid Him .
41016007	“ And go , say to His taught ones , and Kĕpha , that He is going before you into Galil . You shall see Him there as He said to you . ”
41016008	And they went out and fled from the tomb , and were trembling and bewildered . And they spoke to no one , for they were afraid .
41016009	And having risen early on the first day of the week , He appeared first to Miryam from Mag̅dala , from whom He had cast out seven demons .
41016010	She went and reported to those who had been with Him , mourning and weeping .
41016011	And when they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her , they did not believe .
41016012	And after this He appeared in another form to two of them as they walked and went into a field .
41016013	And they went and reported it to the rest , but they did not believe them either .
41016014	Later He appeared to the eleven as they sat at the table . And He reproached their unbelief and hardness of heart , because they did not believe those who had seen Him after He was raised .
41016015	And He said to them , “ Go into all the world and proclaim the Good News to every creature .
41016016	“ He who has believed and has been immersed , shall be saved , but he who has not believed shall be condemned .
41016017	“ And these signs shall accompany the ones who believe : In My Name they shall cast out demons , they shall speak with renewed tongues ,
41016018	they shall take up snakes , and if they drink any deadly drink it shall by no means hurt them , they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall get well . ”
41016019	Then indeed , after the Master had spoken to them , He was received up into the heaven , and sat down at the right hand of Elohim .
41016020	And they went out and proclaimed it everywhere , while the Master worked with them , and confirmed the word through the accompanying signs . Amĕn .
42001001	Since many have indeed taken in hand to set in order an account of the matters completely confirmed among us ,
42001002	as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word delivered them to us ,
42001003	it seemed good to me as well , having followed up all these matters exactly from the beginning , to write to you an orderly account , most excellent Theophilos ,
42001004	that you might know the certainty of the words which you were taught .
42001005	There was in the days of Herodes , the sovereign of Yehuḏah , a certain priest named Zeḵaryah , of the division of Aḇiyah . And his wife was of the daughters of Aharon , and her name was Elisheḇa .
42001006	And they were both righteous before Elohim , blamelessly walking in all the commands and righteousnesses of יהוה .
42001007	And they had no child , because Elisheḇa was barren , and both were advanced in years .
42001008	And it came to be , that while he was serving as priest before Elohim in the order of his division ,
42001009	according to the institute of the priesthood , he was chosen by lot to burn incense when he went into the Dwelling Place of יהוה .
42001010	And the entire crowd of people was praying outside at the hour of incense .
42001011	And a messenger of יהוה appeared to him , standing on the right side of the altar of incense .
42001012	And when Zeḵaryah saw him , he was troubled , and fear fell upon him .
42001013	But the messenger said to him , “ Do not be afraid , Zeḵaryah , for your prayer is heard . And your wife Elisheḇa shall bear you a son , and you shall call his name Yoḥanan .
42001014	“ And you shall have joy and gladness , and many shall rejoice at his birth .
42001015	“ For he shall be great before יהוה , and shall drink no wine and strong drink at all . And he shall be filled with the Set-apart Spirit , even from his mother’s womb .
42001016	“ And he shall turn many of the children of Yisra’ĕl to יהוה their Elohim .
42001017	“ And he shall go before Him in the spirit and power of Ěliyahu , ‘ to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children , ’ and the disobedient to the insight of the righteous , to make ready a people prepared for יהוה . ”
42001018	And Zeḵaryah said to the messenger , “ By what shall I know this ? For I am old , and my wife advanced in years . ”
42001019	And the messenger answering , said to him , “ I am Gaḇri’ĕl , who stands in the presence of Elohim , and was sent to speak to you and announce to you this good news .
42001020	“ But see , you shall be silent and unable to speak until the day this takes place , because you did not believe my words which shall be filled in their appointed time . ”
42001021	And the people waited for Zeḵaryah , and marvelled at his delay in the Dwelling Place .
42001022	And when he came out , he was unable to speak to them . And they recognised that he had seen a vision in the Dwelling Place , for he was beckoning to them and remained dumb .
42001023	And it came to be , as soon as the days of his service were completed , he went away to his house .
42001024	And after those days his wife Elisheḇa conceived . And she hid herself five months , saying ,
42001025	“ יהוה has done this for me , in the days when He looked upon me , to take away my reproach among men . ”
42001026	And in the sixth month the messenger Gaḇri’ĕl was sent by Elohim to a city of Galil named Natsareth ,
42001027	to a maiden engaged to a man whose name was Yosĕph , of the house of Dawiḏ . And the maiden’s name was Miryam .
42001028	And the messenger , coming to her , said , “ Greetings , favoured one , the Master is with you . Blessed are you among women ! ”
42001029	But she was greatly disturbed at his word , and wondered what kind of greeting this was .
42001030	And the messenger said to her , “ Do not be afraid , Miryam , for you have found favour with Elohim .
42001031	“ And see , you shall conceive in your womb , and shall give birth to a Son , and call His Name יהושע .
42001032	“ He shall be great , and shall be called the Son of the Most High . And יהוה Elohim shall give Him the throne of His father Dawiḏ .
42001033	“ And He shall reign over the house of Ya‛aqoḇ forever , and there shall be no end to His reign . ”
42001034	And Miryam said to the messenger , “ How shall this be , since I do not know a man ? ”
42001035	And the messenger answering , said to her , “ The Set-apart Spirit shall come upon you , and the power of the Most High shall overshadow you . And for that reason the Set-apart One born of you shall be called : Son of Elohim .
42001036	“ And see , Elisheḇa your relative , she has also conceived a son in her old age . And this is now the sixth month to her who was called barren ,
42001037	because with Elohim no matter shall be impossible . ”
42001038	And Miryam said , “ See the female servant of יהוה ! Let it be to me according to your word . ” And the messenger went away from her .
42001039	And Miryam arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste , to a city of Yehuḏah ,
42001040	and entered into the house of Zeḵaryah and greeted Elisheḇa .
42001041	And it came to be , when Elisheḇa heard the greeting of Miryam , that the baby leaped in her womb . And Elisheḇa was filled with the Set-apart Spirit ,
42001042	and called out with a loud voice and said , “ Blessed are you among women , and blessed is the fruit of your womb !
42001043	“ And who am I , that the mother of my Master should come to me ?
42001044	“ For look , when the sound of your greeting came to my ears , the baby in my womb leaped for joy .
42001045	“ Blessed is she who believed , for that which יהוה has said to her shall be accomplished ! ”
42001046	And Miryam said , “ My being makes יהוה great ,
42001047	and my spirit has rejoiced in Elohim my Saviour .
42001048	“ Because He looked on the humiliation of His female servant . For look , from now on all generations shall call me blessed .
42001049	“ For He who is mighty has done wonders for me , and set-apart is His Name .
42001050	“ And His compassion is from generation to generation , to those who fear Him .
42001051	“ He did mightily with His arm , He scattered the proud in the thought of their hearts .
42001052	“ He brought down rulers from their thrones , and exalted the lowly .
42001053	“ He has filled the hungry with good items , and the rich He has sent away empty .
42001054	“ He sustained Yisra’ĕl , His servant , in remembrance of His compassion ,
42001055	as He spoke to our fathers , to Aḇraham and to his seed , forever . ”
42001056	And Miryam stayed with her about three months , and returned to her home .
42001057	And the time was filled for Elisheḇa to give birth , and she bore a son .
42001058	And her neighbours and relatives heard how יהוה had shown great compassion to her , and they rejoiced with her .
42001059	And it came to be , on the eighth day , that they came to circumcise the child . And they were calling him by the name of his father , Zeḵaryah .
42001060	And his mother answering , said , “ Not so , but he shall be called Yoḥanan . ”
42001061	And they said to her , “ There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name . ”
42001062	Then they motioned to his father , what he would like him to be called .
42001063	And having asked for a writing tablet , he wrote , saying , “ Yoḥanan is his name . ” And they all marvelled .
42001064	And at once his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed , and he was speaking , praising Elohim .
42001065	And fear came on all those dwelling around them , and all these matters were spoken of in all the hill country of Yehuḏah .
42001066	And all who heard them kept them in their hearts , saying , “ What then shall this child be ? ” And the hand of יהוה was with him .
42001067	And Zeḵaryah , his father , was filled with the Set-apart Spirit , and prophesied , saying ,
42001068	“ Blessed be יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl , for He did look upon and worked redemption for His people ,
42001069	and has raised up a horn of deliverance for us in the house of His servant Dawiḏ ,
42001070	as He spoke by the mouth of His set-apart prophets , from of old –
42001071	deliverance from our enemies and from the hand of all those hating us ,
42001072	to show compassion toward our fathers and to remember His set-apart covenant ,
42001073	an oath which He swore to our father Aḇraham :
42001074	to give to us , being delivered from the hand of our enemies , to serve Him without fear ,
42001075	in set-apartness and righteousness before Him all the days of our life .
42001076	“ And you , child , shall be called prophet of the Most High , for you shall go before the face of יהוה to prepare His ways ,
42001077	to give knowledge of deliverance to His people , by the forgiveness of their sins ,
42001078	through the tender compassion of our Elohim , with which the daybreak from on high has looked upon us ,
42001079	to give light to those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death , to guide our feet into the way of peace . ”
42001080	And the child grew and became strong in spirit , and was in the deserts until the day of showing Himself openly to Yisra’ĕl .
42002001	And it came to be in those days that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus for all the world to be registered .
42002002	This took place as a first registration while Quirinius was governing Syria .
42002003	And all were going to be registered , each one to his own city .
42002004	And Yosĕph also went up from Galil , out of the city of Natsareth to Yehuḏah , to the city of Dawiḏ , which is called Bĕyth Leḥem , because he was of the house and lineage of Dawiḏ ,
42002005	to be registered with Miryam , who was engaged to him – being pregnant .
42002006	And it came to be , that while they were there , the days were filled for her to give birth .
42002007	And she gave birth to her first-born Son , and wrapped Him up , and laid Him down in a feeding trough , because there was no room for them in a lodging place .
42002008	And in the same country there were shepherds living out in the fields , keeping watch over their flock by night .
42002009	And look , a messenger of יהוה stood before them , and the esteem of יהוה shone around them , and they were greatly afraid .
42002010	And the messenger said to them , “ Do not be afraid , for look , I bring you good news of great joy which shall be to all people .
42002011	“ Because there was born to you today in the city of Dawiḏ a Saviour , who is Messiah , the Master .
42002012	“ And this is the sign to you : You shall find a baby wrapped up , lying in a feeding trough . ”
42002013	And suddenly there was with the messenger a crowd of the heavenly host praising Elohim and saying ,
42002014	“ Esteem to Elohim in the highest , and on earth peace among men with whom He is pleased ! ”
42002015	And it came to be , when the messengers had gone away from them into the heaven , that the shepherds said to each other , “ Indeed , let us go to Bĕyth Leḥem and see this matter that has taken place , which the Master has made known to us . ”
42002016	And they came in haste and found Miryam and Yosĕph , and the baby lying in a feeding trough .
42002017	And having seen , they made known the matter which was spoken to them concerning the child .
42002018	And all those who heard marvelled at what the shepherds said to them .
42002019	But Miryam kept all these matters , considering them in her heart .
42002020	And the shepherds returned , boasting and praising Elohim for all they had heard and seen , as it was spoken to them .
42002021	And when eight days were completed for Him to be circumcised , His Name was called יהושע , the Name given by the messenger before He was conceived in the womb .
42002022	And when the days of her cleansing according to the Torah of Mosheh were completed , they brought Him to Yerushalayim to present Him to יהוה –
42002023	as it has been written in the Torah of יהוה , “ Every male who opens the womb shall be called set-apart to יהוה ” –
42002024	and to give an offering according to what is said in the Torah of יהוה , “ A pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons . ”
42002025	And see , there was a man in Yerushalayim whose name was Shim‛on , and this man was righteous and dedicated , looking for the comforting of Yisra’ĕl . And the Set-apart Spirit was upon him .
42002026	And it had been revealed to him by the Set-apart Spirit that he would not see death before he sees the Messiah of יהוה .
42002027	And he came in the Spirit into the Set-apart Place . And as the parents brought in the Child יהושע , to do for Him according to the usual practice of the Torah ,
42002028	then he took Him up in his arms and blessed Elohim and said ,
42002029	“ Now let Your servant go in peace , O Master , according to Your word ,
42002030	for my eyes have seen Your deliverance ,
42002031	which You have prepared before the face of all the peoples ,
42002032	a light for the unveiling of the gentiles , and the esteem of Your people Yisra’ĕl . ”
42002033	And Yosĕph and His mother were marvelling at what was said about Him .
42002034	And Shim‛on blessed them , and said to Miryam His mother , “ See , this One is set for a fall and rising of many in Yisra’ĕl , and for a sign spoken against –
42002035	and a sword shall pierce through your own being also – so as to reveal the thoughts of many hearts . ”
42002036	And there was Ḥannah , a prophetess , a daughter of Penu’ĕl , of the tribe of Ashĕr . She was advanced in years , and had lived with a husband seven years from her maidenhood ,
42002037	and she was a widow of about eighty-four years , who did not leave the Set-apart Place , but served Elohim with fastings and prayers night and day .
42002038	And she , coming in at that moment , gave thanks to יהוה , and spoke of Him to all who were waiting for redemption in Yerushalayim .
42002039	And when they had accomplished all matters according to the Torah of יהוה , they returned to Galil , to their city Natsareth .
42002040	And the Child grew and became strong in spirit , being filled with wisdom . And the favour of Elohim was upon Him .
42002041	And His parents went to Yerushalayim every year at the Festival of the Passover .
42002042	And when He was twelve years old , they went up to Yerushalayim according to the practice of the festival .
42002043	When they had accomplished the days , as they returned , the Child יהושע stayed behind in Yerushalayim . And His parents did not know it ,
42002044	but thinking He was in the company , they went a day’s journey , and were seeking Him among the relatives and friends .
42002045	And not having found Him , they returned to Yerushalayim , seeking Him .
42002046	And it came to be , after three days , that they found Him in the Set-apart Place , sitting in the midst of the teachers , both listening to them and asking them questions .
42002047	And all who heard Him were astonished at His understanding and answers .
42002048	And having seen Him , they were amazed . And His mother said to Him , “ Son , why have You done this to us ? See , Your father and I have been anxiously seeking You . ”
42002049	And He said to them , “ Why were you seeking Me ? Did you not know that I had to be in the matters of My Father ? ”
42002050	But they did not understand the word which He spoke to them .
42002051	And He went down with them and came to Natsareth , and was subject to them , but His mother kept all these matters in her heart .
42002052	And יהושע increased in wisdom and stature , and in favour with Elohim and men .
42003001	And in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar , when Pontius Pilate was governor of Yehuḏah , and Herodes district ruler of Galil , and his brother Philip district ruler of Yetur and the country of Trachonitis , and Lusanias district ruler of Aḇilene ,
42003002	Ḥanan and Qayapha being high priests , the word of Elohim came to Yoḥanan the son of Zeḵaryah in the wilderness .
42003003	And he went into all the neighbourhood of the Yardĕn , proclaiming an immersion of repentance for the forgiveness of sins ,
42003004	as it has been written in the book of the words of Yeshayahu the prophet , saying , “ A voice of one crying in the wilderness , ‘ Prepare the way of יהוה , make His paths straight .
42003005	‘ Every valley shall be filled and every mountain and hill shall be made low , and the crooked shall become straight , and the rough become smooth ways ,
42003006	and all flesh shall see the deliverance of Elohim . ’ ”
42003007	He said therefore to the crowds that came out to be immersed by him , “ Brood of adders , who warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
42003008	“ Therefore bear fruit worthy of repentance , and do not begin to say to yourselves , ‘ We have Aḇraham as our father . ’ For I say to you that Elohim is able to raise up children to Aḇraham from these stones .
42003009	“ And even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees . Therefore every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire . ”
42003010	And the crowds asked him , saying , “ What , then , shall we do ? ”
42003011	And answering He said to them , “ Let him who has two undergarments share with him who has none , and let him who has food do likewise . ”
42003012	And tax collectors also came to be immersed , and said to him , “ Teacher , what shall we do ? ”
42003013	And he said to them , “ Collect no more than what is appointed for you . ”
42003014	And soldiers also asked him , saying , “ And what shall we do ? ” And he said to them , “ Do not intimidate anyone or accuse falsely , and be satisfied with your pay . ”
42003015	But as the people were in expectation , and all were reasoning in their hearts about Yoḥanan , whether he was the Messiah or not ,
42003016	Yoḥanan answered , saying to them all , “ I indeed immerse you in water , but One mightier than I is coming , whose sandal straps I am not worthy to loosen . He shall immerse you in the Set-apart Spirit and fire .
42003017	“ His winnowing fork is in His hand , and He shall thoroughly cleanse His threshing-floor , and gather the wheat into His storehouse , but the chaff He shall burn with unquenchable fire . ”
42003018	And urging with many other words , he brought the Good News to the people .
42003019	And Herodes the district ruler , being reproved by him concerning Herodias his brother Philip’s wife , and for all the wicked deeds which Herodes did ,
42003020	added this also to them all – he locked up Yoḥanan in prison .
42003021	And it came to be , when all the people were immersed , יהושע also being immersed , and praying , the heaven was opened ,
42003022	and the Set-apart Spirit descended in bodily form like a dove upon Him , and a voice came from heaven saying , “ You are My Son , the Beloved , in You I did delight . ”
42003023	And when יהושע Himself began , He was about thirty years of age , being , as reckoned by law , son of Yosĕph , of Ěli ,
42003024	of Mattithyahu , of Lĕwi , of Meleḵi , of Yanah , of Yosĕph ,
42003025	of Mattithyahu , of Amots , of Naḥum , of Ḥesli , of Nog̅ah ,
42003026	of Ma‛ath , of Mattithyahu , of Shim‛i , of Yosĕph , of Yehuḏah ,
42003027	of Yoḥanan , of Rephayah , of Zerubbaḇel , of She’alti’ĕl , of Neri ,
42003028	of Meleḵi , of Addi , of Qosam , of Elmoḏam , of Ěr ,
42003029	of Yehoshua , of Eli‛ezer , of Yorim , of Mattithyahu , of Lĕwi ,
42003030	of Shim‛on , of Yehuḏah , of Yosĕph , of Yonam , of Elyaqim ,
42003031	of Melea , of Menna , of Mattattah , of Nathan , of Dawiḏ ,
42003032	of Yishai , of Oḇĕḏ , of Bo‛az , of Salmon , of Naḥshon ,
42003033	of Amminaḏaḇ , of Ram , of Ḥetsron , of Perets , of Yehuḏah ,
42003034	of Ya‛aqoḇ , of Yitsḥaq , of Aḇraham , of Teraḥ , of Naḥor ,
42003035	of Serug̅ , of Re‛u , of Peleg̅ , of Ěḇer , of Shĕlaḥ ,
42003036	of Qĕynan , of Arpaḵshaḏ , of Shĕm , of Noaḥ , of Lemeḵ ,
42003037	of Methushelaḥ , of Ḥanoḵ , of Yereḏ , of Mahalalĕl , of Qĕynan ,
42003038	of Enosh , of Shĕth , of Aḏam , of Elohim .
42004001	And יהושע , being filled with the Set-apart Spirit , returned from the Yardĕn and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness ,
42004002	being tried for forty days by the devil . And in those days He did not eat at all , and afterward , when they had ended , He was hungry .
42004003	And the devil said to Him , “ If You are the Son of Elohim , command this stone to become bread . ”
42004004	But יהושע answered him , saying , “ It has been written , ‘ Man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word of Elohim . ’ ”
42004005	And the devil , taking Him up on a high mountain , showed Him all the reigns of the world in a moment of time .
42004006	And the devil said to Him , “ All this authority I shall give You , and their esteem , for it has been delivered to me , and I give it to whomever I wish .
42004007	“ If , then , You worship before me , all shall be Yours . ”
42004008	And יהושע answering him , said , “ Get behind Me , Satan ! For it has been written , ‘ You shall worship יהוה your Elohim , and Him only you shall serve . ’ ”
42004009	And he brought Him to Yerushalayim , set Him on the edge of the Set-apart Place , and said to Him , “ If You are the Son of Elohim , throw Yourself down from here ,
42004010	for it has been written , ‘ He shall command His messengers concerning You , to guard over You , ’
42004011	and , ‘ In their hands they shall bear You up , lest You dash Your foot against a stone . ’ ”
42004012	And יהושע answering , said to him , “ It has been said , ‘ You shall not try יהוה your Elohim . ’ ”
42004013	And when the devil had ended every trial , he went away from Him until a convenient time .
42004014	And יהושע returned in the power of the Spirit to Galil , and news of Him went out through all the surrounding country .
42004015	And He was teaching in their congregations , being praised by all .
42004016	And He came to Natsareth , where He had been brought up . And according to His practice , He went into the congregation on the Sabbath day , and stood up to read .
42004017	And the scroll of the prophet Yeshayahu was handed to Him . And having unrolled the scroll , He found the place where it was written :
42004018	“ The Spirit of יהוה is upon Me , because He has anointed Me to bring the Good News to the poor . He has sent Me to heal the broken-hearted , to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind , to send away crushed ones with a release ,
42004019	to proclaim the acceptable year of יהוה . ”
42004020	And having rolled up the scroll , He gave it back to the attendant and sat down . And the eyes of all in the congregation were fixed upon Him .
42004021	And He began to say to them , “ Today this Scripture has been filled in your hearing . ”
42004022	And all were bearing witness to Him , and marvelled at the pleasant words that came out of His mouth . And they said , “ Is this not the son of Yosĕph ? ”
42004023	And He said to them , “ No doubt , you shall say this proverb to Me , ‘ Physician , heal yourself ! Whatever we have heard being done in Kephar Naḥum , do also here in Your country . ’ ”
42004024	And He said , “ Truly , I say to you , no prophet is accepted in his own country .
42004025	“ But truly I say to you , many widows were in Yisra’ĕl in the days of Ěliyahu , when the heaven was shut up for three years and six months , and there was a great scarcity of food in all the land ,
42004026	and Ěliyahu was sent to none of them , but to Tsarephath of Tsiḏon , to a woman , a widow .
42004027	“ And many lepers were in Yisra’ĕl in the time of Elisha the prophet , and none of them was cleansed except Na‛aman the Aramean . ”
42004028	And all those in the congregation , when they heard this , were filled with wrath .
42004029	And rising up they drove Him out of the city , and brought Him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built , in order to throw Him down .
42004030	But He , passing through the midst of them , went away .
42004031	And He came down to Kephar Naḥum , a city of Galil , and was teaching them on the Sabbaths .
42004032	And they were astonished at His teaching , for His word was with authority .
42004033	And in the congregation was a man having a spirit of an unclean demon . And he cried out with a loud voice ,
42004034	saying , “ Ha ! What have we to do with You , יהושע of Natsareth ? Did You come to destroy us ? I know You , who You are , the Set-apart One of Elohim ! ”
42004035	And יהושע rebuked him , saying , “ Be silenced , and come out of him ! ” And when the demon had thrown him in their midst , it came out of him without hurting him .
42004036	And astonishment came on all , and they spoke to each other , saying , “ What is this word , that with authority and power He commands the unclean spirits , and they come out ? ”
42004037	And the report about Him went out into every place of the neighbourhood .
42004038	And rising up from the congregation He went into the house of Shim‛on . But the mother-in-law of Shim‛on was sick with a severe inflammation , and they asked Him concerning her .
42004039	And standing over her He rebuked the inflammation , and it left her , and instantly rising up she served them .
42004040	And when the sun was setting , all who had any who were sick with various diseases brought them to Him . And He laid His hands on each one of them and healed them .
42004041	And also demons were coming out of many , crying out and saying , “ You are the Messiah , the Son of Elohim ! ” And rebuking them , He did not allow them to speak , for they knew that He was the Messiah .
42004042	And when day came , He went out and proceeded to a lonely place , but the crowds were seeking Him and came to Him , and tried to keep Him from leaving them .
42004043	And He said to them , “ To the other cities I also have to bring the Good News : the reign of Elohim , because for this I have been sent . ”
42004044	And He was proclaiming in the congregations of Galil .
42005001	And it came to be , while the crowd was pressing upon Him to hear the word of Elohim , that He stood by the Lake of Gennĕsar ,
42005002	and He saw two boats standing by the lake , but the fishermen had gone from them and were washing their nets .
42005003	And entering into one of the boats , which belonged to Shim‛on , He asked him to pull away a little from the land . And He sat down and was teaching the crowds from the boat .
42005004	And when He ceased speaking , He said to Shim‛on , “ Pull out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch . ”
42005005	And Shim‛on answering , said to Him , “ Master , we have toiled all night and caught none , but at Your word I shall let down the net . ”
42005006	And when they did so , they caught a great number of fish , and their net was breaking ,
42005007	and they motioned to their partners in the other boat to come and help them . And they came and filled both the boats , so that they were sinking .
42005008	And when Shim‛on Kĕpha saw it , he fell down at the knees of יהושע , saying , “ Depart from me , for I am a man , a sinner , O Master ! ”
42005009	For astonishment had seized him and all those with him , at the catch of fish which they took ,
42005010	so too were Ya‛aqoḇ and Yoḥanan , the sons of Zaḇdai , who were partners with Shim‛on . Then יהושע said to Shim‛on , “ Do not fear , from now on you shall catch men . ”
42005011	And having brought the boats to land , they left all and followed Him .
42005012	And it came to be when He was in a certain city , that see , a man covered with leprosy saw יהושע . And he fell on his face and begged Him , saying , “ Master , if You desire , You are able to cleanse me . ”
42005013	And He stretched out His hand and touched him , saying , “ I desire it . Be cleansed . ” And immediately the leprosy left him .
42005014	And He ordered him to say it to no one , “ But go and show yourself to the priest , and make an offering for your cleansing , as a witness to them , as Mosheh commanded . ”
42005015	And the news about Him was spreading even more . And large crowds were coming together to hear , and to be healed by Him of their sicknesses .
42005016	But He was often withdrawing Himself to lonely places and praying .
42005017	And on a certain day it came to be , as He was teaching , that there were Pharisees and teachers of the Torah sitting by , who had come out of every village of Galil , Yehuḏah , and Yerushalayim . And the power of יהוה was there to heal them .
42005018	And see , men brought on a bed a man who was paralysed . And they were seeking to bring him in and lay him before Him .
42005019	But having found no way to bring him in because of the crowd , they went up on the house-top and let him down with his bed through the tiles into the midst before יהושע .
42005020	And having seen their belief , He said to him , “ Man , your sins are forgiven you . ”
42005021	And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason , saying , “ Who is this who speaks blasphemies ? Who is able to forgive sins except Elohim alone ? ”
42005022	And יהושע , knowing their thoughts , answering , said to them , “ Why are you reasoning in your hearts ?
42005023	“ Which is easier , to say , ‘ Your sins are forgiven you , ’ or to say , ‘ Rise up and walk’ ?
42005024	“ But in order for you to know that the Son of Aḏam possesses authority on earth to forgive sins . . . ” He said to the man who was paralysed , “ I say to you , rise , take up your bed , and go to your house . ”
42005025	And at once , having risen up before them , he took up what he had been lying on , and went away to his house , praising Elohim .
42005026	And astonishment seized them all , and they praised Elohim and were filled with fear , saying , “ We have seen extra-ordinary feats today ! ”
42005027	And after this He went out and saw a tax collector named Lĕwi , sitting at the tax office , and said to him , “ Follow Me . ”
42005028	And he , having left all , rose up and followed Him .
42005029	And Lĕwi made a great feast for Him in his house . And there were a great number of tax collectors and others who sat down with them .
42005030	And the Pharisees and their scribes grumbled against His taught ones , saying , “ Why do You eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners ? ”
42005031	And יהושע answering , said to them , “ Those who are well do not need a physician , but those who are sick .
42005032	“ I have not come to call the righteous , but sinners , to repentance . ”
42005033	And they said to Him , “ Why do the taught ones of Yoḥanan fast often and make prayers , and likewise those of the Pharisees , but Yours eat and drink ? ”
42005034	And He said to them , “ Are you able to make the friends of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them ?
42005035	“ But days shall come when the bridegroom is taken away from them , then they shall fast in those days . ”
42005036	And He also spoke a parable to them , “ No one puts a piece from a fresh garment on an old one , otherwise the fresh one makes a tear , and also the piece that was taken out of the fresh one does not match the old .
42005037	“ And no one puts new wine into old wineskins , otherwise the new wine shall burst the wineskins and run out , and the wineskins shall be ruined .
42005038	“ But new wine is put into fresh wineskins , and both are preserved .
42005039	“ And no one , having drunk old wine , immediately desires new wine , for he says , ‘ The old is better . ’ ”
42006001	And it came to be on a Sabbath that He went through grainfields , and His taught ones were plucking the heads of grain and were eating , rubbing them in the hands .
42006002	And some of the Pharisees said to them , “ Why are you doing what is not right to do on the Sabbath ? ”
42006003	And יהושע answering them , said , “ Have you not read what Dawiḏ did when he was hungry , he and those who were with him ,
42006004	how he went into the House of Elohim , took and ate the showbread , and also gave some to those with him , which is not right for any but the priests to eat ? ”
42006005	And He said to them , “ The Son of Aḏam is Master of the Sabbath . ”
42006006	And it also came to be on another Sabbath , that He entered into the congregation and taught , and there was a man whose right hand was withered .
42006007	And the scribes and Pharisees were watching Him closely , whether He would heal on the Sabbath , for them to find an accusation against Him .
42006008	And He knew their thoughts , and said to the man who had the withered hand , “ Rise and stand in the midst . ” And he rose up and stood .
42006009	Then יהושע said to them , “ I ask you , is it right to do good on the Sabbath , or to do evil , to save life or to destroy it ? ”
42006010	And looking around at them all , He said to the man , “ Stretch out your hand . ” And he did so , and his hand was restored sound as the other .
42006011	But they were filled with folly , and were speaking with one another what they should do to יהושע .
42006012	And in those days it came to be that He went out to the mountain to pray , and was spending the night in prayer to Elohim .
42006013	And when it became day , He called near His taught ones and chose from them twelve , whom He also named emissaries :
42006014	Shim‛on whom He also named Kĕpha , and his brother Andri , Ya‛aqoḇ and Yoḥanan , Philip and Bartholomi ,
42006015	Mattithyahu and T’oma , Ya‛aqoḇ the son of Alphai and Shim‛on , the one called the Ardent One ,
42006016	Yehuḏah the son of Ya‛aqoḇ and Yehuḏah from Qerioth who also became the betrayer .
42006017	And coming down with them He stood on a level place with a crowd of His taught ones and a great number of people from all Yehuḏah and Yerushalayim , and from the coast country of Tsor and Tsiḏon , who came to hear Him , and to be healed of their diseases ,
42006018	and those who were troubled with unclean spirits – and they were healed .
42006019	And all the crowd were seeking to touch Him , for power went out from Him , and healing them all .
42006020	And He , lifting up His eyes toward His taught ones , said , “ Blessed are the poor , because yours is the reign of Elohim .
42006021	“ Blessed are you who hunger now , because you shall be satisfied . Blessed are you who weep now , because you shall laugh .
42006022	“ Blessed are you when men shall hate you , and when they shall cut you off , and shall reproach you , and cast out your name as wicked , for the sake of the Son of Aḏam .
42006023	“ Rejoice in that day and leap for joy , for look , your reward is great in the heaven , for that is how their fathers treated the prophets .
42006024	“ But woe to you who are rich , because you are receiving your comfort .
42006025	“ Woe to you who have been filled , because you shall hunger . Woe to you who are laughing now , because you shall mourn and weep .
42006026	“ Woe to you when all men speak well of you , for thus their fathers did to the false prophets .
42006027	“ But I say to you who are hearing : Love your enemies , do good to those hating you .
42006028	“ Bless those cursing you , and pray for those insulting you .
42006029	“ And to him who hits you on the one cheek , offer the other also . And from him who takes away your outer garment , do not withhold the inner garment either .
42006030	“ And give to everyone who asks of you . And from him who takes away what is yours do not ask it back .
42006031	“ And as you wish men should do to you , you also do to them in the same way .
42006032	“ And if you love those loving you , what favour have you ? For sinners , too , love those loving them .
42006033	“ And if you do good to those doing good to you , what favour have you ? For even sinners do the same .
42006034	“ And if you lend to those from whom you expect to receive back , what favour have you ? For even sinners lend to sinners to receive as much back .
42006035	“ Rather , love your enemies , and do good , and lend , expecting none in return . And your reward shall be great , and you shall be sons of the Most High . Because He is kind to the thankless and wicked ones .
42006036	“ Therefore be compassionate , as your Father also is compassionate .
42006037	“ And do not judge , and you shall not be judged at all . Condemn not , and you shall not be condemned at all . Forgive , and you shall be forgiven .
42006038	“ Give , and it shall be given to you . A good measure , pressed down and shaken together and running over shall be put into your lap . For with the same measure with which you measure , it shall be measured back to you . ”
42006039	And He spoke a parable to them , “ Is a blind able to lead a blind ? Shall they not both fall into a pit ?
42006040	“ A taught one is not above his teacher , but everyone perfected shall be like his teacher .
42006041	“ And why do you see the splinter in your brother’s eye , but are not aware of the plank in your own eye ?
42006042	“ Or how are you able to say to your brother , ‘ Brother , let me take out the splinter that is in your eye , ’ not seeing the plank in your own eye ? Hypocrite , first take the plank out of your own eye , and then you shall see clearly to take out the splinter that is in your brother’s eye .
42006043	“ For a good tree does not yield rotten fruit , nor does a rotten tree yield good fruit .
42006044	“ For each tree is known by its own fruit . For they do not gather figs from thorns , nor do they gather grapes from a bramble bush .
42006045	“ The good man brings forth what is good out of the good treasure of his heart , and the wicked man brings forth what is wicked out of the wicked treasure of his heart . For out of the overflow of the heart his mouth speaks .
42006046	“ But why do you call Me ‘ Master , Master , ’ and do not do what I say ?
42006047	“ Everyone who is coming to Me , and is hearing My words and is doing them , I shall show you whom he is like :
42006048	“ He is like a man building a house , who dug deep and laid a foundation on the rock . And when a flood came , the stream burst against that house , but was unable to shake it , for it was founded on the rock .
42006049	“ But the one hearing and not doing , is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation , against which the stream burst , and immediately it fell . And the ruin of that house was great . ”
42007001	And when He completed all His words in the hearing of the people , He went into Kephar Naḥum .
42007002	And a certain captain’s servant , who was valuable to him , was sick and about to die .
42007003	And hearing about יהושע , he sent elders of the Yehuḏim to Him , asking Him to come and heal his servant .
42007004	And when they came to יהושע , they begged Him earnestly , saying , “ He is worthy for You to grant this to him ,
42007005	for he loves our nation , and has built the congregation for us . ”
42007006	So יהושע went with them . However , He was not far from the house when the captain sent friends to Him , saying to Him , “ Master , do not trouble Yourself , for I am not worthy that You should come under my roof .
42007007	“ For this reason I did not even think myself worthy to come to You . But say a word , and my servant shall be healed .
42007008	“ For I too am a man appointed under authority , having soldiers under me . And I say to one , ‘ Go , ’ and he goes , and to another , ‘ Come , ’ and he comes , and to my servant , ‘ Do this , ’ and he does it . ”
42007009	And when יהושע heard this , He marvelled at him , and turned around and said to the crowd that followed Him , “ I say to you , not even in Yisra’ĕl have I found such great belief ! ”
42007010	And those who were sent , returning to the house , found the servant who had been sick in good health .
42007011	And it came to be the next day , that He went into a city called Na‛im . And many of His taught ones went with Him , and a large crowd .
42007012	And see , as He came near the gate of the city a dead man was being carried out , the only son of his mother , and she was a widow . And a large crowd from the city was with her .
42007013	And when the Master saw her , He had compassion on her and said to her , “ Do not weep . ”
42007014	And coming near He touched the bier , and those bearing it stood still . And He said , “ Young man , I say to you , arise . ”
42007015	And he who was dead sat up and began to speak , and He gave him to his mother .
42007016	And fear seized all , and they praised Elohim , saying , “ A great prophet has been raised up among us , ” and , “ Elohim has visited His people . ”
42007017	And this news about Him went out in all Yehuḏah and all the neighbourhood .
42007018	And the taught ones of Yoḥanan reported to him about all this .
42007019	And Yoḥanan , calling two of his taught ones near , sent to יהושע , saying , “ Are You the Coming One , or should we look for another ? ”
42007020	And coming to Him , the men said , “ Yoḥanan the Immerser has sent us to You , saying , ‘ Are You the Coming One , or should we look for another ? ’ ”
42007021	And in the same hour He healed many of diseases , and afflictions , and wicked spirits . And He gave sight to many blind ones .
42007022	And יהושע answering , said to them , “ Go , report to Yoḥanan what you have seen and heard : blind receive sight , lame do walk , lepers are cleansed , deaf do hear , dead are raised , the Good News is brought to the poor .
42007023	“ And blessed is he who shall not stumble in Me . ”
42007024	And when the messengers of Yoḥanan had left , He began to speak to the crowds concerning Yoḥanan , “ What did you go out into the wilderness to see ? A reed shaken by the wind ?
42007025	“ But what did you go out to see ? A man dressed in soft garments ? Look , those who are splendidly dressed and living in luxury are in the houses of sovereigns .
42007026	“ But what did you go out to see ? A prophet ? Yea , I say to you , and more than a prophet .
42007027	“ This is he concerning whom it has been written , ‘ See , I send My messenger before Your face , who shall prepare Your way before You . ’
42007028	“ For I say to you , among those born of women there is not a greater prophet than Yoḥanan the Immerser , but he who is least in the reign of Elohim is greater than he . ”
42007029	And all the people , even the tax collectors , when they heard , declared Elohim righteous , having been immersed with the immersion of Yoḥanan .
42007030	But the Pharisees and those learned in the Torah rejected the counsel of Elohim for themselves , not having been immersed by him .
42007031	And the Master said , “ To what then shall I compare the men of this generation , and what are they like ?
42007032	“ They are like children sitting in the market-place and calling to each other , saying , ‘ We played the flute for you and you did not dance , we lamented for you and you did not weep . ’
42007033	“ For Yoḥanan the Immerser came neither eating bread nor drinking wine , and you say , ‘ He has a demon . ’
42007034	“ The Son of Aḏam has come eating and drinking , and you say , ‘ Look , a man , a glutton and a winedrinker , a friend of tax collectors and sinners ! ’
42007035	“ And wisdom is declared right by all her children . ”
42007036	And one of the Pharisees asked Him to eat with him . And He went into the Pharisee’s house , and sat down to eat .
42007037	And see , a woman in the city who was a sinner , when she knew that יהושע sat at the table in the Pharisee’s house , brought an alabaster flask of perfume .
42007038	And standing behind , at His feet , weeping , she began to wet His feet with her tears , and wiping them with the hair of her head , and was kissing His feet and anointing them with the perfume .
42007039	And when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this , he spoke to himself , saying , “ This One , if He were a prophet , would know who and what kind of woman this is who is touching Him , for she is a sinner . ”
42007040	And יהושע answering , said to him , “ Shim‛on , I have somewhat to say to you . ” And he said , “ Teacher , say it . ”
42007041	“ A certain creditor had two debtors . The one owed five hundred pieces of silver , and the other fifty .
42007042	“ And when they were unable to repay , he forgave them both . Which of them , then , shall love him more ? ”
42007043	And Shim‛on answering , said , “ I suppose the one whom he forgave more . ” And He said to him , “ You have rightly judged . ”
42007044	And turning to the woman He said to Shim‛on , “ Do you see this woman ? I came into your house – you gave Me no water for My feet , but she has wetted My feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head .
42007045	“ You gave Me no kiss , but she has not ceased to kiss My feet since the time I came in .
42007046	“ You did not anoint My head with oil , but she anointed My feet with perfume .
42007047	“ Therefore I say to you , her many sins have been forgiven , because she loved much . But to whom little is forgiven , he loves little . ”
42007048	And He said to her , “ Your sins have been forgiven . ”
42007049	And those who were sitting at the table with Him began to say among themselves , “ Who is this who even forgives sins ? ”
42007050	And He said to the woman , “ Your belief has saved you . Go in peace . ”
42008001	And it came to be , afterward , that He went through every city and village , proclaiming and bringing the Good News of the reign of Elohim , and the twelve were with Him ,
42008002	and certain women who were healed of wicked spirits and sicknesses : Miryam , called ‘ from Mag̅dala , ’ out of whom had come seven demons ,
42008003	and Yoḥanah the wife of Kuza , manager of Herodes , and Shoshannah , and many others who provided for Him from their resources .
42008004	And when a large crowd had gathered , and those who were coming to Him from every city , He spoke by a parable :
42008005	“ A sower went out to sow his seed . And as he sowed , some indeed fell by the wayside . And it was trodden down , and the birds of the heaven devoured it .
42008006	“ And other fell on rock , and when it grew up , it withered because it had no moisture .
42008007	“ And other fell among thorns , and the thorns grew up with it and choked it .
42008008	“ And other fell on the good soil , and grew up , and yielded a crop a hundredfold . ” Having said this He cried , “ He who has ears to hear , let him hear ! ”
42008009	And His taught ones were asking Him , saying , “ What does this parable mean ? ”
42008010	And He said , “ To you it has been given to know the secrets of the reign of Elohim , but to the rest in parables , that ‘ Seeing they do not see , and hearing they do not understand . ’
42008011	“ And this is the parable : The seed is the word of Elohim .
42008012	“ And those by the wayside are the ones who hear , then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts , lest having believed , they should be saved .
42008013	“ And those on the rock are those who , when they hear , receive the word with joy . And these have no root , who believe for a while and in time of trial fall away .
42008014	“ And that which fell among thorns are those who , when they have heard , go out and are choked with worries , and riches , and pleasures of life , and bring no fruit to perfection .
42008015	“ And that on the good soil are those who , having heard the word with a noble and good heart , retain it , and bear fruit with endurance .
42008016	“ And no one having lit a lamp , covers it with a vessel or puts it under a bed , but he puts it on a lampstand , so that those coming in see the light .
42008017	“ For whatever is hidden shall be revealed , and whatever is secret shall be known and come to light .
42008018	“ Therefore take heed how you hear . For whoever possesses , to him more shall be given ; and whoever does not possess , even what he thinks he possesses shall be taken from him . ”
42008019	And His mother and brothers came to Him , and were unable to get to Him because of the crowd .
42008020	And it was reported to Him , saying , “ Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside , wishing to see You . ”
42008021	And He answering , said to them , “ My mother and My brothers are those who are hearing the Word of Elohim and doing it . ”
42008022	And on a certain day it came to be , that He entered into a boat with His taught ones , and He said to them , “ Let us go over to the other side of the lake . ” And they set out .
42008023	And as they were sailing He fell asleep . And a windstorm came down on the lake , and they were filling up , and were in danger .
42008024	And they came to Him and woke Him up , saying , “ Master , Master , we are perishing ! ” And He awoke and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water . And they ceased , and there came a calm .
42008025	And He said to them , “ Where is your belief ? ” And they were afraid , and marvelled , saying to one another , “ Who then is this , that He even commands the winds and water , and they obey Him ? ”
42008026	And they sailed to the country of the Gaḏarenes , which is opposite Galil .
42008027	And as He went out onto the land , He was met by a certain man , from the city , who had demons for a long time . And he wore no garments , and he was not living in a house but in the tombs .
42008028	And when he saw יהושע , he cried out , fell down before Him , and with a loud voice said , “ What have I to do with You , יהושע , Son of the Most High Elohim ? I beg You , do not torture me ! ”
42008029	For He had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man . For it had seized him many times , and he was bound with chains and shackles , being guarded . And breaking the bonds , he was driven by the demon into the lonely places .
42008030	And יהושע asked him , saying , “ What is your name ? ” And he said , “ Legion , ” because many demons had entered into him .
42008031	And they were begging Him that He would not command them to go out into the bottomless pit .
42008032	And a herd of many pigs was feeding there on the mountain . And they begged Him to allow them to go into them . And He allowed them .
42008033	And the demons , having gone out of the man , entered into the pigs , and the herd rushed down the steep place into the lake and drowned .
42008034	And when those feeding them saw what had taken place , they fled and reported it in the city and in the country .
42008035	So they came out to see what had taken place , and came to יהושע , and found the man from whom the demons had gone out , sitting at the feet of יהושע , dressed , and in his right mind . And they were afraid .
42008036	And those who had seen it reported to them how he who had been possessed by demons was healed .
42008037	And all the crowd of the neighbourhood of the Gaḏarenes asked Him to leave them , for they were seized with great fear . And He entered into the boat and returned .
42008038	And the man from whom the demons had gone out was begging Him to be with Him . But יהושע sent him away , saying ,
42008039	“ Go back to your house , and relate what Elohim has done for you . ” And he went away proclaiming through all the city what יהושע did for him .
42008040	And it came to be , when יהושע returned , that the crowd gladly received Him , for they were all looking for Him .
42008041	And see , there came a man whose name was Ya’ir , and he was a ruler of the congregation . And falling down at the feet of יהושע he was calling upon Him to come to his house ,
42008042	because he had an only daughter about twelve years of age , and she was dying . And as He went , the crowds thronged upon Him .
42008043	And a woman , having a flow of blood for twelve years , who , having spent all her livelihood on physicians , was unable to be healed by any ,
42008044	came from behind and touched the tzitzit of His garment . And immediately her flow of blood stopped .
42008045	And יהושע said , “ Who touched Me ? ” And when all denied it , Kĕpha and those with him said , “ Master , the crowds throng You and press upon You , and You say , ‘ Who touched Me ? ’ ”
42008046	But יהושע said , “ Somebody did touch Me , for I knew power went out from Me . ”
42008047	And the woman , seeing that she was not hidden , came trembling , and falling down before Him she declared to Him in the presence of all the people why she had touched Him and how she was healed immediately .
42008048	And He said to her , “ Take courage , daughter , your belief has healed you . Go in peace . ”
42008049	While He was still speaking , someone came from the ruler of the congregation’s house , saying to him , “ Your daughter is dead . Do not trouble the Teacher any further . ”
42008050	And יהושע , having heard , answered him , saying , “ Do not be afraid , only believe , and she shall be healed . ”
42008051	And coming into the house , He allowed no one to go in except Kĕpha , and Ya‛aqoḇ , and Yoḥanan , and the girl’s father and mother .
42008052	And they were all weeping and mourning for her , and He said , “ Do not weep , she is not dead , but sleeps . ”
42008053	And they were laughing at Him , knowing that she was dead .
42008054	But taking her by the hand He called , saying , “ Child , arise . ”
42008055	And her spirit returned , and she rose up immediately . And He directed that she be given food to eat .
42008056	And her parents were astonished , but He ordered them to say to no one what had taken place .
42009001	And having called His twelve taught ones together , He gave them power and authority over all demons , and to heal diseases .
42009002	And He sent them to proclaim the reign of Elohim and to heal the sick .
42009003	And He said to them , “ Take no matter at all for the journey , neither staffs nor bag nor bread nor money – neither have two undergarments .
42009004	“ And whatever house you enter , stay there , and go out from there .
42009005	“ And as for those who do not receive you , when you go out of that city , shake off the dust from your feet as a witness against them . ”
42009006	And going out they went through the villages , bringing the Good News and healing everywhere .
42009007	And Herodes the district ruler heard of all that was done by Him , and was perplexed , because it was said by some that Yoḥanan had been raised from the dead ,
42009008	and by some that Ěliyahu had appeared , and by others that one of the old prophets has risen up .
42009009	And Herodes said , “ Yoḥanan I have beheaded , but who is this of whom I hear such reports ? ” And he was seeking to see Him .
42009010	And the emissaries , when they had returned , related to Him all that they had done . And He took them and they withdrew by themselves to a city called Bĕyth Tsaiḏa .
42009011	And when the crowds knew it , they followed Him . And having received them , He was speaking to them about the reign of Elohim , and healed those who had need of healing .
42009012	And as the day began to decline , the twelve came and said to Him , “ Send the crowd away , that going into the surrounding villages and country , they might lodge and get food , because here we are in a lonely place . ”
42009013	But He said to them , “ You give them to eat . ” And they said , “ We have no more than five loaves and two fishes , unless we go and buy food for all these people . ”
42009014	For there were about five thousand men . And He said to His taught ones , “ Make them sit down in groups of fifty . ”
42009015	And they did so , and made them all sit down .
42009016	And taking the five loaves and the two fishes , having looked up to the heaven , He blessed and broke them , and gave them to the taught ones to set before the crowd .
42009017	So they all ate and were satisfied , and twelve baskets of the broken pieces were picked up by them .
42009018	And it came to be , as He was alone praying , the taught ones were with Him , and He asked them , saying , “ Who do the crowds say that I am ? ”
42009019	And they answering , said , “ Yoḥanan the Immerser , but others Ěliyahu , and others say that one of the old prophets has risen up . ”
42009020	And He said to them , “ And you , who do you say I am ? ” And Kĕpha answering , said , “ The Messiah of Elohim . ”
42009021	And strictly warning them , He commanded them to say this to no one ,
42009022	saying , “ The Son of Aḏam has to suffer much , and to be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes , and to be killed , and to be raised the third day . ”
42009023	And He said to them all , “ If anyone wishes to come after Me , let him deny himself , and take up his stake daily , and follow Me .
42009024	“ For whoever wishes to save his life shall lose it , but whoever loses his life for My sake shall save it .
42009025	“ For what is a man profited if he gains all the world , and is himself destroyed or lost ?
42009026	“ For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words , of him the Son of Aḏam shall be ashamed when He comes in His esteem , and in His Father’s , and of the set-apart messengers .
42009027	“ But truly I say to you , there are some standing here who shall not taste death at all till they see the reign of Elohim : ”
42009028	And it came to be , about eight days after these words , taking with Him Kĕpha and Yoḥanan and Ya‛aqoḇ , He went up to the mountain to pray .
42009029	And it came to be , as He prayed , the appearance of His face changed , and His garment dazzling white .
42009030	And see , two men were talking with Him , who were Mosheh and Ěliyahu ,
42009031	who having appeared in esteem , spoke of His death which He was about to complete at Yerushalayim .
42009032	But Kĕpha and those with him were heavy with sleep . And having awakened , they saw His esteem and the two men standing with Him .
42009033	And it came to be , as they were parting from Him , Kĕpha said to יהושע , “ Master , it is good for us to be here . And let us make three booths : one for You , and one for Mosheh , and one for Ěliyahu , ” not knowing what he said .
42009034	And as he was saying this , a cloud came and overshadowed them . And they were afraid as they entered the cloud .
42009035	And a voice came out of the cloud , saying , “ This is My Son , the Beloved . Hear Him ! ”
42009036	And when the voice had spoken , יהושע was found alone . And they were silent , and reported to no one in those days any of what they had seen .
42009037	And it came to be on the next day , when they came down from the mountain , that a large crowd met Him .
42009038	And see , a man from the crowd cried out , saying , “ Teacher , I beg You , look at my son , for he is my only child .
42009039	“ And see , a spirit seizes him , and he suddenly cries out , and it convulses him , with foaming , and scarcely leaves him , bruising him .
42009040	“ And I begged Your taught ones to cast it out , but they were unable . ”
42009041	And יהושע answering , said , “ O generation , unbelieving and perverse , how long shall I be with you and put up with you ? Bring your son here . ”
42009042	And as he was still coming , the demon threw him down in convulsions . And יהושע rebuked the unclean spirit , and healed the child , and gave him back to his father .
42009043	And they were all amazed at the greatness of Elohim . And while all were marvelling at all that יהושע did , He said to His taught ones ,
42009044	“ Lay up in your ears these words , for the Son of Aḏam is about to be delivered into the hands of men . ”
42009045	But they did not understand this saying , and it was veiled from them so that they did not perceive it . And they were afraid to ask Him about this saying .
42009046	And a reasoning arose among them , who might be the greater of them .
42009047	And יהושע , having seen the reasoning of their heart , took a little child and placed him by His side ,
42009048	and said to them , “ Whoever receives this little child in My Name receives Me . And whoever receives Me receives Him who sent Me . For he who is least among you all , he shall be great . ”
42009049	And Yoḥanan answering , said , “ Master , we saw someone casting out demons in Your Name , and we forbade him because he does not follow with us . ”
42009050	But יהושע said to him , “ Do not forbid him , for he who is not against us is for us . ”
42009051	And it came to be , when the days of His taking up were being completed , even He set His face to go to Yerushalayim ,
42009052	and He sent messengers ahead of Him . And they went and entered into a village of the Shomeronites , to prepare for Him .
42009053	And they did not receive Him , because His face was set for the journey to Yerushalayim .
42009054	And His taught ones , Ya‛aqoḇ and Yoḥanan , seeing it said , “ Master , do You wish us to command fire to come down from the heaven and destroy them , as also Ěliyahu did ? ”
42009055	But having turned , He rebuked them and said , “ You do not know of what spirit you are ,
42009056	for the Son of Aḏam did not come to destroy men’s lives but to save them . ” And they went on to another village .
42009057	And it came to be , as they journeyed on the way , that someone said to Him , “ Master , I shall follow You wherever You go . ”
42009058	And יהושע said to him , “ The foxes have holes and the birds of the heaven nests , but the Son of Aḏam has nowhere to lay His head . ”
42009059	And He said to another , “ Follow Me , ” but he said , “ Master , let me first go and bury my father . ”
42009060	And יהושע said to him , “ Let the dead bury their own dead , but you go and announce the reign of Elohim . ”
42009061	And another also said , “ Master , I shall follow You , but let me first say good-bye to those in my house . ”
42009062	But יהושע said to him , “ No one , having put his hand to the plough , and looking back , is fit for the reign of Elohim . ”
42010001	And after this the Master appointed seventy others , and sent them two by two ahead of Him into every city and place where He Himself was about to go .
42010002	Then He said to them , “ The harvest indeed is great , but the workers are few , therefore pray the Master of the harvest to send out workers into His harvest .
42010003	“ Go ! See , I send you out as lambs into the midst of wolves .
42010004	“ Do not take a purse , nor a bag , nor sandals . And greet no one along the way .
42010005	“ And whatever house you enter , first say , ‘ Peace to this house . ’
42010006	“ And if indeed a son of peace is there , your peace shall rest on it ; and if not , it shall return to you .
42010007	“ And stay in the same house , eating and drinking whatever with them , for the labourer is worthy of his wages . Do not move from house to house .
42010008	“ And into whatever city you enter , and they receive you , eat whatever is placed before you ,
42010009	and heal the sick there , and say to them , ‘ The reign of Elohim has come near to you . ’
42010010	“ And into whatever city you enter , and they do not receive you , go out into its streets and say ,
42010011	‘ Even the dust of your city which clings to us , we wipe off against you , but know this , that the reign of Elohim has come near to you . ’
42010012	“ And I say to you that it shall be more bearable for Seḏom in that Day , than for that city .
42010013	“ Woe to you , Korazin ! Woe to you , Bĕyth Tsaiḏa ! For if the miracles which were done in you had been done in Tsor and Tsiḏon , they would have repented long ago , sitting in sackcloth and ashes .
42010014	“ But it shall be more bearable for Tsor and Tsiḏon at the judgment than for you .
42010015	“ And you , Kephar Naḥum , who are exalted to the heaven , shall be brought down to the grave .
42010016	“ He who hears you hears Me , he who rejects you rejects Me , and he who rejects Me rejects Him who sent Me . ”
42010017	And the seventy returned with joy , saying , “ Master , even the demons are subject to us in Your Name . ”
42010018	And He said to them , “ I saw Satan falling out of the heaven as lightning .
42010019	“ See , I give you the authority to trample on serpents and scorpions , and over all the power of the enemy , and none at all shall hurt you .
42010020	“ But do not rejoice in this , that the spirits are subject to you , but rather rejoice because your names have been written in the heavens . ”
42010021	In that hour יהושע exulted in the Spirit and said , “ I praise You , Father , Master of the heaven and of the earth , that You have hidden these matters from clever and learned ones , and did reveal them to babes . Yea , Father , because thus it was well-pleasing in Your sight .
42010022	“ All has been delivered to Me by My Father , and no one knows who the Son is , except the Father , and who the Father is , except the Son , and he to whom the Son wishes to reveal Him . ”
42010023	And turning to His taught ones He said , separately , “ Blessed are the eyes that see what you see ,
42010024	for I say to you that many prophets and sovereigns have wished to see what you see , and have not seen it , and to hear what you hear , and have not heard it . ”
42010025	And see , a certain one learned in the Torah stood up , trying Him , and saying , “ Teacher , what shall I do to inherit everlasting life ? ”
42010026	And He said to him , “ What has been written in the Torah ? How do you read it ? ”
42010027	And he answering , said , “ ‘ You shall love יהוה your Elohim with all your heart , and with all your being , and with all your strength , and with all your mind , ’ and ‘ your neighbour as yourself . ’ ”
42010028	And He said to him , “ You have answered rightly . Do this and you shall live . ”
42010029	But he , wishing to declare himself righteous , said to יהושע , “ And who is my neighbour ? ”
42010030	And replying , יהושע said , “ A certain man was going down from Yerushalayim to Yeriḥo , and fell among robbers , who , both stripping and beating him , went away , leaving him half dead .
42010031	“ And by a coincidence a certain priest was going down that way . And when he saw him , he passed by on the other side .
42010032	“ And likewise a Lĕwite also , when he came to the place , and seeing , passed by on the other side .
42010033	“ But a certain Shomeronite , journeying , came upon him . And when he saw him , he had compassion on him ,
42010034	and he went to him and bandaged his wounds , pouring on oil and wine . And having placed him on his own beast , he brought him to an inn , and looked after him .
42010035	“ And going out on the next day , he took out two pieces of silver , gave them to the innkeeper , and said to him , ‘ Look after him , and whatever more you spend I shall repay you when I return . ’
42010036	“ Who , then , of these three , do you think , was neighbour to him who fell among the robbers ? ”
42010037	And he said , “ He who showed compassion on him . ” Then יהושע said to him , “ Go and do likewise . ”
42010038	And it came to be as they went that He entered into a certain village . And a certain woman named Martha received Him into her house .
42010039	And she had a sister called Miryam , who also sat at the feet of יהושע and heard His word .
42010040	But Martha was distracted with much serving , and coming up she said , “ Master , are You not concerned that my sister has left me to serve alone ? Speak to her then , to help me . ”
42010041	And יהושע answering , said to her , “ Martha , Martha , you are worried and troubled about many matters ,
42010042	but one only is necessary , and Miryam has chosen the good portion , which shall not be taken away from her . ”
42011001	And it came to be while He was praying in a certain place , as He ceased , one of His taught ones said to Him , “ Master , teach us to pray , as Yoḥanan also taught his taught ones . ”
42011002	And He said to them , “ When you pray , say : Our Father in the heavens , let Your Name be set-apart , let Your reign come , let Your desire be done on earth as it is in heaven .
42011003	“ Give us day by day our daily bread .
42011004	“ And forgive us our sins , for we also forgive everyone who is indebted to us . And do not lead us into trial , but rescue us from the wicked one . ”
42011005	And He said to them , “ Which of you shall have a friend , and go to him at midnight and say to him , ‘ Friend , lend me three loaves ,
42011006	since a friend of mine has come to me on his journey , and I do not have food to set before him , ’
42011007	then the one inside answering , says , ‘ Do not trouble me , the door is already locked , and my children with me are in bed . I am unable to get up and give to you’ ?
42011008	“ I say to you , if he does not get up and give to him because he is his friend , he shall get up and give him as many as he needs because of his persistence .
42011009	“ And I say to you : ask and it shall be given to you , seek and you shall find , knock and it shall be opened to you .
42011010	“ For everyone asking receives , and he who is seeking finds , and to him who is knocking it shall be opened .
42011011	“ And what father among you whose son asks for bread shall give him a stone , or if he asks for a fish shall give him a snake instead of a fish ,
42011012	or if he asks for an egg shall give him a scorpion ?
42011013	“ If you then , being wicked , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more shall your Father from heaven give the Set-apart Spirit to those asking Him ! ”
42011014	And He was casting out a demon , and it was dumb . And it came to be , when the demon had gone out , that the dumb spoke . And the crowds marvelled .
42011015	But some of them said , “ He casts out demons by Be‛elzebul , the ruler of the demons , ”
42011016	and others , trying Him , were seeking from Him a sign from heaven .
42011017	And He , knowing their thoughts , said to them , “ Every reign divided against itself is laid waste , and a house divided against a house falls .
42011018	“ So if Satan also is divided against himself , how shall his reign stand ? Because you say I cast out demons by Be‛elzebul .
42011019	“ Now if I cast out demons by Be‛elzebul , by whom do your sons cast them out ? Because of this they shall be your judges .
42011020	“ But if I cast out demons by the finger of Elohim , then the reign of Elohim has come upon you .
42011021	“ When a strong man , having been well armed , watches over his own court , his possessions are in peace .
42011022	“ But when a stronger than he comes upon him and overcomes him , he takes from him all his armour in which he trusted , and divides his booty .
42011023	“ He who is not with Me is against Me , and he who does not gather with Me scatters .
42011024	“ When the unclean spirit goes out of a man , he goes through dry places , seeking rest . And finding none , he says , ‘ I shall return to my house from which I came . ’
42011025	“ And when he comes , he finds it swept and decorated ,
42011026	then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself , and they enter and dwell there . And the last state of that man becomes worse than the first . ”
42011027	And it came to be , as He was saying this , a certain woman from the crowd raised her voice and said to Him , “ Blessed is the womb that bore You , and the breasts which You sucked ! ”
42011028	But He said , “ Blessed rather are those hearing the Word of Elohim and watching over it ! ”
42011029	And while the crowds were thronging , He began to say , “ This generation is wicked . It seeks a sign , and no sign shall be given to it except the sign of Yonah the prophet .
42011030	“ For as Yonah became a sign to the Ninewites , so also the Son of Aḏam shall be to this generation .
42011031	“ The sovereigness of the South shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation and shall condemn them , for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Shelomoh , and look , a greater than Shelomoh is here .
42011032	“ The men of Ninewĕh shall rise up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it , for they repented at the preaching of Yonah , and look , a greater than Yonah is here .
42011033	“ And no one , when he has lit a lamp , puts it in a hidden place or under a basket , but on a lampstand , that those who come in shall see the light .
42011034	“ The lamp of the body is the eye . Therefore , when your eye is good , all your body also is enlightened . But when your eye is evil , your body also is darkened .
42011035	“ See to it therefore that the light which is in you is not darkness .
42011036	“ If then all your body is enlightened , having no part dark , all shall be enlightened , as when the bright shining of a lamp gives you light . ”
42011037	And as He spoke , a certain Pharisee asked Him to dine with him , so He went in and sat down to eat .
42011038	And when the Pharisee saw it , he marvelled that He did not first wash before dinner .
42011039	And the Master said to him , “ Now you Pharisees make the outside of the cup and dish clean , but your inward part is filled with greed and wickedness .
42011040	“ Mindless ones ! Did not He who made the outside make the inside also ?
42011041	“ But give in kindness of that which is within , and see , all are clean to you .
42011042	“ But woe to you Pharisees , because you tithe the mint and the rue and every plant , and pass by the right-ruling and the love of Elohim . These you should have done , without leaving the others undone .
42011043	“ Woe to you Pharisees , because you love the best seats in the congregations and the greetings in the market-places .
42011044	“ Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites , because you are like the unseen tombs , and the men walking over them do not know . ”
42011045	And one of those learned in the Torah , answering , said to Him , “ Teacher , when You say this You insult us too . ”
42011046	And He said , “ Woe to you also , you learned in the Torah , because you load men with burdens hard to bear , and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers .
42011047	“ Woe to you , because you build the tombs of the prophets , and your fathers killed them .
42011048	“ So you bear witness that you approve of the works of your fathers , because they indeed killed them , and you build their tombs .
42011049	“ And because of this the wisdom of Elohim said , ‘ I shall send them prophets and emissaries , and some of them they shall kill and persecute , ’
42011050	so that the blood of all the prophets which was shed from the foundation of the world shall be required of this generation ,
42011051	from the blood of Heḇel to the blood of Zeḵaryah who perished between the altar and the Dwelling Place . Yea , I say to you , it shall be required of this generation .
42011052	“ Woe to you learned in the Torah , because you took away the key of knowledge . You did not enter in yourselves , and those who were entering in you hindered . ”
42011053	And as He was saying this to them , the scribes and the Pharisees began to oppose Him fiercely , and to draw Him out on many subjects ,
42011054	watching Him , and seeking to catch Him in whatever He says , so as to accuse Him .
42012001	Meanwhile , when an innumerable crowd of people had gathered together , so that they trampled one another , He began to say to His taught ones , first , “ Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees , which is hypocrisy .
42012002	“ And whatever is concealed shall be revealed , and whatever is hidden shall be known .
42012003	“ So , whatever you have said in the dark shall be heard in the light , and what you have spoken in the ear in inner rooms shall be proclaimed on the house-tops .
42012004	“ But I say to you , My friends , do not be afraid of those who kill the body , and after that are unable to do any more .
42012005	“ But I shall show you whom you should fear : Fear the One who , after killing , possesses authority to cast into Gehenna . Yea , I say to you , fear Him !
42012006	“ Are not five sparrows sold for two copper coins ? And not one of them is forgotten before Elohim .
42012007	“ But even the hairs of your head have all been numbered . Do not fear , you are worth more than many sparrows .
42012008	“ And I say to you , everyone who confesses Me before men , the Son of Aḏam shall also confess him before the messengers of Elohim .
42012009	“ But he that has denied Me before men shall be denied before the messengers of Elohim .
42012010	“ And everyone who shall speak a word against the Son of Aḏam , it shall be forgiven him , but to him who has blasphemed against the Set-apart Spirit , it shall not be forgiven .
42012011	“ And when they bring you to the congregations and rulers and authorities , do not worry about how or what you should answer , or what you should say ,
42012012	for the Set-apart Spirit shall teach you in that very hour what you should say . ”
42012013	And someone from the crowd said to Him , “ Teacher , speak to my brother , to divide the inheritance with me . ”
42012014	But He said to him , “ Man , who made Me a judge or divider over you ? ”
42012015	And He said to them , “ Mind , and beware of greed , because one’s life does not consist in the excess of his possessions . ”
42012016	He then spoke a parable to them , saying , “ The land of a certain rich man yielded well .
42012017	“ And he was reasoning within himself , saying , ‘ What shall I do , because I have no room to store my crops ? ’
42012018	“ And he said , ‘ I am going to do this : pull down my storehouses and build greater , and store all my crops and my goods there ,
42012019	then say to myself , “ Life , you have many goods laid up for many years , take your ease , eat , drink , rejoice . ” ’
42012020	“ But Elohim said to him , ‘ You mindless one ! This night your life shall be demanded from you . And who shall own what you have prepared ? ’
42012021	“ So is he who is storing up treasure for himself , and is not rich toward Elohim . ”
42012022	And He said to His taught ones , “ For this reason I say to you , do not worry about your life , what you shall eat ; nor about the body , what you shall put on .
42012023	“ The life is more than the food , and the body is more than the clothing .
42012024	“ Look at the ravens , for they neither sow nor reap , which have neither storehouse nor granary , and Elohim feeds them . How much more valuable are you than the birds ?
42012025	“ And which of you by worrying is able to add one cubit to his life’s span ?
42012026	“ If then you are unable to do the least , why do you worry about the rest ?
42012027	“ Look at the lilies , how they grow . They neither toil nor spin , and I say to you , even Shelomoh in all his esteem was not dressed like one of these .
42012028	“ And if Elohim so clothes the grass , which today exists in the field and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace , how much more you , O you of little belief ?
42012029	“ And do not seek what you shall eat or what you shall drink , and do not keep worrying .
42012030	“ For the gentiles of the world seek all these , and your Father knows that you need these .
42012031	“ But seek the reign of Elohim , and all these shall be added to you .
42012032	“ Do not fear , little flock , because your Father did delight to give you the reign .
42012033	“ Sell your possessions and give in kindness . Make yourselves purses which do not grow old , a treasure in the heavens that does not fail , where no thief does come near nor moth destroys .
42012034	“ For where your treasure is , there your heart shall be also .
42012035	“ Let your loins be girded and your lamps burning ,
42012036	and be like men waiting for their master , when he shall return from the wedding , that when he comes and knocks they open to him immediately .
42012037	“ Blessed are those servants whom the master , when he comes , shall find watching . Truly , I say to you that he shall gird himself and make them sit down to eat , and shall come and serve them .
42012038	“ And if he comes in the second watch , or in the third watch , and find them so , blessed are those servants .
42012039	“ And know this , that if the master of the house had known what hour the thief comes , he would have watched and not allowed his house to be broken into .
42012040	“ And you , then , be ready , for the Son of Aḏam is coming at an hour you do not expect . ”
42012041	And Kĕpha said to Him , “ Master , do You speak this parable to us , or also to all ? ”
42012042	And the Master said , “ Who then is the trustworthy and wise manager , whom his master shall appoint over his household , to give the portion of food in due season ?
42012043	“ Blessed is that servant whom his master shall find so doing when he comes .
42012044	“ Truly , I say to you that he shall appoint him over all his possessions .
42012045	“ But if that servant says in his heart , ‘ My master is delaying his coming , ’ and begins to beat the male servants and female servants , and to eat and drink and be drunk ,
42012046	the master of that servant shall come on a day when he does not expect him , and at an hour that he does not know , and shall cut him in two and appoint his portion with the unbelievers .
42012047	“ And that servant who knew his master’s desire , and did not prepare , nor did according to his desire , shall be beaten with many stripes .
42012048	“ But he who did not know , yet did what deserved flogging , shall be beaten with few . And everyone to whom much is given , from him much shall be demanded . And to whom much has been entrusted , from him much more shall be asked .
42012049	“ I came to send fire on the earth , and how I wish it were already kindled !
42012050	“ But I have an immersion to be immersed with , and how distressed I am until it is accomplished !
42012051	“ Do you think that I came to give peace on earth ? I say to you , no , but rather division .
42012052	“ For from now on five in one house shall be divided , three against two , and two against three –
42012053	father shall be divided against son , and son against father , mother against daughter , and daughter against mother , mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law , and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law . ”
42012054	And He also said to the crowds , “ When you see a cloud rising out of the west , immediately you say , ‘ A storm is coming , ’ and so it is .
42012055	“ And when you see the south wind blow , you say , ‘ There shall be hot weather , ’ and it is .
42012056	“ Hypocrites ! You know to discern the face of the heaven and of the earth , but how is it you do not discern this time ?
42012057	“ And why , also , do you not judge for yourselves what is right ?
42012058	“ For , as you go with your opponent to a ruler , try hard along the way to settle with him , lest he drag you to the judge , and the judge deliver you to the officer , and the officer throw you into prison .
42012059	“ I say to you , you shall certainly not leave there until you have paid even the last mite . ”
42013001	And some were present at that time , reporting to Him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their offerings .
42013002	And יהושע answering , said to them , “ Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all other Galileans , because they have suffered like this ?
42013003	“ I say to you , no ! But unless you repent you shall all perish in the same way .
42013004	“ Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Shiloaḥ fell and killed them , do you think that they were greater offenders than all other men who dwelt in Yerushalayim ?
42013005	“ I say to you , no ! But unless you repent you shall all perish in the same way . ”
42013006	And He spoke this parable , “ A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard , and he came seeking fruit on it and found none .
42013007	“ And he said to the gardener , ‘ Look , for three years I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none . Cut it down , why does it even make the ground useless ? ’
42013008	“ And he answering , said to him , ‘ Master , leave it this year too , until I dig around it and throw manure .
42013009	‘ And if indeed it bears fruit , good . But if not so , you shall cut it down . ’ ”
42013010	And He was teaching in one of the congregations on the Sabbath ,
42013011	and see , there was a woman having a weakening spirit for eighteen years , and was bent over and was unable to straighten up at all .
42013012	And יהושע , seeing her , called her near and said to her , “ Woman , you are loosened from your weakness . ”
42013013	And He laid His hands on her , and immediately she was straightened up , and praised Elohim .
42013014	But the ruler of the congregation , responding , much displeased that יהושע had healed on the Sabbath , said to the crowd , “ There are six days on which men should work , so come and be healed on them , and not on the Sabbath day . ”
42013015	Then the Master answered him and said , “ Hypocrite ! Does not each one of you on the Sabbath loosen his ox or his donkey from the stall , and lead it away to water it ?
42013016	“ And this one , being a daughter of Aḇraham , whom Satan has bound , look , for eighteen years , should she not be loosened from this bond on the Sabbath ? ”
42013017	And when He said this , all His opponents were put to shame . And all the crowd rejoiced for all the splendid works being done by Him .
42013018	Therefore He said , “ What is the reign of Elohim like ? And to what shall I compare it ?
42013019	“ It is like a mustard seed , which a man took and threw into his garden . And it grew and became a large tree , and the birds of the heavens nested in its branches . ”
42013020	And again He said , “ To what shall I compare the reign of Elohim ?
42013021	“ It is like leaven , which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour until it was all leavened . ”
42013022	And He was going through the cities and villages , teaching , and journeying toward Yerushalayim ,
42013023	and someone said to Him , “ Master , are there few who are being saved ? ” And He said to them ,
42013024	“ Strive to enter through the narrow gate , because many , I say to you , shall seek to enter in and shall not be able .
42013025	“ When once the Master of the house has risen up and shut the door , and you begin to stand outside and knock at the door , saying , ‘ Master , Master , open for us , ’ and He shall answer and say to you , ‘ I do not know you , where you are from , ’
42013026	then you shall begin to say , ‘ We ate and drank in Your presence , and You taught in our streets . ’
42013027	“ But He shall say , ‘ I say to you I do not know you , where you are from . Depart from Me , all you workers of unrighteousness . ’
42013028	“ There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth , when you see Aḇraham and Yitsḥaq and Ya‛aqoḇ and all the prophets in the reign of Elohim , and yourselves thrown outside .
42013029	“ And they shall come from the east and the west , and from the north and the south , and sit down in the reign of Elohim .
42013030	“ And see , there are last who shall be first , and there are first who shall be last . ”
42013031	On the same day there came certain Pharisees , saying to Him , “ Get out and go from here , for Herodes wishes to kill You . ”
42013032	And He said to them , “ Go , say to that fox , ‘ See , I cast out demons and perform healings today and tomorrow , and the third day I shall be perfected . ’
42013033	“ But I have to journey today , and tomorrow , and the day following , because it is not fitting for a prophet to perish outside of Yerushalayim .
42013034	“ Yerushalayim , Yerushalayim , killing the prophets and stoning those who are sent to her ! How often I wished to gather your children together , the way a hen gathers her chickens under her wings , but you would not !
42013035	“ See , your House is left to you laid waste . And truly I say to you , you shall by no means see Me until the time comes when you say , ‘ Blessed is He who is coming in the Name of יהוה ! ’ ”
42014001	And it came to be , as He went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees to eat bread on the Sabbath , that they were watching Him closely .
42014002	And see , there was a certain man before Him suffering from dropsy .
42014003	And יהושע responding , spoke to those learned in the Torah and the Pharisees , saying , “ Is it right to heal on the Sabbath ? ”
42014004	But they were silent . So taking hold of him He healed him , and let him go .
42014005	And to them He said , “ Which of you , having a donkey or an ox that has fallen into a pit , shall not immediately pull him out on the Sabbath day ? ”
42014006	And they were unable to answer Him regarding these matters .
42014007	And He spoke a parable to those who were invited , when He noted how they chose the best places , saying to them :
42014008	“ When you are invited by anyone to a wedding feast , do not sit down in the best place , lest one more distinguished than you be invited by him ,
42014009	and he who invited you and him come and say to you , ‘ Give this one place , ’ and then you begin with shame to take the last place .
42014010	“ Rather , when you are invited , go and sit down in the last place , so that when he who invited you comes he shall say to you , ‘ Friend , come up higher . ’ Then you shall have esteem in the presence of those who sit at the table with you .
42014011	“ For everyone who is exalting himself shall be humbled , and he who is humbling himself shall be exalted . ”
42014012	And He also said to him who invited Him , “ When you give a dinner or a supper , do not ask your friends , nor your brothers , nor your relatives , nor your rich neighbours , lest they also invite you back , and you be repaid .
42014013	“ But when you give a feast , invite poor ones , crippled ones , lame ones , blind ones ,
42014014	and you shall be blessed , because they do not have to repay you . For you shall be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous . ”
42014015	And when one of those who sat at the table with Him heard this , he said to Him , “ Blessed is he who eats bread in the reign of Elohim ! ”
42014016	But He said to him , “ A certain man gave a great supper and invited many ,
42014017	and he sent his servant at supper time to say to those who were invited , ‘ Come , for all is now ready . ’
42014018	“ But one by one they all began making excuses . The first said to him , ‘ I have bought a field , and I need to go and see it . I ask you to have me excused . ’
42014019	“ And another said , ‘ I have bought five yoke of oxen , and I am going to try them out . I ask you to have me excused . ’
42014020	“ And another said , ‘ I have married a wife , and because of this I am unable to come . ’
42014021	“ And that servant came and reported this to his master . Then the master of the house , being wroth , said to his servant , ‘ Hurry out into the streets and lanes of the city , and bring in here the poor , and crippled , and lame , and blind . ’
42014022	“ And the servant said , ‘ Master , it is done as you commanded , and still there is room . ’
42014023	“ And the master said to the servant , ‘ Go out into the street corners and hedges , and compel them to come in , so that my house is filled .
42014024	‘ For I say to you that none of those men who were invited shall taste my supper . ’ ”
42014025	And large crowds were going with Him , and turning , He said to them ,
42014026	“ If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father and mother , and wife , and children , and brothers , and sisters , and his own life too , he is unable to be My taught one .
42014027	“ And whoever does not bear his stake and come after Me is unable to be My taught one .
42014028	“ For who of you , wishing to build a tower , does not sit down first and count the cost , whether he has enough to complete it ?
42014029	“ Otherwise , when he has laid the foundation , and is unable to finish it , all who see it begin to mock him ,
42014030	saying , ‘ This man began to build and was unable to finish . ’
42014031	“ Or what sovereign , going to fight against another sovereign , does not sit down first and take counsel whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand ?
42014032	“ And if not , while the other is still far away , he sends a delegation and asks conditions of peace .
42014033	“ So , then , everyone of you who does not give up all that he has , is unable to be My taught one .
42014034	“ The salt is good , but if the salt becomes tasteless , with what shall it be seasoned ?
42014035	“ It is not fit for land , nor for manure , they throw it out . He who has ears to hear , let him hear ! ”
42015001	Now all the tax collectors and the sinners were coming to Him to hear Him .
42015002	And the Pharisees and scribes grumbled , saying , “ This One receives sinners and eats with them . ”
42015003	And He spoke this parable to them , saying ,
42015004	“ What man among you , having a hundred sheep , and having lost one of them , does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the one which is lost until he finds it ?
42015005	“ And having found it , he lays it on his shoulders , rejoicing .
42015006	“ And having come home , he calls together his friends and neighbours , saying to them , ‘ Rejoice with me , for I have found my sheep which was lost ! ’
42015007	“ I say to you that in the same way there shall be more joy in the heaven over one sinner repenting , than over ninety-nine righteous ones who need no repentance .
42015008	“ Or what woman , having ten silver coins , if she loses one coin , does not light a lamp and sweep the house , and seek diligently till she finds it ?
42015009	“ And having found it , she calls friends and neighbours together , saying , ‘ Rejoice with me , for I have found the coin which I lost ! ’
42015010	“ I say to you , in the same way there is joy in the presence of the messengers of Elohim over one sinner repenting . ”
42015011	And He said , “ A certain man had two sons ,
42015012	and the younger of them said to his father , ‘ Father , give me the portion of goods falling to me . ’ And he divided his livelihood between them .
42015013	“ And not many days after , the younger son , having gathered all together , went away to a distant country , and there wasted his goods with loose living .
42015014	“ And when he had spent all , there arose a severe scarcity of food throughout that land , and he began to be in need .
42015015	“ And he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country , and he sent him to his fields to feed pigs .
42015016	“ And he was longing to fill his stomach with the pods which the pigs were eating , and no one gave to him .
42015017	“ But having come to himself , he said , ‘ How many of my father’s hired servants have bread enough and to spare , and I am perishing with hunger !
42015018	‘ Having risen , I shall go to my father and say to him , “ Father , I have sinned against the heaven , and before you ,
42015019	and I am no longer worthy to be called your son . Make me like one of your hired servants . ” ’
42015020	“ And having risen , he went to his father . And while he was still a long way off , his father saw him and was moved with compassion , and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him .
42015021	“ And the son said to him , ‘ Father , I have sinned against the heaven , and before you , and I am no longer worthy to be called your son . ’
42015022	“ But the father said to his servants , ‘ Bring out the best robe and put it on him , and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet .
42015023	‘ And bring the fattened calf here and slaughter it , and let us eat and rejoice ,
42015024	because this son of mine was dead and is alive again , and he was lost and is found . ’ And they began to rejoice .
42015025	“ And his older son was in the field , and when he came and approached the house , he heard music and dancing .
42015026	“ And having called one of the servants he asked what this meant .
42015027	“ And he said to him , ‘ Your brother has come , and your father has slaughtered the fattened calf because he received him back in health . ’
42015028	“ And he was wroth and would not go in . So his father came out and pleaded with him .
42015029	“ And answering , he said to his father , ‘ See , these many years I have been serving you , and I have never transgressed a command of yours , but to me you have never given a young goat , so I could rejoice with my friends .
42015030	‘ But when this son of yours came , who has devoured your livelihood with whores , you slaughtered the fattened calf for him . ’
42015031	“ Then he said to him , ‘ Son , you are always with me , and all I have is yours .
42015032	‘ And we had to rejoice and be glad , for your brother was dead and is alive , and was lost and is found . ’ ”
42016001	And He also said to His taught ones , “ There was a certain rich man who had a manager and he was accused to him as wasting his possessions .
42016002	“ So having called him he said to him , ‘ What is this I hear about you ? Give an account of your management , for you are no longer able to be manager . ’
42016003	“ And the manager said within himself , ‘ What shall I do ? For my master is taking the managership away from me . I am unable to dig , I am ashamed to beg .
42016004	‘ I know what I shall do , that , when I am removed from the managership , they might receive me into their houses . ’
42016005	“ And calling every one of his master’s debtors to him , he said to the first , ‘ How much do you owe my master ? ’
42016006	“ And he said , ‘ A hundred measures of oil . ’ And he said to him , ‘ Take your bill , and sit down quickly and write fifty . ’
42016007	“ Then to another he said , ‘ And how much do you owe ? ’ And he said , ‘ A hundred measures of wheat . ’ And he said to him , ‘ Take your bill , and write eighty . ’
42016008	“ And the master praised the unrighteous manager because he had acted shrewdly , because the sons of this age are more shrewd in their generation than the sons of light .
42016009	“ And would I say to you , make friends for yourselves by unrighteous mammon , that when you fail , they shall receive you into everlasting dwellings ?
42016010	“ He who is trustworthy in what is least , is trustworthy also in much . And he who is unrighteous in what is least is unrighteous also in much .
42016011	“ If , therefore , you have not been trustworthy in the unrighteous mammon , who shall entrust to you the true ?
42016012	“ And if you have not been trustworthy in what is another man’s , who shall give you what is your own ?
42016013	“ No servant is able to serve two masters , for either he shall hate the one and love the other , or else he shall cling to the one and despise the other . You are not able to serve Elohim and mammon . ”
42016014	And the Pharisees , who loved silver , also heard all this , and were sneering at Him ,
42016015	so He said to them , “ You are those who declare yourselves righteous before men , but Elohim knows your hearts , because what is highly thought of among men is an abomination in the sight of Elohim .
42016016	“ The Torah and the prophets are until Yoḥanan . Since then the reign of Elohim is being announced , and everyone is doing violence upon it .
42016017	“ And it is easier for the heaven and the earth to pass away than for one tittle of the Torah to fall .
42016018	“ Everyone putting away his wife and marrying another commits adultery . And everyone marrying her who is put away from her husband commits adultery .
42016019	“ But there was a certain rich man who used to dress in purple and fine linen and lived luxuriously every day .
42016020	“ And there was a certain beggar named El‛azar , being covered with sores , who was placed at his gate ,
42016021	and longing to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man’s table . Indeed , even the dogs came and licked his sores .
42016022	“ And it came to be that the beggar died , and was carried by the messengers to the bosom of Aḇraham . And the rich man also died and was buried .
42016023	“ And while suffering tortures in the grave , having lifted up his eyes , he saw Aḇraham far away , and El‛azar in his bosom .
42016024	“ And crying out he said , ‘ Father Aḇraham , have compassion on me , and send El‛azar to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue , for I am suffering in this flame . ’
42016025	“ But Aḇraham said , ‘ Son , remember that in your life you received your good , and likewise El‛azar the evil , but now he is comforted and you are suffering .
42016026	‘ And besides all this , between us and you a great chasm has been set , so that those who wish to pass from here to you are unable , nor do those from there pass to us . ’
42016027	“ And he said , ‘ Then I beg you , father , that you would send him to my father’s house ,
42016028	for I have five brothers , let him warn them , lest they also come to this place of torture . ’
42016029	“ Aḇraham said to him , ‘ They have Mosheh and the prophets , let them hear them . ’
42016030	“ And he said , ‘ No , father Aḇraham , but if someone from the dead goes to them , they shall repent . ’
42016031	“ But he said to him , ‘ If they do not hear Mosheh and the prophets , neither would they be persuaded even if one should rise from the dead . ’ ”
42017001	And He said to the taught ones , “ It is inevitable that stumbling-blocks should come , but woe to him through whom they come !
42017002	“ It would be better for him if a millstone is put around his neck , and he were thrown into the sea , than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble .
42017003	“ Take heed to yourselves . If your brother sins against you , rebuke him , and if he repents , forgive him .
42017004	“ And if he sins against you seven times in a day , and seven times in a day comes back to you , saying , ‘ I repent , ’ you shall forgive him . ”
42017005	And the emissaries said to the Master , “ Give us more belief . ”
42017006	And the Master said , “ If you have belief as a mustard seed , you would say to this mulberry tree , ‘ Be pulled up by the roots and be planted in the sea , ’ and it would obey you .
42017007	“ But who of you , having a servant ploughing or shepherding , would say to him when he has come in from the field , ‘ Come immediately and sit down to eat’ ?
42017008	“ But would he not rather say to him , ‘ Prepare somewhat for my supper , and gird yourself and serve me while I eat and drink , and afterward you shall eat and drink’ ?
42017009	“ Would he thank that servant because he did what he was commanded ? I think not .
42017010	“ So also you , when you have done all that you were commanded , say , ‘ We are unworthy servants , we have done what was our duty to do . ’ ”
42017011	And it came to be , as He went to Yerushalayim , that He passed through the midst of Shomeron and Galil .
42017012	And as He was entering into a certain village , He was met by ten leprous men , who stood at a distance .
42017013	And they lifted up their voices , saying , “ יהושע , Master , have compassion on us ! ”
42017014	And having seen them , He said to them , “ Go , show yourselves to the priests . ” And it came to be , that as they were going , they were cleansed .
42017015	And one of them , when he saw that he was healed , returned , praising Elohim with a loud voice ,
42017016	and he fell down upon his face at His feet , giving thanks to Him . And he was a Shomeronite .
42017017	And יהושע answering , said , “ Were there not ten cleansed ? But where are the nine ?
42017018	“ Was no one found to return to give praise to Elohim , except this foreigner ? ”
42017019	And He said to him , “ Rise , go your way . Your belief has made you well . ”
42017020	And having been asked by the Pharisees when the reign of Elohim would come , He answered them and said , “ The reign of Elohim does not come with intent watching ,
42017021	nor shall they say , ‘ Look here ! ’ or ‘ Look there ! ’ For look , the reign of Elohim is in your midst ! ”
42017022	And He said to the taught ones , “ Days shall come when you shall long to see one of the days of the Son of Aḏam , but you shall not see it .
42017023	“ And they shall say to you , ‘ Look here ! ’ or ‘ Look there ! ’ Do not go after them , nor follow .
42017024	“ For as the lightning that flashes out of one part under heaven shines to the other part under heaven , so also the Son of Aḏam shall be in His day .
42017025	“ But first He has to suffer much and be rejected by this generation .
42017026	“ And as it came to be in the days of Noaḥ , so also shall it be in the days of the Son of Aḏam :
42017027	“ They were eating , they were drinking , they were marrying , they were given in marriage , until the day that Noaḥ went into the ark , and the flood came and destroyed them all .
42017028	“ And likewise , as it came to be in the days of Lot : They were eating , they were drinking , they were buying , they were selling , they were planting , they were building ,
42017029	but on the day Lot went out of Seḏom it rained fire and sulphur from heaven and destroyed all .
42017030	“ It shall be the same in the day the Son of Aḏam is revealed .
42017031	“ In that day , he who shall be on the house-top , and his goods in the house , let him not come down to take them away . And likewise the one who is in the field , let him not turn back .
42017032	“ Remember the wife of Lot .
42017033	“ Whoever seeks to save his life shall lose it , and whoever loses his life shall preserve it .
42017034	“ I say to you , in that night there shall be two in one bed , the one shall be taken and the other shall be left .
42017035	“ Two shall be grinding together , the one shall be taken and the other shall be left .
42017036	“ Two shall be in the field , the one shall be taken and the other shall be left . ”
42017037	And they answering , said to Him , “ Where , Master ? ” And He said to them , “ Where the body is , there also the eagles shall be gathered together . ”
42018001	And He spoke a parable to them , that they should always pray and not lose heart ,
42018002	saying , “ In a certain city there was a certain judge , not fearing Elohim nor regarding man .
42018003	“ And a widow was in that city , and she came to him , saying , ‘ Do right to me on my adversary . ’
42018004	“ And he would not for a while , but afterward he said within himself , ‘ Even if I do not fear Elohim nor regard man ,
42018005	yet because this widow troubles me I shall do right to her , lest by her continual coming she wears me out . ’ ”
42018006	And the Master said , “ Hear what the unrighteous judge said .
42018007	“ And shall Elohim not do right by all means to His own chosen ones who are crying out day and night to Him , and being patient over them ?
42018008	“ I say to you that He shall do right to them speedily . But when the Son of Aḏam comes , shall He find the belief on the earth ? ”
42018009	And He also spoke this parable to some who relied on themselves that they were righteous , and looking down on others :
42018010	“ Two men went up to the Set-apart Place to pray – the one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector .
42018011	“ The Pharisee stood and began to pray with himself this way , ‘ Elohim , I thank You that I am not like the rest of men , swindlers , unrighteous , adulterers , or even as this tax collector .
42018012	‘ I fast twice a week , I give tithes of all that I possess . ’
42018013	“ But the tax collector standing at a distance would not even raise his eyes to the heaven , but was beating his breast , saying , ‘ Elohim , show favour unto me , a sinner ! ’
42018014	“ I say to you , this man went down to his house declared right , rather than the other . For everyone who is exalting himself shall be humbled , and he who is humbling himself shall be exalted . ”
42018015	And they also brought infants to Him to touch them , but His taught ones seeing it , rebuked them .
42018016	But יהושע called them to Him and said , “ Let the little children come to Me , and do not forbid them , for of such is the reign of Elohim .
42018017	“ Truly , I say to you , whoever does not receive the reign of Elohim as a little child , shall certainly not enter into it . ”
42018018	And a certain ruler asked Him , saying , “ Good Teacher , what shall I do to inherit everlasting life ? ”
42018019	So יהושע said to him , “ Why do you call Me good ? No one is good except One – Elohim .
42018020	“ You know the commands , ‘ Do not commit adultery , ’ ‘ Do not murder , ’ ‘ Do not steal , ’ ‘ Do not bear false witness , ’ ‘ Respect your father and your mother . ’ ”
42018021	And he said , “ All these I have watched over from my youth . ”
42018022	And hearing this , יהושע said to him , “ Yet one you lack : Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor , and you shall have treasure in heaven . And come , follow Me . ”
42018023	But when he heard this , he became intensely sad , for he was extremely rich .
42018024	And when יהושע saw that he became intensely sad , He said , “ How hard it is for those who have riches to enter into the reign of Elohim !
42018025	“ For it is easier for a camel to enter through a needle’s eye than for a rich man to enter into the reign of Elohim . ”
42018026	And those who heard it said , “ And who is able to be saved ? ”
42018027	And He said , “ What is impossible with men is possible with Elohim . ”
42018028	And Kĕpha said , “ See , we have left all and followed You . ”
42018029	And He said to them , “ Truly , I say to you , there is no one who has left house or parents or brothers or wife or children , for the sake of the reign of Elohim ,
42018030	who shall not receive many times more in this present time , and in the age to come everlasting life . ”
42018031	And taking the twelve aside , He said to them , “ See , we are going up to Yerushalayim , and all that have been written by the prophets about the Son of Aḏam shall be accomplished .
42018032	“ For He shall be delivered up to the gentiles and shall be mocked and insulted and spat upon ,
42018033	and having flogged Him they shall kill Him . And on the third day He shall rise again . ”
42018034	But they understood none of this , and this word was hidden from them , and they did not know what was being said .
42018035	And it came to be , that as He was coming near Yeriḥo , that a certain blind man was sitting by the way begging .
42018036	And hearing a crowd passing by , he asked what it meant .
42018037	And they reported to him that יהושע of Natsareth was passing by .
42018038	And he cried out , saying , “ יהושע , Son of Dawiḏ , have compassion on me ! ”
42018039	And those going before were rebuking him that he should be silent , but he was crying out much more , “ Son of Dawiḏ , have compassion on me ! ”
42018040	And יהושע stopped and commanded him to be brought to Him . And when he had come near , He asked him ,
42018041	saying , “ What do you wish Me to do for you ? ” And he said , “ Master , to receive my sight . ”
42018042	And יהושע said to him , “ Receive your sight ! Your belief has saved you . ”
42018043	And immediately he received his sight , and was following Him , praising Elohim . And all the people , seeing it , gave praise to Elohim .
42019001	And having entered , He was passing through Yeriḥo .
42019002	And see , a man called Zakkai ! And he was a chief tax collector , and he was rich ,
42019003	and he was seeking to see who יהושע was , but was unable because of the crowd , for he was small in stature .
42019004	And having run ahead , he climbed up into a sycamore tree to see Him , because He was about to pass by .
42019005	And as יהושע came to the place , He looked up and saw him , and said to him , “ Zakkai , hurry and come down , for I have to stay at your house today . ”
42019006	And he hurried and came down , and received Him , rejoicing .
42019007	And seeing it , they all grumbled , saying , “ He has gone in to stay with a man who is a sinner . ”
42019008	But Zakkai stood up and said to the Master , “ Look , Master , I give half of my possessions to the poor . And if I have taken whatever from anyone by false accusation , I repay fourfold . ”
42019009	And יהושע said to him , “ Today deliverance has come to this house – since he also is a son of Aḇraham .
42019010	“ For the Son of Aḏam has come to seek and to save what was lost . ”
42019011	And as they were hearing this , He spoke another parable , because He was near Yerushalayim and they thought the reign of Elohim was about to be manifested straightaway .
42019012	He therefore said , “ A certain nobleman went to a distant country to receive for himself a reign and to return .
42019013	“ And calling ten of his servants , He gave them ten minas , and said to them , ‘ Trade until I come . ’
42019014	“ But his subjects were hating him , and sent a delegation after him , to say , ‘ We do not wish this one to reign over us . ’
42019015	“ And it came to be , when he came back , having received the reign , that he sent for these servants to whom he had given the silver , in order to know what each had gained by trading .
42019016	“ And the first came , saying , ‘ Master , your mina has earned ten minas . ’
42019017	“ And he said to him , ‘ Well done , good servant . Because you were trustworthy in a small matter , have authority over ten cities . ’
42019018	“ And the second came , saying , ‘ Master , your mina has earned five minas . ’
42019019	“ And he said to him also , ‘ And you – be over five cities . ’
42019020	“ And another came , saying , ‘ Master , here is your mina , which I kept laid up in a handkerchief .
42019021	‘ For I was afraid of you , because you are a hard man . You take up what you did not lay down , and reap what you did not sow . ’
42019022	“ And he said to him , ‘ Out of your own mouth I shall judge you , you wicked servant . You knew that I was a hard man , taking up what I did not lay down and reaping what I did not sow .
42019023	‘ Why did you not put the silver in the bank , that when I come I could have collected it with interest ? ’
42019024	“ Then he said to those who stood by , ‘ Take the mina from him , and give it to him who possesses ten minas . ’
42019025	“ But they said to him , ‘ Master , he already possesses ten minas . ’
42019026	‘ For I say to you , that to everyone who possesses shall be given ; and from him who does not possess , even what he possesses shall be taken away from him .
42019027	‘ But those enemies of mine who did not wish me to reign over them , bring them here and slay them before me . ’ ”
42019028	And having said this , He went on ahead , going up to Yerushalayim .
42019029	And it came to be , when He came near to Bĕyth Phag̅i and Bĕyth Anyah , at the mountain of Olives , that He sent two of His taught ones ,
42019030	saying , “ Go into the village opposite you , in which , as you enter , you shall find a colt tied , on which no one has ever sat . Loosen it and bring it here .
42019031	“ And if anyone asks you , ‘ Why do you loosen it ? ’ thus you shall say to him , ‘ Because the Master has need of it . ’ ”
42019032	And those who were sent went away and found it as He had said to them .
42019033	And as they were loosing the colt , the owners of it said to them , “ Why do you loosen the colt ? ”
42019034	And they said , “ The Master needs it . ”
42019035	So they brought it to יהושע . And throwing their garments on the colt , they set יהושע on it .
42019036	And as He went , they were spreading their garments on the way .
42019037	And as He was coming near , already at the descent of the Mount of Olives , the entire crowd of the taught ones began , to praise Elohim , rejoicing with a loud voice for all the miracles they had seen ,
42019038	saying , “ ‘ Blessed is the Sovereign who is coming in the Name of יהוה ! ’ Peace in heaven and esteem in the highest ! ”
42019039	And some of the Pharisees from the crowd , said to Him , “ Teacher , rebuke Your taught ones . ”
42019040	But He answering , said to them , “ I say to you that if these shall be silent , the stones would cry out . ”
42019041	And as He came near , He saw the city and wept over it ,
42019042	saying , “ If you only knew even today , the matters for your peace ! But now they are hidden from your eyes .
42019043	“ Because days shall come upon you when your enemies shall build a rampart around you , and surround you and press you on all sides ,
42019044	and dash you to the ground , and your children within you . And they shall not leave in you one stone upon another , because you did not know the time of your visitation . ”
42019045	And having entered into the Set-apart Place , He began to drive out those selling and buying in it ,
42019046	saying to them , “ It has been written , ‘ My House is a house of prayer , ’ but you have made it a ‘ den of robbers . ’ ”
42019047	And He was teaching daily in the Set-apart Place . But the chief priests , and the scribes , and the leaders of the people were seeking to destroy Him ,
42019048	but they did not find what they might do , for all the people were hanging upon Him , listening .
42020001	And it came to be , on one of those days , as He was teaching the people in the Set-apart Place and bringing the Good News , that the chief priests and the scribes , together with the elders , came up
42020002	and spoke to Him , saying , “ Say to us , by what authority are You doing these ? Or who is he who gave You this authority ? ”
42020003	And He answering , said to them , “ I shall ask you one question too , and answer Me :
42020004	“ The immersion of Yoḥanan – was it from heaven or from men ? ”
42020005	And they debated among themselves , saying , “ If we say , ‘ From heaven , ’ He shall say , ‘ Then why did you not believe him ? ’
42020006	“ But if we say , ‘ From men , ’ all the people shall stone us , for they are persuaded that Yoḥanan was a prophet . ”
42020007	And they answered that they did not know from where it was .
42020008	And יהושע said to them , “ Neither do I say to you by what authority I do these . ”
42020009	And He began to speak this parable to the people , “ A certain man planted a vineyard , and leased it to farmers , and went away for a long time .
42020010	“ And at harvest time he sent a servant to the farmers , to give him some of the fruit of the vineyard . But the farmers beat him and sent him away empty-handed .
42020011	“ And again he sent another servant . And they beat him too and maltreated him , and sent him away empty-handed .
42020012	“ And again he sent a third . And they wounded him too and cast him out .
42020013	“ And the owner of the vineyard said , ‘ What shall I do ? I shall send my son , the beloved . They might respect him when they see him . ’
42020014	“ But when the farmers saw him , they reasoned among themselves , saying , ‘ This is the heir . Come , let us kill him , so that the inheritance becomes ours . ’
42020015	“ And they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him . What , then , shall the owner of the vineyard do to them ?
42020016	“ He shall come and destroy those farmers and give the vineyard to others . ” And having heard , they said , “ Let it not be ! ”
42020017	But He looked at them and said , “ What then is this that has been written , ‘ The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief corner-stone’ ?
42020018	“ Everyone who falls on that stone shall be broken , but on whomever it falls , he shall be pulverised . ”
42020019	And the chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on Him in the same hour , but they feared the people , for they knew that He had spoken this parable against them .
42020020	And keeping a close watch on Him , they sent spies who pretended to be righteous , to catch Him in a word , in order to deliver Him to the rule and to the authority of the governor .
42020021	So they asked Him , saying , “ Teacher , we know that You say and teach rightly , and You are not partial to any , but teach the way of Elohim truly ,
42020022	“ Is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not ? ”
42020023	But perceiving their craftiness , He said to them , “ Why do you try Me ?
42020024	“ Show Me a silver piece . Whose likeness and inscription does it have ? ” And they answering , said , “ Caesar’s . ”
42020025	And He said to them , “ Then give to Caesar what is Caesar’s , and to Elohim what is Elohim’s . ”
42020026	And they were unable to catch Him in a saying in the presence of the people , and marvelling at His answer , they were silent .
42020027	And some of the Sadducees , who deny that there is a resurrection , came to Him and asked Him ,
42020028	saying , “ Teacher , Mosheh wrote to us that if a man’s brother dies , having a wife , and he dies childless , his brother should take his wife and raise up offspring for his brother .
42020029	“ Now , there were seven brothers , and the first took a wife , and died childless .
42020030	“ And the second took her as wife , and he died childless .
42020031	“ And the third took her , and in the same way the seven also . And they left no children , and died .
42020032	“ And last of all the woman died too .
42020033	“ At the resurrection , then , whose wife does she become ? For the seven had her as wife . ”
42020034	And יהושע answering , said to them , “ The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage ,
42020035	but those who are counted worthy of attaining that age , and the resurrection from the dead , neither marry , nor are they given in marriage ,
42020036	for neither is it possible for them to die any more , because they are like messengers and are sons of Elohim , being sons of the resurrection .
42020037	“ But that the dead are raised , even Mosheh showed at the bush when he called יהוה ‘ the Elohim of Aḇraham , and the Elohim of Yitsḥaq , and the Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ . ’
42020038	“ Now He is not the Elohim of the dead , but of the living , for all live to Him . ”
42020039	And some of the scribes answering , said , “ Teacher , You have spoken well . ”
42020040	And they were not bold enough to question Him any more .
42020041	And He said to them , “ How do they say that the Messiah is the Son of Dawiḏ ?
42020042	“ For Dawiḏ himself said in the Book of Psalms , ‘ יהוה said to my Master , “ sit at My right hand ,
42020043	until I make Your enemies a footstool of Your feet . ” ’
42020044	“ Dawiḏ then calls Him ‘ Master , ’ how is He then his Son ? ”
42020045	And in the hearing of all the people , He said to His taught ones ,
42020046	“ Beware of the scribes , who like to walk in long robes , and love greetings in the market-places , and the best seats in the congregations , and the best places at feasts ,
42020047	who devour widows’ houses , and for a show make long prayers . They shall receive greater judgment . ”
42021001	And looking up He saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury ,
42021002	and He saw a certain poor widow putting in two mites .
42021003	And He said , “ Truly I say to you that this poor widow has put in more than all .
42021004	“ For all these out of their excess have put in offerings for Elohim , but she out of her poverty has put in all that she had to live on . ”
42021005	And as some were speaking about the Set-apart Place , that it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts , He said ,
42021006	“ These that you see – the days are coming in which not one stone shall be left upon another that shall not be thrown down . ”
42021007	And they asked Him , saying , “ Teacher , but when shall this be ? And what is the sign when this is about to take place ? ”
42021008	And He said , “ See that you are not led astray , for many shall come in My Name , saying , ‘ I am , ’ and , ‘ The time is near . ’ Then do not go after them .
42021009	“ But when you hear of fightings and unrests , do not be alarmed , for these have to take place first , but the end is not immediately . ”
42021010	Then He said to them , “ Nation shall rise against nation , and reign against reign .
42021011	“ And there shall be great earthquakes in various places , and scarcities of food and deadly diseases . And there shall be horrors , and great signs from heaven .
42021012	“ But before all this , they shall lay their hands on you and persecute you , delivering you up to the congregations and prisons , and be brought before sovereigns and rulers for My Name’s sake .
42021013	“ And it shall turn out to you for a witness .
42021014	“ Therefore , resolve in your hearts not to premeditate on what to answer .
42021015	“ For I shall give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries shall not be able to refute or resist .
42021016	“ And you shall also be betrayed by parents and brothers and relatives and friends . And some of you shall be put to death .
42021017	“ And you shall be hated by all because of My Name .
42021018	“ But not a hair of your head shall be lost at all .
42021019	“ Possess your lives by your endurance !
42021020	“ And when you see Yerushalayim surrounded by armies , then know that its laying waste is near .
42021021	“ Then let those in Yehuḏah flee to the mountains , and let those who are in the midst of her go out , and let not those who are in the fields enter her .
42021022	“ Because these are days of vengeance , to fill all that have been written .
42021023	“ And woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing children in those days ! For there shall be great distress in the earth and wrath upon this people .
42021024	“ And they shall fall by the edge of the sword , and be led away captive into all nations . And Yerushalayim shall be trampled underfoot by the gentiles until the times of the gentiles are filled .
42021025	“ And there shall be signs in the sun , and moon , and stars , and on the earth anxiety of nations , in bewilderment at the roaring of the sea , and agitation ,
42021026	men fainting from fear and the expectation of what is coming on the earth , for the powers of the heavens shall be shaken .
42021027	“ And then they shall see the Son of Aḏam coming in a cloud with power and much esteem .
42021028	“ And when these matters begin to take place , look up and lift up your heads , because your redemption draws near . ”
42021029	And He spoke a parable to them , “ Look at the fig tree , and all the trees .
42021030	“ When they have already budded , observing it , you shall know for yourselves that summer is now near .
42021031	“ So you also , when you see these matters take place , know that the reign of Elohim is near .
42021032	“ Truly , I say to you , this generation shall by no means pass away till all shall have taken place .
42021033	“ The heaven and the earth shall pass away , but My words shall by no means pass away .
42021034	“ And take heed to yourselves , lest your hearts be weighed down by gluttony , and drunkenness , and worries of this life , and that day come on you suddenly .
42021035	“ For it shall come as a snare on all those dwelling on the face of all the earth .
42021036	“ Watch then at all times , and pray that you be counted worthy to escape all this about to take place , and to stand before the Son of Aḏam . ”
42021037	And He was teaching in the Set-apart Place by day , but at night He went out and stayed on the mountain of Olives ,
42021038	and early in the morning all the people came to Him in the Set-apart Place to hear Him .
42022001	And the Festival of Unleavened Bread drew near , which is called Passover .
42022002	And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to kill Him , for they feared the people .
42022003	And Satan entered into Yehuḏah , who was called man from Qerioth , who was numbered among the twelve .
42022004	And he went and spoke with the chief priests and captains , how he might deliver Him up to them .
42022005	And they were glad , and agreed to give him silver .
42022006	And he promised , and was seeking an occasion to deliver Him up to them , away from the crowd .
42022007	And the Day of Unleavened Bread came when the Passover had to be slaughtered .
42022008	And He sent Kĕpha and Yoḥanan , saying , “ Go and prepare the Passover for us to eat . ”
42022009	And they said to Him , “ Where do You wish us to prepare ? ”
42022010	And He said to them , “ See , as you enter into the city , a man shall meet you carrying a jar of water . Follow him into the house he enters .
42022011	“ And you shall say to the master of the house , ‘ The Teacher says to you , “ Where is the guest room where I might eat the Passover with My taught ones ? ” ’
42022012	“ And he shall show you a large , furnished upper room . Prepare it there . ”
42022013	And going they found it as He had said to them , and they prepared the Passover .
42022014	And when the hour had come , He sat down , and the twelve emissaries with Him .
42022015	And He said to them , “ With desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before My suffering ,
42022016	for I say to you , I shall certainly not eat of it again until it is filled in the reign of Elohim . ”
42022017	And taking the cup , giving thanks , He said , “ Take this and divide it among yourselves ,
42022018	for I say to you , I shall certainly not drink of the fruit of the vine until the reign of Elohim comes . ”
42022019	And taking bread , giving thanks , He broke it and gave it to them , saying , “ This is My body which is given for you , do this in remembrance of Me . ”
42022020	Likewise the cup also , after supper , saying , “ This cup is the renewed covenant in My blood which is shed for you .
42022021	“ But see , the hand of him delivering Me up is with Me on the table .
42022022	“ For indeed the Son of Aḏam goes as it has been decreed , but woe to that man by whom He is delivered up ! ”
42022023	And they began to ask among themselves , which of them it could be who was about to do this .
42022024	And there also took place a dispute among them , as to which of them seemed to be greater .
42022025	And He said to them , “ The sovereigns of the gentiles rule over them , and those who control them are called ‘ workers of good . ’
42022026	“ But not so with you , but let him who is greatest among you be as the youngest , and the leader as one who serves .
42022027	“ For who is greater , the one who sits at the table , or the one who serves ? Is it not the one who sits at the table ? But I am in your midst as the One who serves .
42022028	“ But you are those who have remained with Me in My trials .
42022029	“ And I covenant for you , as My Father covenanted for Me , a reign ,
42022030	to eat and drink at My table , in My reign , and to sit on thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Yisra’ĕl . ”
42022031	And the Master said , “ Shim‛on , Shim‛on ! See , Satan has asked for you to sift you as wheat .
42022032	“ But I have prayed for you , that your belief should not fail . And when you have turned , strengthen your brothers . ”
42022033	And he said to Him , “ Master , I am prepared to go with You , both to prison and to death . ”
42022034	And He said , “ I say to you , Kĕpha , the cock shall not crow at all today until you have denied three times that you know Me . ”
42022035	And He said to them , “ When I sent you without purse and bag and sandals , did you lack any ? ” And they said , “ None at all . ”
42022036	And He said to them , “ But now , let him who has a purse take it , likewise also a bag . And let him who has no sword sell his garment and buy one .
42022037	“ For I say to you that what has been written has yet to be accomplished in Me , ‘ And He was reckoned with lawless ones . ’ For that which refers to Me has an end too . ”
42022038	And they said , “ Master , look , here are two swords . ” But He said to them , “ That is enough ! ”
42022039	And coming out , He went to the Mount of Olives , according to usage , and His taught ones also followed Him .
42022040	And coming to the place , He said to them , “ Pray that you do not enter into trial . ”
42022041	And He withdrew from them about a stone’s throw , and falling on His knees He was praying ,
42022042	saying , “ Father , if it be Your counsel , remove this cup from Me . Yet not My desire , but let Yours be done . ”
42022043	And there appeared a messenger from heaven to Him , strengthening Him .
42022044	And being in agony , He was praying more earnestly . And His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground .
42022045	And rising up from prayer , and coming to His taught ones , He found them sleeping from grief .
42022046	And He said to them , “ Why do you sleep ? Rise and pray , lest you enter into trial . ”
42022047	And while He was still speaking , see : a crowd ! And he who was called Yehuḏah , one of the twelve , was going before them and came near to יהושע to kiss Him .
42022048	And יהושע said to him , “ Yehuḏah , do you deliver up the Son of Aḏam with a kiss ? ”
42022049	And those around Him , seeing what was about to take place , said to Him , “ Master , shall we strike with the sword ? ”
42022050	And one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear .
42022051	But יהושע answering , said , “ Allow it this far . ” And touching his ear He healed him .
42022052	And יהושע said to those who had come against Him , the chief priests and captains of the Set-apart Place and the elders , “ Have you come out as against a robber , with swords and clubs ?
42022053	“ While I was with you daily in the Set-apart Place , you did not lay hands on Me . But this is your hour and the authority of darkness . ”
42022054	And having seized Him , they led Him and brought Him to the house of the high priest . And Kĕpha was following at a distance .
42022055	And when they had lit a fire in the midst of the courtyard , and sat down together , Kĕpha sat among them .
42022056	And a certain servant girl , seeing him as he sat by the fire , looked intently at him and said , “ And this one was with Him . ”
42022057	But he denied Him , saying , “ Woman , I do not know Him . ”
42022058	And after a little while another saw him and said , “ You are one of them too . ” But Kĕpha said , “ Man , I am not ! ”
42022059	And about an hour later , another insisted , saying , “ Truly , this one was with Him too , for he is a Galilean too . ”
42022060	But Kĕpha said , “ Man , I do not know what you are saying ! ” And immediately , while he was still speaking , a cock crowed .
42022061	And the Master turned and looked at Kĕpha , and Kĕpha remembered the word of the Master , how He had said to him , “ Before a cock crows , you shall deny Me three times . ”
42022062	And Kĕpha went out and wept bitterly .
42022063	And the men who were holding יהושע were mocking Him , beating Him .
42022064	And having blindfolded Him , they were striking Him on the face and were asking Him , saying , “ Prophesy ! Who is it that struck You ? ”
42022065	And they said to Him much more , blaspheming .
42022066	And when it became day , the elders of the people , both chief priests and scribes , came together and they led Him into their council , saying ,
42022067	“ If You are the Messiah , say it to us . ” And He said to them , “ If I say to you , you would not believe it at all ,
42022068	and if I asked you , you would not answer Me at all .
42022069	“ From now on the Son of Aḏam shall sit on the right hand of the power of Elohim . ”
42022070	And they all said , “ Are You then the Son of Elohim ? ” And He said to them , “ You say that I am . ”
42022071	And they said , “ Why do we need further witness ? For we heard it ourselves from His mouth . ”
42023001	And the entire assembly of them , having risen up , led Him to Pilate ,
42023002	and began to accuse Him , saying , “ We found this one perverting the nation , and forbidding to pay taxes to Caesar , saying that He Himself is Messiah , a Sovereign . ”
42023003	And Pilate asked Him , saying , “ Are You the Sovereign of the Yehuḏim ? ” And answering him He said , “ You say it . ”
42023004	And Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowd , “ I find no guilt in this Man . ”
42023005	But they were insisting , saying , “ He stirs up the people , teaching through all Yehuḏah , beginning from Galil unto this place . ”
42023006	And when Pilate heard of Galil , he asked if the Man were a Galilean .
42023007	And when he learned that He was under the authority of Herodes , he sent Him to Herodes , who was also in Yerushalayim in those days .
42023008	And seeing יהושע , Herodes rejoiced greatly , for a long time he had wished to see Him , because he had heard much about Him , and was anticipating to see some miracle done by Him ,
42023009	and was questioning Him with many words , but He gave him no answer .
42023010	And the chief priests and the scribes stood , accusing Him intensely .
42023011	And Herodes , with his soldiers , made light of Him and mocked Him , dressing Him in a splendid robe , and sent Him back to Pilate .
42023012	And on that day Pilate and Herodes became friends with each other , for before that they had been at enmity with each other .
42023013	And Pilate , having called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people ,
42023014	said to them , “ You brought this Man to me , as one who turns away the people . And look , I have examined Him in your presence and have found no guilt in this Man regarding the charges which you make against Him ,
42023015	and neither did Herodes , for I sent you back to him . And look , He has done none at all deserving death .
42023016	“ Having disciplined Him , then , I shall release Him ” –
42023017	for he had to release one to them at the festival .
42023018	And they cried out , all together , saying , “ Away with this One , and release to us Barabba ”
42023019	( who had been thrown into prison for a certain uprising made in the city , and for murder ) .
42023020	Wishing to release יהושע , then , Pilate appealed to them again .
42023021	But they were calling out , saying , “ Impale ! Impale Him ! ”
42023022	And he said to them the third time , “ Why , what evil has He done ? I have found no reason for death in Him . Having disciplined Him then , I shall release Him . ”
42023023	But with loud voices they insisted , asking for Him to be impaled . And the voices of these men and of the chief priests were prevailing .
42023024	And Pilate pronounced sentence that what they asked should be done .
42023025	And he released the one they asked for , who for uprising and murder had been thrown into prison , but he handed יהושע over to their wishes .
42023026	And as they led Him away , they laid hold of a certain man , Shim‛on a Cyrenian , who was coming from the field , and they put the stake on him , to bear it behind יהושע .
42023027	And a great number of the people were following Him , and women who also were mourning and lamenting Him .
42023028	But יהושע , turning to them , said , “ Daughters of Yerushalayim , do not weep for Me , but weep for yourselves and for your children .
42023029	“ For look , days are coming in which they shall say , ‘ Blessed are the barren , and wombs that never bore , and the breasts which never nursed ! ’
42023030	“ Then they shall begin ‘ to say to the mountains , “ Fall on us ! ” and to the hills , “ Cover us ! ” ’
42023031	“ Because if they do this to the green tree , what is going to be done to the dry tree ? ”
42023032	And two others also , evil-doers , were led with Him to be put to death .
42023033	And when they had come to the place called Golgotha , they impaled Him there , and the evil-doers , one on the right and the other on the left .
42023034	And יהושע said , “ Father , forgive them , for they do not know what they do . ” And they divided His garments and cast lots .
42023035	And the people were standing , looking on , and the rulers also were sneering with them , saying , “ He saved others , let Him save Himself if He is the Messiah , the chosen of Elohim . ”
42023036	And the soldiers were mocking Him too , coming and offering Him sour wine ,
42023037	and saying , “ If You are the Sovereign of the Yehuḏim , save Yourself . ”
42023038	And there was also an inscription written over Him in letters of Greek , and Roman , and Heḇrew : THIS IS THE SOVEREIGN OF THE YEHUḎIM .
42023039	And one of the evil-doers who were hanged , was speaking evil of Him , saying , “ If You are the Messiah , save Yourself and us . ”
42023040	But the other , responding , rebuked him , saying , “ Do you not even fear Elohim , since you are under the same judgment ?
42023041	“ And we , indeed , rightly so , for we receive the due reward of our deeds , but this One has done no wrong . ”
42023042	And he said to יהושע , “ Master , remember me when You come into Your reign . ”
42023043	And יהושע said to him , “ Truly , I say to you today , you shall be with Me in Paradise . ”
42023044	And it was now about the sixth hour , and darkness came over all the land , until the ninth hour .
42023045	And the sun was darkened , and the veil of the Dwelling Place was torn in two .
42023046	And crying out with a loud voice , יהושע said , “ Father , into Your hands I commit My spirit . ” And having said this , He breathed His last .
42023047	And the captain , seeing what took place , praised Elohim , saying , “ Truly , this Man was righteous ! ”
42023048	And when all the crowds who had gathered to that sight saw what took place , they beat their breasts and went away .
42023049	And all those who knew Him , and the women who followed Him from Galil , stood at a distance , watching this .
42023050	And see , a man named Yosĕph , a council member , a good and righteous man –
42023051	he was not agreeing with their counsel and deed – from Ramathayim , a city of the Yehuḏim , who himself was also waiting for the reign of Elohim ,
42023052	he , going to Pilate , asked for the body of יהושע .
42023053	And taking it down , he wrapped it in linen , and laid it in a tomb hewn out of the rock , where no one was yet laid .
42023054	And it was Preparation day , and the Sabbath was approaching .
42023055	And the women who had come with Him from Galil followed after , and saw the tomb and how His body was laid .
42023056	And having returned , they prepared spices and perfumes . And they rested on the Sabbath according to the command .
42024001	And on the first day of the week , at early dawn , they came to the tomb , bringing the spices which they had prepared ,
42024002	and they found the stone rolled away from the tomb .
42024003	And having entered , they did not find the body of the Master יהושע .
42024004	And it came to be , as they were perplexed about this , that see , two men stood by them in glittering garments .
42024005	And becoming frightened and bowing their faces to the earth , these said to them , “ Why do you seek the living among the dead ?
42024006	“ He is not here , but has been raised up ! Remember how He spoke to you when He was still in Galil ,
42024007	saying , ‘ The Son of Aḏam has to be delivered into the hands of sinners , and be impaled , and the third day rise again . ’ ”
42024008	And they remembered His words .
42024009	And having returned from the tomb they reported all this to the eleven and to all the rest .
42024010	And it was Miryam from Mag̅dala , and Yoḥanah , and Miryam the mother of Ya‛aqoḇ , and the rest with them , who told this to the emissaries .
42024011	And their words appeared to them to be nonsense , and they did not believe them .
42024012	But Kĕpha arose and ran to the tomb . And stooping down , he saw the linen wrappings lying by themselves . And he went away home , marvelling at what took place .
42024013	And see , two of them were going that same day to a village called Amma’us , which was twelve kilometres from Yerushalayim .
42024014	And they were talking to each other of all this which had taken place .
42024015	And it came to be , as they were talking and reasoning , that יהושע Himself drew near and went with them .
42024016	But their eyes were restrained , so that they did not know Him .
42024017	And He said to them , “ What are these words you are exchanging with each other as you are walking – and you are sad ? ”
42024018	And the one whose name was Qleophas answering , said to Him , “ Are You the lone visitor in Yerushalayim who does not know what took place in it these days ? ”
42024019	And He said to them , “ What ? ” And they said to Him , “ Concerning יהושע of Natsareth , who was a Prophet mighty in deed and word before Elohim and all the people ,
42024020	and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to be condemned to death , and impaled Him .
42024021	“ We , however , were expecting that it was He who was going to redeem Yisra’ĕl . But besides all this , today is the third day since these matters took place .
42024022	“ But certain women of ours , who arrived at the tomb early , also astonished us ,
42024023	when they did not find His body , they came saying that they had also seen a vision of messengers who said He was alive .
42024024	“ And some of those with us went to the tomb and found it , as also the women had said , but they did not see Him . ”
42024025	And He said to them , “ O thoughtless ones , and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken !
42024026	“ Was it not necessary for the Messiah to suffer these and to enter into His esteem ? ”
42024027	And beginning at Mosheh and all the Prophets , He was explaining to them in all the Scriptures the matters concerning Himself .
42024028	And they approached the village where they were going , and He seemed to be going on .
42024029	But they urged Him strongly , saying , “ Stay with us , for it is toward evening , and the day has declined . ” And He went in to stay with them .
42024030	And it came to be , when He sat at the table with them , having taken the bread , He blessed , and having broken , He was giving it to them .
42024031	And their eyes were opened and they recognised Him . And He disappeared from their sight .
42024032	And they said to each other , “ Was not our heart burning within us as He was speaking to us on the way , and as He was opening the Scriptures to us ? ”
42024033	And rising up that same hour they returned to Yerushalayim , and found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together ,
42024034	saying , “ The Master was truly raised , and has appeared to Shim‛on ! ”
42024035	And they related what took place on the way , and how He was recognised by them in the breaking of the bread .
42024036	And as they were saying this , יהושע Himself stood in the midst of them , and said to them , “ Peace to you . ”
42024037	And being startled and frightened , they thought they had seen a spirit .
42024038	And He said to them , “ Why are you troubled ? And why do doubts arise in your hearts ?
42024039	“ See My hands and My feet , that it is I Myself . Handle Me and see , for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see I have . ”
42024040	And saying this , He showed them His hands and His feet .
42024041	And while they were still not believing for joy , and marvelling , He said to them , “ Have you any food here ? ”
42024042	And they gave Him a piece of a broiled fish and some honeycomb .
42024043	And taking it He ate in their presence .
42024044	And He said to them , “ These are the words which I spoke to you while I was still with you , that all have to be filled that were written in the Torah of Mosheh and the Prophets and the Psalms concerning Me . ”
42024045	Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures ,
42024046	and said to them , “ Thus it has been written , and so it was necessary for the Messiah to suffer and to rise again from the dead the third day ,
42024047	and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in His Name to all nations , beginning at Yerushalayim .
42024048	“ And you are witnesses of these matters .
42024049	“ And see , I am sending the Promise of My Father upon you , but you are to remain in the city of Yerushalayim until you are clothed with power from on high . ”
42024050	And He led them out as far as Bĕyth Anyah , and lifting up His hands He blessed them .
42024051	And it came to be , while He was blessing them , that He was parted from them and was taken up into the heaven .
42024052	And they , having bowed down to Him , returned to Yerushalayim with great joy ,
42024053	and were continually in the Set-apart Place praising and blessing Elohim . Amĕn .
43001001	In the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with Elohim , and the Word was Elohim .
43001002	He was in the beginning with Elohim .
43001003	All came to be through Him , and without Him not even one came to be that came to be .
43001004	In Him was life , and the life was the light of men .
43001005	And the light shines in the darkness , and the darkness has not overcome it .
43001006	There was a man sent from Elohim , whose name was Yoḥanan .
43001007	This one came for a witness , to bear witness of the Light , that all might believe through him .
43001008	He was not that Light , but that he might bear witness of that Light .
43001009	He was the true Light , which enlightens every man , coming into the world .
43001010	He was in the world , and the world came to be through Him , and the world did not know Him .
43001011	He came to His own , and His own did not receive Him .
43001012	But as many as received Him , to them He gave the authority to become children of Elohim , to those believing in His Name ,
43001013	who were born , not of blood nor of the desire of flesh nor of the desire of man , but of Elohim .
43001014	And the Word became flesh and pitched His tent among us , and we saw His esteem , esteem as of an only brought-forth of a father , complete in favour and truth .
43001015	Yoḥanan bore witness of Him and cried out , saying , “ This was He of whom I said , ‘ He who comes after me has become before me , because He was before me . ’ ”
43001016	And out of His completeness we all did receive , and favour upon favour ,
43001017	for the Torah was given through Mosheh – the favour and the truth came through יהושע Messiah .
43001018	No one has ever seen Elohim . The only brought-forth Son , who is in the bosom of the Father , He did declare .
43001019	Now this was the witness of Yoḥanan when the Yehuḏim sent from Yerushalayim priests and Lĕwites to ask him , “ Who are you ? ”
43001020	And he confessed , and did not deny , but confessed , “ I am not the Messiah . ”
43001021	And they asked him , “ What then , are you Ěliyahu ? ” So he said , “ I am not . ” “ Are you the Prophet ? ” And he answered , “ No . ”
43001022	Therefore they said to him , “ Who are you , so that we give an answer to those who sent us ? What do you say about yourself ? ”
43001023	He said , “ I am a voice of one crying in the wilderness , ‘ Make straight the way of יהוה , ’ as the prophet Yeshayahu said . ”
43001024	And those sent were of the Pharisees ,
43001025	and they asked him , saying , “ Why then do you immerse if you are not the Messiah , nor Ěliyahu , nor the Prophet ? ”
43001026	Yoḥanan answered them , saying , “ I immerse in water , but in your midst stands One whom you do not know ,
43001027	the One coming after me , who has become before me , whose sandal strap I am not worthy to loosen . ”
43001028	This took place in Bĕyth Anyah beyond the Yardĕn , where Yoḥanan was immersing .
43001029	On the next day Yoḥanan saw יהושע coming toward him , and said , “ See , the Lamb of Elohim who takes away the sin of the world !
43001030	“ This is He of whom I said , ‘ After me comes a Man who has become before me , for He was before me . ’
43001031	“ And I did not know Him , but that He might be revealed to Yisra’ĕl , therefore I came immersing in water . ”
43001032	And Yoḥanan bore witness , saying , “ I have seen the Spirit coming down from heaven like a dove and remain on Him .
43001033	“ And I did not know Him , but He who sent me to immerse in water said to me , ‘ Upon whom you see the Spirit coming down and remaining on Him , this is He who immerses in the Set-apart Spirit . ’
43001034	“ And I have seen and have witnessed that this is the Son of Elohim . ”
43001035	Again the following day , Yoḥanan was standing with two of his taught ones ,
43001036	and looking at יהושע walking , he said , “ See the Lamb of Elohim ! ”
43001037	And the two taught ones heard him speaking , and they followed יהושע .
43001038	And יהושע turning , and seeing them following , said to them , “ What do you seek ? ” And they said to Him , “ Rabbi ” ( which means Teacher ) , “ where are You staying ? ”
43001039	He said to them , “ Come and see . ” They went and saw where He was staying , and remained with Him that day . Now it was about the tenth hour .
43001040	Andri , the brother of Shim‛on Kĕpha , was one of the two who heard from Yoḥanan , and followed Him .
43001041	First he found his own brother Shim‛on , and said to him , “ We have found the Messiah ” ( which means the Anointed ) .
43001042	And he brought him to יהושע . And looking at him , יהושע said , “ You are Shim‛on the son of Yonah , you shall be called Kĕpha ” ( which means A Stone ) .
43001043	On the following day יהושע wished to go to Galil , and He found Philip and said to him , “ Follow Me . ”
43001044	And Philip was from Bĕyth Tsaiḏa , the city of Andri and Kĕpha .
43001045	Philip found Nethanĕ’l and said to him , “ We have found Him whom Mosheh wrote of in the Torah , and the prophets : יהושע of Natsareth – the son of Yosĕph . ”
43001046	And Nethanĕ’l said to him , “ Is it possible for any good matter to come out of Natsareth ? ” Philip said to him , “ Come and see . ”
43001047	יהושע saw Nethanĕ’l coming toward Him , and said of him , “ See , truly a Yisra’ĕlite , in whom is no deceit ! ”
43001048	Nethanĕ’l said to Him , “ From where do You know me ? ” יהושע answered and said to him , “ Before Philip called you , when you were under the fig tree , I saw you . ”
43001049	Nethanĕ’l answered and said to Him , “ Rabbi , You are the Son of Elohim ! You are the Sovereign of Yisra’ĕl ! ”
43001050	יהושע answered and said to him , “ Because I said to you , ‘ I saw you under the fig tree , ’ do you believe ? Greater than that you shall see . ”
43001051	And He said to him , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , from now on you shall see the heaven opened , and the messengers of Elohim ascending and descending upon the Son of Aḏam . ”
43002001	And on the third day there was a wedding in Qanah of Galil , and the mother of יהושע was there .
43002002	And both יהושע and His taught ones were invited to the wedding .
43002003	And when they were short of wine , the mother of יהושע said to Him , “ They have no wine . ”
43002004	יהושע said to her , “ Woman , what is that to Me and to you ? My hour has not yet come . ”
43002005	His mother said to the servants , “ Do whatever He says to you . ”
43002006	And there were six stone water-jugs standing there , according to the mode of cleansing of the Yehuḏim , each holding two or three measures .
43002007	יהושע said to them , “ Fill the water-jugs with water . ” And they filled them up to the brim .
43002008	And He said to them , “ Now draw out and take it to the master of the feast . ” So they took it .
43002009	But when the master of the feast had tasted the water that had become wine , and did not know where it came from – though the servants who had drawn the water knew – the master of the feast called the bridegroom ,
43002010	and said to him , “ Every man at the beginning sets out the good wine , and when they have drunk , then that which is poorer . You have kept the good wine until now . ”
43002011	This , the beginning of the signs , יהושע did in Qanah of Galil , and manifested His esteem . And His taught ones believed in Him .
43002012	After this He went down to Kephar Naḥum , He and His mother , and His brothers , and His taught ones . And there they stayed not many days .
43002013	And the Passover of the Yehuḏim was near , and יהושע went up to Yerushalayim .
43002014	And He found in the Set-apart Place those selling oxen and sheep and doves , and the moneychangers sitting .
43002015	And having made a whip of cords , He drove them all out of the Set-apart Place , with the sheep and the oxen , and poured out the moneychangers’ coins and overturned the tables .
43002016	And He said to those selling doves , “ Take these away ! Do not make the house of My Father a house of merchandise ! ”
43002017	And His taught ones remembered that it was written , “ The ardour for Your house has eaten Me up . ”
43002018	And the Yehuḏim answered and said to Him , “ What sign do You show to us , since You are doing these ? ”
43002019	יהושע answered and said to them , “ Destroy this Dwelling Place , and in three days I shall raise it . ”
43002020	Then the Yehuḏim said , “ It took forty-six years to build this Dwelling Place , and You are going to raise it in three days ? ”
43002021	But He spoke about the Dwelling Place of His body .
43002022	So , when He was raised from the dead , His taught ones remembered that He said this to them . And they believed the Scripture and the word which יהושע had said .
43002023	And when He was in Yerushalayim at the Passover , at the festival , many believed in His Name when they saw the signs which He was doing .
43002024	But יהושע was not entrusting Himself to them , because He knew all men ,
43002025	and had no need that anyone should witness of man , for He knew what was in man .
43003001	And there was a man of the Pharisees , Naḵdimon was his name , a ruler of the Yehuḏim .
43003002	This one came to יהושע by night and said to Him , “ Rabbi , we know that You are a teacher come from Elohim , for no one is able to do these signs You do if Elohim is not with him . ”
43003003	יהושע answered and said to him , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , unless one is born from above , he is unable to see the reign of Elohim . ”
43003004	Naḵdimon said to Him , “ How is a man able to be born when he is old ? Is he able to enter into his mother’s womb a second time and be born ? ”
43003005	יהושע answered , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , unless one is born of water and the Spirit , he is unable to enter into the reign of Elohim .
43003006	“ That which has been born of the flesh is flesh , and that which has been born of the Spirit is spirit .
43003007	“ Do not marvel that I said to you , ‘ You have to be born from above . ’
43003008	“ The Spirit breathes where it wishes , and you hear the sound of it , but do not know where it comes from and where it goes . So is everyone who has been born of the Spirit . ”
43003009	Naḵdimon answered and said to Him , “ How is it possible for this to take place ? ”
43003010	יהושע answered and said to him , “ Are you the teacher of Yisra’ĕl , and do not know this ?
43003011	“ Truly , truly , I say to you , We speak what We know and witness what We have seen , and you do not receive Our witness .
43003012	“ If you do not believe when I spoke to you about earthly matters , how are you going to believe when I speak to you about the heavenly matters ?
43003013	“ And no one has gone up into the heaven except He who came down from the heaven – the Son of Aḏam .
43003014	“ And as Mosheh lifted up the serpent in the wilderness , even so the Son of Aḏam has to be lifted up ,
43003015	so that whoever is believing in Him should not perish but possess everlasting life .
43003016	“ For Elohim so loved the world that He gave His only brought-forth Son , so that everyone who believes in Him should not perish but possess everlasting life .
43003017	“ For Elohim did not send His Son into the world to judge the world , but that the world through Him might be saved .
43003018	“ He who believes in Him is not judged , but he who does not believe is judged already , because he has not believed in the Name of the only brought-forth Son of Elohim .
43003019	“ And this is the judgment , that the light has come into the world , and men loved the darkness rather than the light , for their works were wicked .
43003020	“ For everyone who is practising evil matters hates the light and does not come to the light , lest his works should be exposed .
43003021	“ But the one doing the truth comes to the light , so that his works are clearly seen , that they have been wrought in Elohim . ”
43003022	After this , יהושע and His taught ones came into the land of Yehuḏah , and He remained there with them , and was immersing .
43003023	And Yoḥanan was also immersing in Ayin near Salim , because there was plenty of water there . And they were coming and were being immersed ,
43003024	for Yoḥanan had not yet been put into prison .
43003025	Then a dispute arose between some of Yoḥanan’s taught ones and the Yehuḏim about cleansing ,
43003026	and they came to Yoḥanan and said to him , “ Rabbi , He who was with you beyond the Yardĕn , to whom you have witnessed , see , He is immersing , and all are coming to Him ! ”
43003027	Yoḥanan answered and said , “ No man is able to receive any matter unless it is given to him from the heaven .
43003028	“ You yourselves are witnesses for me that I said , ‘ I am not the Messiah but I am sent ahead of Him . ’
43003029	“ He that has the bride is the bridegroom , but the friend of the bridegroom , who stands and hears him , rejoices greatly because of the voice of the bridegroom . So this joy of mine is complete .
43003030	“ It is right for Him to increase , but me to decrease .
43003031	“ He who comes from above is over all , he who is from the earth is of the earth and speaks of the earth . He who comes from the heaven is over all .
43003032	“ And what He has seen and heard , that He witnesses . And no one receives His witness .
43003033	“ He who receives His witness has set his seal that Elohim is true .
43003034	“ For He whom Elohim has sent speaks the Words of Elohim , for Elohim does not give the Spirit by measure .
43003035	“ The Father loves the Son , and has given all into His hand .
43003036	“ He who believes in the Son possesses everlasting life , but he who does not obey the Son shall not see life , but the wrath of Elohim remains on him . ”
43004001	So when the Master knew that the Pharisees had heard that יהושע made and immersed more taught ones than Yoḥanan –
43004002	although יהושע Himself did not immerse , but His taught ones –
43004003	He left Yehuḏah and went away again to Galil .
43004004	And He had to pass through Shomeron .
43004005	So He came to a city of Shomeron , called Sheḵem , near the piece of land Ya‛aqoḇ gave to his son Yosĕph .
43004006	And Ya‛aqoḇ’s fountain was there . So יהושע , being wearied from the journey , was sitting thus at the fountain . It was about the sixth hour .
43004007	A woman of Shomeron came to draw water . יהושע said to her , “ Give Me to drink . ”
43004008	For His taught ones had gone off into the city to buy food .
43004009	The woman of Shomeron therefore said to Him , “ How is it that You , being a Yehuḏite , ask a drink from me , a woman of Shomeron ? ” For Yehuḏim do not associate with Shomeronites .
43004010	יהושע answered and said to her , “ If you knew the gift of Elohim , and who it is who says to you , ‘ Give Me to drink , ’ you would have asked Him , and He would have given you living water . ”
43004011	The woman said to Him , “ Master , You have no vessel , and the well is deep . From where , then , do You have living water ?
43004012	“ Are You greater than our father Ya‛aqoḇ , who gave us the well , and drank from it himself , and his sons , and his cattle ? ”
43004013	יהושע answered and said to her , “ Everyone drinking of this water shall thirst again ,
43004014	but whoever drinks of the water I give him shall certainly never thirst . And the water that I give him shall become in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life . ”
43004015	The woman said to Him , “ Master , give me this water , so that I do not thirst , nor come here to draw . ”
43004016	יהושע said to her , “ Go , call your husband , and come here . ”
43004017	The woman answered and said , “ I have no husband . ” יהושע said to her , “ You have well said , ‘ I have no husband , ’
43004018	for you have had five husbands , and the one whom you now have is not your husband . What you have said is true . ”
43004019	The woman said to Him , “ Master , I see that You are a prophet .
43004020	“ Our fathers worshipped on this mountain , but you people say that in Yerushalayim is the place where one needs to worship . ”
43004021	יהושע said to her , “ Woman , believe Me , the hour is coming when you shall neither on this mountain , nor in Yerushalayim , worship the Father .
43004022	“ You worship what you do not know . We worship what we know , because the deliverance is of the Yehuḏim .
43004023	“ But the hour is coming , and now is , when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth , for the Father also does seek such to worship Him .
43004024	“ Elohim is Spirit , and those who worship Him need to worship in spirit and truth . ”
43004025	The woman said to Him , “ I know that Messiah is coming , the One who is called Anointed . When that One comes , He shall announce to us all . ”
43004026	יהושע said to her , “ I who am speaking to you am He . ”
43004027	And upon this His taught ones came , and they were marvelling that He was speaking with a woman , however , no one said , “ What do You seek ? ” or , “ Why do You speak with her ? ”
43004028	The woman then left her water-jug , and went away to the city , and said to the men ,
43004029	“ Come , see a Man who told me all that I have done . Is this not the Messiah ? ”
43004030	They went out of the city and were coming to Him .
43004031	But in the meantime His taught ones were asking Him , saying , “ Rabbi , eat . ”
43004032	And He said to them , “ I have food to eat of which you do not know . ”
43004033	Then the taught ones said to each other , “ Did anyone bring Him food to eat ? ”
43004034	יהושע said to them , “ My food is to do the desire of Him who sent Me , and to accomplish His work .
43004035	“ Do you not say , ‘ There are still four months , and the harvest comes’ ? See , I say to you , lift up your eyes and see the fields , for they are white for harvest – already !
43004036	“ He who is reaping receives a reward , and gathers fruit for everlasting life , so that both he who is sowing and he who is reaping rejoice together .
43004037	“ For in this the word is true , ‘ One sows and another reaps . ’
43004038	“ I sent you to reap that for which you have not laboured . Others have laboured , and you have entered into their labours . ”
43004039	And many of the Shomeronites of that city believed in Him because of the word of the woman who witnessed , “ He told me all that I have done . ”
43004040	Therefore when the Shomeronites came to Him , they were asking Him to stay with them , and He stayed there two days .
43004041	And many more believed because of His word .
43004042	And they said to the woman , “ We no longer believe because of what you said , for we ourselves have heard , and we know that this is truly the Messiah , the Saviour of the world . ”
43004043	And after the two days He left there and went to Galil .
43004044	For יהושע Himself witnessed that a prophet is without appreciation in his own country .
43004045	Therefore when He came to Galil , the Galileans received Him , having seen all that He had done in Yerushalayim at the festival , for they also went to the festival .
43004046	Then יהושע came again to Qanah of Galil where He had made the water wine . And there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Kephar Naḥum .
43004047	When he heard that יהושע had come from Yehuḏah into Galil , he went to Him and was asking Him to come down and heal his son , for he was about to die .
43004048	יהושע then said to him , “ If you people do not see signs and wonders , you do not believe at all . ”
43004049	The nobleman said to Him , “ Master , come down before my child dies ! ”
43004050	יהושע said to him , “ Go , your son lives . ” And the man believed the word that יהושע spoke to him , and went .
43004051	And while he was going down , his servants met him and reported , saying , “ Your son lives ! ”
43004052	He then asked from them the hour in which he became better , and they said to him , “ Yesterday at the seventh hour the inflammation left him . ”
43004053	Then the father knew that it was at the same hour in which יהושע said to him , “ Your son lives . ” And he himself believed , and all his household .
43004054	Again this was the second sign יהושע did , when He had come from Yehuḏah into Galil .
43005001	After this there was a festival of the Yehuḏim , and יהושע went up to Yerushalayim .
43005002	And in Yerushalayim at the Sheep Gate there is a pool , which is called in Heḇrew , Bĕyth Zatha , having five porches .
43005003	In these were lying a great number of those who were sick , blind , crippled , paralysed , waiting for the stirring of the water .
43005004	For a messenger was going down at a certain time into the pool and was stirring the water . Whoever stepped in first , then , after the stirring of the water , became well of whatever disease he had .
43005005	And a certain man was there who had a sickness thirty-eight years .
43005006	When יהושע saw him lying there , and knowing that he already had been a long time , He said to him , “ Do you wish to become well ? ”
43005007	The sick man answered Him , “ Master , I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred , but while I am coming , another steps down before me . ”
43005008	יהושע said to him , “ Rise , take up your bed and walk . ”
43005009	And immediately the man became well , and he took up his bed and was walking . Now it was Sabbath on that day .
43005010	The Yehuḏim therefore said to him who had been healed , “ It is the Sabbath , it is not right for you to take up the bed . ”
43005011	He answered them , “ He who made me well said to me , ‘ Take up your bed and walk . ’ ”
43005012	Therefore they asked him , “ Who is the Man who said to you , ‘ Take up your bed and walk’ ? ”
43005013	But the one who was healed did not know who it was , for יהושע had moved away , a crowd being in that place .
43005014	Afterward יהושע found him in the Set-apart Place , and said to him , “ See , you have been made well . Sin no more , so that no worse matter befalls you . ”
43005015	The man went away , and told the Yehuḏim that it was יהושע who made him well .
43005016	And because of this the Yehuḏim persecuted יהושע , and were seeking to kill Him , because He was doing these healings on the Sabbath .
43005017	But יהושע answered them , “ My Father works until now , and I work . ”
43005018	Because of this , then , the Yehuḏim were seeking all the more to kill Him , ‘ because not only was He breaking the Sabbath , but He also called Elohim His own Father , making Himself equal with Elohim . ’
43005019	Therefore יהושע responded and said to them , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , the Son is able to do none at all by Himself , but only that which He sees the Father doing , because whatever He does , the Son also likewise does .
43005020	“ For the Father loves the Son , and shows Him all that He Himself does . And greater works than these He is going to show Him , in order that you marvel .
43005021	“ For as the Father raises the dead and makes alive , even so the Son makes alive whom He wishes .
43005022	“ For the Father judges no one , but has given all the judgment to the Son ,
43005023	that all should value the Son even as they value the Father . He who does not value the Son does not value the Father who sent Him .
43005024	“ Truly , truly , I say to you , he who hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me possesses everlasting life , and does not come into judgment , but has passed from death into life .
43005025	“ Truly , truly , I say to you , the hour is coming , and now is , when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of Elohim . And those having heard shall live .
43005026	“ For as the Father possesses life in Himself , so He gave also to the Son to possess life in Himself ,
43005027	and He has given Him authority also to do judgment , because He is the Son of Aḏam .
43005028	“ Do not marvel at this , because the hour is coming in which all those in the tombs shall hear His voice ,
43005029	and shall come forth – those who have done good , to the resurrection of life , and those who have practised evil matters , to a resurrection of judgment .
43005030	“ Of Myself I am unable to do any matter . As I hear , I judge , and My judgment is righteous , because I do not seek My own desire , but the desire of the Father who sent Me .
43005031	“ If I bear witness of Myself , My witness is not true .
43005032	“ There is another who bears witness of Me , and I know that the witness which He witnesses of Me is true .
43005033	“ You have sent to Yoḥanan , and he bore witness to the truth .
43005034	“ But I do not receive witness from man , but I say this in order that you might be saved .
43005035	“ He was the burning and shining lamp , and for a while you wished to rejoice in his light .
43005036	“ But I have a greater witness than that of Yoḥanan , for the works that the Father gave Me to accomplish , the works that I do , bear witness of Me , that the Father has sent Me .
43005037	“ And the Father who sent Me , He bore witness of Me . You have neither heard His voice at any time , nor seen His form .
43005038	“ And you do not have His Word staying in you , because you do not believe Him whom He sent .
43005039	“ You search the Scriptures , because you think you possess everlasting life in them . And these are the ones that bear witness of Me .
43005040	“ But you do not desire to come to Me in order to possess life .
43005041	“ I do not receive esteem from men ,
43005042	but I know you , that you do not have the love of Elohim in you .
43005043	“ I have come in My Father’s Name and you do not receive Me , if another comes in his own name , him you would receive .
43005044	“ How are you able to believe , when you are receiving esteem from one another , and the esteem that is from the only Elohim you do not seek ?
43005045	“ Do not think that I shall accuse you to the Father . There is one who accuses you : Mosheh , in whom you have set your expectation .
43005046	“ For if you believed Mosheh , you would have believed Me , since he wrote about Me .
43005047	“ But if you do not believe his writings , how shall you believe My words ? ”
43006001	After this יהושע went away to the other side of the Sea of Galil , that is Lake Kinnereth .
43006002	And a large crowd was following Him , because they saw His signs which He did on those who were sick .
43006003	And יהושע went up on a mountain , and there He sat down with His taught ones .
43006004	And the Passover was near , the festival of the Yehuḏim .
43006005	Then יהושע , lifting up His eyes and seeing a large crowd coming toward Him , said to Philip , “ Where shall we buy bread for them to eat ? ”
43006006	And this He said , trying him , for He Himself knew what He would do .
43006007	Philip answered Him , “ Two hundred pieces of silver worth of bread is not sufficient for them , for every one of them to receive a little . ”
43006008	One of His taught ones , Andri , the brother of Shim‛on Kĕpha , said to Him ,
43006009	“ Here is a boy who has five barley loaves and two fishes , but what are these for so many ? ”
43006010	And יהושע said , “ Make the people sit down . ” Now there was much grass in the place , and the men , numbering about five thousand , sat down .
43006011	And יהושע took the loaves , and having given thanks He distributed them to the taught ones , and the taught ones to those sitting down . And the same with the fish , as much as they wished .
43006012	And when they were filled , He said to His taught ones , “ Gather the broken pieces that are left over , so that none gets wasted . ”
43006013	So they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces of the five barley loaves which were left over by those who had eaten .
43006014	Then the men , having seen the sign that יהושע did , said , “ This is truly the Prophet who is coming to the world . ”
43006015	Then יהושע , knowing that they were about to come and seize Him , that they might make Him sovereign , withdrew again to the mountain , alone by Himself .
43006016	And when evening came , His taught ones went down to the sea ,
43006017	and entering into the boat , they were going over the sea toward Kephar Naḥum . And it had already become dark , and יהושע had not yet come to them .
43006018	And the sea was rising because a great wind was blowing .
43006019	When they had rowed about five or six kilometres , they saw יהושע walking on the sea and coming near the boat , and they were afraid .
43006020	And He said to them , “ It is I , do not be afraid . ”
43006021	They wished therefore to take Him into the boat , and at once the boat was at the land where they were going .
43006022	On the next day , the crowd that was standing on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there except that one into which His taught ones had entered , and that יהושע had not entered the boat with His taught ones , but His taught ones went away alone –
43006023	but other boats came from Kinnereth , near the place where they ate bread after the Master had given thanks –
43006024	therefore when the crowd saw that יהושע was not there , nor His taught ones , they themselves also entered into the boats and came to Kephar Naḥum , seeking יהושע .
43006025	And having found Him on the other side of the sea , they asked Him , “ Rabbi , when did You come here ? ”
43006026	יהושע answered them and said , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , you seek Me , not because you saw signs , but because you ate of the loaves and were satisfied .
43006027	“ Do not labour for the food that is perishing , but for the food that is remaining to everlasting life , which the Son of Aḏam shall give you , for the Father , Elohim , has set His seal on Him . ”
43006028	So they said to Him , “ What should we do to work the works of Elohim ? ”
43006029	יהושע answered and said to them , “ This is the work of Elohim , that you believe in Him whom He sent . ”
43006030	So they said to Him , “ What sign then would You do , so that we see and believe You ? What would You do ?
43006031	“ Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness , as it has been written , ‘ He gave them bread out of the heaven to eat . ’ ”
43006032	Therefore יהושע said to them , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , Mosheh did not give you the bread out of the heaven , but My Father gives you the true bread out of the heaven .
43006033	“ For the bread of Elohim is He who comes down out of the heaven and gives life to the world . ”
43006034	So they said to Him , “ Master , give us this bread always . ”
43006035	And יהושע said to them , “ I am the bread of life . He who comes to Me shall not get hungry at all , and he who believes in Me shall not get thirsty at all .
43006036	“ But I said to you that you have seen Me , and still do not believe .
43006037	“ All that the Father gives Me shall come to Me , and the one who comes to Me I shall by no means cast out .
43006038	“ Because I have come down out of the heaven , not to do My own desire , but the desire of Him who sent Me .
43006039	“ This is the desire of the Father who sent Me , that all He has given Me I should not lose of it , but should raise it in the last day .
43006040	“ And this is the desire of Him who sent Me , that everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him should possess everlasting life . And I shall raise him up in the last day . ”
43006041	Therefore the Yehuḏim were grumbling against Him , because He said , “ I am the bread which came down out of the heaven . ”
43006042	And they said , “ Is not this יהושע , the son of Yosĕph , whose father and mother we know ? How is it then that He says , ‘ I have come down out of the heaven’ ? ”
43006043	Then יהושע answered and said to them , “ Do not grumble with one another .
43006044	“ No one is able to come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him . And I shall raise him up in the last day .
43006045	“ It has been written in the prophets , ‘ And they shall all be taught by יהוה . ’ Everyone , then , who has heard from the Father , and learned , comes to Me .
43006046	“ Not that anyone has seen the Father , except He who is from Elohim – He has seen the Father .
43006047	“ Truly , truly , I say to you , he who believes in Me possesses everlasting life .
43006048	“ I am the bread of life .
43006049	“ Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness and they died .
43006050	“ This is the bread which comes down out of the heaven , so that anyone might eat of it , and not die .
43006051	“ I am the living bread which came down out of the heaven . If anyone eats of this bread , he shall live forever . And indeed , the bread that I shall give is My flesh , which I shall give for the life of the world . ”
43006052	The Yehuḏim , therefore , were striving with one another , saying , “ How is this One able to give us His flesh to eat ? ”
43006053	יהושע therefore said to them , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Aḏam and drink His blood , you possess no life in yourselves .
43006054	“ He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood possesses everlasting life , and I shall raise him up in the last day .
43006055	“ For My flesh is truly food , and My blood is truly drink .
43006056	“ He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood stays in Me , and I in him .
43006057	“ As the living Father sent Me , and I live because of the Father , so he who feeds on Me shall live because of Me .
43006058	“ This is the bread which came down out of the heaven , not as your fathers ate the manna and died . He who eats this bread shall live forever . ”
43006059	He said this in a congregation , teaching in Kephar Naḥum .
43006060	Therefore many of His taught ones having heard , said , “ This word is hard , who is able to hear it ? ”
43006061	But יהושע knowing within Himself that His taught ones were grumbling about this , said to them , “ Does this make you stumble ?
43006062	“ What if you see the Son of Aḏam going up where He was before ?
43006063	“ It is the Spirit that gives life , the flesh does not profit at all . The words that I speak to you are Spirit and are life .
43006064	“ But there are some of you who do not believe . ” For יהושע knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe , and who would deliver Him up .
43006065	And He said , “ Because of this I have said to you that no one is able to come to Me unless it has been given to him by My Father . ”
43006066	From then on many of His taught ones withdrew and were not walking with Him any more .
43006067	יהושע therefore said to the twelve , “ Do you also wish to go away ? ”
43006068	Then Shim‛on Kĕpha answered Him , “ Master , to whom shall we go ? You possess words of everlasting life .
43006069	“ And we have believed , and we know that You are the Messiah , the Son of the living Elohim . ”
43006070	יהושע answered them , “ Have I not chosen you , the twelve , and one of you is a devil ? ”
43006071	He was now speaking of Yehuḏah from Qerioth , the son of Shim‛on , for he , one of the twelve , was about to deliver Him up .
43007001	And after this יהושע was walking in Galil , for He did not wish to walk in Yehuḏah , because the Yehuḏim were seeking to kill Him .
43007002	And the festival of the Yehuḏim was near , the Festival of Booths .
43007003	So His brothers said to Him , ‘ Get away from here and go into Yehuḏah , so that Your taught ones also see the works that You are doing .
43007004	“ For no one acts in secret while he himself seeks to be known openly . If You do these works , show Yourself to the world . ”
43007005	For even His brothers did not believe in Him .
43007006	יהושע therefore said to them , “ My time has not yet come , but your time is always ready .
43007007	“ It is impossible for the world to hate you , but it hates Me because I bear witness of it , that its works are wicked .
43007008	“ You go up to this festival . I am not yet going up to this festival , for My time has not yet been filled . ”
43007009	And having said this to them , He stayed in Galil .
43007010	But when His brothers had gone up to the festival , then He also went up , not openly , but as it were in secret .
43007011	The Yehuḏim , therefore , were seeking Him at the festival , and said , “ Where is He ? ”
43007012	And there was much grumbling about Him among the crowd . Some were saying , “ He is good , ” but others were saying , “ No , but He is leading the crowd astray . ”
43007013	However , no one spoke openly of Him for fear of the Yehuḏim .
43007014	And about the middle of the festival יהושע went up into the Set-apart Place , and He was teaching .
43007015	And the Yehuḏim were marvelling , saying , “ How does this Man know letters , not having learned ? ”
43007016	יהושע answered them and said , “ My teaching is not Mine , but His who sent Me .
43007017	“ If anyone desires to do His desire , he shall know concerning the teaching , whether it is from Elohim , or whether I speak from Myself .
43007018	“ He who speaks from himself is seeking his own esteem , but He who seeks the esteem of the One who sent Him is true , and no unrighteousness is in Him .
43007019	“ Did not Mosheh give you the Torah ? Yet not one of you does the Torah ! Why do you seek to kill Me ? ”
43007020	The crowd answered and said , “ You have a demon , who seeks to kill You ? ”
43007021	יהושע answered and said to them , “ I did one work , and you all marvel .
43007022	“ Because of this Mosheh has given you the circumcision – though it is not from Mosheh , but from the fathers – and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath .
43007023	“ If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath , so that the Torah of Mosheh should not be broken , are you wroth with Me because I made a man entirely well on the Sabbath ?
43007024	“ Do not judge according to appearance , but judge with righteous judgment . ”
43007025	Therefore some of them from Yerushalayim said , “ Is this not He whom they are seeking to kill ?
43007026	“ And see ! He speaks boldly , and they say none at all to Him . Could it be that the rulers truly know that this is truly the Messiah ?
43007027	“ But we know where this One is from . And when the Messiah comes , no one knows where He is from . ”
43007028	יהושע therefore cried out in the Set-apart Place , teaching and saying , “ You both know Me , and you know where I am from . And I have not come of Myself , but He who sent Me is true , whom you do not know .
43007029	“ But I know Him , because I am from Him , and He sent Me . ”
43007030	So they were seeking to seize Him , but no one laid a hand on Him , because His hour had not yet come .
43007031	And many of the crowd believed in Him , and said , “ When the Messiah comes , shall He do more signs than these which this One did ? ”
43007032	The Pharisees heard the crowd muttering these matters concerning Him , and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to seize Him .
43007033	Therefore יהושע said to them , “ Yet a little while I am with you , then I go to Him who sent Me .
43007034	“ You shall seek Me and you shall not find Me , and where I am you are unable to come . ”
43007035	The Yehuḏim , therefore , said to themselves , “ Where is He about to go that we shall not find Him ? Is He about to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks , and to teach the Greeks ?
43007036	“ What is this word which He said , ‘ You shall seek Me and you shall not find Me , and where I am you are unable to come’ ? ”
43007037	And on the last day , the great day of the festival , יהושע stood and cried out , saying , “ If anyone thirsts , let him come to Me , and let him who believes in Me drink .
43007038	“ As the Scripture said , out of His innermost shall flow rivers of living water . ”
43007039	And this He said concerning the Spirit , which those believing in Him were about to receive , for the Set-apart Spirit was not yet given , because יהושע was not yet esteemed .
43007040	Many from the crowd , when they heard the word , then said , “ This truly is the Prophet . ”
43007041	Others said , “ This is the Messiah , ” but others said , “ Does the Messiah then come out of Galil ?
43007042	“ Did not the Scripture say that the Messiah comes from the seed of Dawiḏ and from the village of Bĕyth Leḥem , where Dawiḏ was ? ”
43007043	So a division came about among the people because of Him .
43007044	And some of them wished to take Him , but no one laid hands on Him .
43007045	The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees . And they said to them , “ Why did you not bring Him ? ”
43007046	The officers answered , “ Never has any man spoken like this Man ! ”
43007047	The Pharisees , therefore , answered them , “ Have you also been led astray ?
43007048	“ Has anyone of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed in Him ?
43007049	“ But this crowd that does not know the Torah is accursed . ”
43007050	Naḵdimon – he who came to יהושע by night , being one of them – said to them ,
43007051	“ Does our Torah judge the man unless it hears first from him and knows what he is doing ? ”
43007052	They answered and said to him , “ Are you also from Galil ? Search and see that no prophet has arisen out of Galil . ”
43007053	And each one went to his own house .
43008001	And יהושע went to the Mount of Olives .
43008002	And at dawn He came again into the Set-apart Place , and all the people were coming to Him . And having sat down , He was teaching them .
43008003	And the scribes and Pharisees brought to Him a woman caught in adultery . And having set her in the midst ,
43008004	they said to Him , “ Teacher , this woman was caught in the act of adultery .
43008005	“ And in the Torah Mosheh commanded us that such should be stoned . What then do You say ? ”
43008006	And this they said , trying Him , so that they might accuse Him . But יהושע , bending down , wrote on the ground with the finger , as though He did not hear .
43008007	But as they kept on questioning Him , He straightened up and said to them , “ He who is without sin among you , let him be the first to throw a stone at her . ”
43008008	And bending down again , He wrote on the ground .
43008009	And when they heard it , being reproved by their conscience , went out one by one , beginning from the older ones until the last . And יהושע was left alone , and the woman standing in the middle .
43008010	And יהושע , straightening up and seeing no one but the woman , said to her , “ Woman , where are those accusers of yours ? Did no one condemn you ? ”
43008011	And she said , “ No one , Master . ” And יהושע said to her , “ Neither do I condemn you . Go and sin no more . ”
43008012	Therefore יהושע spoke to them again , saying , “ I am the light of the world . He who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness , but possess the light of life . ”
43008013	The Pharisees , therefore , said to Him , “ You bear witness about Yourself , Your witness is not true . ”
43008014	יהושע answered and said to them , “ Even if I witness concerning Myself , My witness is true , for I know where I came from and where I am going . But you do not know from where I come , or where I go .
43008015	“ You judge according to the flesh , I judge no one .
43008016	“ But even if I do judge , My judgment is true , because I am not alone in it , but I and the Father who sent Me .
43008017	“ And in your Torah also , it has been written that the witness of two men is true .
43008018	“ I am One who witnesses concerning Myself , and the Father who sent Me witnesses concerning Me . ”
43008019	Therefore they said to Him , “ Where is Your Father ? ” יהושע answered , “ You know neither Me nor My Father . If you knew Me , you would have known My Father also . ”
43008020	These words יהושע spoke in the treasury , teaching in the Set-apart Place . And no one laid hands on Him , because His hour had not yet come .
43008021	Therefore יהושע said to them again , “ I am going away , and you shall seek Me , and you shall die in your sin . Where I go you are unable to come . ”
43008022	Then the Yehuḏim said , “ Shall He kill Himself , because He says , ‘ Where I go you are unable to come’ ? ”
43008023	And He said to them , “ You are from below , I am from above . You are of this world , I am not of this world .
43008024	“ Therefore I said to you that you shall die in your sins . For if you do not believe that I am He , you shall die in your sins . ”
43008025	Then they said to Him , “ Who are You ? ” And יהושע said to them , “ Altogether that which I even say to you !
43008026	“ I have much to say and to judge concerning you . But He who sent Me is true , and what I heard from Him , these Words I speak to the world . ”
43008027	They did not know that He spoke to them of the Father .
43008028	So יהושע said to them , “ When you lift up the Son of Aḏam , then you shall know that I am He , and that I do none at all of Myself , but as My Father taught Me , these words I speak .
43008029	“ And He who sent Me is with Me . The Father has not left Me alone , for I always do what pleases Him . ”
43008030	As He was speaking these words , many believed in Him .
43008031	So יהושע said to those Yehuḏim who believed Him , “ If you stay in My Word , you are truly My taught ones ,
43008032	and you shall know the truth , and the truth shall make you free . ”
43008033	They answered Him , “ We are the seed of Aḇraham , and have been servants to no one at any time . How do you say , ‘ You shall become free’ ? ”
43008034	יהושע answered them , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , everyone doing sin is a servant of sin .
43008035	“ And the servant does not stay in the house forever – a son stays forever .
43008036	“ If , then , the Son makes you free , you shall be free indeed .
43008037	“ I know that you are the seed of Aḇraham , but you seek to kill Me , because My word has no place in you .
43008038	“ I speak what I have seen with My Father , and you do what you have heard from your father . ”
43008039	They answered and said to Him , “ Aḇraham is our father . ” יהושע said to them , “ If you were Aḇraham’s children , you would do the works of Aḇraham .
43008040	“ But now you seek to kill Me , a Man who has spoken to you the truth which I heard from Elohim . Aḇraham did not do this .
43008041	“ You do the works of your father . ” Then they said to Him , “ We were not born of whoring , we have one Father : Elohim . ”
43008042	יהושע said to them , “ If Elohim were your Father , you would love Me , for I came forth from Elohim , and am here . For I have not come of Myself , but He sent Me .
43008043	“ Why do you not know what I say ? Because you are unable to hear My Word .
43008044	“ You are of your father the devil , and the desires of your father you wish to do . He was a murderer from the beginning , and has not stood in the truth , because there is no truth in him . When he speaks the lie , he speaks of his own , for he is a liar and the father of it .
43008045	“ And because I speak the truth , you do not believe Me .
43008046	“ Who of you proves Me wrong concerning sin ? And if I speak the truth , why do you not believe Me ?
43008047	“ He who is of Elohim hears the Words of Elohim , therefore you do not hear because you are not of Elohim . ”
43008048	The Yehuḏim answered and said to Him , “ Do we not say well that You are a Shomeronite and have a demon ? ”
43008049	יהושע answered , “ I do not have a demon , but I value My Father , and you do not value Me .
43008050	“ And I do not seek My own esteem , there is One who is seeking and is judging .
43008051	“ Truly , truly , I say to you , if anyone guards My Word he shall never see death at all . ”
43008052	The Yehuḏim said to Him , “ Now we know that You have a demon ! Aḇraham died , and the prophets . And You say , ‘ If anyone guards My Word he shall never taste death at all . ’
43008053	“ Are You greater than our father Aḇraham , who died ? And the prophets died . Whom do You make Yourself ? ”
43008054	יהושע answered , “ If I esteem Myself , My esteem is none at all . It is My Father who esteems Me , of whom you say that He is your Elohim .
43008055	“ And you have not known Him , but I know Him . And if I say , ‘ I do not know Him , ’ I shall be like you , a liar . But I do know Him and I guard His Word .
43008056	“ Your father Aḇraham was glad that he should see My day , and he saw it and did rejoice . ”
43008057	The Yehuḏim , therefore , said to Him , “ You are not yet fifty years old , and have You seen Aḇraham ? ”
43008058	יהושע said to them , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , before Aḇraham came to be , I am . ”
43008059	Therefore they picked up stones to throw at Him , but יהושע was hidden and went out of the Set-apart Place , going through the midst of them , and so passed by .
43009001	And passing by , He saw a man , blind from birth .
43009002	And His taught ones asked Him , saying , “ Rabbi , who sinned , this man or his parents , that he should be born blind ? ”
43009003	יהושע answered , “ Neither this man nor his parents sinned , but that the works of Elohim might be made manifest in him .
43009004	“ It is necessary for Me to work the works of Him who sent Me while it is day – night is coming , when no one is able to work .
43009005	“ While I am in the world , I am the light of the world . ”
43009006	Having said this , He spat on the ground and made clay with the saliva , and applied the clay to the eyes of the blind man .
43009007	And He said to him , “ Go , wash in the pool of Shiloaḥ ” ( which means Sent ) . So he went and washed , and came seeing .
43009008	Therefore the neighbours and those who saw him before , that he was blind , said , “ Is not this he who was sitting and begging ? ”
43009009	Others said , “ This is he . ” Others said , “ He is like him . ” He said , “ I am . ”
43009010	So they said to him , “ How were your eyes opened ? ”
43009011	He answered and said , “ A Man called יהושע made clay and applied it to my eyes and said to me , ‘ Go to the pool of Shiloaḥ and wash . ’ And I went and washed , and I received sight . ”
43009012	And they said to him , “ Where is He ? ” He said , “ I do not know . ”
43009013	They brought to the Pharisees the one who was once blind .
43009014	Now it was a Sabbath when יהושע made the clay and opened his eyes .
43009015	Therefore the Pharisees also asked him again how he had received his sight . He said to them , “ He put clay on my eyes , and I washed , and I see . ”
43009016	Therefore some of the Pharisees said , “ This Man is not from Elohim , because He does not guard the Sabbath . ” Others said , “ How is a man who is a sinner able to do such miracles ? ” And there was a division among them .
43009017	So they said to the blind one again , “ What do you say about Him because He opened your eyes ? ” And he said , “ He is a prophet . ”
43009018	However , the Yehuḏim did not believe concerning him , that he had been blind and received his sight , till they called the parents of him who had received his sight .
43009019	And they asked them , saying , “ Is this your son , who you say was born blind ? How then does he now see ? ”
43009020	His parents answered them and said , “ We know that this is our son , and that he was born blind ,
43009021	but how he now sees we do not know , or who opened his eyes we do not know . He is of age , ask him , he shall speak concerning himself . ”
43009022	His parents said this because they were afraid of the Yehuḏim , for the Yehuḏim had already agreed that if anyone confessed that He was Messiah , he should be put out of the congregation .
43009023	Because of this his parents said , “ He is of age , ask him . ”
43009024	So for the second time they called the man who was blind , and said to him , “ Give esteem to Elohim , we know that this Man is a sinner . ”
43009025	Then he answered and said , “ Whether He is a sinner , I do not know . I only know that I was blind , now I see . ”
43009026	And they asked him once more , “ What did He do to you ? How did He open your eyes ? ”
43009027	He answered them , “ I have told you already , and you did not hear . Why do you wish to hear it again ? Do you wish to become His taught ones too ? ”
43009028	Then they abused him and said , “ You are His taught one , but we are taught ones of Mosheh .
43009029	“ We know that Elohim has spoken to Mosheh , but this One , we do not know where He is from . ”
43009030	The man answered and said to them , “ Why , this is a wonder ! You do not know where He is from , yet He opened my eyes !
43009031	“ And we know that Elohim does not hear sinners . But if anyone fears Elohim and does His desire , He hears him .
43009032	“ From of old it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of one who was born blind .
43009033	“ If this One were not from Elohim , He could have done none at all . ”
43009034	They answered and said to him , “ You were completely born in sins – and are you teaching us ? ” And they cast him out .
43009035	יהושע heard that they had cast him out , and when He had found him , He said to him , “ Do you believe in the Son of Elohim ? ”
43009036	He answered and said , “ Who is He , Master , that I might believe in Him ? ”
43009037	And יהושע said to him , “ You have both seen Him and He who speaks with you is He . ”
43009038	And he said , “ Master , I believe , ” and bowed before Him .
43009039	And יהושע said , “ For judgment I have come into this world , that those not seeing might see , and those seeing might become blind . ”
43009040	And those of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these words , and said to Him , “ Are we blind , too ? ”
43009041	יהושע said to them , “ If you were blind , you would have no sin , but now you say , ‘ We see , ’ therefore your sin remains .
43010001	“ Truly , truly , I say to you , he who does not enter through the door into the sheepfold , but climbs up by another way , that one is a thief and a robber .
43010002	“ But he who enters through the door is the shepherd of the sheep .
43010003	“ The doorkeeper opens for him , and the sheep hear his voice . And he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out .
43010004	“ And when he has brought out his own sheep , he goes before them . And the sheep follow him , because they know his voice .
43010005	“ And they shall by no means follow a stranger , but shall flee from him , because they do not know the voice of strangers . ”
43010006	יהושע used this figure of speech , but they did not know what He had been saying to them .
43010007	יהושע therefore said to them again , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , I am the door of the sheep .
43010008	“ All who came before Me are thieves and robbers , but the sheep did not hear them .
43010009	“ I am the door . Whoever enters through Me , he shall be saved , and shall go in and shall go out and find pasture .
43010010	“ The thief does not come except to steal , and to slaughter , and to destroy . I have come that they might possess life , and that they might possess it beyond measure .
43010011	“ I am the good shepherd . The good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep .
43010012	“ But the hireling , and not being a shepherd , one who does not own the sheep , sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees . And the wolf snatches the sheep and scatters them .
43010013	“ Now the hireling flees because he is a hireling and is not concerned about the sheep .
43010014	“ I am the good shepherd . And I know Mine , and Mine know Me ,
43010015	even as the Father knows Me , and I know the Father . And I lay down My life for the sheep .
43010016	“ And other sheep I have which are not of this fold – I have to bring them as well , and they shall hear My voice , and there shall be one flock , one shepherd .
43010017	“ Because of this the Father loves Me , because I lay down My life , in order to receive it again .
43010018	“ No one takes it from Me , but I lay it down of Myself . I have authority to lay it down , and I have authority to receive it again . This command I have received from My Father . ”
43010019	Again there came a division among the Yehuḏim because of these words ,
43010020	and many of them said , “ He has a demon and is mad , why do you listen to Him ? ”
43010021	Others said , “ These are not the words of one possessed by a demon . Is a demon able to open the eyes of the blind ? ”
43010022	At that time the Ḥanukkah came to be in Yerushalayim , and it was winter .
43010023	And יהושע was walking in the Set-apart Place , in the porch of Shelomoh .
43010024	So the Yehuḏim surrounded Him and said to Him , “ How long do You keep us in suspense ? If You are the Messiah , say to us plainly . ”
43010025	יהושע answered them , “ I have told you , and you do not believe . The works that I do in My Father’s Name , they bear witness concerning Me .
43010026	“ But you do not believe , because you are not of My sheep , as I said to you .
43010027	“ My sheep hear My voice , and I know them , and they follow Me .
43010028	“ And I give them everlasting life , and they shall by no means ever perish , and no one shall snatch them out of My hand .
43010029	“ My Father , who has given them to Me , is greater than all . And no one is able to snatch them out of My Father’s hand .
43010030	“ I and My Father are one . ”
43010031	Again the Yehuḏim picked up stones to stone Him .
43010032	יהושע answered them , “ Many good works I have shown you from My Father . Because of which of these works do you stone Me ? ”
43010033	The Yehuḏim answered Him , saying , “ We do not stone You for a good work , but for blasphemy , and because You , being a Man , make Yourself Elohim . ”
43010034	יהושע answered them , “ Is it not written in your own Torah , ‘ I said , “ You are elohim ” ’ ?
43010035	“ If He called them elohim , to whom the word of Elohim came – and it is impossible for the Scripture to be broken –
43010036	do you say of Him whom the Father set apart and sent into the world , ‘ You are blaspheming , ’ because I said , ‘ I am the Son of Elohim’ ?
43010037	“ If I do not do the works of My Father , do not believe Me ;
43010038	but if I do , though you do not believe Me , believe the works , so that you know and believe that the Father is in Me , and I in Him . ”
43010039	Therefore they were seeking again to seize Him , but He went forth out of their hand ,
43010040	and went once more to the other side of the Yardĕn to the place where Yoḥanan was immersing at first , and there He stayed .
43010041	And many came to Him and said , “ Yoḥanan indeed did no sign , yet all that Yoḥanan said about this Man was true . ”
43010042	And many believed in Him there .
43011001	And a certain one was sick , El‛azar from Bĕyth Anyah , the village of Miryam and her sister Martha .
43011002	( Now it was Miryam who anointed the Master with perfume and wiped His feet with her hair , whose brother El‛azar was sick ) .
43011003	Therefore the sisters sent to Him , saying , “ Master , see , he whom You love is sick . ”
43011004	But when יהושע heard , He said , “ This sickness is not unto death , but for the esteem of Elohim , so that the Son of Elohim might be esteemed by it . ”
43011005	Now יהושע loved Martha and her sister and El‛azar .
43011006	Therefore , when He heard that he was sick , then indeed He stayed at the place where He was , two more days .
43011007	Then after this He said to the taught ones , “ Let us go back to Yehuḏah . ”
43011008	The taught ones said to Him , “ Rabbi , the Yehuḏim were but now seeking to stone You , and are You going back there ? ”
43011009	יהושע answered , “ Are there not twelve hours in the day ? If anyone walks in the day , he does not stumble , because he sees the light of this world .
43011010	“ But if anyone walks in the night , he stumbles , because the light is not in him . ”
43011011	He said this , and after that He said to them , “ Our friend El‛azar has fallen asleep , but I am going there , to wake him up . ”
43011012	Therefore the taught ones said to Him , “ Master , if he has fallen asleep he shall recover . ”
43011013	But יהושע had spoken about his death , whereas they thought that He spoke of taking rest in sleep .
43011014	So then יהושע said to them plainly , “ El‛azar has died .
43011015	“ And for your sake I am glad I was not there , in order for you to believe . But let us go to him . ”
43011016	T’oma , who is called the Twin , then said to his fellow taught ones , “ Let us also go , so that we die with Him . ”
43011017	Therefore , when יהושע arrived , He found that he had already been four days in the tomb .
43011018	Now Bĕyth Anyah was near Yerushalayim , about three kilometres away .
43011019	And many of the Yehuḏim had come to Martha and Miryam , to comfort them concerning their brother .
43011020	Martha , then , when she heard that יהושע was coming , met Him , but Miryam was sitting in the house .
43011021	Martha , then , said to יהושע , “ Master , if You had been here , my brother would not have died .
43011022	“ But even now I know that whatever You might ask of Elohim , Elohim shall give You . ”
43011023	יהושע said to her , “ Your brother shall rise again . ”
43011024	Martha said to Him , “ I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day . ”
43011025	יהושע said to her , “ I am the resurrection and the life . He who believes in Me , though he dies , he shall live .
43011026	“ And everyone that is living and believing in Me shall never die at all . Do you believe this ? ”
43011027	She said to Him , “ Yea , Master , I believe that You are the Messiah , the Son of Elohim , who is coming into the world . ”
43011028	And having said this she went away and called her sister Miryam secretly , saying , “ The Teacher is here and calls you . ”
43011029	When she heard , she rose up quickly and came to Him .
43011030	And יהושע had not yet come into the village , but was in the place where Martha met Him .
43011031	Therefore the Yehuḏim who were with her in the house , and were comforting her , when they saw that Miryam rose up quickly and went out , followed her , saying , “ She is going to the tomb to weep there . ”
43011032	Miryam , therefore , when she came where יהושע was , and saw Him , she fell down at His feet , saying to Him , “ Master , if You had been here , my brother would not have died . ”
43011033	יהושע , therefore , when He saw her weeping , and the Yehuḏim who came with her weeping , He groaned in the spirit and was troubled ,
43011034	and said , “ Where have you laid him ? ” They said to Him , “ Master , come and see . ”
43011035	יהושע wept .
43011036	The Yehuḏim therefore said , “ See how He loved him ! ”
43011037	And some of them said , “ Was this One , who opened the eyes of the blind , not also able to prevent this one from dying ? ”
43011038	יהושע , therefore , again groaning in Himself , came to the tomb . Now it was a cave , and a stone lay against it .
43011039	יהושע said , “ Take away the stone . ” Martha , the sister of him who had died , said to Him , “ Master , already he smells , for it is four days . ”
43011040	יהושע said to her , “ Did I not say to you that if you believe , you shall see the esteem of Elohim ? ”
43011041	So they took away the stone where the dead man was laid . And יהושע lifted up His eyes and said , “ Father , I thank You that You have heard Me .
43011042	“ And I know that You always hear Me , but because of the crowd standing by I said this , in order that they believe that You sent Me . ”
43011043	And when He had said this , He cried with a loud voice , “ El‛azar , come out ! ”
43011044	And he who died came out bound feet and hands with wrappings , and his face was wrapped with a cloth . יהושע said to them , “ Loosen him , and let him go . ”
43011045	Therefore many of the Yehuḏim who had come to Miryam , and had seen what יהושע did , believed in Him .
43011046	But some of them went away to the Pharisees and told them what יהושע did .
43011047	So the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered a council and said , “ What shall we do ? Because this Man does many signs .
43011048	“ If we let Him alone like this , they all shall believe in Him , and the Romans shall come and take away from us both our place and nation . ”
43011049	And one of them , Qayapha , being high priest that year , said to them , “ You know naught ,
43011050	neither do you consider that it is better for us that one man die for the people than that the entire nation should perish . ”
43011051	But he did not say this from himself , but being high priest that year he prophesied that יהושע was about to die for the nation ,
43011052	and not for the nation only , but to gather together into one the children of Elohim who were scattered abroad .
43011053	So from that day on they plotted to kill Him .
43011054	יהושע therefore no longer went openly among the Yehuḏim , but went from there into the country near the wilderness , to a city called Ephrayim , and remained there with His taught ones .
43011055	Now the Passover of the Yehuḏim was near , and many went from the country up to Yerushalayim before the Passover , to set themselves apart .
43011056	And so they were seeking יהושע , and spoke among one another , standing in the Set-apart Place , “ What do you think ? Is He not coming to the festival at all ? ”
43011057	And both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a command , that if anyone knew where He was , he should disclose it , in order for them to seize Him .
43012001	Accordingly יהושע , six days before the Passover , came to Bĕyth Anyah , where El‛azar was , who had died , whom He raised from the dead .
43012002	So they made Him a supper there , and Martha served , while El‛azar was one of those who sat at the table with Him .
43012003	Then Miryam took a pound of costly perfume of nard , anointed the feet of יהושע , and wiped His feet with her hair . And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume .
43012004	Then one of His taught ones , Yehuḏah from Qerioth , son of Shim‛on , who was about to deliver Him up , said ,
43012005	“ Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred pieces of silver and given to the poor ? ”
43012006	And he said this , not because he was concerned about the poor , but because he was a thief , and had the bag , and he used to take what was put in it .
43012007	יהושע then said , “ Let her alone , she has kept this for the day of My burial .
43012008	“ For the poor you have with you always , but Me you do not have always . ”
43012009	Then a great crowd of the Yehuḏim learned that He was there . And they came , not on account of יהושע only , but also to see El‛azar , whom He had raised from the dead .
43012010	And the chief priests resolved to kill El‛azar as well ,
43012011	because on account of him many of the Yehuḏim went away and believed in יהושע .
43012012	On the next day a great crowd who had come to the festival , when they heard that יהושע was coming to Yerushalayim ,
43012013	took the branches of palm trees and went out to meet Him , and were crying out , “ Hoshia-na ! Blessed is He who is coming in the Name of יהוה , the Sovereign of Yisra’ĕl ! ”
43012014	And יהושע , having found a young donkey , sat on it , as it has been written :
43012015	“ Do not fear , daughter of Tsiyon , see , your Sovereign is coming , sitting on the colt of a donkey . ”
43012016	At first His taught ones did not understand this . But when יהושע was esteemed , then they remembered that this was written about Him and that they had done this to Him .
43012017	Therefore the crowd , who were with Him when He called El‛azar out of his tomb and raised him from the dead , were bearing witness .
43012018	On account of this the crowd also met Him , because they heard that He had done this sign .
43012019	The Pharisees then said among themselves , “ You see how you are getting nowhere at all . Look , the world has gone after Him ! ”
43012020	And there were certain Greeks among those coming up to worship at the festival .
43012021	These then came to Philip , who was from Bĕyth Tsaiḏa of Galil , and were asking him , saying , “ Master , we wish to see יהושע . ”
43012022	Philip came and told Andri , and in turn Andri and Philip told יהושע .
43012023	And יהושע answered them , saying , “ The hour has come for the Son of Aḏam to be esteemed .
43012024	“ Truly , truly , I say to you , unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies , it remains alone . But if it dies , it bears much fruit .
43012025	“ He who loves his life shall lose it , and he who hates his life in this world shall preserve it for everlasting life .
43012026	“ If anyone serves Me , let him follow Me . And where I am , there My servant also shall be . If anyone serves Me , the Father shall value him .
43012027	“ Now I Myself am troubled , and what shall I say ? ‘ Father , save Me from this hour’ ? But for this reason I came to this hour .
43012028	“ Father , esteem Your Name . ” Then a voice came from the heaven , “ I have both esteemed it and shall esteem it again . ”
43012029	So the crowd who stood by and heard it were saying there had been thunder . Others said , “ A messenger has spoken to Him . ”
43012030	יהושע answered and said , “ This voice did not come because of Me , but for your sake .
43012031	“ Now is the judgment of this world , now the ruler of this world shall be cast out .
43012032	“ And I , if I am lifted up from the earth , shall draw all men unto Myself . ”
43012033	This He said , signifying by what death He was about to die .
43012034	The crowd answered Him , “ We have heard out of the Torah that the Messiah remains forever . And how do You say , ‘ The Son of Aḏam has to be lifted up’ ? Who is this Son of Aḏam ? ”
43012035	יהושע , therefore , said to them , “ Yet a little while the light is with you . Walk while you have the light , lest darkness overtake you . And he who walks in darkness does not know where he is going .
43012036	“ While you have the light , believe in the light , so that you become sons of light . ” These words יהושע spoke , and went off and was hidden from them .
43012037	But though He had done so many signs before them , they did not believe in Him ,
43012038	that the word of Yeshayahu the prophet might be filled , which he spoke , “ יהוה , who has believed our report ? And to whom has the arm of יהוה been revealed ? ”
43012039	Because of this they were unable to believe , because again Yeshayahu said :
43012040	“ He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart , so that they should not see with their eyes and understand with their heart , and turn , and I should heal them . ”
43012041	Yeshayahu said this when he saw His esteem and spoke of Him .
43012042	Still , even among the rulers many did believe in Him , but because of the Pharisees they did not confess Him , lest they should be put out of the congregation ,
43012043	for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of Elohim .
43012044	Then יהושע cried out and said , “ He who believes in Me , believes not in Me but in Him who sent Me .
43012045	“ And he who sees Me sees Him who sent Me .
43012046	“ I have come as a light into the world , so that no one who believes in Me should stay in darkness .
43012047	“ And if anyone hears My Words but does not watch over them , I do not judge him . For I did not come to judge the world but to save the world .
43012048	“ He who rejects Me , and does not receive My Words , has one who judges him : the Word that I have spoken shall judge him in the last day .
43012049	“ Because I spoke not from Myself , but the Father who sent Me has given Me a command , what I should say and what I should speak .
43012050	“ And I know that His command is everlasting life . Therefore , whatever I speak , as the Father has said to Me , so I speak . ”
43013001	And before the Festival of the Passover , יהושע knowing that His hour had come that He should move out of this world unto the Father , having loved His own who were in the world , He loved them to the end .
43013002	And supper taking place , the devil having already put it into the heart of Yehuḏah from Qerioth , son of Shim‛on , to deliver Him up ,
43013003	יהושע , knowing that the Father had given all into His hands , and that He had come from Elohim and was going to Elohim ,
43013004	rose from supper and laid aside His garments , and having taken a towel , He girded Himself .
43013005	After that He put water into a basin and began to wash the feet of the taught ones , and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded .
43013006	And so He came to Shim‛on Kĕpha , and he said to Him , “ Master , do You wash my feet ? ”
43013007	יהושע answered and said to him , “ You do not know what I am doing now , but you shall know after this . ”
43013008	Kĕpha said to Him , “ By no means shall You wash my feet , ever ! ” יהושע answered him , “ If I do not wash you , you have no part with Me . ”
43013009	Shim‛on Kĕpha said to Him , “ Master , not my feet only , but also my hands and my head ! ”
43013010	יהושע said to him , “ He who has had a bath does not need to wash , except his feet , but is clean altogether . And you are clean , but not all of you . ”
43013011	For He knew who would deliver Him up , so He said , “ You are not all clean . ”
43013012	So when He had washed their feet and taken His garments , and sat down again , He said to them , “ Do you know what I have done to you ?
43013013	“ You call me Teacher and Master , and you say well , for I am .
43013014	“ Then if I , Master and Teacher , have washed your feet , you also ought to wash one another’s feet .
43013015	“ For I gave you an example , that you should do as I have done to you .
43013016	“ Truly , truly , I say to you , a servant is not greater than his master , nor is an emissary greater than he who sent him .
43013017	“ If you know these teachings , blessed are you if you do them .
43013018	“ I do not speak concerning all of you . I know whom I have chosen , but that the Scripture might be filled , ‘ He who eats bread with Me has lifted up his heel against Me . ’
43013019	“ Now I say to you , before it takes place , that when it does take place , you shall believe that I am .
43013020	“ Truly , truly , I say to you , he who receives whomever I send , receives Me . And he who receives Me , receives Him who sent Me . ”
43013021	When יהושע had said this He was troubled in spirit , and witnessed and said , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , one of you shall deliver Me up . ”
43013022	The taught ones looked at one another , doubting of whom He spoke .
43013023	And one of His taught ones , whom יהושע loved , was reclining on the bosom of יהושע .
43013024	Shim‛on Kĕpha then motioned to him to ask who it was of whom He spoke .
43013025	And leaning back on the breast of יהושע he said to Him , “ Master , who is it ? ”
43013026	יהושע answered , “ It is he to whom I shall give a piece of bread when I have dipped it . ” And having dipped the bread , He gave it to Yehuḏah from Qerioth , son of Shim‛on .
43013027	And after the piece of bread , Satan entered into him . יהושע , therefore , said to him , “ What you do , do quickly . ”
43013028	But no one at the table knew why He said this to him ,
43013029	for some were supposing , because Yehuḏah had the bag , that יהושע was saying to him , “ Buy what we need for the festival , ” or that he should give somewhat to the poor .
43013030	So , having received the piece of bread , he then went out straightaway , and it was night .
43013031	When , therefore , he went out , יהושע said , “ Now the Son of Aḏam has been esteemed , and Elohim has been esteemed in Him .
43013032	“ If Elohim has been esteemed in Him , Elohim shall also esteem Him in Himself , and straightaway esteem Him .
43013033	“ Little children , yet a little while I am with you . You shall seek Me , and as I said to the Yehuḏim , ‘ Where I am going , you are unable to come , ’ I now also say to you .
43013034	“ A renewed command I give to you , that you love one another , as I have loved you , that you also love one another .
43013035	“ By this shall all know that you are My taught ones , if you have love for one another . ”
43013036	Shim‛on Kĕpha said to Him , “ Master , where are You going ? ” יהושע answered him , “ Where I am going you are unable to follow Me now , but afterwards you shall follow Me . ”
43013037	Kĕpha said to Him , “ Master , why am I unable to follow You now ? I shall lay down my life for You . ”
43013038	יהושע answered him , “ Shall you lay down your life for Me ? Truly , truly , I say to you , the cock shall not crow at all until you have denied Me three times .
43014001	“ Let not your heart be troubled . Believe in Elohim , believe also in Me .
43014002	“ In My Father’s house are many staying places . And if not , I would have told you . I go to prepare a place for you .
43014003	“ And if I go and prepare a place for you , I shall come again and receive you to Myself , that where I am , you might be too .
43014004	“ And where I go you know , and the way you know . ”
43014005	T’oma said to Him , “ Master , we do not know where You are going , and how are we able to know the way ? ”
43014006	יהושע said to him , “ I am the Way , and the Truth , and the Life . No one comes to the Father except through Me .
43014007	“ If you had known Me , you would have known My Father too . From now on you know Him , and have seen . ”
43014008	Philip said to Him , “ Master , show us the Father , and it is enough for us . ”
43014009	יהושע said to him , “ Have I been with you so long , and you have not known Me , Philip ? He who has seen Me has seen the Father , and how do you say , ‘ Show us the Father’ ?
43014010	“ Do you not believe that I am in the Father , and the Father is in Me ? The words that I speak to you I do not speak from Myself . But the Father who stays in Me does His works .
43014011	“ Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me , otherwise believe Me because of the works themselves .
43014012	“ Truly , truly , I say to you , he who believes in Me , the works that I do he shall do also . And greater works than these he shall do , because I go to My Father .
43014013	“ And whatever you ask in My Name , that I shall do , in order that the Father might be esteemed in the Son .
43014014	“ If you ask whatever in My Name , I shall do it .
43014015	“ If you love Me , you shall guard My commands .
43014016	“ And I shall ask the Father , and He shall give you another Helper , to stay with you forever –
43014017	the Spirit of the Truth , whom the world is unable to receive , because it does not see Him or know Him . But you know Him , for He stays with you and shall be in you .
43014018	“ I shall not leave you orphans – I am coming to you .
43014019	“ Yet a little while , and the world no longer sees Me , but you shall see Me , because I live , and you shall live .
43014020	“ In that day you shall know that I am in My Father , and you in Me , and I in you .
43014021	“ He who possesses My commands and guards them , it is he who loves Me . And he who loves Me shall be loved by My Father , and I shall love him and manifest Myself to him . ”
43014022	Yehuḏah – not the one from Qerioth – said to Him , “ Master , what has come about that You are about to manifest Yourself to us , and not to the world ? ”
43014023	יהושע answered him , “ If anyone loves Me , he shall guard My Word . And My Father shall love him , and We shall come to him and make Our stay with him .
43014024	“ He who does not love Me does not guard My Words . And the Word which you hear is not Mine but of the Father Who sent Me .
43014025	“ These Words I have spoken to you while still with you .
43014026	“ But the Helper , the Set-apart Spirit , whom the Father shall send in My Name , He shall teach you all , and remind you of all that I said to you .
43014027	“ Peace I leave with you – My peace I give to you . I do not give to you as the world gives . Do not let your heart be troubled , neither let it be afraid .
43014028	“ You heard that I said to you , ‘ I am going away and I am coming to you . ’ If you did love Me , you would have rejoiced that I said , ‘ I am going to the Father , ’ for My Father is greater than I .
43014029	“ And now I have told you before it takes place , that when it does take place , you shall believe .
43014030	“ I shall no longer talk much with you , for the ruler of this world is coming , and he possesses none at all in Me ,
43014031	but , in order for the world to know that I love the Father , and that as the Father commanded Me , so I am doing . Rise up , let us go from here .
43015001	“ I am the true vine , and My Father is the gardener .
43015002	“ Every branch in Me that bears no fruit He takes away . And every branch that bears fruit He prunes , so that it bears more fruit .
43015003	“ You are already clean because of the Word which I have spoken to you .
43015004	“ Stay in Me , and I stay in you . As the branch is unable to bear fruit of itself , unless it stays in the vine , so neither you , unless you stay in Me .
43015005	“ I am the vine , you are the branches . He who stays in Me , and I in him , he bears much fruit . Because without Me you are able to do naught !
43015006	“ If anyone does not stay in Me , he is thrown away as a branch and dries up . And they gather them and throw them into the fire , and they are burned .
43015007	“ If you stay in Me , and My Words stay in you , you shall ask whatever you wish , and it shall be done for you .
43015008	“ In this My Father is esteemed , that you bear much fruit , and you shall be My taught ones .
43015009	“ As the Father has loved Me , I have also loved you . Stay in My love .
43015010	“ If you guard My commands , you shall stay in My love , even as I have guarded My Father’s commands and stay in His love .
43015011	“ These words I have spoken to you , so that My joy might be in you , and that your joy might be complete .
43015012	“ This is My command , that you love one another , as I have loved you .
43015013	“ No one has greater love than this : that one should lay down his life for his friends .
43015014	“ You are My friends if you do whatever I command you .
43015015	“ No longer do I call you servants , for a servant does not know what his master is doing . But I have called you friends , for all teachings which I heard from My Father I have made known to you .
43015016	“ You did not choose Me , but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit , and that your fruit should remain , so that whatever you ask the Father in My Name He might give you .
43015017	“ These words I command you , so that you love one another .
43015018	“ If the world hates you , you know that it hated Me before it hated you .
43015019	“ If you were of the world , the world would love its own . But because you are not of the world , but I chose you out of the world , for that reason the world hates you .
43015020	“ Remember the word that I said to you , ‘ A servant is not greater than his master . ’ If they persecuted Me , they shall persecute you too . If they have guarded My Word , they would guard yours too .
43015021	“ But all this they shall do to you because of My Name , because they do not know Him who sent Me .
43015022	“ If I had not come and spoken to them , they would have no sin , but now they have no excuse for their sin .
43015023	“ He who hates Me hates My Father as well .
43015024	“ If I did not do among them the works which no one else did , they would have no sin . But now they have both seen and have hated both Me and My Father ,
43015025	but . . . that the word might be filled which was written in their Torah , ‘ They hated Me without a cause . ’
43015026	“ And when the Helper comes , whom I shall send to you from the Father , the Spirit of the Truth , who comes from the Father , He shall bear witness of Me ,
43015027	but you also bear witness , because you have been with Me from the beginning .
43016001	“ These words I have spoken to you , so that you do not stumble .
43016002	“ They shall put you out of the congregations , but an hour is coming when everyone who kills you shall think he is rendering service to Elohim .
43016003	“ And this they shall do to you because they did not know the Father , nor Me .
43016004	“ But I have said these words to you , so that when the hour comes you remember that I told them to you . And these words I did not say to you at the beginning , for I was with you .
43016005	“ But now I go away to Him who sent Me , and not one of you asks Me , ‘ Where are You going ? ’
43016006	“ But because I have said these words to you , grief has filled your heart .
43016007	“ But I say the truth to you . It is better for you that I go away , for if I do not go away , the Helper shall not come to you at all , but if I go , I shall send Him to you .
43016008	“ And having come , He shall reprove the world concerning sin , and concerning righteousness , and concerning judgment –
43016009	concerning sin because they do not believe in Me ,
43016010	concerning righteousness because I go to My Father and you see Me no more ,
43016011	concerning judgment because the ruler of this world is judged .
43016012	“ I still have many words to say to you , but you are not able to bear them now .
43016013	“ But when He comes , the Spirit of the Truth , He shall guide you into all the truth . For He shall not speak from Himself , but whatever He hears He shall speak , and He shall announce to you what is to come .
43016014	“ He shall esteem Me , for He shall take of what is Mine and announce it to you .
43016015	“ All that the Father has is Mine . That is why I said that He takes from what is Mine and announces it to you .
43016016	“ A little while , and you do not see Me , and again a little while , and you shall see Me . ”
43016017	Therefore some of His taught ones said to one another , “ What is this that He says to us , ‘ A little while , and you do not see Me , and again a little while , and you shall see Me , ’ and , ‘ because I am going to the Father’ ? ”
43016018	So they said , “ What is this that He says , ‘ A little while’ ? We do not know what He is saying . ”
43016019	יהושע , therefore , knew that they were wishing to ask Him , and He said to them , “ Are you asking one another about what I said , ‘ A little while , and you do not see Me , and again a little while , and you shall see Me’ ?
43016020	“ Truly , truly , I say to you that you shall weep and lament , but the world shall rejoice . And you shall be grieved , but your grief shall become joy .
43016021	“ The woman has grief when she is in labour , because her hour has come , but as soon as she has given birth to the child , she no longer remembers the affliction , for joy that a man was born into the world .
43016022	“ And you , therefore , have grief now , but I shall see you again and your heart shall rejoice , and no one takes your joy away from you .
43016023	“ And in that day you shall ask Me none at all . Truly , truly , I say to you , whatever you ask the Father in My Name He shall give you .
43016024	“ Until now you have asked naught in My Name . Ask , and you shall receive , in order that your joy might be complete .
43016025	“ These words I have spoken to you in figures of speech , but an hour is coming when I shall no longer speak to you in figures of speech , but I shall declare the Father plainly to you .
43016026	“ In that day you shall ask in My Name , and I do not say to you that I shall pray the Father on your behalf ,
43016027	for the Father Himself does love you , because you have loved Me , and have believed that I came forth from Elohim .
43016028	“ I came forth from the Father and have come into the world . Again , I leave the world and go to the Father . ”
43016029	His taught ones said to Him , “ See , now You are speaking plainly , and not using figure of speech !
43016030	“ Now we know that You know all , and have no need that anyone should question You . By this we believe that You came forth from Elohim . ”
43016031	יהושע answered them , “ Do you now believe ?
43016032	“ See , an hour is coming , and has now come , that you are scattered , each to his own , and leave Me alone . Yet I am not alone , because the Father is with Me .
43016033	“ These words I have spoken to you , that in Me you might have peace . In the world you have pressure , but take courage , I have overcome the world . ”
43017001	יהושע said these words , and lifted up His eyes to the heaven , and said , “ Father , the hour has come . Esteem Your Son , so that Your Son also might esteem You ,
43017002	as You have given Him authority over all flesh , that He should give everlasting life to all whom You have given Him .
43017003	“ And this is everlasting life , that they should know You , the only true Elohim , and יהושע Messiah whom You have sent .
43017004	“ I have esteemed You on the earth , having accomplished the work You have given Me that I should do .
43017005	“ And now , esteem Me with Yourself , Father , with the esteem which I had with You before the world was .
43017006	“ I have revealed Your Name to the men whom You gave Me out of the world . They were Yours , and You gave them to Me , and they have guarded Your Word .
43017007	“ Now they have come to know that all You gave to Me , is from You .
43017008	“ Because the Words which You gave to Me , I have given to them . And they have received them , and have truly known that I came forth from You , and they believed that You sent Me .
43017009	“ I pray for them . I do not pray for the world but for those whom You have given Me , for they are Yours .
43017010	“ And all Mine are Yours , and Yours are Mine , and I have been esteemed in them .
43017011	“ And I am no more in the world , but these are in the world , and I come to You . Set-apart Father , guard them in Your Name which You have given Me , so that they might be one , as We are .
43017012	“ When I was with them in the world , I was guarding them in Your Name which You have given Me , and I watched over them , and not one of them perished except the son of destruction , that the Scripture might be filled .
43017013	“ And now I come to You . And I speak these words in the world , so that they have My joy completed in them .
43017014	“ I have given them Your Word , and the world hated them because they are not of the world , as I am not of the world .
43017015	“ I do not pray that You should take them out of the world , but that You keep them from the wicked one .
43017016	“ They are not of the world , as I am not of the world .
43017017	“ Set them apart in Your truth – Your Word is truth .
43017018	“ As You sent Me into the world , I also sent them into the world .
43017019	“ And for them I set Myself apart , so that they too might be set apart in truth .
43017020	“ And I do not pray for these alone , but also for those believing in Me through their word ,
43017021	so that they all might be one , as You , Father , are in Me , and I in You , so that they too might be one in Us , so that the world might believe that You have sent Me .
43017022	“ And the esteem which You gave Me I have given them , so that they might be one as We are one ,
43017023	“ I in them , and You in Me , so that they might be perfected into one , so that the world knows that You have sent Me , and have loved them as You have loved Me .
43017024	“ Father , I desire that those whom You have given Me , might be with Me where I am , so that they see My esteem which You have given Me , because You loved Me before the foundation of the world .
43017025	“ O righteous Father , indeed the world did not know You , but I knew You , and these knew that You sent Me .
43017026	“ And I have made Your Name known to them , and shall make it known , so that the love with which You loved Me might be in them , and I in them . ”
43018001	Having said these words , יהושע went out with His taught ones beyond the Qiḏron torrent , where there was a garden , into which He and His taught ones entered .
43018002	And Yehuḏah , who delivered Him up , also knew the place , because יהושע often met there with His taught ones .
43018003	Yehuḏah , then , having received the company of soldiers , and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees , came there with lanterns , and torches , and weapons .
43018004	יהושע , then , knowing all that would come upon Him , went forward and said to them , “ Whom do you seek ? ”
43018005	They answered Him , “ יהושע of Natsareth . ” יהושע said to them , “ I am . ” And Yehuḏah , who delivered Him up , was also standing with them .
43018006	When , therefore , He said to them , “ I am , ” they drew back and fell to the ground .
43018007	Once more He asked them , “ Whom do you seek ? ” And they said , “ יהושע of Natsareth . ”
43018008	יהושע answered , “ I said to you that I am . If , then , you seek Me , allow these to go , ”
43018009	in order that the word might be filled which He spoke , “ Of those whom You have given Me , I have lost none . ”
43018010	Then Shim‛on Kĕpha , having a sword , drew it and struck the high priest’s servant , and cut off his right ear . And the servant’s name was Meleḵ .
43018011	Then יהושע said to Kĕpha , “ Put your sword into the sheath . Shall I not drink the cup which My Father has given Me ? ”
43018012	Then the company of soldiers and the commander and the officers of the Yehuḏim seized יהושע and bound Him ,
43018013	and they led Him away to Ḥanan first , for he was the father-in-law of Qayapha who was high priest that year .
43018014	Now Qayapha was the one who gave counsel to the Yehuḏim that it was better that one man should die for the people .
43018015	And Shim‛on Kĕpha followed יהושע , with another taught one , and that taught one was known to the high priest , and went with יהושע into the courtyard of the high priest .
43018016	But Kĕpha was standing outside at the door . So the other taught one , who was known to the high priest , went out and spoke to her who kept the door , and brought Kĕpha in .
43018017	Then the servant girl who kept the door said to Kĕpha , “ Are you also one of this Man’s taught ones ? ” He said , “ I am not . ”
43018018	And the servants and officers who had made a fire of coals stood there , because it was cold , and they warmed themselves . And Kĕpha was standing with them and warming himself .
43018019	Then the high priest asked יהושע about His taught ones and His teaching .
43018020	יהושע answered him , “ I spoke openly to the world . I always taught in the congregation and in the Set-apart Place , where the Yehuḏim always meet , and I spoke no word in secret .
43018021	“ Why do you ask Me ? Ask those who have heard Me what I said to them . See , they know what I said . ”
43018022	And when He had said this , one of the officers who stood by slapped יהושע in the face , saying , “ Do You answer the high priest this way ? ”
43018023	יהושע answered him , “ If I have spoken evilly , bear witness of the evil , but if well , why do you strike Me ? ”
43018024	Then Ḥanan sent Him bound to the high priest , Qayapha .
43018025	And Shim‛on Kĕpha was standing and warming himself . Then they said to him , “ Are you also one of His taught ones ? ” He denied it and said , “ I am not ! ”
43018026	One of the servants of the high priest , a relative of the one whose ear Kĕpha cut off , said , “ Did I not see you in the garden with Him ? ”
43018027	Then Kĕpha again denied it , and immediately a cock crowed .
43018028	Then they led יהושע from Qayapha to the palace , and it was early . And they themselves did not go into the palace , lest they should be defiled , but that they might eat the Passover .
43018029	Pilate , therefore , came out to them and said , “ What accusation do you bring against this Man ? ”
43018030	They answered and said to him , “ If He were not an evil-doer , we would not have delivered Him up to you . ”
43018031	Then Pilate said to them , “ You take Him and judge Him according to your law . ” The Yehuḏim said to him , “ It is not right for us to put anyone to death , ”
43018032	in order that the word of יהושע might be filled which He spoke , signifying by what death He was about to die .
43018033	Then Pilate went back into the palace , and called יהושע , and said to Him , “ Are You the Sovereign of the Yehuḏim ? ”
43018034	יהושע answered him , “ Do you say this from yourself , or did others talk to you about Me ? ”
43018035	Pilate answered , “ Am I a Yehuḏite ? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered You to me . What did You do ? ”
43018036	יהושע answered , “ My reign is not of this world . If My reign were of this world , My servants would fight , so that I should not be delivered to the Yehuḏim . But now My reign is not from here . ”
43018037	Then Pilate said to Him , “ You are a sovereign , then ? ” יהושע answered , “ You say it , because I am a sovereign . For this I was born , and for this I have come into the world , that I should bear witness to the truth . Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice . ”
43018038	Pilate said to Him , “ What is truth ? ” And when he had said this , he went out again to the Yehuḏim , and said to them , “ I find no guilt in Him .
43018039	“ But you have a habit that I shall release someone to you at the Passover . Do you wish , then , that I release to you the Sovereign of the Yehuḏim ? ”
43018040	Then they all shouted again , saying , “ Not this One , but Barabba ! ” And Barabba was a robber .
43019001	Then , therefore , Pilate took יהושע and flogged Him .
43019002	And the soldiers plaited a crown of thorns and placed it on His head , and they put a purple robe on Him ,
43019003	and came to Him and said , “ Greetings , Sovereign of the Yehuḏim ! ” And they slapped Him in the face .
43019004	And Pilate went outside again , and said to them , “ See , I am bringing Him out to you , to let you know that I find no guilt in Him . ”
43019005	Then יהושע came outside , wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe . And Pilate said to them , “ See the Man ! ”
43019006	So when the chief priests and officers saw Him , they shouted , saying , “ Impale ! Impale ! ” Pilate said to them , “ You take Him and impale Him , for I find no guilt in Him . ”
43019007	The Yehuḏim answered him , “ We have a law , and according to our law He ought to die , for He has made Himself the Son of Elohim . ”
43019008	So when Pilate heard this word , he was more afraid ,
43019009	and went back into the palace , and asked יהושע , “ Where are You from ? ” But יהושע gave him no answer .
43019010	Then Pilate said to Him , “ Do You not speak to me ? Do You not know that I possess authority to impale You , and I possess authority to release You ? ”
43019011	יהושע answered , “ You would possess no authority against Me if it were not given you from above . Because of this , he who delivered Me to you has greater sin . ”
43019012	From then on Pilate was seeking to release Him , but the Yehuḏim shouted , saying , “ If you release this One , you are not Caesar’s friend . Everyone who makes himself a sovereign , does speak against Caesar . ”
43019013	Therefore , when Pilate heard these words , he brought יהושע out and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called Pavement , but in Heḇrew , Gabbatha .
43019014	And it was the Preparation Day of the Passover week , and about the sixth hour . And he said to the Yehuḏim , “ See your Sovereign ! ”
43019015	But they shouted , “ Away , away , impale Him ! ” Pilate said to them , “ Shall I impale your Sovereign ? ” The chief priests answered , “ We have no sovereign except Caesar ! ”
43019016	At that time , then , he delivered Him to them to be impaled . And they took יהושע and led Him away .
43019017	And bearing His stake , He went out to the so-called Place of a Skull , which is called in Heḇrew , Golgotha ,
43019018	where they impaled Him , and two others with Him , one on this side and one on that side , and יהושע in the middle .
43019019	And Pilate wrote a title too , and put it on the stake , and it was written : יהושע OF NATSARETH , THE SOVEREIGN OF THE YEHUḎIM .
43019020	Many of the Yehuḏim therefore read this title , for the place where יהושע was impaled was near the city , and it was written in Heḇrew , in Greek , in Roman .
43019021	So the chief priests of the Yehuḏim said to Pilate , “ Do not write , ‘ The Sovereign of the Yehuḏim , ’ but , ‘ He said , “ I am the Sovereign of the Yehuḏim . ” ’ ”
43019022	Pilate answered , “ What I have written , I have written . ”
43019023	Then the soldiers , when they had impaled יהושע , took His outer garments and made four parts , to each soldier a part , and the inner garment . But the inner garment was without seam , woven from the top in one piece .
43019024	So they said to each other , “ Let us not tear it , but cast lots for it – whose it shall be , ” in order that the Scripture might be filled which says , “ They divided My garments among them , and for My clothing they cast lots . ” The soldiers therefore indeed did this .
43019025	And by the stake of יהושע stood His mother , and His mother’s sister , Miryam the wife of Qlophah , and Miryam from Mag̅dala .
43019026	Then יהושע , seeing His mother and the taught one whom He loved standing by , He said to His mother , “ Woman , see your son ! ”
43019027	Then to the taught one He said , “ See , your mother ! ” And from that hour that taught one took her to his own home .
43019028	After this , יהושע , knowing that all had been accomplished , in order that the Scripture might be accomplished , said , “ I thirst ! ”
43019029	A bowl of sour wine stood there , and they filled a sponge with sour wine , put it on hyssop , and held it to His mouth .
43019030	So when יהושע took the sour wine He said , “ It has been accomplished ! ” And bowing His head , He gave up His spirit .
43019031	Therefore , since it was the Preparation Day , that the bodies should not remain on the stake on the Sabbath – for that Sabbath was a high one – the Yehuḏim asked Pilate to have their legs broken , and that they be taken away .
43019032	Therefore the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first , and of the other who was impaled with Him ,
43019033	but when they came to יהושע and saw that He was already dead , they did not break His legs .
43019034	But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear , and instantly blood and water came out .
43019035	And he who has seen has witnessed , and his witness is true . And he knows that he is speaking the truth , in order that you might believe .
43019036	For this took place in order for the Scripture to be filled : “ Not one of His bones shall be broken . ”
43019037	And again another Scripture says , “ They shall look on Him whom they pierced . ”
43019038	And after this , Yosĕph of Ramathayim , being a taught one of יהושע , but secretly , for fear of the Yehuḏim , asked Pilate that he might take the body of יהושע , and Pilate gave permission . Therefore he came and took the body of יהושע .
43019039	And Naḵdimon , who at first came to יהושע by night , also came , bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes , about a hundred pounds .
43019040	Then they took the body of יהושע , and bound it in linen wrappings with the spices , as was the habit of the Yehuḏim for burial .
43019041	And at the place where He was impaled there was a garden , and in the garden a fresh tomb in which no one had yet been laid .
43019042	There , then , because of the Preparation Day of the Yehuḏim , they laid יהושע , because the tomb was near .
43020001	And on the first day of the week Miryam from Mag̅dala came early to the tomb , while it was still dark , and saw that the stone had been removed from the tomb .
43020002	So she ran and came to Shim‛on Kĕpha , and to the other taught one whom יהושע loved , and said to them , “ They have taken the Master out of the tomb , and we do not know where they laid Him . ”
43020003	Then Kĕpha and the other taught one went out , and they were going to the tomb ,
43020004	and the two were running together , but the other taught one outran Kĕpha and came to the tomb first .
43020005	And stooping down he saw the linen wrappings lying , but he did not go in .
43020006	Then Shim‛on Kĕpha came , following him , and went into the tomb . And he saw the linen wrappings lying ,
43020007	and the cloth which had been on His head , not lying with the linen wrappings , but folded up in a place by itself .
43020008	So , then , the other taught one , who came to the tomb first , also went in . And he saw and believed .
43020009	For they did not yet know the Scripture , that He has to rise again from the dead .
43020010	Therefore the taught ones went away again , by themselves .
43020011	But Miryam was standing outside by the tomb weeping . Then as she wept , she stooped down to the tomb ,
43020012	and saw two messengers in white sitting , one at the head and the other at the feet , where the body of יהושע had been laid .
43020013	And they said to her , “ Woman , why do you weep ? ” She said to them , “ Because they took away my Master , and I do not know where they laid Him . ”
43020014	And having said this , she turned around and saw יהושע standing , but she did not know that it was יהושע .
43020015	יהושע said to her , “ Woman , why do you weep ? Whom do you seek ? ” Thinking He was the gardener , she said to Him , “ Master , if You have carried Him away , say to me where You put Him , and I shall take Him away . ”
43020016	יהושע said to her , “ Miryam ! ” She turned and said to Him , “ Rabboni ! ” ( which means Teacher ) .
43020017	יהושע said to her , “ Do not hold on to Me , for I have not yet ascended to My Father . But go to My brothers and say to them , ‘ I am ascending to My Father and your Father , and to My Elohim and your Elohim . ’ ”
43020018	Miryam from Mag̅dala came announcing to the taught ones that she had seen the Master , and that He had told her this .
43020019	When therefore it was evening on that day , the first day of the week , and when the doors were shut where the taught ones met , for fear of the Yehuḏim , יהושע came and stood in the midst , and said to them , “ Peace to you . ”
43020020	And having said this , He showed them His hands and His side . The taught ones therefore rejoiced when they saw the Master .
43020021	Then יהושע said to them again , “ Peace to you ! As the Father has sent Me , I also send you . ”
43020022	And having said this , He breathed on them , and said to them , “ Receive the Set-apart Spirit .
43020023	“ If you forgive the sins of any , they are forgiven them ; if you retain the sins of any , they have been retained . ”
43020024	But T’oma , called the Twin , one of the twelve , was not with them when יהושע came ,
43020025	so the other taught ones said to him , “ We have seen the Master . ” But he said to them , “ Unless I see in His hands the mark of the nails , and put my finger into the imprint of the nails , and put my hand into His side , I shall by no means believe . ”
43020026	And after eight days His taught ones were again inside , and T’oma with them . יהושע came , the doors having been shut , and He stood in the midst , and said , “ Peace to you ! ”
43020027	Then He said to T’oma , “ Bring your finger here , and see My hands . And bring your hand and put it into My side – and do not be unbelieving , but believing . ”
43020028	And T’oma answered and said to Him , “ My Master and my Elohim ! ”
43020029	יהושע said to him , “ T’oma , because you have seen Me , you have believed . Blessed are those who have not seen and have believed . ”
43020030	There were indeed many other signs that יהושע did in the presence of His taught ones , which are not written in this book ,
43020031	but these have been written so that you believe that יהושע is the Messiah , the Son of Elohim , and that , believing , you might possess life in His Name .
43021001	After this יהושע manifested Himself again to the taught ones at the Sea of Kinnereth , and He manifested this way :
43021002	Shim‛on Kĕpha , and T’oma called the Twin , and Nethanĕ’l of Qanah in Galil , the sons of Zaḇdai , and two others of His taught ones were together .
43021003	Shim‛on Kĕpha said to them , “ I am going to fish . ” They said to him , “ We are also coming with you . ” They went out and immediately entered into the boat . And that night they caught none at all .
43021004	But when it became early morning , יהושע stood on the beach . However , the taught ones did not know that it was יהושע .
43021005	Then יהושע said to them , “ Children , have you any food ? ” They answered Him , “ No . ”
43021006	And He said to them , “ Throw the net on the right side of the boat , and you shall find . ” So they threw , and they were no longer able to draw it in because of the large number of fish .
43021007	That taught one whom יהושע loved then said to Kĕpha , “ It is the Master ! ” Then Shim‛on Kĕpha , hearing that it was the Master , put on his outer garment – for he was stripped – and plunged into the sea .
43021008	And the other taught ones came in the little boat – for they were not far from land , but about two hundred cubits – dragging the net with fish .
43021009	So when they had come to land , they saw a fire of coals there , and fish laid on it , and bread .
43021010	יהושע said to them , “ Bring some of the fish which you have now caught . ”
43021011	Shim‛on Kĕpha went up and dragged the net to land , filled with one hundred and fifty-three big fishes . And though there were so many , the net was not broken .
43021012	יהושע said to them , “ Come , have breakfast . ” And not one of the taught ones had the courage to ask Him , “ Who are You ? , ” knowing that it was the Master .
43021013	יהושע came and took the bread and gave it to them , and the same with the fish .
43021014	This was now the third time יהושע was manifested to His taught ones after He was raised from the dead .
43021015	When , therefore , they had eaten breakfast , יהושע said to Shim‛on Kĕpha , “ Shim‛on , son of Yonah , do you love Me more than these ? ” He said to Him , “ Yea , Master , You know that I love You . ” He said to him , “ Feed My lambs . ”
43021016	He said to him again , the second time , “ Shim‛on , son of Yonah , do you love Me ? ” He said to Him , “ Yea , Master , You know that I love You . ” He said to him , “ Shepherd My sheep . ”
43021017	He said to him the third time , “ Shim‛on , son of Yonah , do you love Me ? ” Kĕpha was sad because He said to him the third time , “ Do you love Me ? ” And he said to Him , “ Master , You know all , You know that I love You . ” יהושע said to him , “ Feed My sheep .
43021018	“ Truly , truly , I say to you , when you were younger you girded yourself and walked where you wished , but when you are old you shall stretch out your hands , and another shall gird you and bring you where you do not wish . ”
43021019	Now this He said , signifying by what death he would esteem Elohim . And having said this , He said to him , “ Follow Me . ”
43021020	And Kĕpha , turning around , saw the taught one whom יהושע loved following , who also had leaned on His breast at the supper , and said , “ Master , who is the one who is delivering You up ? ”
43021021	Seeing him , Kĕpha said to יהושע , “ But Master , what about this one ? ”
43021022	יהושע said to him , “ If I wish him to remain till I come , what is that to you ? You follow Me . ”
43021023	Therefore this word went out among the brothers that this taught one would not die . However , יהושע did not say to him that he would not die , but , “ If I desire him to remain until I come , what is it to you ? ”
43021024	This is the taught one who bears witness about these matters , and wrote these matters . And we know that his witness is true .
43021025	Now there is much else that יהושע did . If every one of them were written down , I think that the world itself would not contain the written books . Amĕn .
44001001	The first account I made , O Theophilos , of all that יהושע began both to do and to teach ,
44001002	until the day when He was taken up , after giving instructions through the Set-apart Spirit to the emissaries whom He had chosen ,
44001003	to whom He also presented Himself alive after His suffering by many infallible proofs , being seen by them for forty days , speaking concerning the reign of Elohim .
44001004	And meeting with them , He commanded them not to leave Yerushalayim , but to wait for the Promise of the Father , “ which you have heard from Me –
44001005	because Yoḥanan truly immersed in water , but you shall be immersed in the Set-apart Spirit not many days from now . ”
44001006	So when they had come together , they asked Him , saying , “ Master , would You at this time restore the reign to Yisra’ĕl ? ”
44001007	And He said to them , “ It is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has put in His own authority .
44001008	“ But you shall receive power when the Set-apart Spirit has come upon you , and you shall be My witnesses in Yerushalayim , and in all Yehuḏah and Shomeron , and to the end of the earth . ”
44001009	And having said this , while they were looking on , He was taken up , and a cloud hid Him from their sight .
44001010	And as they were gazing into the heaven as He went up , see , two men stood by them dressed in white ,
44001011	who also said , “ Men of Galil , why do you stand looking up into the heaven ? This same יהושע , who was taken up from you into the heaven , shall come in the same way as you saw Him go into the heaven . ”
44001012	Then they went back to Yerushalayim from the Mount of Olives , which is near Yerushalayim , a Sabbath day’s journey .
44001013	And when they came in , they went up into the upper room where they were staying : both Kĕpha and Ya‛aqoḇ and Yoḥanan and Andri , Philip and T’oma , Bartholomi and Mattithyahu , Ya‛aqoḇ the son of Alphai and Shim‛on the Zealot , and Yehuḏah the son of Ya‛aqoḇ .
44001014	All these were continuing with one mind in prayer and supplication , with the women and Miryam the mother of יהושע , and with His brothers .
44001015	And in those days Kĕpha , standing up in the midst of the taught ones – and there was a gathering of about a hundred and twenty – said ,
44001016	“ Men and brothers , this Scripture had to be filled which the Set-apart Spirit spoke before by the mouth of Dawiḏ concerning Yehuḏah , who became a guide to those who seized יהושע ,
44001017	because he was numbered with us and did receive his share in this service . ”
44001018	( This one , therefore , purchased a field with the wages of unrighteousness , and falling forward , he burst open in the middle and all his intestines gushed out .
44001019	And it became known to all those dwelling in Yerushalayim , so that in their own language that field was called , Ḥaqal Dema , that is , Field of Blood ) .
44001020	“ For it has been written in the Book of Psalms , ‘ Let his dwelling lie waste , and let no one live in it , ’ and , ‘ Let another take his office . ’
44001021	“ It is therefore necessary that of the men who have been with us all the time that the Master יהושע went in and out among us ,
44001022	beginning from the immersion of Yoḥanan to that day when He was taken up from us , that one of these should become a witness with us of His resurrection . ”
44001023	And they put forward two : Yosĕph called Barsabba , who was also called Justus , and Mattithyahu .
44001024	And praying they said , “ You , יהוה , who know the hearts of all , show which one of these two You have chosen
44001025	to receive the share in this service and office of the emissary from which Yehuḏah by transgression fell , to go to his own place . ”
44001026	And they cast their lots , and the lot fell on Mattithyahu . And he was numbered with the eleven emissaries .
44002001	And when the Day of the Festival of Weeks had come , they were all with one mind in one place .
44002002	And suddenly there came a sound from the heaven , as of a rushing mighty wind , and it filled all the house where they were sitting .
44002003	And there appeared to them divided tongues , as of fire , and settled on each one of them .
44002004	And they were all filled with the Set-apart Spirit and began to speak with other tongues , as the Spirit gave them to speak .
44002005	Now in Yerushalayim there were dwelling Yehuḏim , dedicated men from every nation under the heaven .
44002006	And when this sound came to be , the crowd came together , and were confused , because everyone heard them speak in his own language .
44002007	And they were all amazed and marvelled , saying to each other , “ Look , are not all these who speak Galileans ?
44002008	“ And how do we hear , each one in our own language in which we were born ?
44002009	“ Parthians and Medes and Ěylamites , and those dwelling in Aram Naharayim , both Yehuḏah and Kappadokia , Pontos and Asia ,
44002010	both Phrygia and Pamphulia , Mitsrayim and the parts of Libya around Cyrene , visitors from Rome , both Yehuḏim and converts ,
44002011	“ Cretans and Araḇs , we hear them speaking in our own tongues the great deeds of Elohim . ”
44002012	And they were all amazed , and were puzzled , saying to each other , “ What does this mean ? ”
44002013	And others mocking said , “ They have been filled with sweet wine . ”
44002014	But Kĕpha , standing up with the eleven , lifted up his voice and said to them , “ Men of Yehuḏah and all those dwelling in Yerushalayim , let this be known to you , and listen closely to my words .
44002015	“ For these men are not drunk , as you imagine , since it is only the third hour of the day .
44002016	“ But this is what was spoken by the prophet Yo’ĕl :
44002017	‘ And it shall be in the last days , says Elohim , that I shall pour out of My Spirit on all flesh . And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy , and your young men shall see visions , and your old men shall dream dreams ,
44002018	and also on My male servants and on My female servants I shall pour out My Spirit in those days , and they shall prophesy .
44002019	‘ And I shall show wonders in the heaven above and signs in the earth beneath : blood and fire and vapour of smoke .
44002020	‘ The sun shall be turned into darkness , and the moon into blood , before the coming of the great and splendid day of יהוה .
44002021	‘ And it shall be that everyone who calls on the Name of יהוה shall be saved . ’
44002022	“ Men of Yisra’ĕl , hear these words : יהושע of Natsareth , a Man from Elohim , having been pointed out to you by mighty works , and wonders , and signs which Elohim did through Him in your midst , as you yourselves also know ,
44002023	this One , given up by the set purpose and foreknowledge of Elohim , you have impaled and put to death through the hands of lawless men –
44002024	“ Him Elohim raised up , having loosed the pangs of death , because it was impossible that He could be held in its grip .
44002025	“ For Dawiḏ says concerning Him , ‘ I saw יהוה before me continually , because He is at my right hand , in order that I should not be shaken .
44002026	‘ For this reason my heart rejoiced , and my tongue was glad , and now my flesh shall also rest in expectation ,
44002027	because You shall not leave my being in the grave , nor shall You give Your Kind One to see corruption .
44002028	‘ You have made known to me the ways of life , You shall fill me with joy in Your presence . ’
44002029	“ Men and brothers , let me speak boldly to you of the ancestor Dawiḏ , that he died and was buried , and his tomb is with us to this day .
44002030	“ Being a prophet , then , and knowing that Elohim had sworn with an oath to him : of the fruit of his loins , according to the flesh , to raise up the Messiah to sit on his throne ,
44002031	foreseeing this he spoke concerning the resurrection of the Messiah , that His being was neither left in the grave , nor did His flesh see corruption .
44002032	“ Elohim has raised up this יהושע , of which we are all witnesses .
44002033	“ Therefore , having been exalted to the right hand of Elohim , and having received from the Father the promise of the Set-apart Spirit , He poured out this which you now see and hear .
44002034	“ For Dawiḏ did not ascend into the heavens , but he himself said , ‘ יהוה said to my Master , “ Sit at My right hand ,
44002035	until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet . ” ’
44002036	“ Therefore let all the house of Yisra’ĕl know for certain that Elohim has made this יהושע , whom you impaled , both Master and Messiah . ”
44002037	And having heard this , they were pierced to the heart , and said to Kĕpha and the rest of the emissaries , “ Men , brothers , what shall we do ? ”
44002038	And Kĕpha said to them , “ Repent , and let each one of you be immersed in the Name of יהושע Messiah for the forgiveness of sins . And you shall receive the gift of the Set-apart Spirit .
44002039	“ For the promise is to you and to your children , and to all who are far off , as many as יהוה our Elohim shall call . ”
44002040	And with many other words he earnestly witnessed and urged them , saying , “ Be saved from this crooked generation . ”
44002041	Then those , indeed , who gladly received his word , were immersed . And on that day about three thousand beings were added to them .
44002042	And they were continuing steadfastly in the teaching of the emissaries , and in the fellowship , and in the breaking of bread , and in the prayers .
44002043	And fear came upon every being , and many wonders and signs were being done through the emissaries .
44002044	And all those who believed were together , and had all in common ,
44002045	and sold their possessions and property , and divided them among all , as anyone might have need .
44002046	And day by day , continuing with one mind in the Set-apart Place , and breaking bread from house to house , they ate their food with gladness and simplicity of heart ,
44002047	praising Elohim and having favour with all the people . And the Master added to the assembly those who were being saved , day by day .
44003001	And Kĕpha and Yoḥanan were going up to the Set-apart Place at the hour of prayer , the ninth hour .
44003002	And a certain man , lame from his birth , was carried , whom they laid daily at the gate of the Set-apart Place which is called Yaphah , to ask alms from those entering into the Set-apart Place ,
44003003	who , seeing Kĕpha and Yoḥanan about to go into the Set-apart Place , asked for alms .
44003004	And Kĕpha , with Yoḥanan , looking steadfastly at him , said , “ Look at us . ”
44003005	And he gave heed to them , expecting to receive whatever from them .
44003006	But Kĕpha said , “ I do not have silver and gold , but what I do possess , this I give you : In the Name of יהושע Messiah of Natsareth , rise up and walk . ”
44003007	And taking him by the right hand he lifted him up , and immediately his feet and ankle bones were made firm .
44003008	And leaping up , he stood and walked , and went in with them into the Set-apart Place , walking and leaping and praising Elohim .
44003009	And all the people saw him walking and praising Elohim .
44003010	And they recognised him , that it was he who sat begging alms at the Lovely Gate of the Set-apart Place . And they were filled with wonder and amazement at what befell him .
44003011	And as the lame man who was healed was clinging to Kĕpha and Yoḥanan , all the people ran together to them in the porch which is called Shelomoh’s , greatly amazed .
44003012	And seeing it , Kĕpha responded to the people , “ Men of Yisra’ĕl , why do you marvel at this ? Or why look so intently at us , as though by our own power or reverence we have made him walk ?
44003013	“ The Elohim of Aḇraham , and of Yitsḥaq , and of Ya‛aqoḇ , the Elohim of our fathers , esteemed His Servant יהושע , whom you delivered up and denied in the presence of Pilate , when he had decided to release Him .
44003014	“ But you denied the Set-apart and Righteous One , and asked that a man , a murderer , be granted you .
44003015	“ But you killed the Leader of life , whom Elohim raised from the dead , of which we are witnesses .
44003016	“ And by the belief in His Name , this one whom you see and know , His Name made strong , and the belief which comes through Him has given him this perfect healing before all of you .
44003017	“ And now , brothers , I know that you did it in ignorance , as your rulers did too .
44003018	“ But this is how Elohim has filled what He had announced beforehand through the mouth of all the prophets , that His Messiah was to suffer .
44003019	“ Repent therefore and turn back , for the blotting out of your sins , in order that times of refreshing might come from the presence of the Master ,
44003020	and that He sends יהושע Messiah , pre-appointed for you ,
44003021	whom heaven needs to receive until the times of restoration of all matters , of which Elohim spoke through the mouth of all His set-apart prophets since of old .
44003022	“ For Mosheh truly said to the fathers , ‘ יהוה your Elohim shall raise up for you a Prophet like me from your brothers . Him you shall hear according to all matters , whatever He says to you .
44003023	‘ And it shall be that every being who does not hear that Prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people . ’
44003024	“ And likewise , all the prophets who have spoken , from Shemu’ĕl and those following , have also announced these days .
44003025	“ You are sons of the prophets , and of the covenant which Elohim made with our fathers , saying to Aḇraham , ‘ And in your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed . ’
44003026	“ To you first , Elohim , having raised up His Servant יהושע , sent Him to bless you , in turning away each one of you from your wicked ways . ”
44004001	And as they were speaking to the people , the priests and the captain of the Set-apart Place , and the Sadducees , came upon them ,
44004002	being annoyed because they taught the people and announced the resurrection from the dead in יהושע .
44004003	And they arrested them , and put them in jail until the next day , for it was already evening .
44004004	But many of those who had heard the word believed , and the number of the men became about five thousand .
44004005	And it came to be , on the next day , that their rulers and elders and scribes assembled in Yerushalayim ,
44004006	as well as Ḥanan the high priest , and Qayapha , and Yoḥanan , and Alexander , and as many as were of high priestly descent .
44004007	And having placed them in the middle , they asked , “ By what power or in what Name did you do this ? ”
44004008	Then Kĕpha , filled with the Set-apart Spirit , said to them , “ Rulers of the people and elders of Yisra’ĕl :
44004009	“ If today we are called to account for a good deed towards a sick man , by whom he has been healed ,
44004010	let it be known to all of you , and to all the people of Yisra’ĕl , that in the Name of יהושע Messiah of Natsareth , whom you impaled , whom Elohim raised from the dead , by Him this one stands before you , healthy .
44004011	“ This is ‘ the stone which was rejected by you builders , which has become the chief cornerstone . ’
44004012	“ And there is no deliverance in anyone else , for there is no other Name under the heaven given among men by which we need to be saved . ”
44004013	And seeing the boldness of Kĕpha and Yoḥanan , and perceiving that they were unlearned and ordinary men , they marvelled . And they recognised that they had been with יהושע .
44004014	And seeing the man who had been healed standing with them , they could not contradict it .
44004015	But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council , they consulted with one another ,
44004016	saying , “ What shall we do to these men ? For , indeed , that an outstanding miracle has been done through them is apparent to all those dwelling in Yerushalayim , and we are unable to deny it .
44004017	“ But in order that it spreads no further among the people , let us strongly threaten them , to speak no more to anyone in this Name . ”
44004018	And they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor to teach in the Name of יהושע .
44004019	But Kĕpha and Yoḥanan answering them , said , “ Whether it is right in the sight of Elohim to listen to you more than to Elohim , you judge .
44004020	“ For it is impossible for us not to speak of what we saw and heard . ”
44004021	And having threatened them further , they released them , finding no way of punishing them , because of the people , because they were all praising Elohim for what had been done .
44004022	For the man was over forty years old on whom this miracle of healing had been done .
44004023	And having been released , they went to their own people and reported all that the chief priests and elders said to them .
44004024	And having heard that , they lifted up their voice to Elohim with one mind and said , “ יהוה , You are Elohim , who made the heaven and the earth and the sea , and all that is in them ,
44004025	who by the mouth of Your servant Dawiḏ have said , ‘ Why did the gentiles rage , and the people plot in vain ?
44004026	‘ The sovereigns of the earth stood up , and the rulers were gathered together against יהוה and against His Messiah . ’
44004027	“ For truly , in this city there were gathered together against Your set-apart Servant יהושע , whom You anointed , both Herodes and Pontius Pilate , with the gentiles and the people of Yisra’ĕl
44004028	to do whatever Your hand and Your purpose decided before to be done .
44004029	“ And now , יהוה , look on their threats , and give to Your servants all boldness to speak Your word ,
44004030	by stretching out Your hand for healing , and signs , and wonders to take place through the Name of Your set-apart Servant יהושע . ”
44004031	And when they had prayed , the place where they came together was shaken . And they were all filled with the Set-apart Spirit , and they spoke the word of Elohim with boldness .
44004032	And the group of those who believed were of one heart and one being . And no one claimed that any of his possessions was his own , but they had all in common .
44004033	And with great power the emissaries gave witness to the resurrection of the Master יהושע , and great favour was upon them all .
44004034	For there was not anyone needy among them , for all who were possessors of lands or houses sold them , and brought the prices of what was sold ,
44004035	and laid them at the feet of the emissaries , and they distributed to each as anyone had need .
44004036	And Yosĕph , who was also called Barnaḇah by the emissaries ( which means Son of Encouragement ) , a Lĕwite , a native of Cyprus ,
44004037	having land , sold it , and brought the proceeds and laid it at the feet of the emissaries .
44005001	But a certain man named Ḥananyah , with Shappirah his wife , sold a possession .
44005002	And he kept back from the price , his wife also being aware of it , and brought a certain part and laid it at the feet of the emissaries .
44005003	But Kĕpha said , “ Ḥananyah , why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Set-apart Spirit and keep back from the price of the land for yourself ?
44005004	“ While it remained , did it not remain your own ? And after it was sold , was it not in your authority ? Why have you conceived this deed in your heart ? You have not lied to men but to Elohim . ”
44005005	Then Ḥananyah , hearing these words , fell down and breathed his last . And great fear came upon all those who heard of this .
44005006	But the young men arose and wrapped him up , carried him out and buried him .
44005007	And it came to be , about three hours later , that his wife came in , not knowing what had taken place .
44005008	And Kĕpha responded to her , “ Say to me whether you sold the land for so much ? ” And she said , “ Yes , for so much . ”
44005009	So Kĕpha said to her , “ Why have you agreed to try the Spirit of יהוה ? Look , the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door , and they shall carry you out . ”
44005010	And immediately she fell down at his feet and breathed her last . And the young men came in and found her dead , and carrying her out , they buried her beside her husband .
44005011	And great fear came upon all the assembly and upon all who heard of this .
44005012	And through the hands of the emissaries many signs and wonders were done among the people . And they were all with one mind in Shelomoh’s Porch .
44005013	But of the rest no one had the courage to join them , however , the people made much of them .
44005014	And more believers were added to the Master , large numbers of both men and women ,
44005015	so that they brought the sick out into the streets and laid them on beds and couches , that at least the shadow of Kĕpha , passing by , might fall on some of them .
44005016	A large number also gathered from the surrounding cities to Yerushalayim , bringing sick ones and those who were troubled by unclean spirits , and they were all healed .
44005017	But the high priest rose up , and all those with him , which is the sect of the Sadducees , and they were filled with jealousy ,
44005018	and seized the emissaries and put them in the public jail .
44005019	But a messenger of יהוה opened the prison doors at night and brought them out , and said ,
44005020	“ Go and stand in the Set-apart Place and speak to the people all the words of this life . ”
44005021	Now when they heard , they went into the Set-apart Place early in the morning , and were teaching . But the high priest and those with him came and called the council together , with all the elders of the children of Yisra’ĕl , and sent to the prison for them to be brought .
44005022	But having come , the officers did not find them in the prison , and they went back and reported it ,
44005023	saying , “ We found the prison shut in all safety , and the watches standing outside before the doors . But having opened them , we found no one inside ! ”
44005024	And as the high priest and the captain of the Set-apart Place and the chief priests heard these words , they were puzzled and wondered what this might be .
44005025	But one came and reported to them , saying , “ Look , the men whom you put in prison are standing in the Set-apart Place and teaching the people ! ”
44005026	Then the captain went with the officers and brought them , not with force , for they feared the people , lest they should be stoned .
44005027	And having brought them , they set them before the council and the high priest asked them ,
44005028	saying , “ Did we not strictly command you not to teach in this Name ? And look , you have filled Yerushalayim with your teaching , and intend to bring the blood of this Man upon us ! ”
44005029	And Kĕpha and the other emissaries answering , said , “ We have to obey Elohim rather than men .
44005030	“ The Elohim of our fathers raised up יהושע whom you laid hands on , hanging Him on a timber .
44005031	“ Him , a Prince and a Saviour , Elohim has exalted to His right hand , to give repentance to Yisra’ĕl and forgiveness of sins .
44005032	“ And we are His witnesses to these matters , and so also is the Set-apart Spirit whom Elohim has given to those who obey Him . ”
44005033	And those hearing were cut to the heart , and took counsel to kill them .
44005034	But a certain one in the council stood up , a Pharisee named Gamli’ĕl , a teacher of the Torah , respected by all the people , and ordered them to put the emissaries outside for a little while ,
44005035	and said to them , “ Men of Yisra’ĕl , take heed to yourselves what you intend to do to these men .
44005036	“ For before these days Toḏah rose up , claiming to be somebody . A number of men , about four hundred , did join him . He was slain , and all who obeyed him were dispersed , and came to naught .
44005037	“ After him , Yehuḏah of Galil rose up in the days of the census , and drew away many people after him . He also perished , and all who obeyed him were scattered .
44005038	“ And now I say to you , stay away from these men and leave them alone , because if this plan or this work is of men , it shall be overthrown ,
44005039	but if it is of Elohim , you are unable to overthrow it , lest you even be found to fight against Elohim . ”
44005040	And they heeded his advice , and having called for the emissaries , beating them , they commanded that they should not speak in the Name of יהושע , and let them go .
44005041	Then indeed they went rejoicing from the presence of the council , because they were counted worthy to suffer shame for His Name .
44005042	And daily in the Set-apart Place , and in every house , they did not cease teaching and bringing the Good News : יהושע the Messiah !
44006001	And in those days , when the taught ones were increasing , there arose a grumbling against the Heḇrews by the Hellenists , because their widows were overlooked in the daily serving .
44006002	So the twelve summoned the group of the taught ones and said , “ It is not pleasing for us to leave the Word of Elohim and serve tables .
44006003	“ Therefore , brothers , seek out from among you seven men who are known to be filled with the Set-apart Spirit and wisdom , whom we shall appoint for this duty ,
44006004	but we shall give ourselves continually to prayer and to serving the Word . ”
44006005	And the word pleased the entire group . And they chose Stephanos , a man filled with belief and the Set-apart Spirit , and Philip , and Prochoros , and Nikanor , and Timon , and Parmenas , and Nikolaos , a convert from Antioch ,
44006006	whom they set before the emissaries . And when they had prayed , they laid hands on them .
44006007	And the Word of Elohim spread , and the number of the taught ones increased greatly in Yerushalayim , and a great many of the priests were obedient to the belief .
44006008	And Stephanos , filled with belief and power , did great wonders and signs among the people .
44006009	But some of those of the so-called Congregation of the Freedmen ( Cyrenians , Alexandrians , and those from Kilikia and Asia ) , rose up , disputing with Stephanos ,
44006010	but they were unable to resist the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke .
44006011	Then they instigated men to say , “ We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Mosheh and Elohim . ”
44006012	And they stirred up the people , and the elders , and the scribes , so they came upon him , seized him , and brought him to the council .
44006013	And they set up false witnesses who said , “ This man does not cease to speak blasphemous words against this set-apart place and the Torah ,
44006014	for we have heard him saying that this יהושע of Natsareth shall overthrow this place and change the institutes which Mosheh delivered unto us . ”
44006015	And all who sat in the council , looking steadily at him , saw his face was like the face of a heavenly messenger .
44007001	And the high priest said , “ Is this so ? ”
44007002	And he replied , “ Men , brothers and fathers , listen : The Elohim of esteem appeared to our father Aḇraham when he was in Aram Naharayim , before he dwelt in Ḥaran ,
44007003	and said to him , ‘ Come out of your land and from your relatives , and come here , into a land that I shall show you . ’
44007004	“ Then he came out of the land of the Chaldeans and dwelt in Ḥaran . And from there , after the death of his father , He removed him to this land in which you now dwell .
44007005	“ And He gave him no inheritance in it , not a foot of it . But He promised to give it to him for a possession , and to his seed after him , when as yet he had no child .
44007006	“ And Elohim spoke in this way : that his seed would be sojourning in a foreign land , and that they would be enslaved and mistreated four hundred years .
44007007	‘ And the nation to whom they shall be enslaved , I shall judge , ’ said Elohim , ‘ and after that they shall come out and serve Me in this place . ’
44007008	“ And He gave him the covenant of circumcision . And so he brought forth Yitsḥaq and circumcised him on the eighth day . And Yitsḥaq brought forth Ya‛aqoḇ , and Ya‛aqoḇ brought forth the twelve ancestors .
44007009	“ And the ancestors , becoming jealous , sold Yosĕph into Mitsrayim . But Elohim was with him ,
44007010	and delivered him out of all his afflictions , and gave him favour and wisdom before Pharaoh , sovereign of Mitsrayim . And he appointed him governor over Mitsrayim and all his house .
44007011	“ Then a scarcity of food and great distress came over all the land of Mitsrayim and Kena ‘ an , and our fathers found no food .
44007012	“ But Ya‛aqoḇ heard that there was grain in Mitsrayim , and he sent out our fathers the first time ,
44007013	and at the second time Yosĕph was made known to his brothers , and Yosĕph’s race became known to the Pharaoh .
44007014	“ And Yosĕph sent and called his father Ya‛aqoḇ and all his relatives to him , seventy-five people .
44007015	“ And Ya‛aqoḇ went down to Mitsrayim , and died , he and our fathers ,
44007016	and they were brought over to Sheḵem and laid in the tomb that Aḇraham bought for a price of silver from the sons of Ḥamor , the father of Sheḵem .
44007017	“ But as the time of the promise drew near which Elohim had sworn to Aḇraham , the people increased and multiplied in Mitsrayim
44007018	until another sovereign arose who did not know Yosĕph .
44007019	“ Having dealt treacherously with our race , this one mistreated our fathers , making them expose their babies , so that they should not live .
44007020	“ At that time Mosheh was born , and he was well-pleasing to Elohim . And he was reared three months in the house of his father .
44007021	“ But when he was exposed , the daughter of Pharaoh took him up and reared him as her own son .
44007022	“ And Mosheh was instructed in all the wisdom of the Mitsrites , and was mighty in words and works .
44007023	“ And when he was forty years old , it came into his heart to visit his brothers , the children of Yisra’ĕl .
44007024	“ And seeing one of them being wronged , he defended and revenged him who was oppressed , smiting the Mitsrite .
44007025	“ And he thought that his brothers would have understood that Elohim would give deliverance to them by his hand , but they did not understand .
44007026	“ And the next day he appeared to two of them as they were fighting , and urged them to peace , saying , ‘ Men , you are brothers , why do you wrong one another ? ’
44007027	“ But he who was wronging his neighbour pushed him away , saying , ‘ Who made you a ruler and a judge over us ?
44007028	‘ Do you wish to kill me as you killed the Mitsrite yesterday ? ’
44007029	“ And at this saying , Mosheh fled and became a sojourner in the land of Miḏyan , where he fathered two sons .
44007030	“ And after forty years were completed , a Messenger of יהוה appeared to him in a flame of fire in a bush , in the wilderness of Mount Sinai .
44007031	“ And Mosheh , seeing it , marvelled at the sight , and coming near to look , the voice of יהוה came to him ,
44007032	saying , ‘ I am the Elohim of your fathers , the Elohim of Aḇraham and the Elohim of Yitsḥaq and the Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ . ’ And Mosheh trembled and did not have the courage to look .
44007033	‘ But יהוה said to him , “ Take your sandals off your feet , for the place where you stand is set-apart ground .
44007034	“ I have certainly seen the evil treatment of my people who are in Mitsrayim , and I have heard their groaning and have come down to deliver them . And now come , let Me send you to Mitsrayim . ” ’
44007035	“ This Mosheh whom they had refused , saying , ‘ Who made you a ruler and a judge ? ’ – this one Elohim sent to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the Messenger who appeared to him in the bush .
44007036	“ This one led them out , after he had done wonders and signs in the land of Mitsrayim , and in the Red Sea , and in the wilderness forty years .
44007037	“ This is the Mosheh who said to the children of Yisra’ĕl , ‘ יהוה your Elohim shall raise up for you a Prophet like me from your brothers . Him you shall hear . ’
44007038	“ This is he who was in the assembly in the wilderness with the Messenger who spoke to him on Mount Sinai , and with our fathers , who received the living Words to give to us ,
44007039	unto whom our fathers would not become obedient , but thrust away , and in their hearts they turned back to Mits-rayim ,
44007040	saying to Aharon , ‘ Make us mighty ones to go before us , for this Mosheh who led us out of the land of Mitsrayim , we do not know what has become of him . ’
44007041	“ And they made a calf in those days , and brought an offering to the idol , and were rejoicing in the works of their own hands .
44007042	“ So Elohim turned and gave them up to worship the host of the heaven , as it has been written in the book of the Prophets , ‘ Did you bring slaughtered beasts and offerings unto Me during forty years in the wilderness , O house of Yisra’ĕl ?
44007043	‘ And you took up the tent of Moleḵ , and the star of your mighty one Kiyyun , images which you made to bow before them . Therefore I shall remove you beyond Baḇel . ’
44007044	“ The Tent of Witness was with our fathers in the wilderness , as He appointed , instructing Mosheh to make it according to the pattern that he had seen ,
44007045	which our fathers , having received it in turn , also brought with Yehoshua into the land possessed by the gentiles , whom Elohim drove out before the face of our fathers until the days of Dawiḏ ,
44007046	who found favour before Elohim and asked to find a dwelling for the Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ ,
44007047	but Shelomoh built Him a house .
44007048	“ However , the Most High does not dwell in dwellings made with hands , as the prophet says :
44007049	‘ The heaven is My throne , and earth is My footstool . What house shall you build for Me ? says יהוה , or what is the place of My rest ?
44007050	‘ Has My hand not made all these ? ’
44007051	“ You stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears ! You always resist the Set-apart Spirit , as your fathers did , you also do .
44007052	“ Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute ? And they killed those who before announced the coming of the Righteous One , of whom you now have become the betrayers and murderers ,
44007053	who received the Torah as it was ordained by messengers , but did not watch over it . ”
44007054	And hearing this they were cut to the hearts and gnashed the teeth at him .
44007055	But he , being filled with the Set-apart Spirit , looked steadily into the heaven and saw the esteem of Elohim , and יהושע standing at the right hand of Elohim ,
44007056	and he said , “ Look ! I see the heavens opened and the Son of Aḏam standing at the right hand of Elohim ! ”
44007057	And crying out with a loud voice , they stopped their ears , and rushed upon him with one mind ,
44007058	and threw him out of the city and stoned him . And the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named Sha’ul .
44007059	And they were stoning Stephanos as he was calling and saying , “ Master יהושע , receive my spirit . ”
44007060	And kneeling down he cried out with a loud voice , “ Master , do not hold this sin against them . ” And having said this , he fell asleep .
44008001	And Sha’ul was giving approval to his death . And on that day there was a great persecution against the assembly which was at Yerushalayim , and they were all scattered throughout the countries of Yehuḏah and Shomeron , except the emissaries .
44008002	And dedicated men buried Stephanos , and made great lamentation over him .
44008003	But Sha’ul was ravaging the assembly , entering every house , and dragging off men and women , putting them in prison .
44008004	Then those who had been scattered went everywhere bringing the Good News : the Word !
44008005	And going down to the city of Shomeron Philip proclaimed Messiah to them .
44008006	And the crowds with one mind heeded what Philip said , hearing and seeing the miracles which he did .
44008007	For unclean spirits came out of many who were possessed , crying with a loud voice , and many who were paralysed and lame were healed .
44008008	And there came to be great joy in that city .
44008009	Now there was a certain man called Shim‛on , who formerly was practising magic in the city and astonishing the people of Shomeron , claiming to be someone great ,
44008010	to whom they all were giving heed , from the least to the greatest , saying , “ This one is the power of Elohim , which is great . ”
44008011	And they were giving heed to him because for a long time he had amazed them with his magic .
44008012	And when they believed Philip as he brought the Good News about the reign of Elohim and the Name of יהושע Messiah , both men and women were immersed .
44008013	And Shim‛on himself also believed . And when he was immersed he continued with Philip , and was amazed , seeing the miracles and signs which took place .
44008014	And when the emissaries who were at Yerushalayim heard that Shomeron had received the Word of Elohim , they sent Kĕpha and Yoḥanan to them ,
44008015	who , when they had come down , prayed for them to receive the Set-apart Spirit ,
44008016	for He had not yet fallen on any of them , but they had only been immersed in the Name of the Master יהושע .
44008017	Then they laid hands on them , and they received the Set-apart Spirit .
44008018	And Shim‛on , seeing that through the laying on of the hands of the emissaries the Set-apart Spirit was given , he offered them money ,
44008019	saying , “ Give me this authority too , so that anyone I lay hands on shall receive the Set-apart Spirit . ”
44008020	But Kĕpha said to him , “ Let your silver perish with you , because you thought to buy the gift of Elohim through money !
44008021	“ You have neither part nor lot in this matter , for your heart is not right before Elohim .
44008022	“ Repent therefore of this evil of yours , and plead with Elohim to forgive you the intention of your heart .
44008023	“ For I see that you are poisoned by bitterness and bound by unrighteousness . ”
44008024	But Shim‛on answering , said , “ Plead with the Master for me , so that none of what you had said shall come upon me . ”
44008025	Then after they had earnestly witnessed and spoken the Word of יהוה , they returned to Yerushalayim , bringing the Good News in many villages of the Shomeronites .
44008026	But a messenger of יהוה spoke to Philip , saying , “ Arise and go toward the south along the way which goes down from Yerushalayim to Azzah . ” This is desert .
44008027	And he arose and went , and saw , a man of Kush , a eunuch of great authority under Kandake the sovereigness of the Kushites , who was in charge of all her treasury , and had come to Yerushalayim to worship ,
44008028	and was returning . And sitting in his chariot , he was reading the prophet Yeshayahu .
44008029	And the Spirit said to Philip , “ Go near and join him in that chariot . ”
44008030	And running up , Philip heard him reading the prophet Yeshayahu , and said , “ Do you know what you are reading ? ”
44008031	And he said , “ How am I able , unless someone guides me ? ” And he called Philip near , to come up and sit with him .
44008032	And the passage of the Scripture which he was reading was this , “ He was led as a sheep to slaughter , and like a lamb silent before its shearer , so He opened not His mouth .
44008033	“ In His humiliation He was deprived of right-ruling . And who shall declare His generation ? Because His life was taken from the earth . ”
44008034	And the eunuch , answering Philip , said , “ I ask you , about whom does the prophet say this , about himself or about some other ? ”
44008035	And Philip opening his mouth , and beginning at this Scripture , brought to him the Good News : יהושע !
44008036	And as they were going on the way , they came to some water . And the eunuch said , “ Look , water ! What hinders me from being immersed ? ”
44008037	And Philip said , “ If you believe with all your heart , it is permitted . ” And he answering , said , “ I believe that יהושע Messiah is the Son of Elohim . ”
44008038	And he commanded the chariot to stand still . And both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water , and he immersed him .
44008039	And when they came up out of the water , the Spirit of יהוה caught Philip away , and the eunuch saw him no more , for he went his way , rejoicing .
44008040	Philip , however , was found at Ashdoḏ . And passing through , he brought the Good News in all the cities until he came to Caesarea .
44009001	But Sha’ul , still breathing threats and murder against the taught ones of the Master , having come to the high priest ,
44009002	asked from him letters to the congregations of Damascus , so that if he found any who were of the Way , whether men or women , to bring them bound to Yerushalayim .
44009003	And it came to be , that as he journeyed , he came near Damascus , and suddenly a light flashed around him from the heaven .
44009004	And he fell to the ground , and heard a voice saying to him , “ Sha’ul , Sha’ul , why do you persecute Me ? ”
44009005	And he said , “ Who are You , Master ? ” And the Master said , “ I am יהושע , whom you persecute . It is hard for you to kick against the prods . ”
44009006	Both trembling , and being astonished , he said , “ Master , what do You wish me to do ? ” And the Master said to him , “ Arise and go into the city , and you shall be told what you have to do . ”
44009007	And the men journeying with him stood speechless , hearing indeed the voice but seeing no one .
44009008	And Sha’ul arose from the ground , but when his eyes were opened he saw no one . And leading him by the hand they brought him into Damascus .
44009009	And he was three days without sight , and did not eat nor drink .
44009010	And there was at Damascus a certain taught one , by name Ḥananyah . And the Master said unto him in a vision , “ Ḥananyah ! ” And he said , “ Here I am , Master . ”
44009011	And the Master said to him , “ Arise and go to the street called Straight , and seek in the house of Yehuḏah for one called Sha’ul of Tarsos , for look , he is praying ,
44009012	and has seen in a vision a man named Ḥananyah coming in and laying his hand on him , so as to see again . ”
44009013	And Ḥananyah answered , “ Master , I have heard from many about this man , how many evils he did to Your set-apart ones in Yerushalayim ,
44009014	and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all those calling on Your Name . ”
44009015	But the Master said to him , “ Go , for he is a chosen vessel of Mine to bear My Name before nations , sovereigns , and the children of Yisra’ĕl .
44009016	“ For I shall show him how much he has to suffer for My Name . ”
44009017	And Ḥananyah went away and went into the house . And laying his hands on him he said , “ Brother Sha’ul , the Master יהושע , who appeared to you on the way as you came , has sent me , so that you might see again and be filled with the Set-apart Spirit . ”
44009018	And immediately there fell from his eyes , as it were scales , and he received his sight . And rising up , he was immersed .
44009019	And having received food , he was strengthened . And Sha’ul was with the taught ones at Damascus some days .
44009020	And immediately he proclaimed the Messiah in the congregations , that He is the Son of Elohim .
44009021	And all who heard were amazed , and said , “ Is this not he who destroyed those calling on this Name in Yerushalayim , and has come here for this , to take them bound to the chief priests ? ”
44009022	But Sha’ul kept increasing in strength , and was confounding the Yehuḏim who dwelt in Damascus , proving that this is the Messiah .
44009023	And after many days had elapsed , the Yehuḏim plotted to kill him .
44009024	But their plot became known to Sha’ul . And they were watching the gates day and night , to kill him .
44009025	But taking him by night , the taught ones let him down through the wall , lowering him in a basket .
44009026	And having arrived at Yerushalayim , Sha’ul tried to join the taught ones , but they were all afraid of him , not believing that he was a taught one .
44009027	But Barnaḇah took him and brought him to the emissaries , and told them how he had seen the Master on the way , and that He had spoken to him , and how he was speaking boldly at Damascus in the Name of יהושע .
44009028	And he was with them at Yerushalayim , coming in and going out ,
44009029	and speaking boldly in the Name of the Master יהושע and disputed with the Hellenists , but they undertook to kill him .
44009030	And when the brothers learned of this , they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him out to Tarsos .
44009031	Then indeed the assemblies throughout all Yehuḏah , and Galil , and Shomeron had peace and were built up , and walking in the fear of יהוה and in the encouragement of the Set-apart Spirit , they were being increased .
44009032	And it came to be , as Kĕpha was passing through all places , that he also came down to the set-apart ones who were dwelling at Lod .
44009033	And there he found a certain man named Aeneas , who had been bedridden for eight years , being paralytic .
44009034	And Kĕpha said to him , “ Aeneas , יהושע the Messiah heals you ! Rise up and make your bed . ” And immediately he rose up .
44009035	And all those dwelling at Lod and Sharon saw him and did turn to the Master .
44009036	And in Yapho there was a certain taught one named Taḇitha , which means Dorkas . This woman was filled with good works and kind deeds which she did .
44009037	And it came to be in those days that she became sick and died . And having washed her , they laid her in an upper room .
44009038	And Lod being near to Yapho , and the taught ones having heard that Kĕpha was there , they sent two men to him , urging him not to delay in coming to them .
44009039	And having risen up , Kĕpha went with them . And when he arrived , they brought him to the upper room . And all the widows stood beside him weeping , showing the inner garments and outer garments which Dorkas had made while she was with them .
44009040	But Kĕpha sent them all out , and knelt down and prayed . And turning to the body he said , “ Taḇitha , arise . ” And she opened her eyes , and seeing Kĕpha , she sat up .
44009041	And giving her his hand , he lifted her up . And calling the set-apart ones and widows , he presented her alive .
44009042	And it became known throughout all Yapho , and many believed on the Master .
44009043	And it came to be that he stayed for many days in Yapho with Shim‛on , a leather-tanner .
44010001	Now there was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius , a captain of what was called the Italian Regiment ,
44010002	dedicated , and fearing Elohim with all his household , doing many kind deeds to the people , and praying to Elohim always .
44010003	He clearly saw in a vision , about the ninth hour of the day , a messenger of Elohim coming to him , and saying to him , “ Cornelius ! ”
44010004	And looking intently at him , and becoming afraid , he said , “ What is it , master ? ” And he said to him , “ Your prayers and your kind deeds have come up for a remembrance before Elohim .
44010005	“ And now send men to Yapho , and send for Shim‛on who is also called Kĕpha .
44010006	“ He is staying with Shim‛on , a leather-tanner , whose house is by the sea . ”
44010007	And when the messenger who spoke to him went away , Cornelius called two of his household servants , and a dedicated soldier from among those who waited on him continually .
44010008	And having explained to them all , he sent them to Yapho .
44010009	And on the next day , as they were on their way and approaching the city , Kĕpha went up on the house-top to pray , about the sixth hour .
44010010	And he became hungry and wished to eat . But while they were preparing , he fell into a trance ,
44010011	and he saw the heaven opened and a certain vessel like a great sheet bound at the four corners , descending to him and let down to the earth ,
44010012	in which were all kinds of four-footed beasts of the earth , and wild beasts , and creeping creatures , and the birds of the heaven .
44010013	And a voice came to him , “ Rise up , Kĕpha , slay and eat . ”
44010014	But Kĕpha said , “ Not at all , Master ! Because I have never eaten whatever is common or unclean . ”
44010015	And a voice came to him again the second time , “ What Elohim has cleansed you do not consider common . ”
44010016	And this took place three times , and the vessel was taken back to the heaven .
44010017	And while Kĕpha was doubting within himself about what the vision might mean , look , the men who had been sent from Cornelius , having asked for the house of Shim‛on , stood at the gate ,
44010018	and calling out , they enquired whether Shim‛on , also known as Kĕpha , was staying there .
44010019	And as Kĕpha was thinking about the vision , the Spirit said to him , “ See , three men seek you .
44010020	“ But rise up , go down and go with them , not doubting at all , for I have sent them . ”
44010021	So Kĕpha went down to the men who had been sent to him from Cornelius , and said , “ Look , I am the one you seek . Why have you come ? ”
44010022	And they said , “ Cornelius the captain , a righteous man and one who fears Elohim and well spoken of by the entire nation of the Yehuḏim , was instructed by a set-apart messenger to send for you to his house , and to hear words from you . ”
44010023	So inviting them in , he housed them . And on the next day Kĕpha went away with them , and some brothers from Yapho went with him .
44010024	And the following day they entered into Caesarea . And Cornelius was waiting for them , having called together his relatives and close friends .
44010025	And it came to be , that when Kĕpha entered , Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and bowed before him .
44010026	But Kĕpha raised him up , saying , “ Stand up , I myself am also a man . ”
44010027	And talking with him , he went in and found many who had come together .
44010028	And he said to them , “ You know that a Yehuḏite man is not allowed to associate with , or go to one of another race . But Elohim has shown me that I should not call any man common or unclean .
44010029	“ That is why I came without hesitation when I was sent for . So I ask , why have you sent for me ? ”
44010030	And Cornelius said , “ Four days ago I was fasting until this hour . And at the ninth hour I prayed in my house , and see , a man stood before me in shining garments ,
44010031	and said , ‘ Cornelius , your prayer has been heard , and your kind deeds were remembered before Elohim .
44010032	‘ Now send to Yapho and call Shim‛on here , who is also called Kĕpha . He is staying in the house of Shim‛on , a leather-tanner , by the sea . When he comes , he shall speak to you . ’
44010033	“ So I sent to you immediately , and you have done well to come . And now , we are all present before Elohim , to hear all that you have been commanded by Elohim . ”
44010034	And opening his mouth , Kĕpha said , “ Truly I see that Elohim shows no partiality ,
44010035	but in every nation , he who fears Him and works righteousness is accepted by Him .
44010036	“ He sent the word to the children of Yisra’ĕl , bringing the Good News : peace through יהושע Messiah ! He is Master of all .
44010037	“ You know what word came to be throughout all Yehuḏah , beginning from Galil after the immersion which Yoḥanan proclaimed :
44010038	how Elohim did anoint יהושע of Natsareth with the Set-apart Spirit and with power , who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil , for Elohim was with Him .
44010039	“ And we are witnesses of all He did , both in the country of the Yehuḏim and in Yerushalayim , whom they even killed by hanging on a timber .
44010040	“ Elohim raised up this One on the third day , and let Him be seen ,
44010041	not to all the people , but to witnesses , those having been chosen before by Elohim – to us who ate and drank with Him after He arose from the dead .
44010042	“ And He commanded us to proclaim to the people , and to witness that it is He who was appointed by Elohim to be Judge of the living and the dead .
44010043	“ To this One all the prophets bear witness , that through His Name , everyone believing in Him does receive forgiveness of sins . ”
44010044	While Kĕpha was still speaking these words , the Set-apart Spirit fell upon all those hearing the word .
44010045	And those of the circumcision who believed were astonished , as many as came with Kĕpha , because the gift of the Set-apart Spirit had been poured out on the gentiles also ,
44010046	for they were hearing them speaking with tongues and extolling Elohim . Then Kĕpha answered ,
44010047	“ Is anyone able to forbid water , that these should not be immersed who have received the Set-apart Spirit – even as also we ? ”
44010048	And he commanded them to be immersed in the Name of יהושע Messiah . Then they asked him to remain a few days .
44011001	And the emissaries and brothers who were in Yehuḏah heard that the gentiles also received the word of Elohim .
44011002	And when Kĕpha went up to Yerushalayim , those of the circumcision were contending with him ,
44011003	saying , “ You went in to uncircumcised men and ate with them ! ”
44011004	But Kĕpha began and set it forth in order , saying :
44011005	“ I was in the city of Yapho praying . And in a trance I saw a vision , a certain vessel descending like a great sheet , let down from the heaven by four corners , and it came to me .
44011006	“ Having looked into it , I perceived and I saw four-footed beasts of the earth , and wild beasts , and creeping creatures , and the birds of heaven .
44011007	“ And I heard a voice saying to me , ‘ Rise up , Kĕpha , slay and eat . ’
44011008	“ But I said , ‘ Not at all , Master ! Because whatever is common or unclean has never entered into my mouth . ’
44011009	“ And the voice answered me again from the heaven , ‘ What Elohim has cleansed you do not consider common . ’
44011010	“ And this took place three times , and all were drawn up again into the heaven .
44011011	“ And see , immediately three men stood before the house where I was , having been sent to me from Caesarea .
44011012	“ And the Spirit said to me to go with them , not doubting at all . And these six brothers also went with me , and we went into the man’s house .
44011013	“ And he told us how he had seen a messenger standing in his house , who said to him , ‘ Send men to Yapho , and call for Shim‛on who is also called Kĕpha ,
44011014	who shall speak to you words , by which you shall be saved , you and all your house . ’
44011015	“ And as I began to speak , the Set-apart Spirit fell upon them , as upon us at the beginning .
44011016	“ And I remembered the word of the Master , how He said , ‘ Yoḥanan indeed immersed in water , but you shall be immersed in the Set-apart Spirit . ’
44011017	“ So if Elohim gave them the same gift as He gave us when we believed on the Master יהושע Messiah , how was I able to withstand Elohim ? ”
44011018	And having heard this , they were silent , and praised Elohim , saying , “ Then Elohim has indeed also given to the gentiles repentance to life . ”
44011019	Then , indeed , they who were scattered because of the pressure that arose over Stephanos passed through to Phoenicia , and Cyprus , and Antioch , speaking the word to no one except the Yehuḏim only .
44011020	But some of them were men from Cyprus and Cyrene , who , when they had come to Antioch , spoke to the Hellenists , bringing the Good News : the Master יהושע !
44011021	And the hand of the Master was with them , and a great number having believed turned to the Master .
44011022	And word of it came to the ears of the assembly in Yerushalayim , and they sent out Barnaḇah to go as far as Antioch ,
44011023	who , having come , and seeing the favour of Elohim , was glad , and encouraged them all with purpose of heart to cleave to the Master .
44011024	Because he was a good man , and filled with the Set-apart Spirit and with belief . And large numbers were added to the Master .
44011025	Then Barnaḇah went to Tarsos to seek Sha’ul ,
44011026	and having found him , he brought him to Antioch . And it came to be that for an entire year they came together in the assembly and taught large numbers . And the taught ones were called ‘ Messianites’ first in Antioch .
44011027	And in those days prophets came from Yerushalayim to Antioch .
44011028	And one of them , named Ḥag̅aḇ , stood up and indicated by the Spirit that there was going to be a great scarcity of food over all the world – which also took place under Claudius Caesar .
44011029	So the taught ones , each according to his ability , decided to send relief to the brothers dwelling in Yehuḏah .
44011030	This they also did , and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnaḇah and Sha’ul .
44012001	And about that time Herodes the sovereign put forth his hands to do evil to some from the assembly .
44012002	And he killed Ya‛aqoḇ the brother of Yoḥanan with the sword .
44012003	And seeing that it was pleasing to the Yehuḏim , he proceeded further to arrest Kĕpha as well – and they were the Days of Unleavened Bread .
44012004	So when he had seized him , he put him in prison , and delivered him to four squads of soldiers to watch over him , intending to bring him before the people after Passover .
44012005	So Kĕpha was indeed kept in prison , but prayer was earnestly made to Elohim on his behalf by the assembly .
44012006	And when Herodes was about to bring him out , that night Kĕpha was sleeping , bound with two chains between two soldiers . And the guards before the door were keeping the prison .
44012007	And see , a messenger of יהוה stood by , and a light shone in the building . And smiting the side of Kĕpha he raised him up , saying , “ Get up quickly ! ” And his chains fell off his hands .
44012008	And the messenger said to him , “ Gird yourself and bind on your sandals , ” and he did so . And he said to him , “ Put on your garment and follow me . ”
44012009	And coming out he followed him , and knew not that what was done by the messenger was true , but thought he was seeing a vision .
44012010	And when they had passed the first and the second guard posts , they came to the iron gate that leads to the city , which opened to them by itself . And they went out and went down one street , and the messenger instantly withdrew from him .
44012011	And when Kĕpha had come to himself , he said , “ Now I truly know that יהוה has sent His messenger , and delivered me from the hand of Herodes and from all the Yehuḏite people were anticipating . ”
44012012	And having realised this , he went to the house of Miryam , the mother of Yoḥanan who was also called Mark , where many had gathered to pray .
44012013	And when Kĕpha knocked at the door of the gate , a girl named Rhode came to answer .
44012014	And when she recognised Kĕpha’s voice , she did not open the gate because of her joy , but ran in and reported that Kĕpha stood before the gate .
44012015	And they said to her , “ You are mad ! ” But she kept insisting that it was so , and they said , “ It is his messenger . ”
44012016	And Kĕpha continued knocking , and having opened they saw him and were amazed .
44012017	And motioning to them with his hand to be silent , he told them how the Master brought him out of the prison . And he said , “ Report this to Ya‛aqoḇ and to the brothers . ” And he left and went to another place .
44012018	Now when day came , there was no small stir among the soldiers about what had become of Kĕpha .
44012019	And when Herodes had searched for him and did not find him , he examined the guards and ordered them to be led away . And he went down from Yehuḏah to Caesarea , and stayed there .
44012020	Now Herodes had been highly displeased with the people of Tsor and Tsiḏon , but with one mind they came to him , and having made Blastos the sovereign’s eunuch their friend , they were asking for peace , because their country was supplied with food by the sovereign’s country .
44012021	And on an appointed day Herodes , having put on his royal clothes , sat on his throne and gave an address to them .
44012022	And the people kept shouting , “ The voice of a mighty one and not of a man ! ”
44012023	And instantly a messenger of יהוה smote him , because he did not give the esteem to Elohim . And becoming worm-eaten , he died .
44012024	And the word of Elohim went on growing and spreading .
44012025	And Barnaḇah and Sha’ul returned from Yerushalayim , having completed the service , and having taken with them Yoḥanan who was also called Mark .
44013001	And in the assembly that was at Antioch there were certain prophets and teachers : both Barnaḇah and Shim‛on who was called Niger , and Lucius of Cyrene , and Manaḥĕm who had been brought up with Herodes the district ruler , and Sha’ul .
44013002	And as they were doing service to the Master and fasted , the Set-apart Spirit said , “ Separate unto Me Barnaḇah and Sha’ul for the work to which I have called them . ”
44013003	Then having fasted and prayed , and having laid hands on them , they sent them away .
44013004	So they , having been sent out by the Set-apart Spirit , went down to Seleukeia , and from there they sailed to Cyprus .
44013005	And having come into Salamis , they proclaimed the word of Elohim in the congregations of the Yehuḏim . And they also had Yoḥanan as an attendant .
44013006	And having passed through all the island to Paphos , they found a certain magician , a false prophet , a Yehuḏite whose name was Bar-Yehoshua ,
44013007	who was with the proconsul , Sergius Paulus , a man of understanding . This man , having called for Barnaḇah and Sha’ul , earnestly sought to hear the word of Elohim .
44013008	But Elumas the magician – for so his name is translated – withstood them , seeking to turn the proconsul away from the belief .
44013009	Then Sha’ul , filled with the Set-apart Spirit , looked intently at him ,
44013010	and said , “ O son of the devil , filled with all deceit and all recklessness , you enemy of all righteousness , shall you not cease perverting the straight ways of יהוה ?
44013011	“ And now , see , the hand of יהוה is upon you , and you shall be blind , not seeing the sun for a time . ” And instantly a dark mist fell on him , and he went around seeking someone to lead him by the hand .
44013012	And having seen what took place , the proconsul believed , being astonished at the teaching of the Master .
44013013	And having put out from Paphos , Sha’ul and those with him came to Perge in Pamphulia . And Yoḥanan , having left them , returned to Yerushalayim .
44013014	But passing through from Perge , they came to Antioch in Pisidia , and went into the congregation on the Sabbath day and sat down .
44013015	And after the reading of the Torah and the Prophets , the rulers of the congregation sent to them , saying , “ Men , brothers , if you have any word of encouragement for the people , speak . ”
44013016	And Sha’ul , standing up and motioning with his hand said , “ Men , Yisra’ĕlites , and those fearing Elohim , listen :
44013017	“ The Elohim of this people Yisra’ĕl did choose our fathers , and exalted the people in their sojourning in the land of Mitsrayim , and with a high arm He brought them out of it .
44013018	“ Now for a time of about forty years He sustained them in the wilderness .
44013019	“ And having destroyed seven nations in the land of Kena ‘ an , He gave their land to them as an inheritance .
44013020	“ And after that He gave judges for about four hundred and fifty years , until Shemu’ĕl the prophet .
44013021	“ But then they asked for a sovereign , and Elohim gave them Sha’ul the son of Qish , a man of the tribe of Binyamin , for forty years .
44013022	“ And having removed him , He raised up for them Dawiḏ as sovereign , to whom also He gave witness and said , ‘ I have found Dawiḏ the son of Yishai , a man after My own heart , who shall do all My desires . ’
44013023	“ From this one’s seed , according to the promise , Elohim raised up for Yisra’ĕl a Saviour , יהושע ,
44013024	after Yoḥanan had first proclaimed the immersion of repentance to all the people of Yisra’ĕl , before His coming .
44013025	“ And as Yoḥanan was completing his mission , he said , ‘ Who do you suppose I am ? I am not He . But see , there comes One after me , the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to loose . ’
44013026	“ Men , brothers , sons of the race of Aḇraham , and those among you fearing Elohim , to you the word of this deliverance has been sent ,
44013027	for those dwelling in Yerushalayim , and their rulers , because they did not know Him , nor even the voices of the Prophets which are read every Sabbath , have filled them in having judged Him .
44013028	“ And having found not one cause for death , they asked Pilate that He should be put to death .
44013029	“ And when they had accomplished all that was written concerning Him , taking Him down from the timber , they laid Him in a tomb .
44013030	“ But Elohim raised Him from the dead ,
44013031	and He was seen for many days by those who came up with Him from Galil to Yerushalayim , who are His witnesses to the people .
44013032	“ And we bring you the Good News , the promise made to the fathers ,
44013033	that Elohim has filled this for us , their children , having raised up יהושע , as it has also been written in the second Psalm , ‘ You are My Son , today I have brought You forth . ’
44013034	“ And that He raised Him out of the dead , no more to return to corruption , He has said thus , ‘ I shall give you the trustworthy kindnesses of Dawiḏ . ’
44013035	“ For this reason He also says in another Psalm , ‘ You shall not give Your Kind One to see corruption . ’
44013036	“ For Dawiḏ , indeed , having served his own generation by the counsel of Elohim , fell asleep , was buried with his fathers , and saw corruption ,
44013037	but He whom Elohim raised up saw no corruption .
44013038	“ Let it therefore be known to you , brothers , that through this One forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you ,
44013039	and by Him everyone who believes is declared right from all sins from which you were not able to be declared right by the Torah of Mosheh .
44013040	“ Watch then that what was said in the prophets does not come upon you :
44013041	“ See , you despisers , marvel and perish , for I work a work in your days , a work which you would in no way believe if someone were to declare it to you . ’ ”
44013042	And when the Yehuḏim went out of the congregation , the gentiles begged to have these words spoken to them the next Sabbath .
44013043	And when the meeting of the congregation had broken up , many of the Yehuḏim and of the worshipping converts followed Sha’ul and Barnaḇah , who , speaking to them , were urging them to continue in the favour of Elohim .
44013044	And on the next Sabbath almost all the city came together to hear the Word of Elohim .
44013045	But when the Yehuḏim saw the crowds , they were filled with jealousy . And contradicting and speaking evil , they opposed what Sha’ul was saying .
44013046	But speaking boldly , Sha’ul and Barnaḇah said , “ It was necessary that the word of Elohim should be spoken to you first , but since you thrust it away , and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life , see , we turn to the gentiles .
44013047	“ For so the Master has commanded us , ‘ I have set you to be a light to the gentiles , that you should be for deliverance to the ends of the earth . ’ ”
44013048	And when the gentiles heard this , they were glad and praised the Word of יהוה . And as many as had been appointed to everlasting life believed .
44013049	And the Word of יהוה was being spread throughout the entire country .
44013050	But the Yehuḏim stirred up the worshipping and noble women and the chief men of the city , and raised up persecution against Sha’ul and Barnaḇah , and threw them out of their borders .
44013051	And shaking off the dust from their feet against them , they came to Ikonion .
44013052	And the taught ones were filled with joy and the Set-apart Spirit .
44014001	And it came to be in Ikonion that they went together into the congregation of the Yehuḏim , and spoke in such a way that a great number of both Yehuḏim and Greeks believed .
44014002	But the Yehuḏim who would not obey stirred up the gentiles and evilly influenced their beings against the brothers .
44014003	So they remained a long time , speaking boldly in the Master , who was bearing witness to the word of His favour , giving signs and wonders to be done by their hands .
44014004	And the crowd of the city was divided , and some sided with the Yehuḏim , and some with the emissaries .
44014005	But when a move took place by both the gentiles and Yehuḏim , with their rulers , to mistreat and stone them ,
44014006	they became aware of it and fled to Lustra and Derbe , cities of Lukaonia , and the country round about .
44014007	And they were bringing the Good News there .
44014008	And in Lustra there was sitting a certain man , disabled in his feet , a cripple from his mother’s womb , who had never walked .
44014009	This one heard Sha’ul speaking , who , looking intently at him and seeing that he had belief to be healed ,
44014010	said with a loud voice , “ Stand upright on your feet ! ” And he sprang up and began to walk .
44014011	And when the crowds saw what Sha’ul had done , they lifted up their voices , saying in Lukaonian , “ The mighty ones have become like men and come down to us ! ”
44014012	And they called Barnaḇah Zeus , and Sha’ul Hermes , since he was the chief speaker .
44014013	And the priest of Zeus , being in front of their city , brought oxen and wreaths to the gates , and wished to offer with the crowds .
44014014	And when the emissaries Barnaḇah and Sha’ul heard this , they tore their garments and ran in among the crowd , crying out
44014015	and saying , “ Men , why are you doing this ? We also are men with the same nature as you , bringing to you the Good News : to turn from these worthless matters to the living Elohim , who made the heaven , and the earth , and the sea , and all that is in them ,
44014016	who in past generations allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways ,
44014017	though , indeed , He did not leave Himself without witness , doing good – giving us rain from heaven and fruit-bearing seasons , filling our hearts with food and gladness . ”
44014018	Even with these words they still had difficulty in stopping the crowds from offering to them .
44014019	But Yehuḏim arrived from Antioch and Ikonion , and having won over the crowds , they stoned Sha’ul , dragged him out of the city , thinking he was dead .
44014020	But while the taught ones gathered around him , he rose up and went into the city . And on the next day he went away with Barnaḇah to Derbe .
44014021	And having brought the Good News to that city , and having made many taught ones , they returned to Lustra , and Ikonion , and Antioch ,
44014022	strengthening the beings of the taught ones , encouraging them to continue in the belief , and that through many pressures we have to enter the reign of Elohim .
44014023	And having appointed elders in every assembly , having prayed with fasting , they committed them to the Master in whom they had believed .
44014024	And having passed through Pisidia , they came to Pamphulia .
44014025	And having spoken the word in Perge , they went down to Attaleia ,
44014026	and from there they sailed to Antioch , where they had been committed to the favour of Elohim for the work which they had completed .
44014027	And having arrived , and having gathered together the assembly , they related all that Elohim had done with them , and that He had opened the door of belief to the gentiles .
44014028	And they remained there a long time with the taught ones .
44015001	And certain men came down from Yehuḏah and were teaching the brothers , “ Unless you are circumcised , according to the practice of Mosheh , you are unable to be saved . ”
44015002	So when Sha’ul and Barnaḇah had no small dissension and dispute with them , they arranged for Sha’ul and Barnaḇah and certain others of them to go up to Yerushalayim , to the emissaries and elders , about this question .
44015003	So , being sent on their way by the assembly , they passed through Phoenicia and Shomeron , relating the conversion of the gentiles . And they were causing great joy to all the brothers .
44015004	And having arrived in Yerushalayim , they were received by the assembly and the emissaries and the elders . And they reported all that Elohim had done with them .
44015005	And some of the believers who belonged to the sect of the Pharisees , rose up , saying , “ It is necessary to circumcise them , and to command them to keep the Torah of Mosheh . ”
44015006	And the emissaries and elders came together to look into this matter .
44015007	And when there had been much dispute , Kĕpha rose up and said to them , “ Men , brothers , you know that a good while ago Elohim chose among us , that by my mouth the gentiles should hear the word of the Good News and believe .
44015008	“ And Elohim , who knows the heart , bore witness to them , by giving them the Set-apart Spirit , as also to us ,
44015009	and made no distinction between us and them , cleansing their hearts by belief .
44015010	“ Now then , why do you try Elohim by putting a yoke on the neck of the taught ones which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear ?
44015011	“ But through the favour of the Master יהושע Messiah we trust to be saved , in the same way as they . ”
44015012	And all the crowd was silent and were listening to Barnaḇah and Sha’ul declaring how many miracles and wonders Elohim did among the gentiles , through them .
44015013	And after they were silent , Ya‛aqoḇ answered , saying , “ Men , brothers , listen to me :
44015014	“ Shim‛on has declared how Elohim first visited the gentiles to take out of them a people for His Name .
44015015	“ And the words of the prophets agree with this , as it has been written :
44015016	‘ After this I shall return and rebuild the Booth of Dawiḏ which has fallen down . And I shall rebuild its ruins , and I shall set it up ,
44015017	so that the remnant of mankind shall seek יהוה , even all the gentiles on whom My Name has been called , says יהוה who is doing all this , ’
44015018	who has made this known from of old .
44015019	“ Therefore I judge that we should not trouble those from among the gentiles who are turning to Elohim ,
44015020	but that we write to them to abstain from the defilements of idols , and from whoring , and from what is strangled , and from blood .
44015021	“ For from ancient generations Mosheh has , in every city , those proclaiming him – being read in the congregations every Sabbath . ”
44015022	Then it seemed good to the emissaries and elders , with all the assembly , to send chosen men from among them to Antioch with Sha’ul and Barnaḇah : Yehuḏah being called Barsabba , and Sila , leading men among the brothers ,
44015023	having written by their hand this : The emissaries and the elders and the brothers , To the brothers who are of the gentiles in Antioch , and Syria , and Kilikia : Greetings .
44015024	Since we have heard that some who went out from us have troubled you with words , unsettling your lives , to whom we gave no command –
44015025	it seemed good to us , having become of one mind , to send chosen men to you with our beloved Barnaḇah and Sha’ul ,
44015026	men who have given up their lives for the Name of our Master יהושע Messiah .
44015027	We have therefore sent Yehuḏah and Sila , who are also confirming this by word of mouth .
44015028	For it seemed good to the Set-apart Spirit , and to us , to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessities :
44015029	that you abstain from what is offered to idols , and blood , and what is strangled , and whoring . If you keep yourselves from these , you shall do well . Be strong !
44015030	They , therefore , being sent off , went to Antioch . And having gathered the crowd together , they delivered the letter .
44015031	And having read it , they rejoiced over its encouragement .
44015032	And Yehuḏah and Sila , being themselves also prophets , encouraged the brothers with many words and strengthened them .
44015033	And having spent some time , they were sent back in peace from the brothers to the emissaries .
44015034	But it seemed good to Sila to remain .
44015035	And Sha’ul and Barnaḇah continued in Antioch , teaching and bringing , with many others also , the Good News : the Word of יהוה !
44015036	And after some days Sha’ul said to Barnaḇah , “ Let us now go back and visit our brothers in every city where we proclaimed the Word of יהוה , and see how they are . ”
44015037	And Barnaḇah purposed to take with them Yoḥanan called Mark .
44015038	But Sha’ul thought it not fit to take with them the one who withdrew from them in Pamphulia , and had not gone with them to the work .
44015039	A sharp feeling therefore came to be , so that they parted from one another . And so Barnaḇah took Mark and sailed to Cyprus .
44015040	And Sha’ul chose Sila and went off , being committed by the brothers to the favour of Elohim .
44015041	And he went through Syria and Kilikia , strengthening the assemblies .
44016001	And he came to Derbe and Lustra . And see , a certain taught one was there , named Timothy , the son of a certain Yehuḏite woman who believed – but his father was Greek –
44016002	who was well spoken of by the brothers who were at Lustra and Ikonion .
44016003	Sha’ul wished to have this one go with him . And he took him and circumcised him because of the Yehuḏim who were in those places , for they all knew that his father was Greek .
44016004	And as they went through the cities , they delivered to them the regulations to keep , which were decided by the emissaries and elders at Yerushalayim .
44016005	Then , indeed , the assemblies were strengthened in the belief , and increased in number every day .
44016006	And having passed through Phrygia and the Galatian country , they were forbidden by the Set-apart Spirit to speak the word in Asia .
44016007	When they came to Musia , they tried to go into Bithunia , but the Spirit did not allow them .
44016008	And having passed by Musia , they came down to Troas .
44016009	And in the night a vision appeared to Sha’ul : A man of Makedonia was standing , begging him and saying , “ Come over to Makedonia and help us . ”
44016010	And when he saw the vision , immediately we sought to go to Makedonia , concluding that the Master had called us to bring the Good News to them .
44016011	Therefore , sailing from Troas , we ran a straight course to Samothrake , and the next day came to Neapolis ,
44016012	and from there to Philippi , which is the principal city of that part of Makedonia , a colony . And we were staying in that city for some days .
44016013	And on the Sabbath day we went outside the city by a river , where there used to be prayer . And having sat down we were speaking to the women who met there .
44016014	And a certain woman named Ludia , a seller of purple from the city of Thyatira , worshipping Elohim , was hearing , whose heart the Master did open to pay attention to what Sha’ul said .
44016015	And when she was immersed , and her household , she begged us , saying , “ If you have judged me to be believing in the Master , come to my house and stay . ” And she urged us .
44016016	And it came to be , as we went to prayer , that a certain slave girl possessed with a spirit of Puthon , did meet us , who brought her masters much profit by foretelling .
44016017	Having followed Sha’ul and us , she cried out , saying , “ These men are the servants of the Most High Elohim , who proclaim to us the way of deliverance . ”
44016018	And she was doing this for many days . But Sha’ul , greatly annoyed , turned and said to the spirit , “ I command you in the Name of יהושע Messiah to come out of her . ” And it came out that same hour .
44016019	But when her masters saw that their anticipation of money-making was gone , they seized Sha’ul and Sila and dragged them into the market-place to the rulers .
44016020	And having brought them to the captains , they said , “ These men , being Yehuḏim , greatly disturb our city ,
44016021	and they proclaim practices which are not right for us to receive nor to do , being Romans . ”
44016022	And the crowd rose up together against them . And the captains tore off their garments and commanded them to be beaten with rods .
44016023	And having laid many blows upon them , they threw them into prison , commanding the jailer to keep them safely ,
44016024	who , having received such a command , put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks .
44016025	And at midnight Sha’ul and Sila were praying and singing songs to Elohim , and the prisoners were listening to them .
44016026	And suddenly a great earthquake took place , so that the foundations of the prison were shaken , and immediately all the doors were opened and all the chains came loose .
44016027	And the jailer , awaking from sleep and seeing the prison doors open , thinking the prisoners had fled , drew his sword and was about to kill himself .
44016028	But Sha’ul called with a loud voice , saying , “ Do no harm to yourself , for we are all here . ”
44016029	And asking for a light , he ran in , and fell down trembling before Sha’ul and Sila .
44016030	And having led them outside he said , “ Masters , what do I have to do to be saved ? ”
44016031	And they said , “ Believe on the Master יהושע Messiah , and you shall be saved , you and your household . ”
44016032	And they spoke the Word of יהוה to him and to all who were in his house .
44016033	And taking them in that hour of the night , he washed their wounds , and immediately he was immersed , he and all that were his .
44016034	And having brought them into his house , he set food before them . And he rejoiced with all his household , having believed in Elohim .
44016035	And when day came , the authorities sent the officers , saying , “ Let these men go . ”
44016036	And the jailer reported these words to Sha’ul , saying , “ The captains have sent to let you go . Now then , come out and go in peace . ”
44016037	But Sha’ul said to them , “ They have beaten us publicly , uncondemned , being Romans . They have thrown us into prison , and now , do they throw us out secretly ? No indeed ! Let them come themselves and bring us out . ”
44016038	And the officers reported these words to the authorities , and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans .
44016039	And having come , they pleaded with them and brought them out , and asked them to leave the city .
44016040	So coming out of the prison they went to Ludia , and seeing the brothers , they encouraged them , and went forth .
44017001	And having passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia , they came to Thessalonike , where there was a congregation of the Yehuḏim .
44017002	And according to his practice , Sha’ul went in unto them , and for three Sabbaths was reasoning with them from the Scriptures ,
44017003	explaining and pointing out that the Messiah had to suffer and rise again from the dead , and saying , “ This is the Messiah , יהושע , whom I proclaim to you . ”
44017004	And some of them did believe , and a large number of the worshipping Greeks , and not a few of the leading women , joined Sha’ul and Sila .
44017005	But the Yehuḏim who did not believe , having become envious , took some of the wicked men from the market-place , and gathering a mob , set all the city in an uproar and came upon the house of Jason , and were seeking to bring them out to the people .
44017006	But not finding them , they dragged Jason and some of the brothers to the city rulers , crying out , “ They who have turned the world upside down have come here too ,
44017007	whom Jason has received . And all of them are acting contrary to the dogmas of Caesar , saying there is another sovereign , יהושע . ”
44017008	And they troubled the crowd and the city rulers when they heard this .
44017009	And when they had received a pledge from Jason and the rest , they let them go .
44017010	And the brothers immediately sent Sha’ul and Sila away by night to Beroia , who , having come , went into the congregation of the Yehuḏim .
44017011	Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonike , who received the word with great eagerness , and searched the Scriptures daily , if these words were so .
44017012	Then many of them truly believed , and also not a few of the Greeks , decent women as well as men .
44017013	And when the Yehuḏim from Thessalonike came to know that the word of Elohim was proclaimed by Sha’ul at Beroia , they came there also and stirred up the crowds .
44017014	And then immediately the brothers sent Sha’ul away , to go to the sea , but both Sila and Timothy stayed there .
44017015	And those who arranged for Sha’ul brought him to Athens . And receiving a command for Sila and Timothy to join him as soon as possible , they departed .
44017016	But while Sha’ul was waiting for them at Athens , his spirit was stirred up within him when he saw that the city was utterly idolatrous .
44017017	Therefore , indeed , he was reasoning in the congregation with the Yehuḏim and with the gentile worshippers , and in the market-place daily with those who met there .
44017018	And some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him . And some were saying , “ What does this babbler wish to say ? ” Others said , “ He seems to be a proclaimer of strange mighty ones ” – because to them he brought the Good News : יהושע and the resurrection !
44017019	So they laid hold of him and brought him to the Areopagus , saying , “ Are we able to know what this fresh teaching is of which you speak ?
44017020	“ For you are bringing some strange matters to our ears . We wish , then , to know what these mean . ”
44017021	For all the Athenians and the strangers living there spent their leisure time in doing naught but to speak or to hear what is fresh .
44017022	And having stood in the midst of the Areopagus Sha’ul said , “ Men of Athens , I see that you are very religious in every matter .
44017023	“ For passing through and observing the objects of your worship , I even found an altar with this inscription : TO THE UNKNOWN MIGHTY ONE . Not knowing then whom you worship , I make Him known to you :
44017024	“ יהוה , who made the world and all that is in it , this One being Master of heaven and earth , does not dwell in dwellings made with hands .
44017025	“ Nor is He served with men’s hands – as if needing any – Himself giving to all life , and breath , and all else .
44017026	“ And He has made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth , having ordained beforehand the times and the boundaries of their dwelling ,
44017027	to seek the Master , if at least they would reach out for Him and find Him , though He is not far from each one of us .
44017028	“ For in Him we live and move and are , as also some of your own poets have said , ‘ For we are also His offspring . ’
44017029	“ Now then , since we are the offspring of Elohim , we should not think that the Elohim is like gold or silver or stone , an image made by the skill and thought of man .
44017030	“ Truly , then , having overlooked these times of ignorance , Elohim now commands all men everywhere to repent ,
44017031	because He has set a day on which He is going to judge the world in righteousness by a Man whom He has appointed , having given proof of this to all by raising Him from the dead . ”
44017032	And hearing of the resurrection of the dead , some indeed mocked , while others said , “ We shall hear you again concerning this . ”
44017033	And so Sha’ul went out from among them .
44017034	But some men joined him and believed , among them Dionusios the Areopagite , and a woman named Damaris , and others with them .
44018001	And after this Sha’ul left Athens and went to Corinth .
44018002	And he found a certain Yehuḏite named Aqulas , born in Pontos , who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla – because Claudius had commanded all the Yehuḏim to leave Rome – and he came to them .
44018003	And because he was of the same trade , he stayed with them and was working , for they were tentmakers by trade .
44018004	And he was reasoning in the congregation every Sabbath , and won over both Yehuḏim and Greeks .
44018005	And when Sila and Timothy came down from Makedonia , Sha’ul was pressed by the Spirit , and earnestly witnessed to the Yehuḏim that יהושע is the Messiah .
44018006	However , when they resisted and blasphemed , he shook his garments and said to them , “ Your blood is upon your head , I am clean . From now on I shall go to the gentiles . ”
44018007	And having left there he came to the house of a certain man named Justus , who worshipped Elohim , whose house was next to the congregation .
44018008	And Crispus , the ruler of the congregation , did believe in the Master with all his household . And many of the Corinthians , hearing , believed and were immersed .
44018009	And the Master spoke to Sha’ul in the night by a vision , “ Do not be afraid , but speak , and do not be silent ,
44018010	because I am with you , and no one shall attack you to do you evil , because I have much people in this city . ”
44018011	And he remained a year and six months , teaching the Word of יהוה among them .
44018012	And when Gallion was proconsul of Achaia , the Yehuḏim with one mind rose up against Sha’ul and brought him to the judgment seat ,
44018013	saying , “ This one does seduce men to worship Elohim contrary to the Torah . ”
44018014	And as Sha’ul was about to open his mouth , Gallion said to the Yehuḏim , “ If it were a matter of wrongdoing or wicked recklessness , O Yehuḏim , there would be reason why I should bear with you .
44018015	“ But if it is a question of words and names and a law which is among you , see to it yourselves , for I do not wish to be a judge of these matters . ”
44018016	And he drove them away from the judgment seat .
44018017	And all the Greeks took Sosthenes , the ruler of the congregation , and beat him before the judgment seat . But Gallion showed no concern whatever .
44018018	And Sha’ul , having stayed several days more , having taken leave of the brothers , was sailing for Syria , and Priscilla and Aqulas were with him , having shaved his hair at Kenḥrea , for he had taken a vow .
44018019	And he came to Ephesos , and left them there , but he himself went into the congregation and reasoned with the Yehuḏim .
44018020	And when they asked him to stay a longer time with them , he declined ,
44018021	but took leave of them , saying , “ I have to keep this coming festival in Yerushalayim by all means , but I shall come back to you , Elohim desiring so . ” And he sailed from Ephesos .
44018022	And having come to Caesarea , going up and greeting the assembly , he went down to Antioch .
44018023	And having spent some time there , he went forth , passing through the country of Galatia and on through Phrygia , strengthening all the taught ones .
44018024	And a certain Yehuḏite named Apollos , born at Alexandria , a learned man and mighty in the Scriptures , came to Ephesos .
44018025	This one had been instructed in the way of the Master . And being fervent in spirit , he was speaking and teaching the matters about the Master exactly , though he knew only the immersion of Yoḥanan .
44018026	And he began to speak boldly in the congregation . And when Aqulas and Priscilla heard him , they took him aside and explained to him the way of Elohim more exactly .
44018027	And when he intended to pass through to Achaia , the brothers , having encouraged him , wrote to the taught ones to receive him , who , having arrived , greatly helped those who believed through favour ,
44018028	for with power he refuted the Yehuḏim publicly , showing from the Scriptures that יהושע is the Messiah .
44019001	And it came to be , while Apollos was at Corinth , that Sha’ul , having passed through the upper parts , came to Ephesos . And having found some taught ones ,
44019002	he said to them , “ Did you receive the Set-apart Spirit when you believed ? ” And they said to him , “ No , we have not even heard that there is a Set-apart Spirit . ”
44019003	And he said to them , “ Into what then were you immersed ? ” And they said , “ Into Yoḥanan’s immersion . ”
44019004	And Sha’ul said , “ Yoḥanan indeed immersed with an immersion of repentance , saying to the people that they should believe in the One who is coming after him , that is , in Messiah יהושע . ”
44019005	And when they heard this , they were immersed in the Name of the Master יהושע .
44019006	And when Sha’ul had laid hands on them , the Set-apart Spirit came upon them , and they were speaking in tongues and prophesying .
44019007	And all the men were about twelve .
44019008	And having gone into the congregation he spoke boldly for three months , reasoning and persuading concerning the reign of Elohim .
44019009	But when some were hardened and did not believe , speaking evil of the Way before the crowd , he withdrew from them and separated the taught ones , reasoning daily in the school of Turannos .
44019010	And this took place for two years , so that all who dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Master יהושע , both Yehuḏim and Greeks .
44019011	And Elohim worked unusual miracles through the hands of Sha’ul ,
44019012	so that even handkerchiefs or aprons were brought from his body to the sick , and the diseases left them and the wicked spirits went out of them .
44019013	But certain roving Yehuḏite exorcists took it upon themselves to call the Name of the Master יהושע over those who had wicked spirits , saying , “ We exorcise you by יהושע whom Sha’ul proclaims . ”
44019014	And there were seven sons of a certain Skeua , a Yehuḏite chief priest , who were doing this .
44019015	And the wicked spirit answering , said , “ יהושע I know , and Sha’ul I know , but who are you ? ”
44019016	And the man in whom the wicked spirit was leaped on them , overpowered them , and prevailed against them , so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded .
44019017	And this became known to all , both Yehuḏim and Greeks dwelling in Ephesos . And fear fell on them all , and the Name of the Master יהושע was made great .
44019018	And many who had believed came confessing and declaring their deeds .
44019019	And many of those who had practised magic brought their books together , burning them before all . And they reckoned up the value of them , and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver .
44019020	So the word of the Master was growing mightily and prevailing .
44019021	Now when these matters had been completed , Sha’ul purposed in the Spirit , when he had passed through Makedonia and Achaia , to go to Yerushalayim , saying , “ After I have been there , I have to see Rome too . ”
44019022	And having sent into Makedonia two of those assisting him , Timothy and Ěrastos , he himself remained in Asia for a time .
44019023	And about that time there came to be a great commotion about the Way .
44019024	For a certain man named Demetrios , a silversmith , who made silver shrines of Artemis , provided no little business to the craftsmen ,
44019025	who , having called them together , with the workers of similar trade , said , “ Men , you know that our wealth is from this business .
44019026	“ And you see and hear that not only at Ephesos , but throughout almost all Asia , this Sha’ul has persuaded and turned away a large number , saying that they are not mighty ones which are made with hands .
44019027	“ And not only is this trade of ours in danger of coming to rejection , but also that the temple of the great female mighty one Artemis whom all Asia and the world worship , shall be regarded as worthless and her greatness diminished . ”
44019028	And having heard this , they were filled with rage and cried out , saying , “ Great is Artemis of the Ephesians ! ”
44019029	And the entire city was filled with confusion , and they rushed with one mind into the theatre , having seized Gaios and Aristarchos , Makedonians , Sha’ul’s fellow travellers .
44019030	And Sha’ul , intending to go in among the mob , the taught ones did not allow him .
44019031	And some of the officials of Asia , being his friends , sent to him begging him not to risk himself into the theatre .
44019032	Then others indeed shouted this and others that , for the assembly was confused , and most of them did not know why they had come together .
44019033	And some of the crowd instructed Alexander – the Yehuḏim putting him forward . And Alexander motioned with his hand , and wished to make his defence to the people .
44019034	But having recognised that he was a Yehuḏite , all with one voice cried out for about two hours , “ Great is Artemis of the Ephesians ! ”
44019035	And the city clerk , having calmed the crowd , said , “ Men of Ephesos , what man is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is the guardian of the temple of the great female mighty one Artemis , and of that which fell down from Zeus ?
44019036	“ Therefore , if these matters are undeniable , you need to be calm , and do not act rashly .
44019037	“ For you have brought these men here who are neither temple-robbers nor speaking evil of your female mighty one .
44019038	“ If truly then Demetrios and his fellow craftsmen have a case against anyone , the courts are open and there are proconsuls . Let them accuse one another .
44019039	“ And if you have any further complaint , it shall be settled in the regular assembly .
44019040	“ For we are in danger of being accused of riot concerning today , there being no reason which we could give to account for this disorderly gathering . ”
44019041	And having said this , he dismissed the assembly .
44020001	After the uproar had ceased , Sha’ul called the taught ones to him , and having embraced them , went away to go to Makedonia .
44020002	And having gone through those parts , and having encouraged them with many words , he came to Greece ,
44020003	where he spent three months . When he was about to sail to Syria , he decided to return through Makedonia , as a plot was made against him by the Yehuḏim .
44020004	And he was accompanied by Sopater of Beroia , and Aristarchos and Sekundos of the Thessalonians , and Gaios of Derbe , and Timothy , and Tuchikos and Trophimos of Asia .
44020005	And these , going ahead , waited for us at Troas .
44020006	And we sailed away from Philippi after the Days of Unleavened Bread , and came to them at Troas in five days , where we stayed seven days .
44020007	And on the first day of the week , the taught ones having gathered together to break bread , Sha’ul , intending to depart the next day , was reasoning with them and was extending the word till midnight .
44020008	And there were many lamps in the upper room where they were assembled .
44020009	And a certain young man , by name Eutuchos , was sitting in a window , being overpowered by a deep sleep . As Sha’ul kept on reasoning , he was overcome by sleep and fell down from the third storey , and was picked up dead .
44020010	And Sha’ul , having gone down , fell on him , and embracing him said , “ Do not be upset , for his life is in him . ”
44020011	Then going up again , and having broken bread and eaten , he talked a long while , even till daybreak , and so went forth .
44020012	And they brought the young man in alive , and were encouraged , not a little .
44020013	And we , going ahead to the ship , sailed to Assos , intending to take Sha’ul on board there , for so he had arranged , intending himself to go on foot .
44020014	And when he met us at Assos , we took him on board and came to Mitulene .
44020015	And from there we sailed , and the next day came opposite Chios . And the next day we arrived at Samos and remained at Trogullion . And the following day we came to Miletos .
44020016	For Sha’ul had decided to sail past Ephesos , so that he might lose no time in Asia , for he was hurrying to be at Yerushalayim , if possible , on the Day of the Festival of Weeks .
44020017	And from Miletos he sent to Ephesos and called for the elders of the assembly .
44020018	And when they had come to him , he said to them , “ You know , from the first day that I came to Asia , how I was with you all the time ,
44020019	serving the Master with all humility , with many tears and trials which befell me by the plotting of the Yehuḏim ,
44020020	as I kept back no matter that was profitable , but proclaimed it to you , and taught you publicly and from house to house ,
44020021	witnessing to Yehuḏim , and also to Greeks : repentance toward Elohim and belief in our Master יהושע Messiah .
44020022	“ And now see , I go bound in the spirit to Yerushalayim , not knowing what is going to meet me there ,
44020023	except that the Set-apart Spirit witnesses in every city , saying that chains and pressures await me .
44020024	“ But I do not count my life of any value to me , so that I might accomplish my mission with joy , and the service which I received from the Master יהושע , to bear witness to the Good News of the favour of Elohim .
44020025	“ And now see , I know that you all , among whom I went about proclaiming the reign of Elohim , shall see my face no more .
44020026	“ Therefore I witness to you this day that I am clear from the blood of all .
44020027	“ For I kept not back from declaring to you all the counsel of Elohim .
44020028	“ Therefore take heed to yourselves and to all the flock , among which the Set-apart Spirit has made you overseers , to shepherd the assembly of Elohim which He has purchased with His own blood .
44020029	“ For I know this , that after my departure savage wolves shall come in among you , not sparing the flock .
44020030	“ Also from among yourselves men shall arise , speaking distorted teachings , to draw away the taught ones after themselves .
44020031	“ Therefore watch , remembering that for three years , night and day , I did not cease to warn each one with tears .
44020032	“ And now , brothers , I commit you to Elohim and to the word of His favour , which is able to build you up and give you an inheritance among all those having been set apart .
44020033	“ I have coveted no one’s silver or gold or garments .
44020034	“ And you yourselves know that these hands supplied my needs , and for those who were with me .
44020035	“ All this I did show you , by labouring like this , that you ought to help the weak . And remember the words of the Master יהושע , that He said , ‘ It is more blessed to give than to receive . ’ ”
44020036	And having said this , he knelt down and prayed with them all .
44020037	And there was much weeping among them all , and falling on Sha’ul’s neck , they kissed him ,
44020038	distressed most of all because of the word which he had said , that they would see his face no more . And they went with him to the ship .
44021001	And it came to be , when we had torn ourselves away from them , and had set sail , we ran a straight course and came to Cos , and the next day to Rhodes , and from there to Patara .
44021002	And having found a ship passing over to Phoenicia , we went aboard and set sail .
44021003	And having sighted Cyprus , and having passed it on the left , we sailed to Syria , and landed at Tsor , for the ship was to unload her cargo there .
44021004	And having found taught ones , we remained there seven days . And they told Sha’ul through the Spirit not to go up to Yerushalayim .
44021005	And when it came to be that our days there were ended , we left and went on , all of them accompanying us , with wives and children , till we were out of the city . And kneeling down on the beach , we prayed .
44021006	And having embraced one another , we boarded the ship , and they returned to their homes .
44021007	And when we had completed our voyage from Tsor , we came to Ptolemais . And having greeted the brothers we stayed with them one day .
44021008	And on the next day we left and came to Caesarea , and went into the house of Philip the evangelist , who was one of the seven , and stayed with him .
44021009	Now this one had four maiden daughters who prophesied .
44021010	And as we were staying many days , a certain prophet named Ḥag̅aḇ came down from Yehuḏah ,
44021011	and having come to us , he took the girdle of Sha’ul , bound his own hands and feet , and said , “ Thus says the Set-apart Spirit , ‘ Thus shall the Yehuḏim at Yerushalayim bind the man who owns this girdle , and deliver him into the hands of the gentiles . ’ ”
44021012	And when we heard this , both we and those from that place begged him not to go up to Yerushalayim .
44021013	And Sha’ul answered , “ What do you mean by weeping and breaking my heart ? For I am ready not only to be bound , but also to die at Yerushalayim for the Name of the Master יהושע . ”
44021014	And as he could not be persuaded , we ceased , saying , “ Let the desire of the Master be done . ”
44021015	And after those days , having made ready , we went up to Yerushalayim .
44021016	And also some of the taught ones from Caesarea went with us and brought with them one , Mnason of Cyprus , an early taught one , with whom we were to lodge .
44021017	And when we had arrived in Yerushalayim , the brothers received us gladly .
44021018	And on the following day Sha’ul went in with us to Ya‛aqoḇ , and all the elders came .
44021019	And having greeted them , he was relating one by one what Elohim had done among the gentiles through his service .
44021020	And when they heard it , they praised the Master . And they said to him , “ You see , brother , how many thousands of Yehuḏim there are who have believed , and all are ardent for the Torah .
44021021	“ And they have been informed about you that you teach all the Yehuḏim who are among the gentiles to forsake Mosheh , saying not to circumcise the children nor to walk according to the practices .
44021022	“ What then is it ? They shall certainly hear that you have come .
44021023	“ So do this , what we say to you : We have four men who have taken a vow .
44021024	“ Take them and be cleansed with them , and pay their expenses so that they shave their heads . And all shall know that what they have been informed about you is not so , but that you yourself also walk orderly , keeping the Torah .
44021025	“ But concerning the gentiles who believe , we have written and decided that they should keep themselves from what is offered to idols , and blood , and what is strangled , and whoring . ”
44021026	Then Sha’ul took the men on the next day , and having been cleansed with them , went into the Set-apart Place to announce the completion of the days of separation – until the offering should be presented for each one of them .
44021027	And when the seven days were almost ended , the Yehuḏim from Asia , seeing him in the Set-apart Place , were stirring up all the crowd , and they laid hands on him ,
44021028	crying out , “ Men of Yisra’ĕl , help ! This is the man who is teaching all men everywhere against the people , and the Torah , and this place . And besides , he also brought Greeks into the Set-apart Place and has profaned this Set-apart Place . ”
44021029	Because they had previously seen Trophimos the Ephesian with him in the city , whom they thought that Sha’ul had brought into the Set-apart Place .
44021030	And the entire city was moved , and the people rushed together , seized Sha’ul , and dragged him out of the Set-apart Place . And immediately the doors were shut .
44021031	And while they were seeking to kill him , a report came to the commander of the company of soldiers that all Yerushalayim was in confusion .
44021032	At once he took soldiers and captains , and ran down to them . And they , having seen the commander and the soldiers , stopped beating Sha’ul .
44021033	Then the commander came near and took him , and commanded him to be bound with two chains , and was asking who he was and what he had done .
44021034	And in the crowd some were shouting this and others that . And not being able to ascertain the truth because of the uproar , he commanded him to be taken into the barracks .
44021035	And when he came to the stairs , he had to be carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd .
44021036	For a large number of the people followed after , crying out , “ Away with him ! ”
44021037	And as Sha’ul was about to be led into the barracks , he said to the commander , “ Am I allowed to say somewhat to you ? ” And he said , “ Do you know Greek ?
44021038	“ Are you not the Mitsrite who some time ago stirred up a revolt and led the four thousand assassins out into the wilderness ? ”
44021039	But Sha’ul replied , “ I am a Yehuḏite from Tarsos , in Kilikia , a citizen of no mean city . And I beg you , allow me to speak to the people . ”
44021040	And having given him permission , Sha’ul , standing on the stairs motioned with his hand to the people . And when there was a great silence , he spoke in the Heḇrew language , saying ,
44022001	“ Men , brothers , and fathers , hear my defence before you now . ”
44022002	And when they heard that he spoke to them in the Heḇrew language , they kept greater silence . And he said :
44022003	“ I am indeed a Yehuḏite , having been born in Tarsos of Kilikia , but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamli’ĕl , having been instructed according to the exactness of the Torah of our fathers , being ardent for Elohim , as you all are today ,
44022004	who persecuted this Way to the death , binding and delivering up into prisons both men and women ,
44022005	as also the high priest bears me witness , and all the eldership , from whom I also received letters to the brothers , and went to Damascus to bring in chains even those who were there to Yerushalayim to be punished .
44022006	“ And it came to be , as I was journeying and coming near Damascus , about noon , suddenly a great light shone around me out of the heaven ,
44022007	and I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me , ‘ Sha’ul , Sha’ul , why do you persecute Me ? ’
44022008	“ And I answered , ‘ Who are You , Master ? ’ And He said to me , ‘ I am יהושע of Natsareth , whom you persecute . ’
44022009	“ And those who were with me indeed saw the light and were afraid , but they did not hear His voice speaking to me .
44022010	“ And I said , ‘ What shall I do , Master ? ’ And the Master said to me , ‘ Rise up , go into Damascus , and there you shall be told all that you have been appointed to do . ’
44022011	“ And as I could not see because of the esteem of that light , being led by the hand of those who were with me , I came into Damascus .
44022012	“ And a certain Ḥananyah , a dedicated man according to the Torah , being well spoken of by all the Yehuḏim dwelling there ,
44022013	came to me , and stood by and said to me , ‘ Brother Sha’ul , look up . ’ And at that same hour I looked up at him .
44022014	“ And he said , ‘ The Elohim of our fathers has appointed you to know His desire , and to see the Righteous One , and to hear the voice from His mouth .
44022015	‘ Because you shall be His witness to all men of what you have seen and heard .
44022016	‘ And now , why do you delay ? Rise up , be immersed , and wash away your sins , calling on the Name of יהוה . ’
44022017	“ And it came to be , when I returned to Yerushalayim , and while I was praying in the Set-apart Place , I came to be in a trance ,
44022018	and I saw Him saying to me , ‘ Hurry and get out of Yerushalayim , speedily , because they shall not accept your witness concerning Me . ’
44022019	“ And I said , ‘ Master , they know that in every congregation I was imprisoning and beating those who believe on You .
44022020	‘ And when the blood of Your witness Stephanos was shed , I also was standing by giving my approval to his death , and keeping the garments of those who were killing him . ’
44022021	“ And He said to me , ‘ Go , because I shall send you far from here to the gentiles . ’ ”
44022022	And they were listening to him until this word , and then they lifted up their voice , saying , “ Away with such a one from the earth , for it is not fit that he should live ! ”
44022023	As they were shouting and tearing their garments , and throwing dust into the air ,
44022024	the commander ordered him to be brought into the barracks , and said that he should be examined by flogging , in order to find out why they were shouting so against him .
44022025	And as they were stretching him out with straps , Sha’ul said to the captain who was standing by , “ Is it permitted for you to whip a man who is a Roman , and uncondemned ? ”
44022026	And when the captain heard , he went and reported to the commander , saying , “ Watch what you are about to do , for this man is a Roman . ”
44022027	And having come , the commander said to him , “ Say to me , are you a Roman ? ” And he said , “ Yes . ”
44022028	And the commander answered , “ With a large sum I obtained this citizenship . ” And Sha’ul said , “ But I was even born so . ”
44022029	Then at once those who were about to examine him withdrew from him . And the commander was also afraid after he found out that he was a Roman , and because he had bound him .
44022030	And on the next day , intending to know for certain why he was accused by the Yehuḏim , he released him , and commanded the chief priests and all their council to come , and brought Sha’ul down and set him before them .
44023001	And Sha’ul , looking intently at the council , said , “ Men , brothers , I have lived in all good conscience before Elohim until this day . ”
44023002	And the high priest Ḥananyah commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth .
44023003	Then Sha’ul said to him , “ Elohim is going to strike you , whitewashed wall ! And do you sit judging me according to the Torah , and do you command me to be struck contrary to the Torah ? ”
44023004	And those who stood by said , “ Do you revile the high priest of Elohim ? ”
44023005	And Sha’ul said , “ I did not know , brothers , that he was the high priest , for it has been written , ‘ You shall not speak evil of the ruler of your people . ’ ”
44023006	Now Sha’ul , perceiving that one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees , cried out in the council , “ Men , brothers , I am a Pharisee , the son of a Pharisee , I am being judged concerning the expectation and resurrection of the dead ! ”
44023007	And when he had said this , there came a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees . And the crowd was divided .
44023008	For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection , nor messenger nor spirit , but the Pharisees confess both .
44023009	And there was a great uproar . And certain of the scribes of the party of Pharisees were earnestly contending , saying , “ We find no evil in this man . And if a spirit or a messenger has spoken to him , let us not fight against Elohim . ”
44023010	And a great dissension having come , the commander , fearing lest Sha’ul would be pulled to pieces by them , commanded the body of soldiers to go down and seize him from their midst , and bring him into the barracks .
44023011	And on the following night the Master stood by him and said , “ Take courage , Sha’ul , for as you have witnessed for Me in Yerushalayim , so you have to bear witness at Rome too . ”
44023012	And when it became day , some of the Yehuḏim made a conspiracy and bound themselves under an oath , saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Sha’ul .
44023013	And those making this conspiracy were more than forty ,
44023014	who , having come to the chief priests and elders , said , “ We have bound ourselves under a great oath not to eat at all until we have killed Sha’ul .
44023015	“ Now , then , you , with the council , inform the commander to have him brought down to you tomorrow , as intending to examine more exactly all about him . And we are ready to kill him before he comes near . ”
44023016	And when Sha’ul’s sister’s son heard of their ambush , he went and entered into the barracks and reported to Sha’ul .
44023017	And Sha’ul , having called one of the captains to him , said , “ Take this young man to the commander , for he has somewhat to report to him . ”
44023018	He indeed then took him and led him to the commander and said , “ The prisoner Sha’ul called me to him and asked me to bring this young man to you , having somewhat to say to you . ”
44023019	And the commander , having taken him by the hand , went aside by themselves and asked , “ What is it that you have to report to me ? ”
44023020	And he said , “ The Yehuḏim have agreed to ask that you bring Sha’ul down to the council tomorrow , as intending to inquire more exactly about him .
44023021	“ Therefore , do not let them persuade you , for more than forty of them lie in wait for him , men who have bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor to drink until they have killed him . And now they are ready , waiting for the promise from you . ”
44023022	Then the commander dismissed the young man , having commanded him , “ Inform no one that you reported this to me . ”
44023023	And having called near a certain two captains , he said , “ Get two hundred soldiers ready to go to Caesarea , and seventy horsemen , and two hundred spearmen , after the third hour of the night ,
44023024	and provide beasts , on which to place Sha’ul , and bring him safely to Felix the governor , ”
44023025	having written a letter in this form :
44023026	Claudius Lysias , to the most excellent governor Felix : Greetings .
44023027	This man , having been seized by the Yehuḏim , and being about to be killed by them , I rescued , having come with the body of soldiers , having learned that he was a Roman .
44023028	And , desiring to know the reason they accused him , I brought him before their council .
44023029	I found out that he was accused concerning questions of their Torah , but there was no charge against him deserving death or chains .
44023030	And when I was informed that there was to be a plot against the man by the Yehuḏim , I sent him immediately to you , having also commanded his accusers to state before you the charges against him . Be strong !
44023031	So the soldiers , as they were commanded , took Sha’ul and brought him by night to Antipatris .
44023032	And on the next day they left the horsemen to go on with him , and returned to the barracks ,
44023033	who , having come to Caesarea , and delivered the letter to the governor , they also presented Sha’ul to him .
44023034	And the governor , having read it , and having asked of what province he was , and being informed that he was from Kilikia ,
44023035	said , “ I shall hear you when your accusers arrive also . ” And he commanded him to be kept in Herodes’ palace .
44024001	And after five days the high priest Ḥananyah came down , with the elders , and a certain speaker – Tertullus . And they brought charges against Sha’ul before the governor .
44024002	And when he was called upon , Tertullus began to accuse him , saying , “ Having obtained great peace through you , and reforms being brought to this nation by your forethought ,
44024003	we accept it always and in all places , most excellent Felix , with all thanks .
44024004	“ But in order not to hinder you any further , I beg you to hear us briefly in your gentleness .
44024005	“ For having found this man a plague , who stirs up dissension among all the Yehuḏim throughout the world , and a ringleader of the sect of the Natsarenes ,
44024006	who also tried to profane the Set-apart Place , and whom we seized , and wished to judge him according to our law ,
44024007	but the commander Lysias came along and with much violence took him out of our hands ,
44024008	commanding his accusers to come to you . And by examining him yourself you shall be able to know all these matters of which we accuse him . ”
44024009	And the Yehuḏim also agreed , maintaining that these matters were so .
44024010	And when the governor had motioned him to speak , Sha’ul answered , “ Knowing that for many years you have been a judge of this nation , I gladly defend myself ,
44024011	seeing you are able to know that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to Yerushalayim to worship .
44024012	“ And they neither found me in the Set-apart Place disputing with anyone nor stirring up the crowd , either in the congregations or in the city .
44024013	“ Nor are they able to prove the charges of which they now accuse me .
44024014	“ And this I confess to you , that according to the Way which they call a sect , so I worship the Elohim of my fathers , believing all that has been written in the Torah and in the Prophets ,
44024015	having an expectation in Elohim , which they themselves also wait for , that there is to be a resurrection of the dead , both of the righteous and the unrighteous .
44024016	“ And in this I exercise myself to have a clear conscience toward Elohim and men always .
44024017	“ And after many years I came to bring kind deeds to my nation and offerings ,
44024018	at which time certain Yehuḏim from Asia found me cleansed in the Set-apart Place , neither with a crowd nor with disturbance ,
44024019	who ought to be present before you to bring charges if they have any matter against me .
44024020	“ Or else let these themselves say if they found any wrongdoing in me while I stood before the council ,
44024021	other than for this one declaration which I cried out , standing among them , ‘ Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am being judged by you today . ’ ”
44024022	And having heard this , having known more exactly about the Way , Felix put them off , saying , “ When Lysias the commander comes down , I shall decide your case . ”
44024023	And he ordered the captain to keep Sha’ul and to have ease , and not to forbid any of his friends to attend to him .
44024024	And after some days , when Felix came with his wife Drusilla , who was a female Yehuḏite , he sent for Sha’ul and heard him concerning the belief in Messiah .
44024025	And as he reasoned about righteousness , and self-control , and the judgment to come , Felix became frightened and said , “ For the present , go . And when I find time I shall send for you . ”
44024026	At the same time too he was anticipating that silver would be given him by Sha’ul , that he might release him . Therefore he sent for him more often and conversed with him .
44024027	But after two years had passed Porcius Festus succeeded Felix . And wishing to do the Yehuḏim a favour , Felix left Sha’ul bound .
44025001	Festus therefore , having come to the province , three days later went up from Caesarea to Yerushalayim .
44025002	And the high priest and the chief men of the Yehuḏim informed him against Sha’ul , and they begged him ,
44025003	asking a favour against him , that he would send him to Yerushalayim – making a plot along the way to kill him .
44025004	Then , indeed , Festus answered that Sha’ul should be kept at Caesarea , and that he himself was about to set out shortly .
44025005	“ Therefore , ” he said , “ let those who have authority among you go down with me and accuse this man , to see if there is any fault in him . ”
44025006	And having spent more than ten days among them , he went down to Caesarea . And on the next day , sitting on the judgment seat , he commanded Sha’ul to be brought .
44025007	And when he had come , the Yehuḏim who had come down from Yerushalayim stood about , bringing many and heavy charges against Sha’ul , which they were unable to prove ,
44025008	while Sha’ul said in his own defence , “ Neither against the Torah of the Yehuḏim , nor against the Set-apart Place , nor against Caesar did I commit any sin . ”
44025009	But Festus , wishing to do the Yehuḏim a favour , answering Sha’ul , said , “ Do you wish to go up to Yerushalayim and be judged before me there concerning these matters ? ”
44025010	And Sha’ul said , “ I am standing at Caesar’s judgment seat , where I should be judged . To the Yehuḏim I have done no wrong , as you know well enough .
44025011	“ For if indeed I do wrong , or have committed whatever deserving death , I do not refuse to die . But if there is none at all in these matters of which these men accuse me , no one is able to give me up to them . I appeal to Caesar . ”
44025012	Then Festus , having talked with the council , answered , “ You have appealed to Caesar ? To Caesar you shall go ! ”
44025013	And certain days having passed , Sovereign Agrippa and Bernike came to Caesarea to greet Festus .
44025014	And when they had spent many days there , Festus laid Sha’ul’s case before the sovereign , saying , “ There is a man here whom Felix left as a prisoner ,
44025015	about whom the chief priests and the elders of the Yehuḏim informed me , when I was in Yerushalayim , asking for a judgment against him .
44025016	“ To them I answered , ‘ It is not the Roman practice to give up any man to destruction before the accused meets the accusers face to face , and has a chance to answer for himself concerning the charge against him . ’
44025017	“ They , therefore , having come together , without any delay , I sat on the judgment seat the next day and commanded the man to be brought in .
44025018	“ When the accusers stood up , they brought no charge against him such as I expected ,
44025019	but had some questions against him about their own worship and about a certain יהושע , who had died , whom Sha’ul was claiming to be alive .
44025020	“ And being uncertain how to investigate these matters , I asked whether he wished to go to Yerushalayim and there be judged concerning these matters .
44025021	“ But when Sha’ul appealed to be kept for the decision of Augustus , I ordered him to be kept until I send him to Caesar . ”
44025022	And Agrippa said to Festus , “ I was wishing also to hear the man myself . ” And he said , “ Tomorrow , you shall hear him . ”
44025023	Therefore , on the next day , Agrippa and Bernike having come with great show , and having entered the place of hearing with the commanders and the eminent men of the city , Sha’ul was brought in at the order of Festus .
44025024	And Festus said , “ Sovereign Agrippa and all the men present here with us , you see this one about whom all the community of the Yehuḏim pleaded with me , both at Yerushalayim and here , shouting that he ought not to be living any longer .
44025025	“ But I , having found that he had committed none at all deserving death , and that he himself had appealed to Augustus , I decided to send him .
44025026	“ I have no definite matter to write to my master concerning him . Therefore I have brought him out before you , and most of all before you , Sovereign Agrippa , so that after the examination has taken place I might have somewhat to write .
44025027	“ For it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner and not to signify the charges against him . ”
44026001	And Agrippa said to Sha’ul , “ You are allowed to speak for yourself . ” Then Sha’ul stretched out his hand and made his defence :
44026002	“ I think myself blessed , Sovereign Agrippa , because today I shall make my defence before you concerning all of which I am accused by the Yehuḏim ,
44026003	you being most of all an expert , knowing of all practices and questions which have to do with the Yehuḏim . So , please hear me patiently .
44026004	“ Truly , then , all the Yehuḏim know my way of life from youth , which I led from the beginning among my own nation at Yerushalayim ,
44026005	since they have known me from the first , if they wish to witness , that I lived as a Pharisee according to the strictest sect of our observance .
44026006	“ And now I stand and am judged for the expectation of the promise made by Elohim to our fathers ,
44026007	to which our twelve tribes , earnestly serving Elohim night and day , expect to attain . Concerning this expectation , O Sovereign Agrippa , I am accused by the Yehuḏim .
44026008	“ Why is it considered ‘ unbelievable’ among you if Elohim raises the dead ?
44026009	“ Therefore , indeed , I thought within myself that I ought to do much against the Name of יהושע of Natsareth ,
44026010	which also I did in Yerushalayim , and I shut up many of the set-apart ones in prison , having received authority from the chief priests . And when they were put to death , I gave my vote against them .
44026011	“ And punishing them often in all the congregations , I compelled them to blaspheme . And being exceedingly enraged against them , I persecuted them even to foreign cities .
44026012	“ While thus engaged , as I was journeying to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests ,
44026013	at midday along the highway , O sovereign , I saw a light from heaven , brighter than the sun , shining around me and those who journeyed with me .
44026014	“ And when we had all fallen to the ground , I heard a voice speaking to me , and saying in the Heḇrew language , ‘ Sha’ul , Sha’ul , why do you persecute Me ? It is hard for you to kick against the prods . ’
44026015	“ And I said , ‘ Who are You , Master ? ’ And He said , ‘ I am יהושע , whom you persecute .
44026016	‘ But rise up , and stand on your feet , for I have appeared to you for this purpose , to appoint you a servant and a witness both of what you saw and of those which I shall reveal to you ,
44026017	delivering you from the people , and the gentiles , to whom I now send you ,
44026018	to open their eyes , to turn them from darkness to light , and the authority of Satan to Elohim , in order for them to receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who are set-apart by belief in Me . ’
44026019	“ Therefore , Sovereign Agrippa , I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision ,
44026020	but declared first to those in Damascus and in Yerushalayim , and in all the country of Yehuḏah , and to the gentiles , that they should repent , and turn to Elohim , and do works worthy of repentance .
44026021	“ That is why the Yehuḏim seized me in the Set-apart Place and tried to kill me .
44026022	“ Therefore , having obtained help from Elohim , to this day I stand , witnessing both to small and great , saying nil else than what the prophets and Mosheh said would come –
44026023	that the Messiah would suffer , would be the first to rise from the dead , He would proclaim light to the people and to the gentiles . ”
44026024	And while saying this in his defence , Festus said with a loud voice , “ Sha’ul , you are mad ! Much learning is turning you to madness ! ”
44026025	But Sha’ul said , “ I am not mad , most excellent Festus , but I speak words of truth and sense .
44026026	“ For the sovereign , before whom I also speak boldly , knows these matters . For I am persuaded that none of these are hidden from him , for this has not been done in a corner .
44026027	“ Sovereign Agrippa , do you believe the prophets ? I know that you do believe . ”
44026028	And Agrippa said to Sha’ul , “ With a little you might persuade me to become a Messianite ! ”
44026029	And Sha’ul said , “ Much or little , I pray to Elohim that not only you , but also all who hear me today , might become such as I also am , except for these chains . ”
44026030	And having said this , the sovereign stood up , as well as the governor and Bernike and those sitting with them ,
44026031	and having withdrawn , they spoke to each other , saying , “ This man is doing none at all deserving death or chains . ”
44026032	And Agrippa said to Festus , “ This man could have been released if he had not appealed to Caesar . ”
44027001	And when it was decided that we should sail to Italy , they delivered Sha’ul and some other prisoners to one named Julius , a captain of the Augustan regiment .
44027002	And having embarked in a ship from Adramyttium , about to sail along the coasts of Asia , did set sail . Aristarchos , a Makedonian of Thessalonike , was with us .
44027003	And on the next day we landed at Tsiḏon . And Julius treated Sha’ul kindly and allowed him to go to his friends to receive attention .
44027004	And from there we put out to sea and sailed close to Cyprus , because the winds were against us .
44027005	And having sailed over the sea along Kilikia and Pamphulia , we came to Mura , of Lukia .
44027006	And there the captain , having found an Alexandrian ship sailing to Italy , did put us on board .
44027007	And having sailed slowly many days , and arriving with difficulty off Knidos , the wind not allowing us to proceed , we sailed close to Crete , off Salmone .
44027008	And passing it with difficulty , we came to a place called Fair Havens , near the city of Lasea .
44027009	And much time having passed , and the sailing now being dangerous , because the Fast was already over , Sha’ul advised them ,
44027010	saying , “ Men , I see that this voyage is going to end with damage and great loss , not only of the cargo and ship , but also our lives . ”
44027011	But the captain was persuaded by the pilot and the owner of the ship , rather than what Sha’ul said .
44027012	And because the harbour was unsuitable to winter in , the greater part advised to set sail from there too , if somehow they were able to reach Phoenix , a harbour of Crete facing southwest and northwest , to pass the winter .
44027013	And a south wind blowing softly , thinking they had obtained their purpose , having lifted anchor , they sailed along Crete , close inshore .
44027014	And not long after , a stormy head wind rushed down from it , called Northeaster .
44027015	And when the ship was caught in it , and unable to head against the wind , we let her go and were driven .
44027016	And having run under a small island called Klauda , we were hardly able to control the small boat .
44027017	And having hoisted it , they used helps to undergird the ship . And fearing lest they should run aground on Surtis , they lowered the tackle and so were driven .
44027018	And because we were exceedingly storm-tossed , the next day they began to throw overboard .
44027019	And on the third day we threw out the ship’s tackle with our own hands .
44027020	When , now , neither sun nor stars appeared for many days , and no small storm beat on us , all expectancy that we would be saved was taken away .
44027021	And when there had been a long abstinence from food , then Sha’ul , standing in the midst of them , said , “ Truly , men , you should have listened to me not to have sailed from Crete and sustained this damage and loss .
44027022	“ And now I urge you to take courage , for there shall be no loss of life among you , but only of the ship .
44027023	“ For tonight a messenger of the Elohim to whom I belong and whom I serve , stood by me ,
44027024	saying , ‘ Do not be afraid , Sha’ul , you have to be brought before Caesar . And look , Elohim has favourably given you all those who sail with you . ’
44027025	“ Therefore take courage , men , for I believe Elohim that it shall be according to the way it was spoken to me .
44027026	“ However , we need to run aground on some island . ”
44027027	And when the fourteenth night came , as we were driven up and down in the Adriatic Sea , about midnight the sailors suspected that they were drawing near some land .
44027028	So , taking soundings , they found it to be twenty fathoms . And a little farther on they took soundings again and found it to be fifteen fathoms .
44027029	And , fearing lest we should run aground on the rocks , they dropped four anchors from the stern , and were praying for day to come .
44027030	But when the sailors were seeking to escape from the ship , when they had let down the boat into the sea , under pretence of going to cast out anchors from the prow ,
44027031	Sha’ul said to the captain and the soldiers , “ If these do not remain in the ship , it is impossible for you to be saved . ”
44027032	Then the soldiers did cut the ropes of the boat and let it fall off .
44027033	And when day was about to come , Sha’ul urged them all to take food , saying , “ Today is the fourteenth day you have continued without food , and eaten none at all .
44027034	“ So I urge you to take food , for this concerns your safety , since not a hair shall fall from the head of any of you . ”
44027035	And having said this , he took bread and gave thanks to Elohim in the presence of them all . And when he had broken it he began to eat .
44027036	And they were all encouraged , and also took food themselves .
44027037	And all of us were two hundred and seventy-six beings in the ship .
44027038	And being satisfied with food , they were lightening the ship , throwing out the wheat into the sea .
44027039	And when day came , they did not recognise the land , but they noted a certain bay with a beach , onto which they planned to run the ship if possible .
44027040	And having cast off the anchors , they left them in the sea , meanwhile untying the rudder ropes . And they hoisted the foresail to the wind and made for the beach .
44027041	But coming upon a place where two seas met , they grounded the ship , and the prow stuck fast and remained immovable , but the stern was broken by the pounding of the surf .
44027042	And the soldiers intended to kill the prisoners , lest any of them should swim away and escape .
44027043	But the captain , intending to save Sha’ul , kept them from their intention , and commanded those able to swim to jump first and get to land ,
44027044	and the rest , some indeed on boards , and some on items of the ship . And so it came to be that all reached the land in safety .
44028001	And having come to safety , they then learned that the island was called Melite .
44028002	And the foreigners showed us extraordinary kindness , for they kindled a fire and received us all , because of the rain that was falling and because of the cold .
44028003	But Sha’ul , having gathered a bundle of sticks , and having laid them on the fire , an adder came out because of the heat , and fastened itself on his hand .
44028004	And when the foreigners saw the creature hanging from his hand , they said to each other , “ This man is certainly a murderer , whom , though saved from the sea , still right-ruling does not allow to live . ”
44028005	Then , indeed , he shook off the creature into the fire and suffered no evil .
44028006	And expecting that he would swell up or suddenly fall down dead , they waited for a long time and saw no harm come to him , changing their minds they said that he was a mighty one .
44028007	And in the neighbourhood of that place there were lands of the chief of the island , whose name was Poplius , who received us and housed us in a friendly way for three days .
44028008	And it came to be that the father of Poplius lay sick with inflammation and dysentery . Sha’ul went in to him , and having prayed he laid his hands on him and healed him .
44028009	And when this took place , the rest of those on the island who had diseases also came and were healed ,
44028010	who also respected us in many ways . And when we were setting sail , they provided us with our needs .
44028011	And after three months we set sail in an Alexandrian ship which had wintered at the island , and whose figurehead was “ Twin Brothers . ”
44028012	And having landed at Syracuse , we stayed three days ,
44028013	from which place we went round and arrived at Rhegium . And after one day the south wind blew , and the second day we came to Puteoli ,
44028014	where we found brothers , and were invited to stay with them seven days . And so we went toward Rome .
44028015	And when the brothers there heard about us , they came to meet us as far as Forum of Appius and Three Taverns . When Sha’ul saw them , he thanked Elohim and took courage .
44028016	And when we came to Rome , the captain delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard , but Sha’ul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier guarding him .
44028017	And it came to be after three days that Sha’ul called the leaders of the Yehuḏim together . And when they had come together , he said to them , “ Men , brothers , though I have done none at all against our people or the practices of our fathers , I was delivered as a prisoner from Yerushalayim into the hands of the Romans ,
44028018	who , when they had examined me , intended to let me go , because there was no cause for putting me to death .
44028019	“ But the Yehuḏim spoke against it , and I was compelled to appeal to Caesar , not that I had any accusation against my nation .
44028020	“ This therefore is the reason I called for you , to see you and speak with you . It is because of the expectation of Yisra’ĕl that I am bound with this chain . ”
44028021	And they said to him , “ We neither received letters from Yehuḏah concerning you , nor have any of the brothers who came reported or spoken whatever wicked about you .
44028022	“ And we think it right to hear from you what you think , for indeed , concerning this sect , we know that it is spoken against everywhere . ”
44028023	And having appointed him a day , many came to him where he was staying , to whom he was explaining , earnestly witnessing about the reign of Elohim , and persuading them concerning יהושע from both the Torah of Mosheh and the Prophets , from morning until evening .
44028024	And some indeed were persuaded by what was said , but some believed not .
44028025	And disagreeing with one another , they began to leave , after Sha’ul had spoken one word , “ The Set-apart Spirit rightly spoke through Yeshayahu the prophet to our fathers ,
44028026	saying , ‘ Go to this people and say , “ Hearing you shall hear but by no means understand , and seeing you shall see but by no means perceive ,
44028027	for the heart of this people has become thickened , and with their ears they heard heavily , and they have closed their eyes , lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears , and understand with their heart , and turn back , and I should heal them . ” ’
44028028	“ Therefore let it be known to you that the deliverance of Elohim has been sent to the gentiles , and they shall hear ! ”
44028029	And when he had said these words , the Yehuḏim went away and had a great dispute among themselves .
44028030	And Sha’ul stayed two entire years in his own rented house , and was receiving all who came to him ,
44028031	proclaiming the reign of Elohim and teaching about the Master יהושע Messiah with all boldness , unhindered .
45001001	Sha’ul , a servant of יהושע Messiah , a called emissary , separated to the Good News of Elohim ,
45001002	which He promised before through His prophets in the Set-apart Scriptures ,
45001003	concerning His Son , who came of the seed of Dawiḏ according to the flesh ,
45001004	who was designated Son of Elohim with power , according to the Set-apart Spirit , by the resurrection from the dead : יהושע Messiah , the Master of us ,
45001005	through whom we have received favour and office of the emissary for belief-obedience among all the nations on behalf of His Name ,
45001006	among whom you also are the called ones of יהושע Messiah .
45001007	To all who are in Rome , beloved of Elohim , called , set-apart ones : Favour to you and peace from Elohim our Father and the Master יהושע Messiah .
45001008	First , I truly thank my Elohim through יהושע Messiah for you all , that your belief is spoken of in all the world .
45001009	For Elohim is my witness , whom I serve with my spirit in the Good News of His Son , how unceasingly I make mention of you ,
45001010	always asking in my prayers , if at all possible , I shall be blessed by the desire of Elohim , to come to you .
45001011	For I long to see you , so as to impart some spiritual gift to you , for you to be established ,
45001012	and that is , to be encouraged together among you , each by the other’s belief – both yours and mine .
45001013	And I do not wish you to be unaware , brothers , that I often purposed to come to you , but was hindered until now , in order to have some fruit among you , as also among the other gentiles .
45001014	I am a debtor both to Greeks and to foreigners , both to wise and to foolish .
45001015	That is why I am so eager to bring the Good News also to you who are in Rome .
45001016	For I am not ashamed of the Good News of Messiah , for it is the power of Elohim for deliverance to everyone who believes , to the Yehuḏite first and also to the Greek .
45001017	For in it the righteousness of Elohim is revealed from belief to belief , as it has been written , “ But the righteous shall live by belief . ”
45001018	For the wrath of Elohim is revealed from heaven against all wickedness and unrighteousness of men , who suppress the truth in unrighteousness ,
45001019	because that which is known of Elohim is manifest among them , for Elohim has manifested it to them .
45001020	For since the creation of the world His invisible qualities have been clearly seen , being understood from what has been made , both His everlasting power and Mightiness , for them to be without excuse ,
45001021	because , although they knew Elohim , they did not esteem Him as Elohim , nor gave thanks , but became vain in their reasonings , and their undiscerning heart was darkened .
45001022	Claiming to be wise , they became fools ,
45001023	and changed the esteem of the incorruptible Elohim into the likeness of an image of corruptible man , and of birds and of four-footed beasts and of reptiles .
45001024	Therefore Elohim gave them up to uncleanness in the lust of their hearts , to disrespect their bodies among themselves ,
45001025	who changed the truth of Elohim into the falsehood , and worshipped and served what was created rather than the Creator , who is blessed forever . Amĕn .
45001026	Because of this Elohim gave them over to degrading passions . For even their women exchanged natural relations for what is against nature ,
45001027	and likewise , the men also , having left natural relations with woman , burned in their lust for one another , men with men committing indecency , and receiving back the reward which was due for their straying .
45001028	And even as they did not think it worth- while to possess the knowledge of Elohim , Elohim gave them over to a worthless mind , to do what is improper ,
45001029	having been filled with all unrighteousness , whoring , wickedness , greed , evil ; filled with envy , murder , fighting , deceit , evil habits ; whisperers ,
45001030	slanderers , haters of Elohim , insolent , proud , boasters , devisers of evils , disobedient to parents ,
45001031	without discernment , covenant breakers , unloving , unforgiving , ruthless ;
45001032	who , though they know the righteousness of Elohim , that those who practise such deserve death , not only do the same but also approve of those who practise them .
45002001	Therefore , O man , you are without excuse , everyone who judges , for in which you judge another you condemn yourself , since you who judge practise the same wrongs .
45002002	And we know that the judgment of Elohim is according to truth against those who practise such wrongs .
45002003	And do you think , O man , you who judge those practising such wrongs , and doing the same , that you shall escape the judgment of Elohim ?
45002004	Or do you despise the riches of His kindness , and tolerance , and patience , not knowing that the kindness of Elohim leads you to repentance ?
45002005	But according to your hardness and your unrepentant heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of Elohim ,
45002006	who “ shall render to each one according to his works ” :
45002007	everlasting life to those who by persistence in good work seek for esteem , and respect , and incorruptibility ;
45002008	but wrath and displeasure to those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth , but obey unrighteousness ;
45002009	affliction and distress on every human being working what is evil , of the Yehuḏite first , and also of the Greek ;
45002010	but esteem , respect , and peace to everyone working what is good , to the Yehuḏite first and also to the Greek .
45002011	For there is no partiality with Elohim .
45002012	For as many as sinned without Torah shall also perish without Torah , and as many as sinned in the Torah shall be judged by the Torah .
45002013	For not the hearers of the Torah are righteous in the sight of Elohim , but the doers of the law shall be declared right .
45002014	For when gentiles , who do not have the Torah , by nature do what is in the Torah , although not having the Torah , they are a Torah to themselves ,
45002015	who show the work of the Torah written in their hearts , their conscience also bearing witness , and between themselves their thoughts accusing or even excusing ,
45002016	in the day when Elohim shall judge the secrets of men through יהושע Messiah , according to my Good News .
45002017	See , you are called a Yehuḏite , and rest on the Torah , and make your boast in Elohim ,
45002018	and know the desire of Elohim , and approve what is superior , being instructed out of the Torah ,
45002019	and are trusting that you yourself are a guide to the blind , a light to those who are in darkness ,
45002020	an instructor of foolish ones , a teacher of babes , having the form of knowledge and of the truth in the Torah .
45002021	You , then , who teach another , do you not teach yourself ? You who proclaim that a man should not steal , do you steal ?
45002022	You who say , “ Do not commit adultery , ” do you commit adultery ? You who abominate idols , do you rob temples ?
45002023	You who make your boast in the Torah , through the transgression of the Torah do you disrespect Elohim ?
45002024	For “ The Name of Elohim is blasphemed among the gentiles because of you , ” as it has been written .
45002025	For circumcision indeed profits if you practise the Torah , but if you are a transgressor of the Torah , your circumcision has become uncircumcision .
45002026	So , if an uncircumcised one watches over the righteousnesses of the Torah , shall not his uncircumcision be reckoned as circumcision ?
45002027	And the uncircumcised by nature , who perfects the Torah , shall judge you who notwithstanding letter and circumcision are a transgressor of the Torah !
45002028	For he is not a Yehuḏite who is so outwardly , neither is circumcision that which is outward in the flesh .
45002029	But a Yehuḏite is he who is so inwardly , and circumcision is that of the heart , in Spirit , not literally , whose praise is not from men but from Elohim .
45003001	What then is the advantage of the Yehuḏite , or what is the value of the circumcision ?
45003002	Much in every way ! Because firstly indeed , that they were entrusted with the Words of Elohim .
45003003	For what if some did not believe ? Shall their unbelief nullify the trustworthiness of Elohim ?
45003004	Let it not be ! But let Elohim be true , and every man a liar , as it has been written , “ That You should be declared right in Your words , and prevail in Your judging . ”
45003005	But if our unrighteousness establishes the righteousness of Elohim , what shall we say ? Is Elohim unrighteous who is inflicting wrath ? I speak as a man .
45003006	Let it not be ! Otherwise how shall Elohim judge the world ?
45003007	For if the truth of Elohim has increased through my lie , to His esteem , why am I also still judged as a sinner ?
45003008	And why not say , “ Let us do evil so that the good might come ” ? – as we are wrongly accused and as some claim that we say . Their judgment is in the right .
45003009	What then ? Are we better than they ? Not at all , for we have previously accused both Yehuḏim and Greeks that they are all under sin .
45003010	As it has been written , “ There is none righteous , no , not one !
45003011	“ There is no one who is understanding , there is none who is seeking Elohim .
45003012	“ They all have turned aside , they have together become worthless . There is none who does good , no , not one . ”
45003013	“ Their throat is an open tomb , with their tongues they have deceived , ” “ The poison of adders is under their lips , ”
45003014	“ Whose mouth is filled with cursing and bitterness . ”
45003015	“ Their feet are swift to shed blood ,
45003016	ruin and wretchedness are in their ways ,
45003017	and the way of peace they have not known . ”
45003018	“ There is no fear of Elohim before their eyes . ”
45003019	And we know that whatever the Torah says , it says to those who are in the Torah , so that every mouth might be stopped , and all the world come under judgment before Elohim .
45003020	Therefore by works of Torah no flesh shall be declared right before Him , for by the Torah is the knowledge of sin .
45003021	But now , apart from the Torah , a righteousness of Elohim has been revealed , being witnessed by the Torah and the Prophets ,
45003022	and the righteousness of Elohim is through belief in יהושע Messiah to all and on all who believe . For there is no difference ,
45003023	for all have sinned and fall short of the esteem of Elohim ,
45003024	being declared right , without paying , by His favour through the redemption which is in Messiah יהושע ,
45003025	whom Elohim set forth as an atonement , through belief in His blood , to demonstrate His righteousness , because in His tolerance Elohim had passed over the sins that had taken place before ,
45003026	to demonstrate at the present time His righteousness , that He is righteous and declares righteous the one who has belief in יהושע .
45003027	Where , then , is the boasting ? It is shut out . By what Torah ? Of works ? No , but by the Torah of belief .
45003028	For we reckon that a man is declared right by belief without works of Torah .
45003029	Or is He the Elohim of the Yehuḏim only , and not also of the gentiles ? Yea , of the gentiles also ,
45003030	since it is one Elohim who shall declare right the circumcised by belief and the uncircumcised through belief .
45003031	Do we then nullify the Torah through the belief ? Let it not be ! On the contrary , we establish the Torah .
45004001	What , then , shall we say Aḇraham our father , to have found , according to the flesh ?
45004002	For if Aḇraham was declared right by works , he has ground for boasting , but not before Elohim .
45004003	For what does the Scripture say ? “ Aḇraham believed Elohim , and it was reckoned to him for righteousness . ”
45004004	And to him who is working , the reward is not reckoned as a favour but as a debt .
45004005	And to him who is not working but believes on Him who is declaring right the wicked , his belief is reckoned for righteousness ,
45004006	even as Dawiḏ also says of the blessedness of the man to whom Elohim reckons righteousness without works :
45004007	“ Blessed are those whose lawlessnesses are forgiven , and whose sins are covered ,
45004008	blessed is the man to whom יהוה shall by no means reckon sin . ”
45004009	Is this blessing then upon the circumcised only , or also upon the uncircumcised ? For we affirm : Belief was reckoned unto Aḇraham for righteousness .
45004010	How then was it reckoned ? Being in circumcision , or in uncircumcision ? Not in circumcision , but in uncircumcision .
45004011	And he received the sign of circumcision , a seal of the righteousness of the belief while in uncircumcision , for him to be a father of all those believing through uncircumcision , for righteousness to be reckoned to them also ,
45004012	and the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision , but who also walk in the steps of the belief which our father Aḇraham had in uncircumcision .
45004013	For the promise that he should be the heir of the world , was not to Aḇraham or to his seed through the Torah , but through a righteousness of belief .
45004014	For if those who are of the Torah are heirs , belief has been made useless , and the promise has been nullified ,
45004015	for the Torah works out wrath , for where there is no Torah there is no transgression .
45004016	On account of this it is of belief , that it be according to favour , for the promise to be made certain to all the seed , not only to those who are of the Torah , but also to those who are of the belief of Aḇraham , who is father of us all –
45004017	as it has been written , “ I have made you a father of many nations ” – in the presence of Him whom he believed , even Elohim , who gives life to the dead and calls that which does not exist as existing ,
45004018	who against all expectation did believe , in expectation , so that he should become father of many nations , according to what was said , “ So shall your seed be . ”
45004019	And not having grown weak in belief , he did not consider his own body , already dead , being about a hundred years old , and the deadness of Sarah’s womb ,
45004020	he did not hesitate about the promise of Elohim through unbelief , but was strengthened in belief , giving esteem to Elohim ,
45004021	and being completely persuaded that what He had promised He was also able to do .
45004022	Therefore also “ it was reckoned to him for righteousness . ”
45004023	And not because of him alone was it written that it was reckoned to him ,
45004024	but also because of us , to whom it shall be reckoned , to us who believe in Him who raised up יהושע our Master from the dead ,
45004025	who was delivered up because of our trespasses , and was raised for us to be declared right .
45005001	Therefore , having been declared right by belief , we have peace with Elohim through our Master יהושע Messiah ,
45005002	through whom also we have access by belief into this favour in which we stand , and we exult in the expectation of the esteem of Elohim .
45005003	And not only this , but we also exult in pressures , knowing that pressure works endurance ;
45005004	and endurance , approvedness ; and approvedness , expectation .
45005005	And expectation does not disappoint , because the love of Elohim has been poured out in our hearts by the Set-apart Spirit which was given to us .
45005006	For when we were still weak , Messiah in due time died for the wicked .
45005007	For one shall hardly die for a righteous one , though possibly for a good one someone would even have the courage to die .
45005008	But Elohim proves His own love for us , in that while we were still sinners , Messiah died for us .
45005009	Much more then , having now been declared right by His blood , we shall be saved from wrath through Him .
45005010	For if , being enemies , we were restored to favour with Elohim through the death of His Son , much more , having been restored to favour , we shall be saved by His life .
45005011	And not only this , but we also exult in Elohim through our Master יהושע Messiah , through whom we have now received the restoration to favour .
45005012	For this reason , even as through one man sin did enter into the world , and death through sin , and thus death spread to all men , because all sinned –
45005013	for until the Torah , sin was in the world , but sin is not reckoned when there is no Torah .
45005014	But death reigned from Aḏam until Mosheh , even over those who had not sinned according to the likeness of the transgression of Aḏam , who is a type of Him who was to come .
45005015	But the favourable gift is not like the trespass . For if by the one man’s trespass many died , much more the favour of Elohim , and the gift in favour of the one Man , יהושע Messiah , overflowed to many .
45005016	And the favourable gift is not as by one having sinned . For indeed the judgment was of one to condemnation , but the favourable gift is of many trespasses unto righteousness .
45005017	For if by the trespass of the one , death did reign through the one , much more those who receive the overflowing favour and the gift of righteousness shall reign in life through the One , יהושע Messiah .
45005018	So then , as through one trespass there resulted condemnation to all men , so also through one righteous act there resulted righteous-declaring of life to all men .
45005019	For as through the disobedience of one man many were made sinners , so also through the obedience of the One many shall be made righteous .
45005020	And the Torah came in beside , so that the trespass would increase . But where sin increased , favour increased still more ,
45005021	so that as sin did reign in death , even so favour might reign through righteousness to everlasting life through יהושע Messiah our Master .
45006001	What , then , shall we say ? Shall we continue in sin , to let favour increase ?
45006002	Let it not be ! How shall we who died to sin still live in it ?
45006003	Or do you not know that as many of us as were immersed into Messiah יהושע were immersed into His death ?
45006004	We were therefore buried with Him through immersion into death , that as Messiah was raised from the dead by the esteem of the Father , so also we should walk in newness of life .
45006005	For if we have come to be grown together in the likeness of His death , we shall be also of the resurrection ,
45006006	knowing this , that our old man was impaled with Him , so that the body of sin might be rendered powerless , to serve sin no longer .
45006007	For he who has died has been made right from sin .
45006008	And if we died with Messiah , we believe that we shall also live with Him ,
45006009	knowing that Messiah , having been raised from the dead , dies no more – death no longer rules over Him .
45006010	For in that He died , He died to sin once for all ; but in that He lives , He lives to Elohim .
45006011	So you also , reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin , but alive to Elohim in Messiah יהושע our Master .
45006012	Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body , to obey it in its desires ,
45006013	neither present your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin , but present yourselves to Elohim as being alive from the dead , and your members as instruments of righteousness to Elohim .
45006014	For sin shall not rule over you , for you are not under the law but under favour .
45006015	What then ? Shall we sin because we are not under Torah but under favour ? Let it not be !
45006016	Do you not know that to whom you present yourselves servants for obedience , you are servants of the one whom you obey , whether of sin to death , or of obedience to righteousness ?
45006017	But thanks to Elohim that you were servants of sin , yet you obeyed from the heart that form of teaching to which you were entrusted .
45006018	And having been set free from sin , you became servants of righteousness .
45006019	I speak as a man , because of the weakness of your flesh . For even as you did present your members as servants of uncleanness , and of lawlessness resulting in lawlessness , so now present your members as servants of righteousness resulting in set-apartness .
45006020	For when you were servants of sin , you were free from righteousness .
45006021	What fruit , therefore , were you having then , over which you are now ashamed ? For the end thereof is death .
45006022	But now , having been set free from sin , and having become servants of Elohim , you have your fruit resulting in set-apartness , and the end , everlasting life .
45006023	For the wages of sin is death , but the favourable gift of Elohim is everlasting life in Messiah יהושע our Master .
45007001	Or do you not know , brothers – for I speak to those knowing the Torah – that the Torah rules over a man as long as he lives ?
45007002	For the married woman has been bound by Torah to the living husband , but if the husband dies , she is released from the Torah concerning her husband .
45007003	So then , while her husband lives , she shall be called an adulteress if she becomes another man’s . But if her husband dies , she is free from that part of the Torah , so that she is not an adulteress , having become another man’s .
45007004	So my brothers , you also were put to death to the Torah through the body of Messiah , for you to become another’s , the One who was raised from the dead , that we should bear fruit to Elohim .
45007005	For when we were in the flesh , the passions of sins , through the Torah , were working in our members to bear fruit to death .
45007006	But now we have been released from the Torah , having died to what we were held by , so that we should serve in newness of Spirit and not in oldness of letter .
45007007	What , then , shall we say ? Is the Torah sin ? Let it not be ! However , I did not know sin except through the Torah . For also the covetousness I knew not if the Torah had not said , “ You shall not covet . ”
45007008	But sin , having taken the occasion through the command , did work in me all sorts of covetousness . For apart from Torah sin is dead .
45007009	And I was alive apart from the Torah once , but when the command came , the sin revived , and I died .
45007010	And the command which was to result in life , this I found to result in death .
45007011	For sin , having taken the occasion through the command , deceived me , and through it killed me .
45007012	So that the Torah truly is set-apart , and the command set-apart , and righteous , and good .
45007013	Therefore , has that which is good become death to me ? Let it not be ! But the sin , that sin might be manifest , was working death in me through what is good , so that sin through the command might become an exceedingly great Sinner .
45007014	For we know that the Torah is Spiritual , but I am fleshly , sold under sin .
45007015	For what I work , I know not . For what I wish , that I do not practise , but what I hate , that I do .
45007016	But if I do what I do not wish , I agree with the Torah that it is good .
45007017	And now , it is no longer I that work it , but the sin dwelling in me .
45007018	For I know that in me , that is in my flesh , dwells no good . For to wish is present with me , but to work the good I do not find .
45007019	For the good that I wish to do , I do not do ; but the evil I do not wish to do , this I practise .
45007020	And if I do that which I do not wish , it is no longer I who work it , but the sin dwelling in me .
45007021	I find therefore this law , that when I wish to do the good , that the evil is present with me .
45007022	For I delight in the Torah of Elohim according to the inward man ,
45007023	but I see another law in my members , battling against the Torah of my mind , and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members .
45007024	Wretched man that I am ! Who shall deliver me from this body of death ?
45007025	Thanks to Elohim , through יהושע Messiah our Master ! So then , with the mind I myself truly serve the Torah of Elohim , but with the flesh the law of sin .
45008001	There is , then , now no condemnation to those who are in Messiah יהושע , who do not walk according to the flesh , but according to the Spirit .
45008002	For the Torah of the Spirit of the life in Messiah יהושע has set me free from the law of sin and of death .
45008003	For the Torah being powerless , in that it was weak through the flesh , Elohim , having His own Son in the likeness of flesh of sin , and concerning sin , condemned sin in the flesh ,
45008004	so that the righteousness of the Torah should be completed in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit .
45008005	For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the matters of the flesh , but those who live according to the Spirit , the matters of the Spirit .
45008006	For the mind of the flesh is death , but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace .
45008007	Because the mind of the flesh is enmity towards Elohim , for it does not subject itself to the Torah of Elohim , neither indeed is it able ,
45008008	and those who are in the flesh are unable to please Elohim .
45008009	But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit , if indeed the Spirit of Elohim dwells in you . And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Messiah , this one is not His .
45008010	And if Messiah is in you , the body is truly dead on account of sin , but the Spirit is life on account of righteousness .
45008011	And if the Spirit of Him who raised יהושע from the dead dwells in you , He who raised Messiah from the dead shall also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit dwelling in you .
45008012	So then , brothers , we are not debtors to the flesh , to live according to the flesh .
45008013	For if you live according to the flesh , you are going to die ; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body , you shall live .
45008014	For as many as are led by the Spirit of Elohim , these are sons of Elohim .
45008015	For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear , but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out , “ Abba , Father . ”
45008016	The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of Elohim ,
45008017	and if children , also heirs – truly heirs of Elohim , and co-heirs with Messiah , if indeed we suffer with Him , in order that we also be exalted together .
45008018	For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the esteem that is to be revealed in us .
45008019	For the intense longing of the creation eagerly waits for the revealing of the sons of Elohim .
45008020	For the creation was subjected to futility , not from choice , but because of Him who subjected it , in anticipation ,
45008021	that the creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage to corruption into the esteemed freedom of the children of Elohim .
45008022	For we know that all the creation groans together , and suffers the pains of childbirth together until now .
45008023	And not only so , but even we ourselves who have the first-fruits of the Spirit , we ourselves also groan within ourselves , eagerly waiting for the adoption , the redemption of our body .
45008024	For in this expectation we were saved , but expectation that is seen is not expectation , for when anyone sees , does he expect it ?
45008025	And if we expect what we do not see , we eagerly wait for it with endurance .
45008026	And in the same way the Spirit does help in our weaknesses . For we do not know what we should pray , but the Spirit Himself pleads our case for us with groanings unutterable .
45008027	And He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is , because He makes intercession for the set-apart ones according to Elohim .
45008028	And we know that all matters work together for good to those who love Elohim , to those who are called according to His purpose .
45008029	Because those whom He knew beforehand , He also ordained beforehand to be conformed to the likeness of His Son , for Him to be the first-born among many brothers .
45008030	And whom He ordained beforehand , these He also called , and whom He called , these He also declared right . And whom He declared right , these He also esteemed .
45008031	What then shall we say to this ? If Elohim is for us , who is against us ?
45008032	Truly , He who did not spare His own Son , but delivered Him up on behalf of us all – how shall He not , along with Him , freely give us all else ?
45008033	Who shall bring any charge against Elohim’s chosen ones ? It is Elohim who is declaring right .
45008034	Who is he who is condemning ? It is Messiah who died , and furthermore is also raised up , who is also at the right hand of Elohim , who also makes intercession for us .
45008035	Who shall separate us from the love of the Messiah ? Shall pressure , or distress , or persecution , or scarcity of food , or nakedness , or danger , or sword ?
45008036	As it has been written , “ For Your sake we are killed all day long , we are reckoned as sheep of slaughter . ”
45008037	But in all this we are more than overcomers through Him who loved us .
45008038	For I am persuaded that neither death nor life , nor messengers nor principalities nor powers , neither the present nor the future ,
45008039	nor height nor depth , nor any other creature , shall be able to separate us from the love of Elohim which is in Messiah יהושע our Master .
45009001	I speak the truth in Messiah , I do not lie , my conscience also bearing me witness in the Set-apart Spirit ,
45009002	that I have great sadness and continual grief in my heart .
45009003	For I myself could have wished to be banished from Messiah for the sake of my brothers , my relatives according to the flesh ,
45009004	who are Yisra’ĕlites , whose is the adoption , and the esteem , and the covenants , and the giving of the Torah , and the worship , and the promises ,
45009005	whose are the fathers , and from whom is the Messiah according to the flesh , who is over all , Elohim-blessed forever . Amĕn .
45009006	However , it is not as though the word of Elohim has failed . For they are not all Yisra’ĕl who are of Yisra’ĕl ,
45009007	neither are they all children because they are the seed of Aḇraham , but , “ In Yitsḥaq your seed shall be called . ”
45009008	That is , those who are the children of the flesh , these are not the children of Elohim , but the children of the promise are reckoned as the seed .
45009009	For this is the word of promise , “ At this time I shall come and Sarah shall have a son . ”
45009010	And not only so , but Riḇqah having conceived by one , our father Yitsḥaq .
45009011	Yet , before they were born or had done any good or evil – in order that the purpose of Elohim , according to choice , might stand , not of works but of Him who calls –
45009012	it was said to her , “ The greater shall serve the lesser , ”
45009013	as it has been written , “ Ya‛aqoḇ I have loved , but Ěsaw I have hated . ”
45009014	What , then , shall we say ? Is there unrighteousness with Elohim ? Let it not be !
45009015	For He says to Mosheh , “ I shall favour whomever I favour , and I shall have compassion on whomever I have compassion . ”
45009016	So , then , it is not of him who is wishing , nor of him who is running , but of Elohim who shows favour .
45009017	For the Scripture says to Pharaoh , “ For this same purpose I have raised you up , to show My power in you , and that My Name be declared in all the earth . ”
45009018	So , then , He favours whom He wishes , and He hardens whom He wishes .
45009019	Then you shall say to me , “ Why does He still find fault ? For who has resisted His counsel ? ”
45009020	But who are you , O man , to talk back to Elohim ? Shall that which is formed say to him who formed it , “ Why have you made me like this ? ”
45009021	Does not the potter have authority over the clay , from the same lump to make one vessel for value and another not for value ?
45009022	And if Elohim , desiring to show wrath , and to make His power known , with much patience tolerated the vessels of wrath prepared for destruction ,
45009023	and that He might make known the riches of His esteem on vessels of compassion , which He had prepared beforehand for esteem ,
45009024	even whom He called , not only us of the Yehuḏim , but also of the gentiles ?
45009025	As He says in Hoshĕa too , “ I shall call them My people , who were not My people , and her beloved , who was not beloved . ”
45009026	“ And it shall be in the place where it was said to them , ‘ You are not My people , ’ there they shall be called sons of the living Elohim . ”
45009027	And Yeshayahu cries out on behalf of Yisra’ĕl , “ Though the number of the children of Yisra’ĕl be as the sand of the sea , the remnant shall be saved .
45009028	For He is bringing a matter to an end , and is cutting it short in righteousness , because יהוה shall cut short a matter on the earth . ”
45009029	And as Yeshayahu said before , “ If יהוה of hosts had not left us a seed , we would have become like Seḏom , and we would have been made like Amorah . ”
45009030	What shall we say then ? That gentiles not following after righteousness , have obtained righteousness , even the righteousness of belief ,
45009031	but Yisra’ĕl following after the Torah of righteousness , has not arrived at the Torah of righteousness .
45009032	Why ? Because it was not of belief , but as by works of Torah . For they stumbled at the Stone of stumbling .
45009033	As it has been written , “ See , I lay in Tsiyon a Stone of stumbling and a Rock that makes for falling , and everyone who is believing on Him shall not be put to shame . ”
45010001	Truly brothers , my heart’s desire and prayer to Elohim for Yisra’ĕl is for deliverance .
45010002	For I bear them witness that they have an ardour for Elohim , but not according to knowledge .
45010003	For not knowing the righteousness of Elohim , and seeking to establish their own righteousness , they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of Elohim .
45010004	For Messiah is the goal of the ‘ Torah unto righteousness’to everyone who believes .
45010005	For Mosheh writes about the righteousness which is of the Torah , “ The man who does these shall live by them . ”
45010006	But the righteousness of belief speaks in this way , “ Do not say in your heart , ‘ Who shall ascend into the heavens ? ’ ” – that is , to bring Messiah down ; or ,
45010007	“ ‘ Who shall descend into the abyss ? ’ ” – that is , to bring Messiah up from the dead .
45010008	But what does it say ? “ The word is near you , in your mouth and in your heart ” – that is , the word of belief which we are proclaiming :
45010009	That if you confess with your mouth the Master יהושע and believe in your heart that Elohim has raised Him from the dead , you shall be saved .
45010010	For with the heart one believes unto righteousness , and one confesses with the mouth , and so is saved .
45010011	Because the Scripture says , “ Whoever puts his trust in Him shall not be put to shame . ”
45010012	Because there is no distinction between Yehuḏite and Greek , for the same Master of all is rich to all those calling upon Him .
45010013	For “ everyone who calls on the Name of יהוה shall be saved . ”
45010014	How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed ? And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard ? And how shall they hear without one proclaiming ?
45010015	And how shall they proclaim if they are not sent ? As it has been written , “ How pleasant are the feet of those who bring the Good News of peace , who bring the Good News of the good ! ”
45010016	However , not all obeyed the Good News . For Yeshayahu says , “ יהוה , who has believed our report ? ”
45010017	So then belief comes by hearing , and hearing by the word of Elohim .
45010018	But I ask , Did they not hear ? Yea indeed , “ Their voice went out to all the earth , and their words to the ends of the world . ”
45010019	But I ask , Did Yisra’ĕl not know ? First Mosheh says , “ I shall provoke you to jealousy by those who are not a nation , I shall enrage you by an unwise nation . ”
45010020	And Yeshayahu boldly says , “ I was found by those not seeking Me , I was made manifest to those not asking for Me . ”
45010021	And to Yisra’ĕl He says , “ All day long I have stretched out My hands to a disobedient and back-talking people . ”
45011001	I say then , has Elohim rejected His people ? Let it not be ! For I also am a Yisra’ĕlite , of the seed of Aḇraham , of the tribe of Binyamin .
45011002	Elohim has not rejected His people whom He knew beforehand . Or do you not know what the Scripture says of Ěliyahu , how he pleads with Elohim against Yisra’ĕl , saying ,
45011003	“ יהוה , they have killed Your prophets and overthrown Your altars , and I alone am left , and they seek my life ” ?
45011004	But what does the answer of Elohim say to him ? “ I have left for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Ba‛al . ”
45011005	So therefore also , at this present time a remnant according to the choice of favour has come to be .
45011006	And if by favour , it is no longer of works , otherwise favour is no longer favour . And if it is of works , it is no longer favour , otherwise work is no longer work .
45011007	What then ? Yisra’ĕl has not obtained what it seeks , but the chosen did obtain it , and the rest were hardened .
45011008	As it has been written , “ יהוה has given them a spirit of deep sleep , eyes not to see and ears not to hear , unto this day . ”
45011009	Dawiḏ also says , “ Let their table become for a snare , and for a trap , and for a stumbling-block and a recompense to them ,
45011010	let their eyes be darkened , not to see , and bow down their back always . ”
45011011	I say then , have they stumbled that they should fall ? Let it not be ! But by their fall deliverance has come to the gentiles , to provoke them to jealousy .
45011012	And if their fall is riches for the world , and their failure riches for the gentiles , how much more their completeness !
45011013	For I speak to you , the gentiles , inasmuch as I am an emissary to the gentiles , I esteem my service ,
45011014	if somehow I might provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh and save some of them .
45011015	For if their casting away is the restoration to favour of the world , what is their acceptance but life from the dead ?
45011016	Now if the first-fruit is set-apart , the lump is also . And if the root is set-apart , so are the branches .
45011017	And if some of the branches were broken off , and you , being a wild olive tree , have been grafted in among them , and came to share the root and fatness of the olive tree ,
45011018	do not boast against the branches . And if you boast , remember : you do not bear the root , but the root bears you !
45011019	You shall say then , “ The branches were broken off that I might be grafted in . ”
45011020	Good ! By unbelief they were broken off , and you stand by belief . Do not be arrogant , but fear .
45011021	For if Elohim did not spare the natural branches , He might not spare you either .
45011022	See then the kindness and sharpness of Elohim : on those who fell sharpness , but toward you kindness , if you continue in His kindness , otherwise you also shall be cut off .
45011023	And they also , if they do not continue in unbelief , shall be grafted in , for Elohim is able to graft them in again .
45011024	For if you were cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature , and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree , how much more shall these who are the natural branches , be grafted into their own olive tree ?
45011025	For I do not wish you to be ignorant of this secret , brothers , lest you should be wise in your own estimation , that hardening in part has come over Yisra’ĕl , until the completeness of the gentiles has come in .
45011026	And so all Yisra’ĕl shall be saved , as it has been written , “ The Deliverer shall come out of Tsiyon , and He shall turn away wickedness from Ya‛aqoḇ ,
45011027	and this is My covenant with them , when I take away their sins . ”
45011028	Truly , as regards the Good News they are enemies for your sake , but concerning the choice they are beloved for the sake of the fathers .
45011029	For the gifts and the calling of Elohim are not to be repented of .
45011030	For as you also at one time disobeyed Elohim , but now have obtained compassion through their disobedience ,
45011031	so also these have now disobeyed , that through the compassion shown you they also might obtain compassion .
45011032	For Elohim has shut them all up to disobedience , in order to have compassion on all .
45011033	Oh , the depth of riches , and wisdom and knowledge of Elohim ! How unsearchable His judgments and untraceable His ways !
45011034	“ For who has known the mind of יהוה ? Or who has become His counsellor ? ”
45011035	“ Or who first gave to Him , and it shall be given back to him ? ”
45011036	Because of Him , and through Him , and to Him , are all , to whom be esteem forever . Amĕn .
45012001	I call upon you , therefore , brothers , through the compassion of Elohim , to present your bodies a living offering – set-apart , well-pleasing to Elohim – your reasonable worship .
45012002	And do not be conformed to this world , but be transformed by the renewing of your mind , so that you prove what is that good and well-pleasing and perfect desire of Elohim .
45012003	For I say , through the favour which has been given to me , to everyone who is among you , not to think of himself more highly than he should think , but to think soberly , as Elohim has given to each a measure of belief .
45012004	For as we have many members in one body , but all members do not have the same function ,
45012005	so we , the many , are one body in Messiah , and members each one of one another .
45012006	Now having different gifts , according to the favour which was given to us , let us use them accordingly : if prophecy , according to the proportion of belief ;
45012007	if serving , in the serving ; or he who is teaching , in the teaching ;
45012008	or he who encourages , in the encouragement ; or he who is sharing , in sincerity ; he who is leading , in diligence ; he who shows compassion , joyously .
45012009	Let love be without hypocrisy . Shrink from what is wicked , cling to what is good .
45012010	In brotherly love , tenderly loving towards one another , in appreciation , giving preference to each other ;
45012011	not idle in duty , ardent in spirit , serving the Master ;
45012012	rejoicing in the expectancy , enduring under pressure , continuing steadfastly in prayer ;
45012013	imparting to the needs of the set-apart ones , pursuing kindness towards strangers .
45012014	Bless those who persecute you – bless and do not curse .
45012015	Rejoice with those who rejoice , and weep with those who weep .
45012016	Be of the same mind toward one another . Do not be proud in mind , but go along with the lowly . Do not be wise in your own estimation .
45012017	Repay no one evil for evil . Respect what is right in the sight of all men .
45012018	If possible , on your part , be at peace with all men .
45012019	Beloved , do not revenge yourselves , but give place to the wrath , for it has been written , “ Vengeance is Mine , I shall repay , ” says יהוה .
45012020	“ Instead , if your enemy hungers , feed him ; if he thirsts , give him a drink , for in so doing you shall heap coals of fire on his head . ”
45012021	Do not be overcome by evil , but overcome evil with good .
45013001	Let every being be in subjection to the governing authorities . For there is no authority except from Elohim , and the authorities that exist are appointed by Elohim .
45013002	So he who opposes the authority withstands the institution of Elohim , and those who withstand shall bring judgment on themselves .
45013003	For those ruling are an object of fear , not to good works , but to evil . Do you wish to be not afraid of the authority ? Do the good , and you shall have praise from it ,
45013004	for it is a servant of Elohim to you for good . But if you do evil , be afraid , for it does not bear the sword in vain . For it is a servant of Elohim , a revenger to execute wrath on him who practises evil .
45013005	Therefore , it is necessary to be subject , not only because of wrath but also because of the conscience .
45013006	For because of this you also pay taxes , for they are servants of Elohim attending continually to these duties .
45013007	Render therefore to all what is due to them : tax to whom tax is due , toll to whom toll , fear to whom fear , respect to whom respect .
45013008	Owe no one any matter except to love one another , for he who loves another has filled the Torah .
45013009	For this , “ You shall not commit adultery , ” “ You shall not murder , ” “ You shall not steal , ” “ You shall not bear false witness , ” “ You shall not covet , ” and if there is any other command , is summed up in this word , “ You shall love your neighbour as yourself . ”
45013010	Love does no evil to a neighbour . Therefore , love is completion of the Torah .
45013011	And do this , knowing the time , that it is already the hour for us to wake up from sleep , for now our deliverance is nearer than when we did believe .
45013012	The night is far advanced , the day has come near . So let us put off the works of darkness , and let us put on the armour of light .
45013013	Let us walk becomingly , as in the day , not in wild parties and drunkenness , not in living together and indecencies , not in fighting and envy ,
45013014	but put on the Master יהושע Messiah , and make no provision for the lusts of the flesh .
45014001	And receive him who is weak in the belief , not criticising his thoughts .
45014002	One indeed believes to eat all food , but he who is weak eats only vegetables .
45014003	He that eats , let him not despise him who does not eat , and he that does not eat , let him not judge him who eats , for Elohim received him .
45014004	Who are you that judges another’s servant ? To his own master he stands or falls . But he shall be made to stand , for Elohim is able to make him stand .
45014005	One indeed judges one day above another , another judges every day alike . Let each one be completely persuaded in his own mind .
45014006	He who minds the day , minds it to יהוה . And he who does not mind the day , to יהוה he does not mind it . He who eats , eats to יהוה , for he gives Elohim thanks . And he who does not eat , to יהוה he does not eat , and gives Elohim thanks .
45014007	For not one of us lives to himself , and not one dies to himself .
45014008	For both , if we live , we live unto the Master , and if we die , we die unto the Master . Therefore , whether we live or die , we are the Master’s .
45014009	For unto this Messiah died and rose and lived again , to rule over both the dead and the living .
45014010	But why do you judge your brother ? Or why do you despise your brother ? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Messiah .
45014011	For it has been written , “ As I live , says יהוה , every knee shall bow to Me , and every tongue shall confess to Elohim . ”
45014012	Each one of us , therefore , shall give account of himself to Elohim .
45014013	Therefore let us not judge one another any longer , but rather judge this , not to put an obstacle or a stumbling-block in our brother’s way .
45014014	I know and am persuaded in the Master יהושע that none at all is common of itself . But to him who regards whatever to be common , to him it is common .
45014015	And if your brother is grieved because of your food , you are no longer walking in love . Do not by your food ruin the one for whom Messiah died .
45014016	Do not then allow your good to be spoken of as evil .
45014017	For the reign of Elohim is not eating and drinking , but righteousness and peace and joy in the Set-apart Spirit .
45014018	For he who is serving Messiah in these matters is well-pleasing to Elohim and approved by men .
45014019	So , then , let us pursue the matters of peace and the matters for building up one another .
45014020	Do not destroy the work of Elohim for the sake of food . All indeed are clean , but evil to that man who eats so as to cause stumbling .
45014021	It is good not to eat meat or drink wine , nor to do whatever by which your brother stumbles .
45014022	Do you have belief ? Have it to yourself before Elohim . Blessed is he who does not condemn himself in what he approves .
45014023	But he who doubts , if he eats , is condemned , because it is not of belief , and all that is not of belief is sin .
45015001	But we who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak , and not to please ourselves .
45015002	Let each one of us please his neighbour for his good , to build him up .
45015003	For even the Messiah did not please Himself , but , as it has been written , “ The reproaches of those who reproached You fell upon Me . ”
45015004	For whatever was written before was written for our instruction , that through endurance and encouragement of the Scriptures we might have the expectation .
45015005	And the Elohim of endurance and encouragement give you to be of the same mind toward one another , according to Messiah יהושע ,
45015006	that with one mind and one mouth , you might praise the Elohim and Father of our Master יהושע Messiah .
45015007	So accept one another , as Messiah also did accept us , to the esteem of Elohim .
45015008	And I say that יהושע Messiah has become a servant of the circumcised for the truth of Elohim , to confirm the promises made to the fathers ,
45015009	and for the gentiles to praise Elohim for His compassion , as it has been written , “ Because of this I shall confess to You among the gentiles , and I shall sing to Your Name . ”
45015010	And again it says , “ Rejoice , O gentiles , with His people ! ”
45015011	And again , “ Praise יהוה , all you gentiles ! Praise Him , all you peoples ! ”
45015012	And again , Yeshayahu says , “ There shall be a root of Yishai , and He who shall rise to reign over the gentiles , on Him the gentiles shall set their expectation . ”
45015013	And the Elohim of expectation fill you with all joy and peace in believing , that you overflow with expectation by the power of the Set-apart Spirit .
45015014	Now I myself am persuaded concerning you , my brothers , that you too are filled with goodness , complete in all knowledge , able also to admonish one another .
45015015	But I have written more boldly to you , in part , as reminding you , because of the favour given to me by Elohim ,
45015016	to be a servant of יהושע Messiah to the gentiles , with the priestly duty of bringing the Good News of Elohim , so that the offering of the gentiles becomes acceptable , set apart by the Set-apart Spirit .
45015017	Therefore I have cause for boasting in Messiah יהושע in the matters pertaining to Elohim .
45015018	For I shall not presume to speak of any matter except what Messiah has worked out through me , in word and deed , to make the gentiles obedient ,
45015019	in power of signs and wonders , in power of the Spirit of Elohim , so that from Yerushalayim and round about to Illurikon I have completed the preaching of the Good News of Messiah .
45015020	And so I was ambitious to bring the Good News where Messiah had not been named , lest I should build on another man’s foundation ,
45015021	but as it has been written , “ To whom it was not announced concerning Him , they shall see , and those that have not heard shall understand . ”
45015022	This is why I was often hindered from coming to you .
45015023	But now , no longer having a place in these parts , and having a longing to come to you for many years ,
45015024	I shall come to you when I go to Spain . For I expect to see you on my journey , and to be helped on my way there by you , if first I be somewhat filled with your company .
45015025	But now I am going to Yerushalayim to serve the set-apart ones .
45015026	For it pleased those from Makedonia and Achaia to make some contribution for the poor among the set-apart ones who are in Yerushalayim .
45015027	For they were pleased , and they are their debtors . For if the gentiles have shared in their spiritual matters , their duty is also to serve them in material matters .
45015028	Having completed this , then , and having put my seal on this fruit of theirs , I shall return through you to Spain .
45015029	And I know that when I come to you , I shall come in the completeness of the blessing of the Good News of Messiah .
45015030	But I urge you , brothers , through our Master יהושע Messiah , and through the love of the Spirit , to strive together with me in prayers for me , unto Elohim ,
45015031	that I might be delivered from those in Yehuḏah who do not believe , and that my service for Yerushalayim be well received by the set-apart ones ,
45015032	that I might come to you with joy , through the desire of Elohim , and be refreshed together with you .
45015033	And the Elohim of peace be with you all . Amĕn .
45016001	And I commend to you Phoebe our sister , who is a servant of the assembly in Kenḥrea ,
45016002	that you receive her in יהוה , worthy of the set-apart ones , and assist her in whatever matter she has need of you . For she has been a great help to many , including me .
45016003	Greet Priscilla and Aqulas , my fellow workers in Messiah יהושע ,
45016004	who risked their own necks for my life , to whom not only I give thanks , but also all the assemblies of the gentiles ,
45016005	and the assembly that is in their house . Greet my beloved Epainetos , who is the first-fruits of Achaia to Messiah .
45016006	Greet Miryam , who worked very hard for us .
45016007	Greet Andronikos and Junias , my relatives and my fellow prisoners , who are eminent among the emissaries , who also were in Messiah before me .
45016008	Greet Amplias , my beloved in יהוה .
45016009	Greet Urbanus , our fellow worker in Messiah , and Stachus , my beloved .
45016010	Greet Apelles , the approved in Messiah . Greet those who are of Aristobulos .
45016011	Greet Herodion , my relative . Greet those who are of Narcissus who are in יהוה .
45016012	Greet Truphaina and Truphosa , who work in יהוה . Greet the beloved Persis , who worked very hard in יהוה .
45016013	Greet Rufus , chosen in יהוה and his mother and mine .
45016014	Greet Asugritos , Phlegon , Hermas , Patrobas , Hermes , and the brothers who are with them .
45016015	Greet Philologos and Julia , Nereus and his sister , and Olumpas , and all the set-apart ones who are with them .
45016016	Greet one another with a set-apart kiss . The assemblies of Messiah greet you .
45016017	Now I call upon you , brothers , watch out for those who cause divisions and stumbling , contrary to the teaching which you learned , and turn away from them .
45016018	For such ones do not serve our Master יהושע Messiah , but their own stomach , and by smooth words and flattering speech they deceive the hearts of the innocent .
45016019	Your obedience , indeed , is reported to all . Therefore I rejoice concerning you , but I wish you to be wise indeed as to the good , and simple toward the evil .
45016020	And the Elohim of peace shall crush Satan under your feet shortly . The favour of our Master יהושע Messiah be with you . Amĕn .
45016021	Timothy , my fellow worker , and Lucius , and Jason , and Sosipater , my relatives , greet you .
45016022	I , Tertius , who wrote this letter , greet you in יהוה .
45016023	Gaios , the host of all the assembly and me , greets you . Ěrastos , the treasurer of the city , greets you , and Quartus , a brother .
45016024	The favour of our Master יהושע Messiah be with you all . Amĕn .
45016025	And to Him who is able to establish you according to my Good News and the preaching of יהושע Messiah , according to the revelation of the secret which was kept silent since times of old ,
45016026	but now has been made manifest , and by the prophetic Scriptures has been made known to all nations , according to the command of the everlasting Elohim , for belief-obedience .
45016027	To Elohim , wise alone , be the esteem , through יהושע Messiah forever . Amĕn .
46001001	Sha’ul , a called emissary of יהושע Messiah by the desire of Elohim , and brother Sosthenes ,
46001002	to the assembly of Elohim which is at Corinth , to those who are set-apart in Messiah יהושע , called set-apart ones , with all those calling on the Name of יהושע Messiah our Master in every place , theirs and ours :
46001003	Favour to you and peace from Elohim our Father and the Master יהושע Messiah .
46001004	I thank my Elohim always concerning you for the favour of Elohim which was given to you by Messiah יהושע ,
46001005	that in Him you were enriched in all – in every word and all knowledge –
46001006	as the witness of Messiah was confirmed in you ,
46001007	so that you are not lacking in any gift , eagerly waiting for the revelation of our Master יהושע Messiah ,
46001008	who shall also confirm you to the end , unreprovable in the day of our Master יהושע Messiah .
46001009	Elohim is trustworthy , by whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son , יהושע Messiah our Master .
46001010	And I appeal to you , brothers , by the Name of our Master יהושע Messiah , that you all agree , and that there be no divisions among you , but that you be knit together in the same mind and in the same opinion .
46001011	For I have been informed concerning you , my brothers , by those of the house of Chloe , that there are strifes among you .
46001012	What I mean is this , that each one of you says , “ I am of Sha’ul , ” or “ I am of Apollos , ” or “ I am of Kĕpha , ” or “ I am of Messiah . ”
46001013	Has the Messiah been divided ? Was Sha’ul impaled for you ? Or were you immersed in the name of Sha’ul ?
46001014	I thank Elohim that I immersed not one of you except Crispus and Gaios ,
46001015	that no one should say that I immersed into my own name .
46001016	Now I did also immerse the household of Stephanas . For the rest , I do not know whether I immersed anyone else .
46001017	For Messiah did not send me to immerse , but to bring the Good News , not with wisdom of words , that the stake of Messiah should not be nullified .
46001018	For the word of the stake is indeed foolishness to those who are perishing , but to us who are being saved it is the power of Elohim .
46001019	For it has been written , “ I shall destroy the wisdom of the wise , and set aside the learning of the learned ones . ”
46001020	Where is the wise ? Where is the scholar ? Where is the debater of this age ? Has not Elohim made foolish the wisdom of this world ?
46001021	For since , in the wisdom of Elohim , the world through wisdom did not know Elohim , it pleased Elohim through the foolishness of preaching to save those who believe .
46001022	And since Yehuḏim ask a sign , and Greeks seek wisdom ,
46001023	yet we proclaim Messiah impaled , to the Yehuḏim a stumbling-block and to the Greeks foolishness ,
46001024	but to those who are called – both Yehuḏim and Greeks – Messiah the power of Elohim and the wisdom of Elohim .
46001025	For the foolishness of Elohim is wiser than men , and the weakness of Elohim is stronger than men .
46001026	For look at your calling , brothers , that there were not many wise according to the flesh , not many mighty , not many noble .
46001027	But Elohim has chosen the foolish matters of the world to put to shame the wise , and Elohim has chosen the weak of the world to put to shame the strong .
46001028	And Elohim has chosen the low-born of the world and the despised , and the ones that are not , that He might bring to naught the ones that are ,
46001029	so that no flesh should boast in His presence .
46001030	And of Him you are in Messiah יהושע , who became for us wisdom from Elohim , righteousness also , and set-apartness and redemption ,
46001031	that , as it has been written , “ He who boasts , let him boast in יהוה . ”
46002001	And , when I came to you , brothers , I did not come with excellence of speech or wisdom , proclaiming to you the witness of Elohim .
46002002	For I resolved not to know any matter among you except יהושע Messiah and Him impaled .
46002003	And I was with you in weakness , and in fear , and in much trembling .
46002004	And my word and my preaching were not with persuasive words of man’s wisdom , but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power ,
46002005	in order that your belief should not be in the wisdom of men but in the power of Elohim .
46002006	Yet we speak wisdom among those who are perfect , and not the wisdom of this age , nor of the rulers of this age that are being brought to naught .
46002007	But we speak the wisdom of Elohim , which was hidden in a secret , and which Elohim ordained before the ages for our esteem ,
46002008	which no one of the rulers of this age knew , for if they had known , they would not have impaled the Master of esteem .
46002009	But as it has been written , “ Eye has not seen , and ear has not heard , nor have entered into the heart of man what Elohim has prepared for those who love Him . ”
46002010	But Elohim has revealed them to us through His Spirit . For the Spirit searches all matters , even the depths of Elohim .
46002011	For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the spirit of the man that is in him ? So also , the thoughts of Elohim no one has known , except the Spirit of Elohim .
46002012	And we have received , not the spirit of the world , but the Spirit that is from Elohim , in order to know what Elohim has favourably given us ,
46002013	which we also speak , not in words which man’s wisdom teaches but which the Set-apart Spirit teaches , comparing spiritual matters with spiritual matters .
46002014	But the natural man does not receive the matters of the Spirit of Elohim , for they are foolishness to him , and he is unable to know them , because they are spiritually discerned .
46002015	But he who is spiritual discerns indeed all matters , but he himself is discerned by no one .
46002016	For “ Who has known the mind of יהוה ? Who shall instruct Him ? ” But we have the mind of Messiah .
46003001	And I , brothers , was not able to speak to you as to spiritual ones but as to fleshly , as to babes in Messiah .
46003002	I fed you with milk and not with solid food , for until now you were not able to receive it , and even now you are still not able ,
46003003	for you are still fleshly . For since there is envy , and strife , and divisions among you , are you not fleshly and walking according to man ?
46003004	For when one says , “ I am of Sha’ul , ” and another , “ I am of Apollos , ” are you not fleshly ?
46003005	What then is Apollos , and what is Sha’ul , but servants through whom you believed , as the Master assigned to each ?
46003006	I planted , Apollos watered , but Elohim was giving growth .
46003007	So neither he who plants nor he who waters is any at all , but Elohim who gives the increase .
46003008	And he who plants and he who waters are one , and each one shall receive his own reward according to his own labour .
46003009	For we are fellow workers of Elohim , you are the field of Elohim , the building of Elohim .
46003010	According to the favour of Elohim which was given to me , as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation , and another builds on it . But each one should look how he builds on it .
46003011	For no one is able to lay any other foundation except that which is laid , which is יהושע Messiah .
46003012	And if anyone builds on this foundation with gold , silver , precious stones , wood , hay , straw ,
46003013	each one’s work shall be revealed , for the day shall show it up , because it is revealed by fire . And the fire shall prove the work of each one , what sort it is .
46003014	If anyone’s work remains , which he has built on , he shall receive a reward .
46003015	If anyone’s work is burned , he shall suffer loss , but he himself shall be saved , but so as through fire .
46003016	Do you not know that you are a Dwelling Place of Elohim and that the Spirit of Elohim dwells in you ?
46003017	If anyone destroys the Dwelling Place of Elohim , Elohim shall destroy him . For the Dwelling Place of Elohim is set-apart , which you are .
46003018	Let no one deceive himself . If anyone among you seems to be wise in this age , let him become foolish , so that he might become wise .
46003019	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with Elohim . For it has been written , “ He catches the wise in their craftiness , ”
46003020	and again , “ יהוה knows the thoughts of the wise , that they are worthless . ”
46003021	So then , let no one boast in men , for all belongs to you ,
46003022	whether Sha’ul or Apollos or Kĕpha , or the world , or life , or death , or the present or the future – all belongs to you .
46003023	And you belong to Messiah , and Messiah belongs to Elohim .
46004001	Let a man regard us as servants of Messiah and trustees of the secrets of Elohim .
46004002	For the rest , it is sought in trustees , that those should be found trustworthy .
46004003	But with me it is a small matter that I should be judged by you or by a man’s court . But not even myself I judge .
46004004	For I am not conscious of any matter against myself , yet I am not declared right by this , but He who judges me is יהוה .
46004005	So do not judge any at all before the time , until the Master comes , who shall bring to light what is hidden in darkness and reveal the thoughts of the hearts . And then each one’s praise shall come from Elohim .
46004006	And these matters , brothers , I have applied in a figure to myself and Apollos for your sakes , so that in us you might learn not to think beyond what is written , so that none of you be puffed up on behalf of one against the other .
46004007	For who makes you to differ ? And what do you have that you did not receive ? And if you did indeed receive it , why do you boast as if you had not received it ?
46004008	You are already satisfied ! You are already enriched ! You have reigned as sovereigns , apart from us ! And I wish , indeed , you did reign , that we also might reign with you !
46004009	For I think that Elohim has exhibited us , the emissaries , last , as appointed to death , because we became a spectacle to the world , both to messengers and to men .
46004010	We are fools for the sake of Messiah , but you are wise in Messiah ! We are weak , but you are strong ! You are in esteem , but we are not appreciated !
46004011	Until the present hour we both hunger and thirst , and we are scantily clad , and beaten , and homeless ,
46004012	and labour , working with our own hands . Being cursed , we bless ; being persecuted , we suffer ;
46004013	being insulted , we help . We have been made as the filth of the world – dirt wiped off by all until now .
46004014	I do not write this to shame you , but to warn you as my beloved children .
46004015	For if you should have ten thousand instructors in Messiah , yet not many fathers , for in Messiah יהושע I have brought you forth through the Good News .
46004016	Therefore I appeal to you , to become imitators of me .
46004017	For this reason I have sent Timothy to you , who is my beloved and trustworthy son in the Master , who shall remind you of my ways in Messiah , as I teach everywhere in every assembly .
46004018	Now some are puffed up , as though I were not coming to you .
46004019	But I shall come to you shortly , if the Master desires , and I shall know , not the word of those who are puffed up , but the power .
46004020	For the reign of Elohim is not in speech , but in power .
46004021	What do you wish ? Shall I come to you with a rod , or in love and a spirit of meekness ?
46005001	It is commonly reported that there is whoring among you , and such whoring as is not even named among the gentiles , so as one to have his father’s wife !
46005002	And you have been puffed up , and did not rather mourn , so that he who has done this deed , be removed from among you !
46005003	For I indeed , as absent in body but present in spirit , have already judged the one who did this , as though I were present .
46005004	In the Name of our Master יהושע Messiah , when you are gathered together , and my spirit , with the power of our Master יהושע Messiah ,
46005005	deliver such a one to Satan for destruction of the flesh , in order that his spirit be saved in the day of the Master יהושע .
46005006	Your boasting is not good . Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the entire lump ?
46005007	Therefore cleanse out the old leaven , so that you are a new lump , as you are unleavened . For also Messiah our Passover was offered for us .
46005008	So then let us observe the festival , not with old leaven , nor with the leaven of evil and wickedness , but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth .
46005009	I wrote to you in my letter not to keep company with those who whore .
46005010	And I certainly did not mean with those of this world who whore , or with the greedy of gain , or swindlers , or idolaters , since then you would need to go out of the world .
46005011	But now I have written to you not to keep company with anyone called ‘ a brother , ’ if he is one who whores , or greedy of gain , or an idolater , or a reviler , or a drunkard , or a swindler – not even to eat with such a one .
46005012	For what have I to do with judging outsiders ? Do you not judge those who are inside ?
46005013	But Elohim judges those who are outside . And put away the wicked one from among you !
46006001	Should any of you , holding a matter against another , go to be judged before the unrighteous , and not before the set-apart ones ?
46006002	Do you not know that the set-apart ones shall judge the world ? And if the world is judged by you , are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters ?
46006003	Do you not know that we shall judge messengers ? How much more , matters of this life ?
46006004	If then you truly have judgments of this life , do you appoint them as judges who are least esteemed by the assembly ?
46006005	I say this to your shame . Is it so , that there is not a wise one among you , not even one , who shall be able to judge between his brothers ?
46006006	But brother against brother goes to be judged and that before unbelievers !
46006007	Already , then , there is a failure with you , that you have lawsuits among you . Why not rather be wronged ? Why not rather be cheated ?
46006008	But you yourselves do wrong and cheat , and that to your brothers !
46006009	Do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the reign of Elohim ? Do not be deceived . Neither those who whore , nor idolaters , nor adulterers , nor effeminate , nor homosexuals ,
46006010	nor thieves , nor greedy of gain , nor drunkards , nor revilers , nor swindlers shall inherit the reign of Elohim .
46006011	And such were some of you . But you were washed , but you were set apart , but you were declared right in the Name of the Master יהושע and by the Spirit of our Elohim .
46006012	All is permitted me , but not all do profit . All is permitted me , but I shall not be under authority of any .
46006013	Foods for the stomach and the stomach for foods – but Elohim shall destroy both it and them . And the body is not for whoring but for the Master , and the Master for the body .
46006014	And Elohim , who raised up the Master , shall also raise us up through His power .
46006015	Do you not know that your bodies are members of Messiah ? Shall I then take the members of Messiah and make them members of a whore ? Let it not be !
46006016	Or do you not know that he who is joined to a whore is one body ? For He says , “ The two shall become one flesh . ”
46006017	And he who is joined to the Master is one spirit .
46006018	Flee whoring . Every sin that a man does is outside the body , but he who commits whoring sins against his own body .
46006019	Or do you not know that your body is the Dwelling Place of the Set-apart Spirit who is in you , which you have from Elohim , and you are not your own ?
46006020	For you were bought with a price , therefore esteem Elohim in your body and in your spirit , which are of Elohim .
46007001	And concerning the matters you wrote to me : It is good for a man not to touch a woman .
46007002	But because of whoring , let each one have his own wife , and let each woman have her own husband .
46007003	Let the husband render to his wife what is her due , and likewise also the wife to her husband .
46007004	The wife does not have authority over her own body , but the husband does . And likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body , but the wife does .
46007005	Do not deprive one another except with agreement for a time , to give yourselves to fasting and prayer . And come together again so that Satan does not try you because of your lack of self-control .
46007006	And I say this as a concession , not as a command .
46007007	For I wish that all men were even as I myself . But each one has his own gift from Elohim , one in this way and another in that .
46007008	And I say to the unmarried and to the widows : It is good for them if they remain even as I am ,
46007009	but if they do not have self-control , let them marry , for it is better to marry than to burn .
46007010	And to the married I command , not I , but the Master : A wife should not separate from a husband .
46007011	But if she is indeed separated , let her remain unmarried or be restored to favour with her husband , and let a husband not send away a wife .
46007012	And to the rest I say , not the Master : If any brother has an unbelieving wife , and she thinks well to live with him , let him not send her away .
46007013	And a woman who has an unbelieving husband , and he thinks well to live with her , let her not send him away .
46007014	For the unbelieving husband has been set-apart in the wife , and the unbelieving wife has been set-apart in the husband . Otherwise your children would be unclean , but now they are set-apart .
46007015	And , if the unbelieving one separates , let him separate himself . A brother or a sister has not been enslaved in such matters . But Elohim has called us to peace .
46007016	For how do you know , O wife , whether you shall save your husband ? Or how do you know , O husband , whether you shall save your wife ?
46007017	Only , as Elohim has distributed to each one , as the Master has called each one , so let him walk . And so I order in all the assemblies .
46007018	Was anyone called while circumcised ? Let him not become uncircumcised . Was anyone called while uncircumcised ? Let him not be circumcised .
46007019	The circumcision is naught , and the uncircumcision is naught , but the guarding of the commands of Elohim does matter !
46007020	Let each one remain in the same calling in which he was called .
46007021	Were you called while a slave ? It matters not to you , but if you are able to become free too , rather use it .
46007022	For he who is called in the Master while a slave is the Master’s freed man . Likewise he who is called while free is a slave of Messiah .
46007023	You were bought with a price , do not become slaves of men .
46007024	Brothers , let each one remain with Elohim in that calling in which he was called .
46007025	And concerning maidens : I have no command from the Master , but I give judgment as one whom the Master in His compassion has made trustworthy .
46007026	I think then that this is good because of the present necessity , that it is good for a man to remain as he is .
46007027	Are you bound to a wife ? Do not seek to be loosed . Are you loosed from a wife ? Do not seek a wife .
46007028	But even if you should marry , you have not sinned . And if a maiden should marry , she has not sinned . But such shall have pressure in the flesh , but I would spare you .
46007029	And this I say , brothers , the time is short , so that from now on even those who have wives should be as though they had none ,
46007030	and those who weep as though they did not weep , and those who rejoice as though they did not rejoice , and those who buy as though they did not possess ,
46007031	and those who use this world as not misusing it . For the scene of this world is passing away .
46007032	And I wish you to be without concern . He who is unmarried is concerned about the matters of the Master – how to please the Master .
46007033	But he who is married is concerned about the matters of the world – how to please his wife .
46007034	There is a difference between a wife and a maiden . The unmarried woman is concerned about the matters of the Master , that she might be set-apart both in body and in spirit . But she who is married is concerned about the matters of the world – how to please her husband .
46007035	And this I say for your own good , not to put a restraint on you , but for what is proper , and to attend to the Master without distraction .
46007036	And if anyone thinks he is behaving improperly toward his maiden , if she is past the flower of her youth , and so it should be , let him do what he desires , he does not sin – let them marry .
46007037	But he who stands steadfast in his heart , having no necessity , and has authority over his own desire , and has so decided in his heart to guard his own maiden , does well .
46007038	So then he who gives her in marriage does well , but he who does not give her in marriage does better .
46007039	A wife is bound by Torah as long as her husband lives , and if her husband dies , she is free to be married to whom she desires , only in the Master .
46007040	But she is better off if she remains as she is , according to my opinion . And I think I also have the Spirit of Elohim .
46008001	And concerning food offered to idols : We know that we all have knowledge . Knowledge puffs up , but love builds up .
46008002	If anyone thinks that he knows somewhat , he does not yet know as he should know .
46008003	But if anyone loves Elohim , this one is known by Him .
46008004	So then , concerning the eating of food offered to idols , we know that an idol is no matter at all in the world , and that there is no other Elohim but one .
46008005	For even if there are so-called mighty ones , whether in heaven or on earth – as there are many mighty ones and many masters –
46008006	for us there is one Elohim , the Father , from whom all came and for whom we live , and one Master יהושע Messiah , through whom all came and through whom we live .
46008007	However , not all have this knowledge . But some , being aware of the idol , until now eat it as having been offered to an idol , so their conscience , being weak , is defiled .
46008008	But food does not commend us to Elohim , for we are none the better if we eat , nor any worse for not eating .
46008009	But look to it , lest somehow this right of yours become a stumbling-block to those who are weak .
46008010	For if anyone sees you who have knowledge eating in an idol’s place , shall not his conscience , if he is weak , be built up to eat food offered to idols ?
46008011	So this weak brother , for whom Messiah died , shall perish through your knowledge !
46008012	Now sinning in this way against the brothers , and wounding their weak conscience , you sin against Messiah .
46008013	Therefore , if food makes my brother stumble , I am never again going to eat meat , lest I make my brother stumble .
46009001	Am I not an emissary ? Am I not free ? Have I not seen יהושע Messiah our Master ? Are you not my work in the Master ?
46009002	If to others I am not an emissary , I certainly am to you . For you are the seal of my office of the emissary in the Master .
46009003	My defence to those who examine me is this :
46009004	Do we not have a right to eat and drink ?
46009005	Do we not have a right to take along a sister – a wife – as do also the other emissaries , and the brothers of the Master , and Kĕpha ?
46009006	Or do only Barnaḇah and I have no right to refrain from working ?
46009007	Who serves as a soldier at his own expense ? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit ? Or who shepherds a flock and does not feed on the milk of the flock ?
46009008	Do I say this as a man ? Or does not the Torah say the same too ?
46009009	For it has been written in the Torah of Mosheh , “ You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain . ” Is it about oxen Elohim is concerned ?
46009010	Or does He say it because of us all ? For this was written because of us , that he who ploughs should plough in expectation , and the thresher in expectation of sharing .
46009011	If we have sown spiritual seed among you , is it too much if we reap material goods from you ?
46009012	If others share authority over you , should not rather we ? But we have not used this authority , but we put up with all , lest we hinder the Good News of Messiah .
46009013	Do you not know that those serving the Set-apart Place eat from the Set-apart Place , and those attending at the altar have their share of the offerings of the altar ?
46009014	So also the Master instituted that those announcing the Good News should live from the Good News .
46009015	But I have used none of these , nor have I written this that it should be done so to me . For it would be better for me to die than that anyone should make my boasting empty .
46009016	For if I bring the Good News , it is no boasting for me , for necessity is laid on me , and it is woe to me if I do not bring the Good News !
46009017	For if I do this voluntarily I have a reward , but if not voluntarily , I am entrusted with a management .
46009018	What then is my reward ? That in bringing the Good News , I should offer the Good News of Messiah without cost , so as not to abuse my authority in the Good News .
46009019	For though I am free from all , I made myself a servant to all , in order to win more ,
46009020	and to the Yehuḏim I became as a Yehuḏite , that I might win Yehuḏim ; to those who are under Torah , as under Torah , so as to win those who are under Torah ;
46009021	to those without Torah , as without Torah – not being without Torah toward Elohim , but under Torah of Messiah – so as to win those who are without Torah .
46009022	To the weak I became as weak , so as to win the weak . To all men I have become all , so as to save some , by all means .
46009023	And I do this because of the Good News , so as to become a fellow-partaker with it .
46009024	Do you not know that those who run in a race indeed all run , but one receives the prize ? Run in such a way as to obtain it .
46009025	And everyone who competes controls himself in every way . Now they do it to receive a corruptible crown , but we for an incorruptible crown .
46009026	Therefore I run accordingly , not with uncertainty . Thus I fight , not as one who beats the air .
46009027	But I treat my body severely and make it my slave , so that when I have proclaimed to others , I myself might be rejected .
46010001	For I do not wish you to be ignorant , brothers , that all our fathers were under the cloud , and all passed through the sea ,
46010002	and all were immersed into Mosheh in the cloud and in the sea ,
46010003	and all ate the same spiritual food ,
46010004	and all drank the same spiritual drink . For they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed , and the Rock was Messiah .
46010005	However , with most of them Elohim was not well pleased , for they were laid low in the wilderness .
46010006	And these became examples for us , so that we should not lust after evil , as those indeed lusted .
46010007	And do not become idolaters as some of them , as it has been written , “ The people sat down to eat and to drink , and stood up to play . ”
46010008	Neither should we commit whoring , as some of them did , and in one day twenty-three thousand fell ,
46010009	neither let us try Messiah , as some of them also tried , and were destroyed by serpents ,
46010010	neither grumble , as some of them also grumbled , and were destroyed by the destroyer .
46010011	And all these came upon them as examples , and they were written as a warning to us , on whom the ends of the ages have come ,
46010012	so that he who thinks he stands , let him take heed lest he fall .
46010013	No trial has overtaken you except such as is common to man , and Elohim is trustworthy , who shall not allow you to be tried beyond what you are able , but with the trial shall also make the way of escape , enabling you to bear it .
46010014	Therefore , my beloved ones , flee from idolatry .
46010015	I speak as to wise men , judge for yourselves what I say .
46010016	The cup of blessing which we bless , is it not a sharing in the blood of Messiah ? The bread that we break , is it not a sharing in the body of Messiah ?
46010017	Because there is one bread , we , who are many , are one body , for we all partake of the one bread .
46010018	Look at Yisra’ĕl after the flesh : Are not those who eat of the offerings sharers in the altar ?
46010019	What then do I say ? That an idol is of any value ? Or that which is offered to idols is of any value ?
46010020	No , but what the gentiles offer they offer to demons and not to Elohim , and I do not wish you to become sharers with demons .
46010021	You are not able to drink the cup of the Master and the cup of demons , you are not able to partake of the table of the Master and of the table of demons .
46010022	Do we provoke the Master to jealousy ? Are we stronger than He ?
46010023	All is permitted me , but not all do profit . All is permitted me , but not all build up .
46010024	Let no one seek his own , but each one that of the other .
46010025	You eat whatever is sold in the meat market , asking no questions because of conscience ,
46010026	for “ The earth belongs to יהוה , and all that fills it . ”
46010027	And if any of the unbelievers invite you , and you wish to go , you eat whatever is set before you , asking no question on account of the conscience .
46010028	And if anyone says to you , “ This was offered to idols , ” do not eat it because of the one pointing it out to you , and on account of the conscience , for “ The earth belongs to יהוה , and all that fills it . ”
46010029	Now I say conscience , not your own , but that of the other . For why is my freedom judged by another’s conscience ?
46010030	But if I partake with thanks , why am I evil spoken of for what I give thanks ?
46010031	Therefore , whether you eat or drink , or whatever you do , do all to the esteem of Elohim .
46010032	Cause no stumbling , either to the Yehuḏim or to the Greeks or to the assembly of Elohim ,
46010033	as I also please all men in all matters , not seeking my own advantage , but that of the many , that they might be saved .
46011001	Become imitators of me , as I also am of Messiah .
46011002	And I praise you , brothers , that you remember me in every way and keep the traditions as I delivered them to you .
46011003	And I wish you to know that the head of every man is the Messiah , and the head of woman is the man , and the head of Messiah is Elohim .
46011004	Every man praying or prophesying , having his head covered , brings shame to his Head .
46011005	And every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered brings shame to her head , for that is one and the same as if her head were shaved .
46011006	For if a woman is not covered , let her also be shorn . But if it is a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaved , let her be covered .
46011007	For a man indeed should not cover his head , since he is the likeness and esteem of Elohim , but woman is the esteem of man .
46011008	For man is not from woman , but woman from man .
46011009	For man also was not created for the woman , but woman for the man .
46011010	Because of this the woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head , because of the messengers .
46011011	However , man is not independent of woman , nor woman independent of man , in the Master .
46011012	For as the woman was from the man , even so the man also is through the woman . But all are from Elohim .
46011013	Judge for yourselves : is it proper for a woman to pray to Elohim with her head uncovered ?
46011014	Does not nature itself teach you that if a man indeed has long hair , it is a disrespect to him ?
46011015	And if a woman has long hair , it is an esteem to her , because the long hair has been given to her over against a veil .
46011016	If , however , anyone seems to be contentious , we do not have such a habit , nor do the assemblies of Elohim .
46011017	And in declaring this I do not praise you , since you come together not for the better but for the worse .
46011018	For in the first place , I hear that when you come together as an assembly , there are divisions among you , and to some extent I believe it .
46011019	For there have to be factions even among you , so that the approved ones might be revealed among you .
46011020	So when you come together in one place , it is not to eat the Master’s supper .
46011021	For , when you eat , each one takes his own supper first , and one is hungry and another is drunk .
46011022	Have you not houses to eat and drink in ? Or do you despise the assembly of Elohim and shame those who have not ? What shall I say to you ? Shall I praise you in this ? I do not praise !
46011023	For I received from the Master that which I also delivered to you : that the Master יהושע in the night in which He was delivered up took bread ,
46011024	and having given thanks , He broke it and said , “ Take , eat , this is My body which is broken for you ; do this in remembrance of Me . ”
46011025	In the same way also the cup , after supper , saying , “ This cup is the renewed covenant in My blood . As often as you drink it , do this in remembrance of Me . ”
46011026	For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup , you proclaim the death of the Master until He comes .
46011027	So that whoever should eat this bread or drink this cup of the Master unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Master .
46011028	But let a man examine himself , and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup .
46011029	For the one who is eating and drinking unworthily , eats and drinks judgment to himself , not discerning the body of the Master .
46011030	Because of this many are weak and sick among you , and many sleep .
46011031	For if we were to examine ourselves , we would not be judged .
46011032	But when we are judged , we are disciplined by the Master , that we should not be condemned with the world .
46011033	So then , my brothers , when you come together to eat , wait for one another .
46011034	And if anyone is hungry , let him eat at home , lest you come together for judgment . And the rest I shall set in order when I come .
46012001	And concerning spiritual gifts , brothers , I do not wish you to be ignorant .
46012002	You know that you were gentiles , led away to the dumb idols , even as you might be led .
46012003	Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of Elohim says יהושע is a curse , and no one is able to say that יהושע is Master except by the Set-apart Spirit .
46012004	And there are different kinds of gifts , but the same Spirit .
46012005	There are different kinds of services , but the same Master .
46012006	And there are different kinds of workings , but it is the same Elohim who is working all in all .
46012007	And to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for profiting ,
46012008	for to one is given a word of wisdom through the Spirit , and to another a word of knowledge according to the same Spirit ,
46012009	and to another belief by the same Spirit , and to another gifts of healing by the same Spirit ,
46012010	and to another operations of powers , and to another prophecy , and to another discerning of spirits , and to another kinds of tongues , and to another interpretation of tongues .
46012011	But one and the same Spirit works all these , distributing to each one individually as He intends .
46012012	For as the body is one and has many members , but all the members of that one body , being many , are one body , so also is the Messiah .
46012013	For indeed by one Spirit we were all immersed into one body , whether Yehuḏim or Greeks , whether slaves or free , and we were all made to drink into one Spirit .
46012014	For indeed the body is not one member but many .
46012015	If the foot says , “ Because I am not a hand , I do not belong to the body , ” does it therefore not belong to the body ?
46012016	And if the ear says , “ Because I am not an eye , I do not belong to the body , ” does it therefore not belong to the body ?
46012017	If all the body was an eye , where would be the hearing ? If all hearing , where would be the smelling ?
46012018	But now Elohim has set the members , each one of them , in the body , even as He pleased .
46012019	And if they all had been one member , where would the body be ?
46012020	And now , there are indeed many members , but one body .
46012021	And an eye is unable to say to the hand , “ I have no need of you , ” or again the head to the feet , “ I have no need of you . ”
46012022	But much rather , those members of the body which are thought to be weaker are necessary .
46012023	And to those of the body which we think to be less respected , these we present greater respect . And our unseemly members have greater seemliness ,
46012024	whereas our seemly members have no need . But Elohim blended together the body , having given greater respect to that member which lacks it ,
46012025	that there should be no division in the body , but that the members should have the same concern one for another .
46012026	And if one member suffers , all the members suffer with it ; or if one member is esteemed , all the members rejoice with it .
46012027	And you are a body of Messiah , and members individually .
46012028	And Elohim has appointed these in the assembly : firstly emissaries , secondly prophets , thirdly teachers , after that miracles , then gifts of healings , helps , ministrations , kinds of tongues .
46012029	Are all emissaries ? Are all prophets ? Are all teachers ? Are all workers of miracles ?
46012030	Do all have gifts of healings ? Do all speak with tongues ? Do all interpret ?
46012031	But earnestly seek the better gifts . And yet I show you a more excellent way .
46013001	If I speak with the tongues of men and of messengers , but do not have love , I have become as sounding brass or a clanging cymbal .
46013002	And if I have prophecy , and know all secrets and all knowledge , and if I have all belief , so as to remove mountains , but do not have love , I am none at all .
46013003	And if I give out all my possessions to feed the poor , and if I give my body to be burned , but do not have love , I am not profited at all .
46013004	Love is patient , is kind , love does not envy , love does not boast , is not puffed up ,
46013005	does not behave indecently , does not seek its own , is not provoked , reckons not the evil ,
46013006	does not rejoice over the unrighteousness , but rejoices in the truth ,
46013007	it covers all , believes all , expects all , endures all .
46013008	Love never fails . And whether there be prophecies , they shall be inactive ; or tongues , they shall cease ; or knowledge , it shall be inactive .
46013009	For we know in part and we prophesy in part .
46013010	But when that which is perfect has come , then that which is in part shall be inactive .
46013011	When I was a child , I spoke as a child , I thought as a child , I reasoned as a child . But when I became a man , I did away with childish matters .
46013012	For now we see in a mirror , dimly , but then face to face . Now I know in part , but then I shall know , as I also have been known .
46013013	And now belief , expectation , and love remain – these three . But the greatest of these is love .
46014001	Pursue love , and earnestly seek the spiritual gifts , but rather that you prophesy .
46014002	For he who is speaking in a tongue does not speak to men but to Elohim , for no one understands , but in the Spirit he speaks secrets .
46014003	But he who is prophesying speaks upbuilding and encouragement and comfort to men .
46014004	He who is speaking in a tongue builds up himself , but he who is prophesying builds up the assembly .
46014005	Now I wish you all spoke with tongues , but rather that you might prophesy , for he who is prophesying is greater than he who is speaking with tongues , unless he interprets , so that the assembly might receive upbuilding .
46014006	But now , brothers , if I come to you speaking with tongues , what shall I profit you unless I speak to you , either by revelation , or by knowledge , or by prophesying , or by teaching ?
46014007	Nevertheless , lifeless instruments making a sound , whether flute or harp , if they do not make a distinction in the sound , how shall it be known what is played on the flute or on the harp ?
46014008	For indeed , if the trumpet makes an indistinct sound , who shall prepare himself for battle ?
46014009	So also you , if you do not give speech by the tongue that is clear , how shall it be known what is spoken ? For you shall be speaking into the air .
46014010	There are , undoubtedly , so many kinds of sounds in the world , and none of them is without distinct sound .
46014011	If then I do not know the power of the voice , I shall be a foreigner to him who speaks , and he who speaks be a foreigner to me .
46014012	So also you , since you are ardent for spiritual gifts , seek to excel in the upbuilding of the assembly .
46014013	Therefore , he who is speaking in a tongue , let him pray that he might interpret .
46014014	For if I am praying in a tongue , my spirit is praying , but my understanding is without fruit .
46014015	What then is it ? I shall pray with the spirit , and I shall also pray with the understanding . I shall sing with the spirit , and I shall also sing with the understanding .
46014016	Otherwise , if you bless with the spirit , how shall he who fills up the place of the unlearned say “ Amĕn ” at your giving of thanks , since he does not know what you say ?
46014017	For you truly give thanks well , but the other is not built up .
46014018	I thank my Elohim I speak with tongues more than you all ,
46014019	but in an assembly I wish to speak five words with my understanding that I might instruct others also , than ten thousand words in a tongue .
46014020	Brothers , do not be children in your thinking , but in evil be babes , and in your thinking be perfect .
46014021	In the Torah it has been written , “ With men of other tongues and other lips I shall speak to this people . And even so , they shall not hear Me , says יהוה . ”
46014022	So then tongues are for a sign , not to those who believe but to unbelievers , and prophesying is not for unbelievers but for those who believe .
46014023	If then all the assembly comes together in one place , and all speak with tongues , and there come in those who are unlearned or unbelievers , shall they not say that you are mad ?
46014024	But if all prophesy , and an unbeliever or an unlearned one comes in , he is reproved by all , he is discerned by all .
46014025	And so the secrets of his heart are revealed . And so , falling down on his face , he shall worship Elohim , declaring that Elohim is truly among you .
46014026	What then is it , brothers ? Whenever you come together , each one has a psalm , has a teaching , has a tongue , has a revelation , has an interpretation . Let all be done for upbuilding .
46014027	If anyone speaks in a tongue , let there be two or at the most three , each in turn , and let one interpret .
46014028	And if there is no interpreter , let him be silent in an assembly , and let him speak to himself and to Elohim .
46014029	And let two or three prophets speak , and let the others discern .
46014030	And if there should be a revelation to another who sits by , let the first be silent .
46014031	For you are all able to prophesy one by one , so that all learn and all be encouraged .
46014032	And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets .
46014033	For Elohim is not Elohim of disorder but of peace , as in all the assemblies of the set-apart ones .
46014034	Let your women be silent in the assemblies , for they are not allowed to speak , but let them subject themselves , as the Torah also says .
46014035	And if they wish to learn whatever , let them ask their own husbands at home , for it is improper for women to speak in an assembly .
46014036	Or did the word of Elohim go out from you ? Or did it reach only to you ?
46014037	If anyone thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual , let him acknowledge what I write to you , that they are a command of the Master .
46014038	And if anyone is ignorant , let him be ignorant .
46014039	So , then , brothers , earnestly seek to prophesy , and do not forbid speaking in tongues .
46014040	Let all be done decently and in order .
46015001	But brothers , I make known to you the Good News , which I brought as Good News to you , which you also did receive , and in which you stand ,
46015002	through which also you are being saved , if you hold fast that word I brought as Good News to you . Otherwise , you have believed in vain .
46015003	For I delivered to you at the first that which I also received : that Messiah died for our sins according to the Scriptures ,
46015004	and that He was buried , and that He was raised the third day , according to the Scriptures ,
46015005	and that He was seen by Kĕpha , then by the twelve .
46015006	After that He was seen by over five hundred brothers at one time , of whom the greater part remain till now , but some have fallen asleep .
46015007	After that He was seen by Ya‛aqoḇ , then by all the emissaries .
46015008	And last of all He was seen by me also , as if to one born prematurely .
46015009	For I am the least of the emissaries , who am not worthy to be called an emissary , because I persecuted the assembly of Elohim .
46015010	But by the favour of Elohim I am what I am , and His favour toward me was not in vain , but I laboured much more than they all , yet not I , but the favour of Elohim with me .
46015011	Whether , then , it was I or they , so we proclaimed and so you believed .
46015012	And if Messiah is proclaimed that He has been raised from the dead , how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead ?
46015013	And if there is no resurrection of the dead , then Messiah has not been raised .
46015014	And if Messiah has not been raised , then our proclaiming is empty , and your belief also empty ,
46015015	and we are also found false witnesses of Elohim , because we have witnessed of Elohim that He raised up Messiah , whom He did not raise up , if then the dead are not raised .
46015016	For if the dead are not raised , then neither Messiah has been raised .
46015017	And if Messiah has not been raised , your belief is to no purpose , you are still in your sins !
46015018	Then also those who have fallen asleep in Messiah have perished .
46015019	If in this life only we have expectation in Messiah , we are of all men the most wretched .
46015020	But now Messiah has been raised from the dead , and has become the first-fruit of those having fallen asleep .
46015021	For since death is through a man , resurrection of the dead is also through a Man .
46015022	For as all die in Aḏam , so also all shall be made alive in Messiah .
46015023	And each in his own order : Messiah the first-fruits , then those who are of Messiah at His coming ,
46015024	then the end , when He delivers up the reign to Elohim the Father , when He has brought to naught all rule and all authority and power .
46015025	For He has to reign until He has put all enemies under His feet .
46015026	The last enemy to be brought to naught is death .
46015027	For “ He has put all under His feet . ” But when He says “ all are put under Him , ” it is clear that He who put all under Him is excepted .
46015028	And when all are made subject to Him , then the Son Himself shall also be subject to Him who put all under Him , in order that Elohim be all in all .
46015029	Otherwise , what shall they do who are immersed for the dead , if the dead are not raised at all ? Why indeed are they immersed for the dead ?
46015030	And why do we stand in danger every hour ?
46015031	I affirm , by the boasting in you which I have in Messiah יהושע our Master , I die day by day .
46015032	If , as men do , I have fought with beasts at Ephesos , of what good is it to me ? If the dead are not raised , “ Let us eat and drink , for tomorrow we die . ”
46015033	Do not be led astray , “ Evil company corrupts good habits . ”
46015034	Wake up to soberness , righteously , and do not sin , for some do not have the knowledge of Elohim . I speak this to your shame .
46015035	But someone might say , “ How are the dead raised up ? And with what body do they come ? ”
46015036	Senseless one ! What you sow is not made alive unless it dies .
46015037	And as to what you sow : you do not sow the body which is to be , but a bare grain , it might be wheat or some other grain .
46015038	But Elohim gives it a body as He wishes , and to each seed a body of its own .
46015039	All flesh is not the same flesh , but there is one flesh of men , and another flesh of beasts , and another of fishes , and another of birds .
46015040	And there are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies , but the esteem of the heavenly is truly one , and the esteem of the earthly is another ,
46015041	one esteem of the sun , and another esteem of the moon , and another esteem of the stars – for star differs from star in esteem .
46015042	So also is the resurrection of the dead : it is sown in corruption , it is raised in incorruption ;
46015043	it is sown in disrespect , it is raised in esteem ; it is sown in weakness , it is raised in power ;
46015044	it is sown a natural body , it is raised a spiritual body ; there is a natural body , and there is a spiritual body .
46015045	And so it has been written , “ The first man Aḏam became a living being , ” the last Aḏam a life-giving Spirit .
46015046	The spiritual , however , was not first , but the natural , and afterward the spiritual .
46015047	The first man was of the earth , earthy ; the second Man is the Master from heaven .
46015048	As is the earthy , so also are those who are earthy ; and as is the heavenly , so also are those who are heavenly .
46015049	And as we have borne the likeness of the earthy , we shall also bear the likeness of the heavenly .
46015050	And this I say , brothers , that flesh and blood is unable to inherit the reign of Elohim , neither does corruption inherit incorruption .
46015051	See , I speak a secret to you : We shall not all sleep , but we shall all be changed ,
46015052	in a moment , in the twinkling of an eye , at the last trumpet . For the trumpet shall sound , and the dead shall be raised incorruptible , and we shall be changed .
46015053	For this corruptible has to put on incorruption , and this mortal to put on immortality .
46015054	And when this corruptible has put on incorruption , and this mortal has put on immortality , then shall come to be the word that has been written , “ Death is swallowed up in overcoming . ”
46015055	“ O Death , where is your sting ? O grave , where is your overcoming ? ”
46015056	And the sting of death is the sin , and the power of the sin is the Torah .
46015057	But thanks to Elohim who gives us the overcoming through our Master יהושע Messiah .
46015058	Therefore , my beloved brothers , be steadfast , immovable , always excelling in the work of the Master , knowing that your labour is not in vain in the Master .
46016001	And concerning the collections for the set-apart ones , you are to do as I gave orders to the assemblies of Galatia :
46016002	On the first day of the week let each one of you set aside , storing up whatever he is prospered , so that there are no collections when I come .
46016003	And when I come , whomever you approve by your letters , I shall send to bear your gift to Yerushalayim .
46016004	And if it is fitting for me to go , they shall go with me .
46016005	And I shall come to you when I pass through Makedonia , for I am passing through Makedonia .
46016006	And possibly I shall stay with you , or even spend the winter , so that you send me forward , wherever I go .
46016007	For I do not wish to see you now on the way , but I expect to stay a while with you , if the Master permits .
46016008	And I shall remain in Ephesos until the Festival of Weeks .
46016009	For a great and effective door has opened to me , and many are opposing .
46016010	And if Timothy comes , see that he is with you without fear , for he does the work of the Master , even as I .
46016011	Therefore let no one despise him . And send him forward in peace , so that he comes to me , for I am waiting for him with the brothers .
46016012	And concerning our brother Apollos , I strongly urged him to come to you with the brothers , but he had no desire at all to come at this time ; however , he shall come when it is convenient .
46016013	Watch , stand fast in the belief , be men , be strong .
46016014	Let all that you do be done in love .
46016015	And I urge you , brothers , you know the household of Stephanas , that it is the first-fruit of Achaia , and that they have assigned themselves for service to the set-apart ones ,
46016016	that you also be subject to such , and to everyone who works and labours with us .
46016017	And I rejoice about the coming of Stephanas , and Fortunatos , and Achaikos , for what was lacking on your part they supplied .
46016018	For they refreshed my spirit and yours , therefore give recognition to such ones .
46016019	The assemblies of Asia greet you . Aqulas and Priscilla greet you heartily in the Master , with the assembly that is in their house .
46016020	All the brothers greet you . Greet one another with a set-apart kiss .
46016021	The greeting with my own hand – Sha’ul .
46016022	If anyone does not love the Master יהושע Messiah , let him be a curse . Maranatha !
46016023	The favour of our Master יהושע Messiah be with you .
46016024	My love be with you all in Messiah יהושע . Amĕn .
47001001	Sha’ul , an emissary of יהושע Messiah , by the desire of Elohim , and Timothy the brother , to the assembly of Elohim that is at Corinth , with all the set-apart ones who are in all Achaia :
47001002	Favour to you and peace from Elohim our Father and the Master יהושע Messiah .
47001003	Blessed be the Elohim and Father of our Master יהושע Messiah , the Father of compassion and Elohim of all comfort ,
47001004	who is comforting us in all our pressure , enabling us to comfort those who are in every pressure , through the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by Elohim .
47001005	Because , as the sufferings of Messiah overflow in us , so our comfort also overflows through Messiah .
47001006	And if we suffer pressure , it is for your comfort and deliverance , being worked out in enduring the same sufferings which we also suffer . If we are comforted , it is for your comfort and deliverance .
47001007	And our expectation for you is steadfast , because we know that as you are sharing in the sufferings – so also in the comfort .
47001008	For we do not wish you to be ignorant , brothers , of our pressure which came to us in Asia , that we were weighed down , exceedingly , beyond ability , so that we despaired even of life .
47001009	Indeed , we had the sentence of death in ourselves , that we should not trust in ourselves but in Elohim who raises the dead ,
47001010	who rescued us from so great a death , and does rescue , in whom we trust that He shall still rescue us ,
47001011	you also helping together in prayer for us , that thanks shall be given by many on our behalf for the favour bestowed upon us through many .
47001012	For our boasting is this : the witness of our conscience that we behaved ourselves in the world in simplicity and sincerity of Elohim , not in fleshly wisdom but in the favour of Elohim , and much more toward you .
47001013	For we are not writing any other matters to you than what you read or understand . Now I trust you shall understand , even to the end ,
47001014	as also you have understood us in part , that we are your boast as you also are ours , in the day of the Master יהושע .
47001015	And relying on this I intended to come to you before , that you might twice receive a favour ,
47001016	and to pass your way into Makedonia , and again from Makedonia come to you , and to be sent by you on my way to Yehuḏah .
47001017	Since I intended this , did I do it lightly ? Or what I plan , do I plan according to the flesh , that with me there should be Yea , Yea , and No , No ?
47001018	But Elohim is trustworthy , that our word to you was not Yea and No .
47001019	For the Son of Elohim , יהושע Messiah , who was proclaimed among you by us – by me , Sila , and Timothy – was not Yea and No , but in Him was Yea .
47001020	For as many promises as are of Elohim , in Him they are Yea , and in Him Amĕn , to the esteem of Elohim through us .
47001021	But He who establishes us with you in Messiah and has anointed us is Elohim ,
47001022	who also sealed us , and gave the Spirit in our hearts as a pledge .
47001023	And I call Elohim as witness against my being , that to spare you I came no more to Corinth .
47001024	Not that we rule over your belief , but we are fellow workers for your joy , for you stand by belief .
47002001	And I decided this within myself , not to come to you again in sadness .
47002002	For if I make you sad , then who is he who makes me glad but the one who is made sad by me ?
47002003	And I wrote to you as I did , so that having come , I might not have sadness over those from whom I should have joy , trusting in you all that my joy is that of you all .
47002004	For out of much pressure and distress of heart I wrote to you , with many tears , not that you should be sad , but that you might know the love which I so richly have for you .
47002005	But if anyone has caused sadness , he has not made me sad , but in some degree you all – not to be too harsh .
47002006	For such a one this punishment , by the many , is sufficient ,
47002007	so that , on the contrary , you should rather forgive and comfort , lest somehow such a one be swallowed up with too much sadness .
47002008	So I appeal to you to confirm your love to him .
47002009	Besides , I wrote for this purpose also , that I might know the proof of you , if you are obedient in all matters .
47002010	And whom you forgive any matter , I do also . For indeed , if I have forgiven any matter , I have forgiven that one for your sakes in the sight of Messiah ,
47002011	lest Satan should take advantage of us , for we are not ignorant of his thoughts .
47002012	And when I came to Troas for the Good News of Messiah , and a door was opened to me by the Master ,
47002013	I had no rest in my spirit , because I did not find Titus my brother . But taking my leave of them , I went on to Makedonia .
47002014	But thanks be to Elohim who always leads us on , to overcome in Messiah , and manifests through us the fragrance of His knowledge in every place .
47002015	Because we are to Elohim the fragrance of Messiah among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing .
47002016	To the one we are the smell of death to death , and to the other the fragrance of life to life . And who is competent for these ?
47002017	For we are not , as so many , adulterating the Word of Elohim for gain – but as of sincerity , but as from Elohim , in the sight of Elohim , we speak in Messiah .
47003001	Are we to begin to recommend ourselves again ? Or do we need , as some , letters of recommendation to you , or from you ?
47003002	You are our letter , having been written in our hearts , known and read by all men ,
47003003	making it obvious that you are a letter of Messiah , served by us , written not with ink but by the Spirit of the living Elohim , not on tablets of stone but on fleshly tablets of the heart .
47003004	And such trust we have toward Elohim , through the Messiah .
47003005	Not that we are competent in ourselves to reckon any matter as from ourselves , but our competence is from Elohim ,
47003006	who also made us competent as servants of a renewed covenant , not of the letter but of the Spirit , for the letter kills but the Spirit gives life .
47003007	But if the administering of death in letters , engraved on stones , was esteemed , so that the children of Yisra’ĕl were unable to look steadily at the face of Mosheh because of the esteem of his face , which was passing away ,
47003008	how much more esteemed shall the administering of the Spirit not be ?
47003009	For if the administering of condemnation had esteem , the administering of righteousness exceeds much more in esteem .
47003010	For indeed what was made esteemed had no esteem in this respect , in view of the esteem that excels .
47003011	For if that which is passing away was esteemed , much more that which remains in esteem .
47003012	Having then such expectation , we use much boldness of speech ,
47003013	and not like Mosheh , who put a veil over his face so that the children of Yisra’ĕl should not look steadily at the end of what was passing away .
47003014	But their minds were hardened , for to this day , when the old covenant is being read , that same veil remains , not lifted , because in Messiah it is taken away .
47003015	But to this day , when Mosheh is being read , a veil lies on their heart .
47003016	And when one turns to the Master , the veil is taken away .
47003017	Now יהוה is the Spirit , and where the Spirit of יהוה is , there is freedom .
47003018	And we all , as with unveiled face we see as in a mirror the esteem of יהוה , are being transformed into the same likeness from esteem to esteem , as from יהוה , the Spirit .
47004001	Therefore , having this service , even as we received compassion , we do not lose heart ,
47004002	but have renounced the secret ways of shame , not walking in craftiness nor falsifying the Word of Elohim , but by the manifestation of the truth recommending ourselves to every human conscience , in the sight of Elohim .
47004003	And indeed , if our Good News has been veiled , it has been veiled in those who are perishing ,
47004004	in whom the mighty one of this age has blinded the minds of the unbelieving , so that the enlightening of the Good News of the esteem of Messiah , who is the likeness of Elohim , does not shine on them .
47004005	For we do not proclaim ourselves , but Messiah יהושע the Master , and ourselves your servants for the sake of יהושע .
47004006	For Elohim , who said , “ Let light shine out of darkness , ” is the One who has shone in our hearts for the enlightening of the knowledge of the esteem of Elohim in the face of יהושע Messiah .
47004007	And we have this treasure in earthen vessels , so that the excellence of the power might be of Elohim , and not of us –
47004008	being hard pressed on every side , but not crushed ; being perplexed , but not in despair ;
47004009	being persecuted , but not forsaken ; being thrown down , but not destroyed ;
47004010	always bearing about in the body the dying of the Master יהושע , that the life of יהושע might also be manifested in our body .
47004011	For we , the living , are always delivered to death for the sake of יהושע , that the life of יהושע might also be manifested in our mortal flesh ,
47004012	so that death indeed is working in us , but the life in you .
47004013	But having the same spirit of belief , according to what has been written , “ I believed , therefore I spoke , ” we also believe , therefore we also speak ,
47004014	knowing that He who raised up the Master יהושע shall also raise us up through יהושע , and shall present us with you .
47004015	For all this is for your sake , so that favour , having spread through the many , would cause thanksgiving to overflow , unto the esteem of Elohim .
47004016	Therefore we do not lose heart , but even if our outward man is perishing , the inward man is being renewed day by day .
47004017	For this slight momentary pressure , is working for us a far more exceeding and everlasting weight of esteem .
47004018	We are not looking on what is seen , but on what is not seen . For what is seen passes away , but what is not seen is everlasting .
47005001	For we know that if the tent of our earthly house , is destroyed , we have a building from Elohim , a house not made with hands , everlasting in the heavens .
47005002	For indeed in this we groan , longing to put on our dwelling which is from heaven ,
47005003	so that , having put it on , we shall not be found naked .
47005004	For indeed , we who are in this tent groan , being burdened , not because we wish to put it off , but to put on the other , so that what is to die might be swallowed up by life .
47005005	Now He who has prepared us for this same purpose is Elohim , who has given us the Spirit as a pledge of what is to come .
47005006	Therefore , being always of good courage , and knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Master –
47005007	for we walk by belief , not by sight –
47005008	we are of good courage , and are well pleased rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Master .
47005009	So we also make it our aim to be well-pleasing to Him , whether being at home , or being away from home .
47005010	For we all have to appear before the judgment seat of Messiah , in order for each one to receive according to what he has done in the body , whether good or evil .
47005011	Knowing , therefore , the fear of יהוה , we persuade men , but we have been made manifest to Elohim , and I also trust in your consciences to have been manifested .
47005012	For we do not again commend ourselves to you , but give you an occasion to boast on our behalf , in order that you have an answer for those who take pride in appearance and not in heart .
47005013	For whether we are beside ourselves , it was for Elohim , or whether we are of sound mind , it is for you .
47005014	For the love of Messiah compels us , having judged this : that if One died for all , then all died ;
47005015	and He died for all , that those who live should no longer live for themselves , but for Him who died for them , and was raised .
47005016	So from now onwards we know no one according to the flesh . And if we have known Messiah according to the flesh , yet now we no longer know Him thus .
47005017	Therefore , if anyone is in Messiah , he is a renewed creature – the old matters have passed away , see , all matters have become renewed !
47005018	And all matters are from Elohim , who has restored us to favour with Himself through יהושע Messiah , and has given us the service of restoration to favour ,
47005019	that is , that Elohim was in Messiah restoring the world to favour unto Himself , not reckoning their trespasses to them , and has committed to us the word of restoration to favour .
47005020	Therefore we are envoys on behalf of Messiah , as though Elohim were pleading through us . We beg , on behalf of Messiah : Be restored to favour with Elohim .
47005021	For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us , so that in Him we might become the righteousness of Elohim .
47006001	And working together , we also call upon you not to receive the favour of Elohim in vain –
47006002	For He says , “ In an acceptable time I have heard you , and in a day of deliverance I have helped you . ” See , now is the well-accepted time , see , now is a day of deliverance –
47006003	giving no cause of stumbling in whatever , so that the service is not blamed .
47006004	Rather , we commend ourselves as servants of Elohim in every way : in much endurance , in pressures , in hardships , in distresses ,
47006005	in stripes , in imprisonments , in disturbances , in toils , in watchings , in fastings ,
47006006	in cleanness , in knowledge , in patience , in kindness , in the Set-apart Spirit , in love unfeigned ,
47006007	in the word of truth , in the power of Elohim , through the weapons of righteousness , on the right and on the left ,
47006008	through esteem and disrespect , through evil report and good report ; regarded as deceivers , and yet true ;
47006009	as unknown , and yet well-known ; as dying , and see , we live ; as disciplined , and yet not killed ;
47006010	as sad , yet always rejoicing ; as poor , yet enriching many ; as having none , and yet possessing all .
47006011	Our mouth has spoken openly to you , O Corinthians , our heart is wide open .
47006012	You are not restrained by us , but you are restrained by your own affections .
47006013	But for the same reward – I speak as to children – open wide your hearts too .
47006014	Do not become unevenly yoked with unbelievers . For what partnership have righteousness and lawlessness ? And what fellowship has light with darkness ?
47006015	And what agreement has Messiah with Beliya‛al ? Or what part does a believer have with an unbeliever ?
47006016	And what union has the Dwelling Place of Elohim with idols ? For you are a Dwelling Place of the living Elohim , as Elohim has said , “ I shall dwell in them and walk among them , and I shall be their Elohim , and they shall be My people . ”
47006017	Therefore , “ Come out from among them and be separate , says יהוה , and do not touch what is unclean , and I shall receive you .
47006018	“ And I shall be a Father to you , and you shall be sons and daughters to Me , says יהוה the Almighty . ”
47007001	Having , then , these promises , beloved , let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of the flesh and spirit , perfecting set-apartness in the fear of Elohim .
47007002	Make room for us , we wronged no one , we corrupted no one , we exploited no one .
47007003	I do not say this to condemn , for I previously said that you are in our hearts , to die together and to live together .
47007004	Great is my boldness of speech toward you , great is my boasting on your behalf . I have been filled with encouragement , I overflow with joy in all our pressure .
47007005	For , indeed , when we came into Makedonia , our flesh had no rest , but we were hard pressed on every side – conflicts without , fears within .
47007006	But Elohim , who encourages the downcast , encouraged us by the coming of Titus ,
47007007	and not only by his coming , but also by the encouragement with which he was encouraged over you , when he reported to us your longing , your mourning , your ardour for me , so that I greatly rejoiced .
47007008	For even if I made you sad with my letter , I do not regret it , though I did regret it . For I perceive that the same letter made you sad , even if for an hour .
47007009	I now rejoice , not that you were made sad , but that you were saddened into repenting . For you were made sad according to Elohim , so that you suffered no loss from us .
47007010	For sadness according to Elohim works repentance to deliverance , not to be regretted , but the sadness of the world works death .
47007011	For see how you have been saddened according to Elohim – how much it worked out in you eagerness ; indeed , clearing of yourselves ; indeed , displeasure ; indeed , fear ; indeed , longing ; indeed , ardour ; indeed , righting of wrong ! In every way you proved yourselves to be clear in the matter .
47007012	So although I wrote to you , it was not for the sake of him who had done the wrong , nor for the sake of him who suffered wrong , but for the sake of revealing our diligence for you , before Elohim .
47007013	For this reason we have been encouraged in your encouragement . And we rejoiced exceedingly more for the joy of Titus , because his spirit has been refreshed by all of you .
47007014	Because if I have boasted somewhat about you to him , I am not ashamed . But as we spoke to you in all truth , even so our boasting to Titus was found true .
47007015	And his tender feelings are greater for you as he remembers the obedience of all of you , as you received him with fear and trembling .
47007016	I rejoice that in every way I am of good courage by reason of you .
47008001	Now brothers , we make known to you the favour of Elohim which has been given in the assemblies of Makedonia :
47008002	that in much trial of pressure the overflowing of their joy and their deep poverty overflowed into the riches of their generosity .
47008003	Because I bear witness that according to their ability , and beyond their ability , they gave voluntarily ,
47008004	begging us with much urgency for the favour of taking part in this service to the set-apart ones .
47008005	And , not as we had expected , they gave themselves first to the Master , and then to us by the desire of Elohim ,
47008006	that we should urge Titus , that as he had begun , so he would also complete this kind gift in you as well .
47008007	But as you excel in every way – in belief , and speech , and knowledge , and all diligence , and in your love for us – that you should excel in this kind gift as well .
47008008	I speak not by command , but I am proving the genuineness of your love by the eagerness of others .
47008009	For you know the favour of our Master יהושע Messiah , that being rich , He became poor for your sake , so that you might become rich through His poverty .
47008010	And in this I give an opinion : It is to your advantage not only to be doing what you began and were desiring to do a year ago ,
47008011	and now also complete the work , that as there was a readiness in desiring it , so there also should be a completion out of what you have .
47008012	For if the readiness is present , it is well received according to what one has , not according to what he does not have –
47008013	not , however , that others should be eased and you hard pressed ,
47008014	but by fair sharing , that now at this time your plenty for their need , so that their plenty might also be for your need – that there might be fair sharing .
47008015	As it has been written , “ He who gathered much did not have too much , and he who gathered little had not less . ”
47008016	But thanks be to Elohim who puts the same eagerness for you into the heart of Titus .
47008017	Because he received the appeal , indeed , but being more eager , he went to you of his own accord .
47008018	And we sent with him the brother whose praise is in the Good News through all the assemblies ,
47008019	and not only so , but who was also chosen by the assemblies to travel with us with this gift that is administered by us to the esteem of the Master Himself , and your ready mind ,
47008020	avoiding this : that anyone should blame us in this generous gift which is administered by us .
47008021	For we provide what is right , not only in the sight of יהוה , but also in the sight of men .
47008022	And we sent with them our brother whom we have often proved eager in many ways , but now much more eager , because of the great reliance which we have in you .
47008023	As for Titus , he is my partner and fellow worker for you . As for our brothers , they are messengers of the assemblies , the esteem of Messiah .
47008024	Therefore show to them the proof of your love and of our boasting on your behalf , and in the presence of the assemblies .
47009001	Indeed , concerning the service to the set-apart ones , it is unnecessary for me to write to you ;
47009002	for I know your eagerness , about which I boast of you to the Makedonians , that Achaia was ready a year ago . And your ardour has stirred up most of them .
47009003	But I sent the brothers , lest our boasting on behalf of you should be made empty in this part , in order that , as I said , you were ready ,
47009004	lest if some Makedonians come with me and find you not ready , we – not to speak of you – should be put to shame because of our belief .
47009005	So I thought it necessary to appeal to the brothers to come to you in advance , and arrange your promised blessing beforehand – this to be ready as a blessing and not as greediness .
47009006	And this : He who sows sparingly shall also reap sparingly , and he who sows on blessing shall also reap on blessing .
47009007	Let each one give as he purposes in his heart , not of grief or of necessity , for Elohim loves a joyous giver .
47009008	And Elohim is able to make all favour overflow toward you , that you , always having all you need in every way , have plenty for every good work .
47009009	As it has been written , “ He scattered abroad , He gave to the poor , His righteousness remains forever . ”
47009010	And He who supplies seed to the sower , and bread for food , shall supply and increase the seed you have sown and increase the fruit of your righteousness ,
47009011	being enriched in every way for all simplicity , which works out thanksgiving to Elohim through us .
47009012	Because the rendering of this service not only supplies the needs of the set-apart ones , but also is overflowing through many thanksgivings to Elohim .
47009013	Through the proof of this service , they esteem Elohim on the submission of your confession to the Good News of Messiah , and generosity in sharing with them and all men ,
47009014	and by their prayer for you , who long for you because of the exceeding favour of Elohim in you .
47009015	Thanks also to Elohim for His unspeakable gift !
47010001	And I , Sha’ul , myself appeal to you , through the meekness and gentleness of Messiah – I who am indeed lowly when face to face with you , but bold toward you when absent !
47010002	But I pray , that when I am present , I might not be bold with that bravery by which I think to be bold against some who reckon us as if we walked according to the flesh .
47010003	For though we walk in the flesh , we do not fight according to the flesh .
47010004	For the weapons we fight with are not fleshly but mighty in Elohim for overthrowing strongholds ,
47010005	overthrowing reasonings and every high matter that exalts itself against the knowledge of Elohim , taking captive every thought to make it obedient to the Messiah ,
47010006	and being ready to punish all disobedience , when your obedience is complete .
47010007	Take a look at what you are facing . If anyone seems to trust in himself that he is of Messiah , let him reckon again for himself , that as he is of Messiah , so also are we .
47010008	For even if I should boast somewhat more about our authority , which the Master gave us for building up , and not for overthrowing you , I shall not be put to shame ,
47010009	lest I seem to frighten you away by letters .
47010010	Because they say , “ His letters are truly weighty and strong , but his bodily presence is weak , and his speech amounts to naught . ”
47010011	Let such a one take this into account , that what we are in word by letters when absent , such we are also in deed when we are present .
47010012	For we do not presume to count ourselves or compare ourselves with those who commend themselves . But they , measuring themselves by themselves , and comparing themselves among themselves , are not wise .
47010013	But we shall not boast beyond measure , but within the measure of the limits Elohim assigned unto us , to reach even to you .
47010014	For we are not overextending ourselves , as if we did not reach to you , for we also came to you with the Good News of the Messiah ,
47010015	not boasting beyond measure in the labours of others , but having an expectation , that as your belief grows , we shall be greatly enlarged by you , according to our limits ,
47010016	to bring the Good News in the parts beyond you – not to boast in another’s limits in what has been accomplished .
47010017	But “ He who boasts , let him boast in יהוה . ”
47010018	For not he who commends himself is approved , but he whom the Master commends .
47011001	I wish that you would bear with me in a little folly . But indeed , you are bearing with me .
47011002	For I am jealous for you with a jealousy according to Elohim . For I gave you in marriage to one husband , to present you as an innocent maiden to Messiah .
47011003	But I am afraid , lest , as the serpent deceived Ḥawwah by his trickery , so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Messiah .
47011004	For , indeed , if he who is coming proclaims another יהושע , whom we have not proclaimed , or if you receive a different spirit which you have not received , or a different Good News which you have not accepted , you put up with it well enough !
47011005	For I reckon that I am not inferior to the most eminent emissaries .
47011006	But even if I am unskilled in word , yet not in knowledge . Indeed , in every way we have been manifested among you in all matters .
47011007	Or did I commit sin in humbling myself in order to exalt you , because I brought good news , the Good News of Elohim to you without being paid ?
47011008	Other assemblies I robbed , by receiving wages from them to serve you .
47011009	And when I was present with you , and in need , I was not a burden to anyone , for what was lacking to me the brothers who came from Makedonia supplied . And in every way I kept myself – and shall keep – from being a burden to you .
47011010	It is a truth of Messiah in me , that this boasting in me shall not be stopped in the districts of Achaia .
47011011	Why ? Is it that I do not love you ? Elohim knows !
47011012	And I shall go on doing as I do , in order to cut off the occasion from those desiring an occasion , so that in that which they boast , they might be found also as we are .
47011013	For such are false emissaries , deceptive workers , masquerading as emissaries of Messiah .
47011014	And no wonder ! For Satan himself masquerades as a messenger of light !
47011015	It is not surprising , then , if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness , whose end shall be according to their works !
47011016	Again I say , let no one think me to be a fool . And if otherwise , at least receive me as a fool , for me to also boast a little .
47011017	What I speak , I speak not according to the Master , but as in foolishness , in this boldness of boasting .
47011018	Since many boast according to the flesh , I too shall boast .
47011019	For you , being wise , put up with fools gladly !
47011020	For you put up with it if anyone enslaves you , if anyone devours you , if anyone takes from you , if anyone exalts himself , if one hits you in the face .
47011021	To my shame , I say that we were too weak for that ! But in whatever anyone is bold – I say it in foolishness – I am bold also .
47011022	Are they Heḇrews ? So am I . Are they Yisra’ĕlites ? So am I . Are they the seed of Aḇraham ? So am I .
47011023	Are they servants of Messiah ? – I speak as beside myself – I am more , in labours much more , in stripes above measure , in prisons more frequently , in deaths many times .
47011024	Five times I received from the Yehuḏim forty stripes less one .
47011025	Three times I was beaten with rods , once I was stoned , three times I was shipwrecked , a night and a day I have been in the deep ,
47011026	in many travels , in dangers of waters , in dangers of robbers , in dangers from my own race , in dangers from the gentiles , in dangers in the city , in dangers in the desert , in dangers in the sea , in dangers among false brothers ;
47011027	in toil and hardship , in watchings often , in hunger and thirst , in fastings often , in cold and nakedness ,
47011028	besides the matters from outside , what comes upon me daily : the anxiety for all the assemblies .
47011029	Who is weak , and I am not weak ? Who is made to stumble , and I do not burn inwardly ?
47011030	If I have to boast , I shall boast of matters that show up my weakness .
47011031	The Elohim and Father of our Master יהושע Messiah , who is blessed forever , knows that I am not lying .
47011032	In Damascus the governor , under Aretas the sovereign , was guarding the city of the Damascenes , wishing to seize me ,
47011033	but through a window I was let down in a basket by the wall , and escaped from his hands .
47012001	To boast , indeed , is useless for me , for I shall go on to visions and revelations of יהוה .
47012002	I know a man in Messiah who fourteen years ago – whether in the body I do not know , or whether out of the body I do not know , Elohim knows – such a one was caught up to the third heaven .
47012003	And I know such a man – whether in the body or out of the body I do not know , Elohim knows –
47012004	that he was caught up into Paradise and heard unspeakable words , which it is not right for a man to speak .
47012005	Of such a one I shall boast , but of myself I shall not boast , except in my weaknesses .
47012006	For if I shall wish to boast , I shall not be a fool , for I shall speak the truth . But I refrain , lest anyone should think more of me than what he sees in me , or hears of me .
47012007	And to keep me from exalting myself because of the exceeding greatness of the revelations , a thorn in the flesh was given to me , a messenger of Satan to hit me , to keep me from exalting myself .
47012008	Concerning this I pleaded with the Master three times to take it away from me .
47012009	And He said to me , “ My favour is sufficient for you , for My power is perfected in weakness . ” Most gladly , then , I shall rather boast in my weaknesses , so that the power of Messiah rests on me .
47012010	Therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses , in insults , in needs , in persecutions , in distresses , for the sake of Messiah . For when I am weak , then I am strong .
47012011	I have become a fool – you have compelled me . For I should have been commended by you , for in no respect was I behind the most eminent emissaries , though I am a nobody .
47012012	Indeed , the signs of an emissary were wrought among you with all endurance , in signs and wonders and powers .
47012013	For what is there in which you were inferior to other assemblies , except that I myself was not a burden to you ? Forgive me this wrong !
47012014	See , I am ready to come to you for the third time . And I shall not be a burden to you , for I do not seek yours , but you . For the children should not lay up for the parents , but the parents for the children .
47012015	And I shall most gladly spend and be spent for your lives . If I love you more and more , am I to be loved less ?
47012016	But be it so , I did not burden you . But being crafty , did I catch you with guile ?
47012017	Did I take advantage of you by any of those whom I sent to you ?
47012018	I urged Titus , and sent our brother with him . Did Titus take advantage of you ? Did we not walk in the same spirit – not in the same steps ?
47012019	Again , do you think that we defend ourselves to you ? We speak before Elohim in Messiah . But all this , beloved , is for your upbuilding .
47012020	For I fear lest , when I come , I do not find you such as I wish , and I be found by you such as you do not wish – lest there be strife , jealousies , outbursts of wrath , selfish ambitions , slander , gossip , puffings up , unrests ,
47012021	and lest , when I come again , my Elohim should humble me among you , and I shall mourn for many who have sinned before and have not repented of the uncleanness , and whoring , and indecency which they have practised .
47013001	This is the third time I am coming to you . “ By the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall be established . ”
47013002	I have previously said , and I say beforehand , as being present the second time , and now being absent I write to those who have sinned before , and to all the rest , that if I come again I shall not spare ,
47013003	since you are seeking for proof of Messiah speaking in me , who is not weak toward you , but mighty in you .
47013004	For though He was impaled in weakness , yet He lives by the power of Elohim . For we also are weak in Him , but we shall live with Him by the power of Elohim toward you .
47013005	Examine yourselves whether you are in the belief – prove yourselves . Or do you not know yourselves , that יהושע Messiah is in you , unless you are disapproved .
47013006	And I trust that you shall know that we are not disapproved .
47013007	And we pray to Elohim that you do no evil at all – not that we should appear approved , but that you should do what is right , even though we should appear unapproved .
47013008	For we have no power at all against the truth , but for the truth .
47013009	For we rejoice when we are weak and you are strong . And this also we pray for : your perfection .
47013010	For this reason I write this in my absence , so that , being present I should not use sharpness , according to the authority which the Master has given me for upbuilding and not for overthrowing .
47013011	For the rest , brothers , rejoice . Be made perfect , be encouraged , be of one mind , live in peace . And the Elohim of love and peace shall be with you .
47013012	Greet one another with a set-apart kiss .
47013013	All the set-apart ones greet you .
47013014	The favour of the Master יהושע Messiah , and the love of Elohim , and the fellowship of the Set-apart Spirit be with all of you . Amĕn .
48001001	Sha’ul , an emissary – not from men , nor by a man , but by יהושע Messiah and Elohim the Father who raised Him from the dead –
48001002	and all the brothers who are with me , to the assemblies of Galatia :
48001003	Favour to you and peace from Elohim the Father and our Master יהושע Messiah ,
48001004	who gave Himself for our sins , to deliver us out of this present wicked age , according to the desire of our Elohim and Father ,
48001005	to whom be the praise forever and ever . Amĕn .
48001006	I marvel that you are so readily turning away from Him who called you in the favour of Messiah , to a different ‘ Good News , ’
48001007	which is not another , only there are some who are troubling you and wishing to pervert the Good News of Messiah .
48001008	However , even if we , or a messenger out of heaven , bring a ‘ Good News’ to you beside what we announced to you , let him be accursed .
48001009	As we have said before , and now I say again , if anyone brings a ‘ Good News’ to you beside what you have received , let him be accursed .
48001010	For do I now persuade men , or Elohim ? Or do I seek to please men ? For if I still pleased men , I should not be a servant of Messiah .
48001011	And I make known to you , brothers , that the Good News announced by me is not according to man .
48001012	For I did not receive it from man , nor was I taught it , but through a revelation of יהושע Messiah .
48001013	For you have heard of my former way of life in Yehuḏaism , how intensely I persecuted the assembly of Elohim , and ravaged it .
48001014	And I progressed in Yehuḏaism beyond many of my age in my race , being more exceedingly ardent for the traditions of my fathers .
48001015	But when it pleased Elohim , who separated me from my mother’s womb and called me by His favour ,
48001016	to reveal His Son in me , that I might bring Him , the Good News , to the gentiles , I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood ,
48001017	neither did I go up to Yerushalayim , to those who were emissaries before me . But I went to Araḇia , and returned again to Damascus .
48001018	Then after three years I went up to Yerushalayim to learn from Kĕpha , and remained with him for fifteen days .
48001019	And I saw no other of the emissaries except Ya‛aqoḇ , the brother of the Master .
48001020	And what I write to you , see , before Elohim , I do not lie .
48001021	Then I went into the districts of Syria and of Kilikia .
48001022	And I was still not known by sight to the assemblies of Yehuḏah which were in Messiah ,
48001023	but they were hearing only that , “ The one who once persecuted us now brings as Good News the belief which he once ravaged . ”
48001024	So they were esteeming Elohim in me .
48002001	Then after fourteen years I again went up to Yerushalayim , with Barnaḇah , taking Titus along too .
48002002	And I went up by revelation , and laid before them that Good News which I proclaim among the gentiles , but separately to those who were esteemed , lest somehow I run , or had run , in vain .
48002003	But not even Titus who was with me , though a Greek , was compelled to be circumcised .
48002004	But as for the false brothers , sneakingly brought in , who sneaked in to spy out our freedom which we have in Messiah יהושע in order to enslave us ,
48002005	to these we did not yield in subjection , not even for an hour , so that the truth of the Good News remains with you .
48002006	But from those who were esteemed to be whatever – what they were , it makes no difference to me , Elohim shows no partiality – for those who were esteemed contributed naught to me .
48002007	But on the contrary , when they saw that the Good News to the uncircumcised had been entrusted to me , even as Kĕpha to the circumcised –
48002008	for He who worked in Kĕpha to make him an emissary to the circumcised also worked in me for the gentiles .
48002009	So when Ya‛aqoḇ , Kĕpha , and Yoḥanan , who seemed to be supports , came to know the favour that had been given to me , they gave me and Barnaḇah the right hand of fellowship , in order that we go to the gentiles and they to the circumcised ,
48002010	only that we might remember the poor , which I myself was eager to do .
48002011	And when Kĕpha had come to Antioch , I withstood him to his face , because he was at fault .
48002012	For before some came from Ya‛aqoḇ , he was eating with the gentiles , but when they came , he began to withdraw and separate himself , in fear of those of the circumcision .
48002013	And the rest of the Yehuḏim joined him in hypocrisy , so that even Barnaḇah was led away by their hypocrisy .
48002014	But when I saw that they are not walking straight according to the truth of the Good News , I said to Kĕpha before them all , “ If you , being a Yehuḏite , live as a gentile and not as the Yehuḏim , why do you compel gentiles to live as Yehuḏim ?
48002015	“ We , Yehuḏim by nature , and not of the gentiles , sinners ,
48002016	knowing that a man is not declared right by works of Torah , but through belief in יהושע Messiah , even we have believed in Messiah יהושע , in order to be declared right by belief in Messiah and not by works of Torah , because by works of Torah no flesh shall be declared right .
48002017	“ And if , while seeking to be declared right by Messiah , we ourselves also are found sinners , is Messiah then a servant of sin ? Let it not be !
48002018	“ For if I rebuild what I once overthrew , I establish myself a transgressor .
48002019	“ For through Torah I died to Torah , in order to live to Elohim .
48002020	“ I have been impaled with Messiah , and I no longer live , but Messiah lives in me . And that which I now live in the flesh I live by belief in the Son of Elohim , who loved me and gave Himself for me .
48002021	“ I do not set aside the favour of Elohim , for if righteousness is through Torah , then Messiah died for naught . ”
48003001	O senseless Galatians ! Who has put you under a spell , not to obey the truth – before whose eyes יהושע Messiah was clearly portrayed among you as impaled ?
48003002	This only I wish to learn from you : Did you receive the Spirit by works of Torah , or by the hearing of belief ?
48003003	Are you so senseless ? Having begun in the Spirit , do you now end in the flesh ?
48003004	Have you suffered so much in vain – if indeed in vain ?
48003005	Is He , then , who is supplying the Spirit to you and working miracles among you , doing it by works of Torah , or by hearing of belief ?
48003006	Even so Aḇraham “ did believe Elohim , and it was reckoned unto him as righteousness . ”
48003007	Know , then , that those who are of belief are sons of Aḇraham .
48003008	And the Scripture , having foreseen that Elohim would declare right the nations by belief , announced the Good News to Aḇraham beforehand , saying , “ All the nations shall be blessed in you , ”
48003009	so that those who are of belief are blessed with Aḇraham , the believer .
48003010	For as many as are of works of Torah are under the curse , for it has been written , “ Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all that has been written in the book of the Torah , to do them . ”
48003011	And that no one is declared right by Torah before Elohim is clear , for “ The righteous shall live by belief . ”
48003012	And the Torah is not of belief , but “ The man who does them shall live by them . ”
48003013	Messiah redeemed us from the curse of the Torah , having become a curse for us – for it has been written , “ Cursed is everyone who hangs upon a tree . ” –
48003014	in order that the blessing of Aḇraham might come upon the nations in Messiah יהושע , to receive the promise of the Spirit through belief .
48003015	Brothers , as a man I say it : a covenant , even though it is man’s , yet if it is confirmed , no one sets it aside , or adds to it .
48003016	But the promises were spoken to Aḇraham , and to his Seed . He does not say , “ And to seeds , ” as of many , but as of one , “ And to your Seed , ” who is Messiah .
48003017	Now this I say , Torah , that came four hundred and thirty years later , does not annul a covenant previously confirmed by Elohim in Messiah , so as to do away with the promise .
48003018	For if the inheritance is by Torah , it is no longer by promise , but Elohim gave it to Aḇraham through a promise .
48003019	Why , then , the Torah ? It was added because of transgressions , until the Seed should come to whom the promise was made . And it was ordained through messengers in the hand of a mediator .
48003020	The Mediator , however , is not of one , but Elohim is one .
48003021	Is the Torah then against the promises of Elohim ? Let it not be ! For if a law had been given that was able to make alive , truly righteousness would have been by Torah .
48003022	But the Scripture has shut up all mankind under sin , that the promise by belief in יהושע Messiah might be given to those who believe .
48003023	But before belief came , we were being guarded under Torah , having been shut up for the belief being about to be revealed .
48003024	Therefore the Torah became our trainer unto Messiah , in order to be declared right by belief .
48003025	And after belief has come , we are no longer under a trainer .
48003026	For you are all sons of Elohim through belief in Messiah יהושע .
48003027	For as many of you as were immersed into Messiah have put on Messiah .
48003028	There is not Yehuḏite nor Greek , there is not slave nor free , there is not male and female , for you are all one in Messiah יהושע .
48003029	And if you are of Messiah , then you are seed of Aḇraham , and heirs according to promise .
48004001	And I say , for as long as the heir is a child , he is no different from a slave , though he is master of all ,
48004002	but is under guardians and trustees till the time prearranged by the father .
48004003	So we also , when we were children , were under the elementary matters of the world , being enslaved .
48004004	But when the completion of the time came , Elohim sent forth His Son , born of a woman , born under Torah ,
48004005	to redeem those who were under Torah , in order to receive the adoption as sons .
48004006	And because you are sons , Elohim has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts , crying , “ Abba , Father ! ”
48004007	So you are no longer a slave but a son , and if a son , also an heir of Elohim through Messiah .
48004008	But then , indeed , not knowing Elohim , you served those which by nature are not mighty ones .
48004009	But now after you have known Elohim , or rather are known by Elohim , how do you turn again to the weak and poor elementary matters , to which you wish to be enslaved again ?
48004010	You observe days and months and seasons and years .
48004011	I fear for you , lest by any means I have laboured for you in vain .
48004012	Brothers , I beg you to become as I am , because I am as you are . You did not wrong me at all .
48004013	But you know that through weakness of the flesh I brought the Good News to you before .
48004014	And my trial which was in my flesh you did not despise or reject , but you received me as a messenger of Elohim , as Messiah יהושע .
48004015	What then was your blessedness ? For I bear you witness , that if possible , you would have plucked out your own eyes and given them to me .
48004016	So then , have I become your enemy , speaking truth to you ?
48004017	They are ardent towards you , for no good , but they wish to shut you out , that you might be ardent towards them .
48004018	And it is good always to be ardent in what is good , and not only when I am present with you .
48004019	My little children , for whom I am again in birth pains until Messiah is formed in you ,
48004020	even now I wish to be present with you now and to change my voice , for I have doubts about you .
48004021	Say to me , you who wish to be under Torah , do you not hear the Torah ?
48004022	For it has been written that Aḇraham had two sons , one by a female servant , the other by a free woman .
48004023	But he who was of the female servant was born according to the flesh , and he of the free woman through promise .
48004024	This is allegorical , for these are the two covenants : one indeed from Mount Sinai which brings forth slavery , which is Hag̅ar ,
48004025	for this Hag̅ar is Mount Sinai in Araḇia , and corresponds to Yerushalayim which now is , and is in slavery with her children .
48004026	But the Yerushalayim above is free , which is the mother of us all .
48004027	For it has been written , “ Rejoice , O barren , you who do not bear ! Break forth and shout , you who do not have birth pains ! For the deserted one has many more children than she who has a husband . ”
48004028	And we , brothers , as Yitsḥaq was , are children of promise .
48004029	But , as he who was born according to the flesh then persecuted him born according to the Spirit , so also now .
48004030	But what does the Scripture say ? “ Cast out the female servant and her son , for the son of the female servant shall by no means be heir with the son of the free woman . ”
48004031	Therefore , brothers , we are not children of the female servant but of the free woman .
48005001	In the freedom with which Messiah has made us free , stand firm , then , and do not again be held with a yoke of slavery .
48005002	See , I , Sha’ul , say to you that if you become circumcised , Messiah shall be of no use to you .
48005003	And I witness again to every man being circumcised that he is a debtor to do the entire Torah .
48005004	You who are declared right by Torah have severed yourselves from Messiah , you have fallen from favour .
48005005	For we , in Spirit , by belief , eagerly wait for the expectation of righteousness .
48005006	For in Messiah יהושע neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any strength , but belief working through love .
48005007	You were running well , who held you back from obeying the truth ?
48005008	That persuasion does not come from Him who calls you .
48005009	A little leaven leavens all the lump .
48005010	I trust in you , in the Master , that you shall have no other mind . And he who is troubling you shall bear his judgment , whoever he is .
48005011	And I , brothers , if I still proclaim circumcision , why am I still persecuted ? Then the stumbling-block of the stake has been set aside .
48005012	O that those who disturb you would even cut themselves off !
48005013	For you , brothers , have been called to freedom , only do not use freedom as an occasion for the flesh , but through love serve one another .
48005014	For the entire Torah is completed in one word , in this , “ You shall love your neighbour as yourself . ”
48005015	And if you bite and devour one another , beware lest you be consumed by one another !
48005016	And I say : Walk in the Spirit , and you shall not accomplish the lust of the flesh .
48005017	For the flesh lusts against the Spirit , and the Spirit against the flesh . And these are opposed to each other , so that you do not do what you desire to do .
48005018	But if you are led by the Spirit , you are not under Torah .
48005019	And the works of the flesh are well-known , which are these : adultery , whoring , uncleanness , indecency ,
48005020	idolatry , drug sorcery , hatred , quarrels , jealousies , fits of rage , selfish ambitions , dissensions , factions ,
48005021	envy , murders , drunkenness , wild parties , and the like – of which I forewarn you , even as I also said before , that those who practise such as these shall not inherit the reign of Elohim .
48005022	But the fruit of the Spirit is love , joy , peace , patience , kindness , goodness , trustworthiness ,
48005023	gentleness , self-control . Against such there is no Torah .
48005024	And those who are of Messiah have impaled the flesh with its passions and the desires .
48005025	If we live in the Spirit , let us also walk in the Spirit .
48005026	Let us not become conceited , provoking one another , envying one another .
48006001	Brothers , if a man is overtaken in some trespass , you the spiritual ones , set such a one straight in a spirit of meekness , looking at yourself lest you be tried too .
48006002	Bear one another’s burdens , and so complete the Torah of Messiah .
48006003	For if anyone thinks himself to be somebody , when he is not , he deceives himself .
48006004	But let each one examine his own work , and then he shall have boasting in himself alone , and not in another .
48006005	For each one shall bear his own burden .
48006006	And let him who is instructed in the Word share in all that is good , with him who is instructing .
48006007	Do not be led astray : Elohim is not mocked , for whatever a man sows , that he shall also reap .
48006008	Because he who sows to his own flesh shall reap corruption from the flesh , but he who sows to the Spirit shall reap everlasting life from the Spirit .
48006009	And let us not lose heart in doing good , for in due season we shall reap if we do not grow weary .
48006010	So then , as we have occasion , let us do good to all , especially to those who are of the household of the belief .
48006011	See with what big letters I have written to you with my own hand !
48006012	As many as wish to make a good show in the flesh , these compel you to be circumcised , only so that they should not be persecuted for the stake of Messiah .
48006013	For those who are circumcised do not even watch over the Torah , but they wish to have you circumcised so that they might boast in your flesh .
48006014	And for me , let it not be that I should boast except in the stake of our Master יהושע Messiah , through whom the world has been impaled to me , and I to the world .
48006015	For in Messiah יהושע neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any strength , but a renewed creature .
48006016	And as many as walk according to this rule , peace and compassion be upon them , and upon the Yisra’ĕl of Elohim .
48006017	From now on let no one trouble me , for I bear in my body the scars of the Master יהושע .
48006018	The favour of our Master יהושע Messiah be with your spirit , brothers . Amĕn .
49001001	Sha’ul , an emissary of יהושע Messiah by the desire of Elohim , to the set-apart ones who are in Ephesos , and true to Messiah יהושע :
49001002	Favour to you and peace from Elohim our Father and the Master יהושע Messiah .
49001003	Blessed be the Elohim and Father of our Master יהושע Messiah , who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Messiah ,
49001004	even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world , that we should be set-apart and blameless before Him in love ,
49001005	having previously ordained us to adoption as sons through יהושע Messiah to Himself , according to the good pleasure of His desire ,
49001006	to the praise of the esteem of His favour with which He favoured us in the Beloved ,
49001007	in whom we have redemption through His blood , the forgiveness of trespasses , according to the riches of His favour ,
49001008	which He has lavished on us in all wisdom and insight ,
49001009	having made known to us the secret of His desire , according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Him ,
49001010	to administer at the completion of time , to gather together in one all in Messiah , both which are in the heavens and which are on earth , in Him ,
49001011	in whom also we did obtain an inheritance , being previously ordained according to the purpose of Him working all matters according to the counsel of His desire ,
49001012	for us to be the praise of His esteem – those having first trusted in Messiah ,
49001013	in whom you also , having heard the word of the truth , the Good News of your deliverance , in whom also , having believed , you were sealed with the Set-apart Spirit of promise ,
49001014	who is the pledge of our inheritance , until the redemption of the purchased possession , to the praise of His esteem .
49001015	For this reason I too , having heard of your belief in the Master יהושע and your love for all the set-apart ones ,
49001016	do not cease giving thanks for you , making mention of you in my prayers ,
49001017	that the Elohim of our Master יהושע Messiah , the Father of esteem , would give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him ,
49001018	the eyes of your understanding being enlightened , so that you know what is the expectation of His calling , and what are the riches of the esteem of His inheritance in the set-apart ones ,
49001019	and what is the exceeding greatness of His power toward us who are believing , according to the working of His mighty strength ,
49001020	which He wrought in the Messiah when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenlies ,
49001021	far above all rule and authority and power and mastery , and every name that is named , not only in this age but also in that which is to come .
49001022	And He put all under His feet , and gave Him to be head over all , to the assembly ,
49001023	which is His body , the completeness of Him who fills all in all .
49002001	And you were dead in trespasses and sins ,
49002002	in which you once walked according to the course of this world , according to the ruler of the authority of the air , of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience ,
49002003	among whom also we all once lived in the lusts of our flesh , doing the desires of the flesh and of the mind , and were by nature children of wrath , as also the rest .
49002004	But Elohim , who is rich in compassion , because of His great love with which He loved us ,
49002005	even when we were dead in trespasses , made us alive together with Messiah – by favour you have been saved –
49002006	and raised us up together , and made us sit together in the heavenlies in Messiah יהושע ,
49002007	in order to show in the coming ages the exceeding riches of His favour in kindness toward us in Messiah יהושע .
49002008	For by favour you have been saved , through belief , and that not of yourselves , it is the gift of Elohim ,
49002009	it is not by works , so that no one should boast .
49002010	For we are His workmanship , created in Messiah יהושע unto good works , which Elohim prepared beforehand that we should walk in them .
49002011	Therefore remember that you , once gentiles in the flesh , who are called ‘ the uncircumcision’ by what is called ‘ the circumcision’ made in the flesh by hands ,
49002012	that at that time you were without Messiah , excluded from the citizenship of Yisra’ĕl and strangers from the covenants of promise , having no expectation and without Elohim in the world .
49002013	But now in Messiah יהושע you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of the Messiah .
49002014	For He is our peace , who has made both one , and having broken down the partition of the barrier ,
49002015	having abolished in His flesh the enmity – the Torah of the commands in dogma – so as to create in Himself one renewed man from the two , thus making peace ,
49002016	and to completely restore to favour both of them unto Elohim in one body through the stake , having destroyed the enmity by it .
49002017	And having come , He brought as Good News peace to you who were far off , and peace to those near .
49002018	Because through Him we both have access to the Father by one Spirit .
49002019	So then you are no longer strangers and foreigners , but fellow citizens with the set-apart ones and members of the household of Elohim ,
49002020	having been built upon the foundation of the emissaries and prophets , יהושע Messiah Himself being chief corner-stone ,
49002021	in whom all the building , being joined together , grows into a set-apart Dwelling Place in יהוה ,
49002022	in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling of Elohim in the Spirit .
49003001	Because of this I , Sha’ul , am the prisoner of יהושע Messiah on behalf of you gentiles –
49003002	if indeed you have heard of the administration of the favour of Elohim that was given to me for you ,
49003003	that by revelation was made known to me the secret , as I wrote before briefly .
49003004	In reading this , then , you are able to understand my insight into the secret of Messiah ,
49003005	which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations , as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to His set-apart emissaries and prophets :
49003006	The gentiles to be co-heirs , united in the same body , and partakers together in the promise in Messiah through the Good News ,
49003007	of which I became a servant according to the gift of the favour of Elohim given to me , according to the working of His power .
49003008	To me , the very least of all the set-apart ones , this favour was given , to bring the Good News of the unsearchable riches of Messiah among the gentiles ,
49003009	and to make all see how this secret is administered , which for ages past has been hidden in Elohim who created all through יהושע Messiah ,
49003010	so that now , through the assembly , the many-sided wisdom of Elohim might be known to the principalities and authorities in the heavenlies ,
49003011	according to the everlasting purpose which He made in Messiah יהושע our Master ,
49003012	in whom we have boldness and access , with reliance , through belief in Him .
49003013	I pray therefore , that you do not lose heart at my pressures on your behalf , which is your esteem .
49003014	For this reason I bow my knees to the Father of our Master יהושע Messiah ,
49003015	from whom all fatherhood in the heavens and earth is named ,
49003016	in order that He might give you , according to the riches of His esteem by power , to be strengthened in the inner man , through His Spirit ,
49003017	that the Messiah might dwell in your hearts through belief – having become rooted and grounded in love ,
49003018	in order that you might be strengthened to firmly grasp , with all the set-apart ones , what is the width and length and depth and height ,
49003019	to know the love of Messiah which surpasses knowledge , in order that you might be filled to all the completeness of Elohim .
49003020	And to Him who is able to do exceedingly above what we ask or think , according to the power that is working in us ,
49003021	to Him be esteem in the assembly by Messiah יהושע unto all generations , for ever and ever . Amĕn .
49004001	I call upon you therefore , I the prisoner of the Master , to walk worthily of the calling with which you were called ,
49004002	with all humility and meekness , with patience , bearing with one another in love ,
49004003	being eager to guard the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace –
49004004	one body and one Spirit , as you also were called in one expectation of your calling ,
49004005	one Master , one belief , one immersion ,
49004006	one Elohim and Father of all , who is above all , and through all , and in you all .
49004007	But to each one of us favour was given according to the measure of the gift of Messiah .
49004008	That is why it says , “ When He went up on high , He led captivity captive , and gave gifts to men . ”
49004009	But what does “ He went up ” mean , except that He also first went down into the lower parts of the earth ?
49004010	He who went down is also the One who went up far above all the heavens , to fill all .
49004011	And He Himself gave some as emissaries , and some as prophets , and some as evangelists , and some as shepherds and teachers
49004012	for the perfecting of the set-apart ones , to the work of service to a building up of the body of the Messiah ,
49004013	until we all come to the unity of the belief and of the knowledge of the Son of Elohim , to a perfect man , to the measure of the stature of the completeness of Messiah ,
49004014	so that we should no longer be children , tossed and borne about by every wind of teaching , by the trickery of men , in cleverness , unto the craftiness of leading astray ,
49004015	but , maintaining the truth in love , we grow up in all respects into Him who is the head , Messiah ,
49004016	from whom the entire body , joined and knit together by what every joint supplies , according to the working by which each part does its share , causes growth of the body for the building up of itself in love .
49004017	So this I say , and witness in the Master , that you should no longer walk as the gentiles walk , in the futility of their mind ,
49004018	having been darkened in their understanding , having been estranged from the life of Elohim , because of the ignorance that is in them , because of the hardness of their heart ,
49004019	who , having become callous , have given themselves up to indecency , to work all uncleanness with greediness .
49004020	But you have not so learned Messiah ,
49004021	if indeed you have heard Him and were taught by Him , as truth is in יהושע :
49004022	that you put off – with regard to your former way of life – the old man , being corrupted according to the desires of the deceit ,
49004023	and to be renewed in the spirit of your mind ,
49004024	and that you put on the renewed man which was created according to Elohim , in righteousness and set-apartness of the truth .
49004025	Therefore , having put off the false , speak truth , each one with his neighbour , for we are members of one another .
49004026	“ Be wroth , but do not sin . ” Do not let the sun go down on your rage ,
49004027	nor give place to the devil .
49004028	Let him who stole steal no more , but rather let him labour , working with his hands what is good , so that he has somewhat to share with those in need .
49004029	Let no corrupt word come out of your mouth , but only such as is good for the use of building up , so as to impart what is pleasant to the hearers .
49004030	And do not grieve the Set-apart Spirit of Elohim , by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption .
49004031	Let all bitterness , and wrath , and displeasure , and uproar , and slander be put away from you , along with all evil .
49004032	And be kind towards one another , tenderhearted , forgiving one another , as Elohim also forgave you in Messiah .
49005001	Become , then , imitators of Elohim as beloved children .
49005002	And walk in love , as Messiah also has loved us , and gave Himself for us , a gift and an offering to Elohim for a sweet-smelling fragrance .
49005003	But whoring and all uncleanness , or greed of gain , let it not even be named among you , as is proper among set-apart ones –
49005004	neither filthiness , nor foolish talking , nor coarse jesting , which are not fitting , but rather thanksgiving .
49005005	For this you know , that no one who whores , nor unclean one , nor one greedy of gain , who is an idolater , has any inheritance in the reign of Messiah and Elohim .
49005006	Let no one deceive you with empty words , for because of these the wrath of Elohim comes upon the sons of disobedience .
49005007	Therefore do not become partakers with them .
49005008	For you were once darkness , but now you are light in the Master . Walk as children of light –
49005009	for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness , and righteousness , and truth –
49005010	proving what is well-pleasing to the Master .
49005011	And have no fellowship with the fruitless works of darkness , but rather reprove them .
49005012	For it is a shame even to speak of what is done by them in secret .
49005013	But all matters being reproved are manifested by the light , for whatever is manifested is light .
49005014	That is why He says , “ Wake up , you who sleep , and arise from the dead , and Messiah shall shine on you . ”
49005015	See then that you walk exactly , not as unwise , but as wise ,
49005016	redeeming the time , because the days are wicked .
49005017	So then do not be foolish , but understand what the desire of יהוה is .
49005018	And do not be drunk with wine , in which is loose behaviour , but be filled with the Spirit ,
49005019	speaking to each other in psalms and songs of praise and spiritual songs , singing and striking the strings in your heart to the Master ,
49005020	giving thanks always for all to Elohim the Father , in the Name of our Master יהושע Messiah ,
49005021	subjecting yourselves to each other in the fear of Elohim .
49005022	Wives , subject yourselves to your own husbands , as to the Master .
49005023	Because the husband is head of the wife , as also the Messiah is head of the assembly , and He is Saviour of the body .
49005024	But as the assembly is subject to Messiah , so also let the wives be to their own husbands in every respect .
49005025	Husbands , love your wives , as Messiah also did love the assembly and gave Himself for it ,
49005026	in order to set it apart and cleanse it with the washing of water by the Word ,
49005027	in order to present it to Himself a splendid assembly , not having spot or wrinkle or any of this sort , but that it might be set-apart and blameless .
49005028	In this way husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies . He who loves his wife loves himself .
49005029	For no one ever hated his own flesh , but feeds and cherishes it , as also the Master does the assembly .
49005030	Because we are members of His body , of His flesh and of His bones .
49005031	“ For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife , and the two shall become one flesh . ”
49005032	This secret is great , but I speak concerning Messiah and the assembly .
49005033	However , you too , everyone , let each one love his own wife as himself , and let the wife see that she fears her husband .
49006001	Children , obey your parents in the Master , for this is right .
49006002	“ Respect your father and mother , ” which is the first command with promise ,
49006003	in order that it might be well with you , and you might live long on the earth . ”
49006004	And you , fathers , do not provoke your children , but bring them up in the instruction and admonition of the Master .
49006005	Servants , obey your masters according to the flesh , with fear and trembling , in sincerity of heart , as to Messiah ;
49006006	not with eye-service as men-pleasers , but as servants of Messiah , doing the desire of Elohim from the inner self ,
49006007	rendering service with pleasure , as to the Master , and not to men ,
49006008	knowing that whatever good anyone does , he shall receive the same from the Master , whether he is slave or free .
49006009	And , masters , do the same to them , refrain from threatening , knowing that your own Master also is in the heavens , and there is no partiality with Him .
49006010	For the rest , my brothers , be strong in the Master and in the mightiness of His strength .
49006011	Put on the complete armour of Elohim , for you to have power to stand against the schemes of the devil .
49006012	Because we do not wrestle against flesh and blood , but against principalities , against authorities , against the world-rulers of the darkness of this age , against spiritual matters of wickedness in the heavenlies .
49006013	Because of this , take up the complete armour of Elohim , so that you have power to withstand in the wicked day , and having done all , to stand .
49006014	Stand , then , having girded your waist with truth , and having put on the breastplate of righteousness ,
49006015	and having fitted your feet with the preparation of the Good News of peace ;
49006016	above all , having taken up the shield of belief with which you shall have power to quench all the burning arrows of the wicked one .
49006017	Take also the helmet of deliverance , and the sword of the Spirit , which is the Word of Elohim ,
49006018	praying at all times , with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit , watching in all perseverance and supplication for all the set-apart ones ;
49006019	also for me , that a word might be given to me in the opening of my mouth , to be bold in making known the secret of the Good News ,
49006020	for which I am an envoy in chains , that in it I might speak boldly , as I should speak .
49006021	Now , in order that you also might know about me , how I am doing , Tuchikos , a beloved brother and trustworthy servant in the Master , shall make all matters known to you ,
49006022	whom I did send to you for this same purpose , so that you know about us , and might encourage your hearts .
49006023	Peace to the brothers , and love , with belief , from Elohim the Father and the Master יהושע Messiah .
49006024	Favour be with all those who love our Master יהושע Messiah , undecayingly ! Amĕn .
50001001	Sha’ul and Timothy , servants of יהושע Messiah , to all the set-apart ones in Messiah יהושע who are in Philippi , with the overseers and attendants :
50001002	Favour to you and peace from Elohim our Father and the Master יהושע Messiah .
50001003	I thank my Elohim in all my remembrance of you .
50001004	In all my prayers for all of you , I always pray with joy ,
50001005	for your fellowship in the Good News from the first day until now ,
50001006	being persuaded of this , that He who has begun a good work in you shall perfect it until the day of יהושע Messiah .
50001007	It is right for me to think this of you all , because I have you in my heart , all of you being sharers of the favour with me , both in my chains and in the defence and confirmation of the Good News .
50001008	For Elohim is my witness , how I long for you all with the affection of יהושע Messiah .
50001009	And this I pray , that your love might extend more and more in knowledge and all discernment ,
50001010	for you to examine the matters that differ , in order to be sincere , and not stumbling , until the day of Messiah ,
50001011	being filled with the fruit of righteousness , through יהושע Messiah , to the esteem and praise of Elohim .
50001012	And I wish you to know , brothers , that what has befallen me has turned out for the advancement of the Good News ,
50001013	so that it has become known to all the palace guard , and to all the rest , that my chains are in Messiah ;
50001014	and most of the brothers , trusting in the Master because of my chains , are much more bold to fearlessly speak the word .
50001015	Some indeed proclaim Messiah even from envy and strife , but some also out of pleasure –
50001016	the former announce Messiah from selfish ambition , not sincerely , thinking to add distress to my chains ,
50001017	but the latter out of love , knowing that I am appointed for the defence of the Good News .
50001018	What then ? Only that in every way , whether in pretence or in truth , Messiah is announced . And in this I rejoice , in fact , I shall rejoice .
50001019	For I know that this shall turn out for my deliverance through your prayer and the supply of the Spirit of יהושע Messiah ,
50001020	according to my intense longing and anticipation that I shall not be ashamed at all , but that with all boldness , as always , so now also Messiah shall be made great in my body , whether by life or by death .
50001021	For to me , to live is Messiah , and to die is gain .
50001022	And if to live in the flesh is to me a fruit of work , then what shall I choose ? I do not know .
50001023	For I am pressed down by the two , having a desire to depart and be with Messiah , which is much better ,
50001024	but to remain in the flesh is more necessary for your sake .
50001025	And being persuaded of this , I know that I shall stay and continue with you all , for your progress and joy of belief ,
50001026	so that your boasting might overflow in יהושע Messiah on account of me , through my coming to you again .
50001027	Only , behave yourselves worthily of the Good News of Messiah , in order that whether I come and see you or am absent , I hear about you , that you stand fast in one spirit , with one being , striving together for the belief of the Good News ,
50001028	without being frightened in any way by those who oppose , which to them truly is a proof of destruction , but to you of deliverance , and that from Elohim .
50001029	Because to you it has been given as a favour , on behalf of Messiah , not only to believe in Him , but also to suffer for His sake ,
50001030	having the same struggle which you saw in me , and now hear to be in me .
50002001	If , then , there is any encouragement in Messiah , if any comfort of love , if any fellowship of Spirit , if any affection and compassion ,
50002002	make my joy complete by being of the same mind , having the same love , one in being and of purpose ,
50002003	doing none at all through selfishness or self-conceit , but in humility consider others better than yourselves .
50002004	Each one should look out not only for his own interests , but also for the interests of others .
50002005	For , let this mind be in you which was also in Messiah יהושע ,
50002006	who , being in the form of Elohim , did not regard equality with Elohim a matter to be grasped ,
50002007	but emptied Himself , taking the form of a servant , and came to be in the likeness of men .
50002008	And having been found in fashion as a man , He humbled Himself and became obedient unto death , death even of a stake .
50002009	Elohim , therefore , has highly exalted Him and given Him the Name which is above every name ,
50002010	that at the Name of יהושע every knee should bow , of those in heaven , and of those on earth , and of those under the earth ,
50002011	and every tongue should confess that יהושע Messiah is Master , to the esteem of Elohim the Father .
50002012	So that , my beloved , as you always obeyed – not only in my presence , but now much rather in my absence – work out your own deliverance with fear and trembling ,
50002013	for it is Elohim who is working in you both to desire and to work for His good pleasure .
50002014	Do all matters without grumblings and disputings ,
50002015	in order that you be blameless and faultless , children of Elohim without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation , among whom you shine as lights in the world ,
50002016	holding on to the Word of life , for a boast to me in the day of Messiah , that I have not run in vain or laboured in vain .
50002017	In fact , even if I am being poured out as a drink offering on the offering and service of your belief , I am glad and rejoice with you all .
50002018	So you too should be glad and rejoice with me .
50002019	But I trust in the Master יהושע to send Timothy to you shortly , so that I too am encouraged by news from you .
50002020	For I have no one else of the same mind , who takes a genuine interest in your welfare .
50002021	For all seek their own interests , not those of Messiah יהושע .
50002022	But you know he has proven himself , that as a son with his father he served with me for the Good News .
50002023	So I expect to send him as soon as I see how it goes with me ,
50002024	and I trust in the Master that I myself shall also come shortly .
50002025	But I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditos , my brother , fellow worker , and fellow soldier , and your emissary and servant to my need ,
50002026	since he was longing for you all , and being troubled because you had heard that he was sick .
50002027	For indeed he was sick , near to death , but Elohim had compassion on him , and not only on him but on me as well , lest I should have sadness upon sadness .
50002028	Therefore I sent him more eagerly , so that on seeing him again you might rejoice , and I be less sad .
50002029	Receive him therefore in the Master with all joy , and hold such as he in esteem ,
50002030	because for the work of Messiah he was near death , risking his life , to fill up what was lacking in your service toward me .
50003001	For the rest , my brothers , rejoice in יהוה . To write the same matters to you is truly no trouble to me , and for you it is safe .
50003002	Look out for dogs , look out for the evil workers , look out for the mutilation !
50003003	For we are the circumcision , who are serving Elohim in the Spirit , and boasting in Messiah יהושע , and do not trust in the flesh ,
50003004	though I too might have trust in the flesh . If anyone else thinks to trust in the flesh , I more –
50003005	circumcised the eighth day , of the race of Yisra’ĕl , of the tribe of Binyamin , a Heḇrew of Heḇrews , according to Torah a Pharisee ,
50003006	according to ardour , persecuting the assembly ; according to righteousness that is in the law , having become blameless .
50003007	But what might have been a gain to me , I have counted as loss , because of Messiah .
50003008	What is more , I even count all to be loss because of the excellence of the knowledge of Messiah יהושע my Master , for whom I have suffered the loss of all , and count them as refuse , in order to gain Messiah ,
50003009	and be found in Him , not having my own righteousness , which is of the law , but that which is through belief in Messiah , the righteousness which is from Elohim on the basis of belief ,
50003010	to know Him , and the power of His resurrection , and the fellowship of His sufferings , being conformed to His death ,
50003011	if somehow I might attain to the resurrection from the dead .
50003012	Not that I have already received , or already been perfected , but I press on , to lay hold of that for which Messiah יהושע has also laid hold of me .
50003013	Brothers , I do not count myself to have laid hold of it yet , but only this : forgetting what is behind and reaching out for what lies ahead ,
50003014	I press on toward the goal for the prize of the high calling of Elohim in Messiah יהושע .
50003015	As many , then , as are perfect , should have this mind . And if you think differently in any respect , Elohim shall also reveal this to you .
50003016	But to what we have already attained – walk by the same rule , be of the same mind .
50003017	Become joint imitators of me , brothers , and observe those who so walk , as you have us for a pattern .
50003018	For many – of whom I have often told you , and now say to you even weeping – walk as enemies of the stake of Messiah .
50003019	Their end is destruction , their mighty one is their stomach , and their esteem is in their shame – they mind the earthly .
50003020	For our citizenship is in the heavens , from which we also eagerly wait for the Saviour , the Master יהושע Messiah ,
50003021	who shall change our lowly body , to be conformed to His esteemed body , according to the working by which He is able even to bring all under His control .
50004001	So then , my brothers , beloved and longed-for , my joy and crown , stand firm in the Master , beloved .
50004002	I appeal to Euodia and I appeal to Suntuche to be of the same mind in the Master .
50004003	And I also ask you , true companion , help these women who laboured with me in the Good News , with Qlemes also , and the rest of my fellow workers , whose names are in the Book of Life .
50004004	Rejoice in יהוה always , again I say , rejoice !
50004005	Let your gentleness be known to all men . The Master is near .
50004006	Do not worry at all , but in every matter , by prayer and petition , with thanksgiving , let your requests be made known to Elohim .
50004007	And the peace of Elohim , which surpasses all understanding , shall guard your hearts and minds through Messiah יהושע .
50004008	For the rest , brothers , whatever is true , whatever is noble , whatever is righteous , whatever is clean , whatever is lovely , whatever is of good report , if there is any uprightness and if there is any praise – think on these .
50004009	And what you have learned and received and heard and saw in me , practise these , and the Elohim of peace shall be with you .
50004010	And I rejoiced in יהוה greatly that now at last your concern for me has revived again – though you were concerned , but had no chance .
50004011	Not that I speak concerning need , for I have learned to be content in whatever state I am .
50004012	I know what it is to be humbled , and I know what it is to have in excess . In any and every situation I have learned both to be filled , and to be hungry , both to have in excess , and to be in need .
50004013	I have strength to do all , through Messiah who empowers me .
50004014	Yet you did well in sharing in my pressure .
50004015	And you know too , Philippians , that in the beginning of the Good News , when I went out from Makedonia , no assembly shared with me concerning giving and receiving , except you only ,
50004016	because , even in Thessalonike you sent to my need , once and twice .
50004017	Not that I seek the gift , but I seek the fruit that is multiplying to your account .
50004018	Indeed I have all and more than enough . I have been filled , having received from Epaphroditos what you sent , a sweet-smelling fragrance , an acceptable offering , well-pleasing to Elohim .
50004019	And my Elohim shall fill all your need according to His riches in esteem by Messiah יהושע .
50004020	And to our Elohim and Father be esteem forever and ever . Amĕn .
50004021	Greet every set-apart one in Messiah יהושע . The brothers with me greet you .
50004022	All the set-apart ones greet you , but most of all those of Caesar’s household .
50004023	The favour of our Master יהושע Messiah be with you all . Amĕn .
51001001	Sha’ul , an emissary of יהושע Messiah by the desire of Elohim , and Timothy our brother ,
51001002	to the set-apart ones in Colosse , and true brothers in Messiah : Favour to you and peace from Elohim our Father and the Master יהושע Messiah .
51001003	We give thanks to the Elohim and Father of our Master יהושע Messiah , praying always for you ,
51001004	having heard of your belief in Messiah יהושע and of your love for all the set-apart ones ,
51001005	because of the expectation that is laid up for you in the heavens , of which you heard before in the word of the truth of the Good News ,
51001006	which has come to you , as also in all the world it is bearing fruit and growing , as also among you , since the day you heard and knew the favour of Elohim in truth ,
51001007	as you also learned from Epaphras , our beloved fellow servant , who is a true servant of Messiah on your behalf ,
51001008	who also declared to us your love in the Spirit .
51001009	That is also why we , from the day we heard , have not ceased praying for you , and asking that you be filled with the knowledge of His desire in all wisdom and spiritual understanding ,
51001010	to walk worthily of the Master , pleasing all , bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of Elohim ,
51001011	being empowered with all power , according to the might of His esteem , for all endurance and patience with joy ,
51001012	giving thanks to the Father who has made us fit to share in the inheritance of the set-apart ones in the light ,
51001013	who has delivered us from the authority of darkness and transferred us into the reign of the Son of His love ,
51001014	in whom we have redemption through His blood , the forgiveness of sins ,
51001015	who is the likeness of the invisible Elohim , the first-born of all creation .
51001016	Because in Him were created all that are in the heavens and that are on earth , visible and invisible , whether thrones or rulerships or principalities or authorities – all have been created through Him and for Him .
51001017	And He is before all , and in Him all hold together .
51001018	And He is the Head of the body , the assembly , who is the beginning , the first-born from the dead , that He might become the One who is first in all .
51001019	Because in Him all the completeness was well pleased to dwell ,
51001020	and through Him to completely restore to favour all unto Himself , whether on earth or in the heavens , having made peace through the blood of His stake .
51001021	And you , who once were estranged and enemies in the mind by wicked works , but now He has completely restored to favour
51001022	in the body of His flesh through death , to present you set-apart , and blameless , and unreprovable before Him ,
51001023	if indeed you continue in the belief , founded and steadfast , and are not moved away from the expectation of the Good News which you heard , which was proclaimed to every creature under the heaven , of which I , Sha’ul , became a servant ,
51001024	who now rejoice in my sufferings for you , and fill up in my flesh what is lacking in Messiah’s afflictions , for the sake of His Body , which is the assembly ,
51001025	of which I became a servant according to the administration of Elohim which was given to me for you , to fill the word of Elohim ,
51001026	the secret which has been hidden from ages and from generations , but now has been revealed to His set-apart ones ,
51001027	to whom Elohim desired to make known what are the riches of the esteem of this secret among the gentiles : which is Messiah in you , the expectancy of esteem ,
51001028	whom we announce , warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom , in order to present every man perfect in Messiah יהושע ,
51001029	for which I also labour , striving according to the working of Him who works in me in power .
51002001	For I wish you to know what a great struggle I have for you and those in Laodikeia , and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh ,
51002002	in order that their hearts might be encouraged , being knit together in love , and to all riches of the entire confirmation of understanding , to a true knowledge of the secret of Elohim , and of the Father , and of the Messiah ,
51002003	in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge .
51002004	And this I say , so that no one deceives you with enticing words .
51002005	For though I am absent in the flesh , yet I am with you in spirit , rejoicing to see your good order and the steadfastness of your belief in Messiah .
51002006	Therefore , as you accepted Messiah יהושע the Master , walk in Him ,
51002007	having been rooted and built up in Him , and established in the belief , as you were taught , overflowing in it with thanksgiving .
51002008	See to it that no one makes a prey of you through philosophy and empty deceit , according to the tradition of men , according to the elementary matters of the world , and not according to Messiah .
51002009	Because in Him dwells all the completeness of the Mightiness bodily ,
51002010	and you have been made complete in Him , who is the Head of all principality and authority .
51002011	In Him you were also circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands , in the putting off of the body of the sins of the flesh , by the circumcision of Messiah ,
51002012	having been buried with Him in immersion , in which you also were raised with Him through the belief in the working of Elohim , who raised Him from the dead .
51002013	And you , being dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh , He has made alive together with Him , having forgiven you all trespasses ,
51002014	having blotted out the certificate of debt against us – by the dogmas – which stood against us . And He has taken it out of the way , having nailed it to the stake .
51002015	Having stripped the principalities and the authorities , He made a public display of them , having prevailed over them in it .
51002016	Let no one therefore judge you in eating or in drinking , or in respect of a festival or a new moon or Sabbaths –
51002017	which are a shadow of what is to come – but the Body of the Messiah .
51002018	Let no one deprive you of the prize , one who takes delight in false humility and worship of messengers , taking his stand on what he has not seen , puffed up by his fleshly mind ,
51002019	and not holding fast to the Head , from whom all the Body – nourished and knit together by joints and ligaments – grows with the growth of Elohim .
51002020	If , then , you died with Messiah from the elementary matters of the world , why , as though living in the world , do you subject yourselves to regulations :
51002021	“ Do not touch , do not taste , do not handle ” –
51002022	which are all to perish with use – according to the commands and teachings of men ?
51002023	These indeed have an appearance of wisdom in self-imposed worship , humiliation and harsh treatment of the body – of no value at all , only for satisfaction of the flesh .
51003001	If , then , you were raised with Messiah , seek the matters which are above , where Messiah is , seated at the right hand of Elohim .
51003002	Mind the matters above , not those on the earth .
51003003	For you have died , and your life has been hidden with Messiah in Elohim .
51003004	When the Messiah , who is our life , is manifested , then you also shall be manifested with Him in esteem .
51003005	Therefore put to death your members which are on the earth : whoring , uncleanness , passion , evil desire and greed of gain , which is idolatry .
51003006	Because of these the wrath of Elohim is coming upon the sons of disobedience ,
51003007	in which you also once walked when you lived in them .
51003008	But now , also put off all these : displeasure , wrath , evil , blasphemy , filthy talk from your mouth .
51003009	Do not lie to each other , since you have put off the old man with his practices ,
51003010	and have put on the new one who is renewed in knowledge according to the likeness of Him who created him ,
51003011	where there is not Greek and Yehuḏite , circumcised and uncircumcised , foreigner , Scythian , slave , free , but Messiah is all , and in all .
51003012	Therefore , as chosen ones of Elohim , set-apart and beloved , put on compassion , kindness , humbleness of mind , meekness , patience ,
51003013	bearing with one another , and forgiving each other if anyone has a complaint against another , indeed , as Messiah forgave you so also should you .
51003014	But above all these put on love , which is a bond of the perfection .
51003015	And let the peace of Elohim rule in your hearts , to which indeed you were called in one Body , and be filled with thanks .
51003016	Let the Word of Messiah dwell in you richly , teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom , singing with pleasure in your hearts to the Master in psalms and songs of praise and spiritual songs .
51003017	And whatever you do in word or deed , do all in the Name of the Master יהושע , giving thanks to Elohim the Father through Him .
51003018	Wives , subject yourselves to your own husbands , as is proper in the Master .
51003019	Husbands , love your wives and do not be bitter toward them .
51003020	Children , obey your parents in all , for this is well-pleasing to the Master .
51003021	Fathers , do not provoke your children , lest they become discouraged .
51003022	Servants , obey your masters according to the flesh in all respects , not with eye-service , as men-pleasers , but in sincerity of heart , fearing Elohim .
51003023	And whatever you do , do it heartily , as to the Master and not to men ,
51003024	knowing that from the Master you shall receive the reward of the inheritance . It is the Master , Messiah , you serve .
51003025	But he who does wrong shall be repaid for the wrong which he has done , and there is no partiality .
51004001	Masters , give your servants what is righteous and fair , knowing that you also have a Master in the heavens .
51004002	Continue in prayer , watching therein , with thanksgiving ,
51004003	praying at the same time also for us , that Elohim would open to us a door for the word , to speak the secret of Messiah , for which I am also in chains ,
51004004	so that I make it clear , as I should speak .
51004005	Walk in wisdom toward those who are outside , redeeming the time .
51004006	Let your word always be with favour , seasoned with salt , so that you know how you ought to answer each one .
51004007	Tuchikos , who is a beloved brother , a true servant , and a fellow servant in the Master , shall give you all the news about me .
51004008	I am sending him to you for this purpose , to know your circumstances and to encourage your hearts ,
51004009	with Onesimos , a true and beloved brother , who is one of you . They shall let you know all the news here .
51004010	Aristarchos my fellow prisoner greets you , with Mark the relative of Barnaḇah about whom you received instructions : if he comes to you , welcome him ,
51004011	also Yeshua who is called Justus . These are my only fellow workers for the reign of Elohim who are of the circumcision , who were to me a comfort .
51004012	Epaphras , who is one of you , a servant of Messiah , greets you , always wrestling for you in prayers , so that you stand perfect and complete in all the desire of Elohim .
51004013	For I bear him witness that he has a deep concern for you , and for those who are in Laodikeia and those in Hierapolis .
51004014	Luke the beloved physician and Demas greet you .
51004015	Greet the brothers in Laodikeia , and Numpha and the assembly that is in his house .
51004016	And when this letter is read among you , see that it is read also in the assembly of the Laodikeians , and that you likewise read the letter from Laodikeia .
51004017	And say to Archippos , “ See to the service which you have received in the Master , so that you complete it . ”
51004018	This greeting is in my own hand – Sha’ul . Remember my chains . Favour be with you . Amĕn .
52001001	Sha’ul , and Sila , and Timothy , to the assembly of the Thessalonians in Elohim the Father and the Master יהושע Messiah : Favour to you and peace from Elohim our Father and the Master יהושע Messiah .
52001002	We give thanks to Elohim always for you all , making mention of you in our prayers ,
52001003	remembering without ceasing your work of the belief , and the labour of love , and the endurance of the expectation in our Master יהושע Messiah in the presence of our Elohim and Father ,
52001004	knowing , brothers beloved by Elohim , that you were chosen .
52001005	Because our Good News did not come to you in word only , but also in power , and in the Set-apart Spirit and in entire confirmation , as you know what kind of men we were among you for your sake .
52001006	And you became imitators of us and of the Master , having received the word in much pressure , with joy of the Set-apart Spirit ,
52001007	so that you became an example to all who believe in Makedonia and Achaia .
52001008	For from you the word of the Master has sounded forth , not only in Makedonia and Achaia , but also in every place your belief toward Elohim has gone out , so that it is unnecessary for us to say whatever .
52001009	For they themselves report what kind of reception we had with you , and how you turned to Elohim from idols , to serve the living and true Elohim ,
52001010	and to wait for His Son from the heavens , whom He raised from the dead , יהושע , who is delivering us from the wrath to come .
52002001	For you yourselves know , brothers , that our coming to you was not in vain .
52002002	But having suffered before and having been mistreated at Philippi , as you know , we were bold in our Elohim to speak to you the Good News of Elohim in much struggle .
52002003	For the appeal we make does not come from delusion , nor from uncleanness , nor from deceit .
52002004	But as we have been approved by Elohim to be entrusted with the Good News , so we speak , not as pleasing men , but Elohim who proves our hearts .
52002005	For we never came with a word of flattery , as you know , nor with a cloak for greed – Elohim is witness –
52002006	nor were we looking for praise from men , not from you nor from others , though we could have been a burden to you , as emissaries of Messiah .
52002007	But we were gentle in your midst , like a nursing mother warmly loving her own children .
52002008	So , having a tender affection for you , we were well pleased to share with you not only the Good News of Elohim , but also our own lives , because you have become beloved to us .
52002009	For you remember , brothers , our toil and hardship , for labouring night and day , in order not to burden any of you , we proclaimed to you the Good News of Elohim .
52002010	You are witnesses , Elohim also , how set-apart and righteously and blamelessly we behaved ourselves among you who believe ,
52002011	even as you know how each one of you , as a father to his children , encouraging and comforting and bearing witness to you ,
52002012	that you would walk worthily of Elohim who is calling you into His own reign and esteem .
52002013	And because of this we thank Elohim without ceasing , that when you received the Word of Elohim which you heard from us , you welcomed it not as the word of men , but as it is truly , the Word of Elohim , which also works in you who believe .
52002014	For you , brothers , became imitators of the assemblies of Elohim which are in Yehuḏah in Messiah יהושע , because you also suffered the same treatment from your own countrymen as they also from the Yehuḏim ,
52002015	who killed both the Master יהושע and their own prophets , and have persecuted us , and who displease Elohim and are hostile to all men ,
52002016	forbidding us to speak to the gentiles that they might be saved , so as to fill up their sins always . But the wrath has come upon them to the utmost .
52002017	But we , brothers , having been taken away from you for a short while – in presence , not in heart – were much more eagerly trying to see your face , with much longing .
52002018	We would therefore have come to you , I indeed , Sha’ul , more than once , but Satan hindered us .
52002019	For what is our expectation , or joy , or crown of boasting ? Is it not even you , before our Master יהושע Messiah at His coming ?
52002020	For you are our esteem and joy .
52003001	So , when we could no longer stand it , we thought it good to be left in Athens alone ,
52003002	and sent Timothy , our brother and servant of Elohim , and our fellow worker in the Good News of Messiah , to establish you and encourage you concerning your belief ,
52003003	that no one should be unsettled by these pressures , for you yourselves know that we are appointed to this .
52003004	For indeed , we did inform you beforehand , when we were with , you that we would suffer pressure , and so it came to be , as you know .
52003005	Because of this , when I could no longer stand it , I sent to find out about your belief , lest the trying one might have tried you , and our labour should be in vain .
52003006	But now that Timothy has come to us from you , and having brought us good news of your belief and love , and that you always have good remembrance of us , longing to see us , as we also to see you ,
52003007	therefore , brothers , in all our pressure and distress we were encouraged concerning you by your belief .
52003008	Because we now live , if you stand fast in the Master .
52003009	For what thanks are we able to return to Elohim for you , for all the joy with which we rejoice for your sake in the presence of our Elohim ,
52003010	night and day praying exceedingly , to see your face and make complete what is lacking in your belief ?
52003011	And our Elohim and Father Himself , and our Master יהושע Messiah , direct our way to you !
52003012	And the Master make you increase and overflow in love to each other and to all , as we also do to you ,
52003013	to establish your hearts blameless in set-apartness before our Elohim and Father at the coming of our Master יהושע Messiah with all His set-apart ones !
52004001	For the rest then , brothers , we beg you and call upon you in the Master יהושע , that as you received from us how you should walk and to please Elohim , you should excel still more ,
52004002	for you know what commands we gave you through the Master יהושע .
52004003	For this is the desire of Elohim : your set-apartness ! – that you should abstain from whoring ,
52004004	that each one of you should know how to possess his own vessel in set-apartness and respect ,
52004005	not in passion of lust , like the gentiles who do not know Elohim ,
52004006	not to overstep and take advantage of his brother in this matter , because the Master is the revenger of all such , as we indeed said to you before and earnestly warned .
52004007	For Elohim did not call us to uncleanness , but in set-apartness .
52004008	Therefore he who rejects this does not reject man , but Elohim , who also gives us His Set-apart Spirit .
52004009	And it is not necessary to write to you about brotherly love , for you yourselves are taught by Elohim to love one another ,
52004010	for , in fact , you do so toward all the brothers who are in all Makedonia . But we call upon you , brothers , that you do so more and more ,
52004011	and to make it your ambition to live peaceably , and to attend to your own , and to work with your own hands , as we commanded you ,
52004012	so that you behave decently toward those who are outside , and not be in any need .
52004013	Now , brothers , we do not wish you to be ignorant concerning those who have fallen asleep , lest you be sad as others who have no expectation .
52004014	For if we believe that יהושע died and rose again , so also Elohim shall bring with Him those who sleep in יהושע .
52004015	For this we say to you by the word of the Master , that we , the living who are left over at the coming of the Master shall in no way go before those who are asleep .
52004016	Because the Master Himself shall come down from heaven with a shout , with the voice of a chief messenger , and with the trumpet of Elohim , and the dead in Messiah shall rise first .
52004017	Then we , the living who are left over , shall be caught away together with them in the clouds to meet the Master in the air – and so we shall always be with the Master .
52004018	So , then , encourage one another with these words .
52005001	Now , brothers , as to the times and the seasons , you do not need to be written to .
52005002	For you yourselves know very well that the day of יהוה comes as a thief in the night .
52005003	For when they say , “ Peace and safety ! ” then suddenly destruction comes upon them , as labour pains upon a pregnant woman , and they shall not escape .
52005004	But you , brothers , are not in darkness , so that this Day should overtake you as a thief .
52005005	For you are all sons of light and sons of the day . We are not of the night nor of darkness .
52005006	So , then , we should not sleep , as others do , but we should watch and be sober .
52005007	For those who sleep , sleep at night , and those who get drunk are drunk at night .
52005008	But we who are of the day should be sober , putting on the breastplate of belief and love , and as a helmet the expectation of deliverance .
52005009	Because Elohim did not appoint us to wrath , but to obtain deliverance through our Master יהושע Messiah ,
52005010	who died for us , so that we , whether awake or asleep , should live together with Him .
52005011	Therefore encourage one another , and build up one another , as indeed you do .
52005012	But brothers , we beg you to know those who labour among you , and are over you in the Master and admonish you ,
52005013	and to hold them in the highest regard in love because of their work . Be at peace among yourselves .
52005014	And we appeal to you , brothers , warn those who are disorderly , encourage the faint-hearted , uphold the weak , be patient with all .
52005015	See that no one renders evil for evil to anyone , but always pursue what is good both for yourselves and for all .
52005016	Rejoice always ,
52005017	pray without ceasing ,
52005018	in all circumstances give thanks , for this is the desire of Elohim in Messiah יהושע for you .
52005019	Do not quench the Spirit .
52005020	Do not despise prophecies ,
52005021	prove them all . Hold fast what is good .
52005022	Keep back from every form of wickedness .
52005023	And the Elohim of peace Himself set you completely apart , and your entire spirit , and being , and body - be preserved blameless at the coming of our Master יהושע Messiah !
52005024	He who calls you is trustworthy , who also shall do it .
52005025	Brothers , pray for us .
52005026	Greet all the brothers with a set-apart kiss .
52005027	I charge you by the Master that this letter be read to all the set-apart brothers .
52005028	The favour of our Master יהושע Messiah be with you . Amĕn .
53001001	Sha’ul , and Sila , and Timothy , to the assembly of the Thessalonians in Elohim our Father and the Master יהושע Messiah :
53001002	Favour to you and peace from Elohim our Father and the Master יהושע Messiah .
53001003	We ought to give thanks to Elohim always for you , brothers , as it is proper , because your belief grows exceedingly , and the love every one of you has for each other is increasing ,
53001004	so that we ourselves boast of you among the assemblies of Elohim for your endurance and belief in all your persecutions and afflictions which you are bearing ,
53001005	clear evidence of the righteous judgment of Elohim , in order for you to be counted worthy of the reign of Elohim , for which you also suffer ,
53001006	since Elohim shall rightly repay with affliction those who afflict you ,
53001007	and to give you who are afflicted rest with us when the Master יהושע is revealed from heaven with His mighty messengers ,
53001008	in flaming fire taking vengeance on those who do not know Elohim , and on those who do not obey the Good News of our Master יהושע Messiah ,
53001009	who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Master and from the esteem of His strength ,
53001010	when He comes to be esteemed in His set-apart ones and to be admired among all those who believe in that Day , because our witness to you was believed .
53001011	To this end we always pray for you that our Elohim would count you worthy of this calling , and complete all the good pleasure of goodness , and the work of belief with power ,
53001012	so that the Name of our Master יהושע Messiah is esteemed in you , and you in Him , according to the favour of our Elohim and the Master יהושע Messiah .
53002001	As to the coming of our Master יהושע Messiah and our gathering together to Him , we ask you , brothers ,
53002002	not to become easily unsettled in mind or troubled , either by spirit or by word or by letter , as if from us , as if the day of יהוה has come .
53002003	Let no one deceive you in any way , because the falling away is to come first , and the man of lawlessness is to be revealed , the son of destruction ,
53002004	who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called Elohim or that is worshipped , so that he sits as Elohim in the Dwelling Place of Elohim , showing himself that he is Elohim .
53002005	Do you not remember that I told you this while I was still with you ?
53002006	And now you know what restrains , for him to be revealed in his time .
53002007	For the secret of lawlessness is already at work – only until he who now restrains comes out of the midst .
53002008	And then the lawless one shall be revealed , whom the Master shall consume with the Spirit of His mouth and bring to naught with the manifestation of His coming .
53002009	The coming of the lawless one is according to the working of Satan , with all power and signs and wonders of falsehood ,
53002010	and with all deceit of unrighteousness in those perishing , because they did not receive the love of the truth , in order for them to be saved .
53002011	And for this reason Elohim sends them a working of delusion , for them to believe the falsehood ,
53002012	in order that all should be judged who did not believe the truth , but have delighted in the unrighteousness .
53002013	But we ought to give thanks to Elohim always for you , brothers , beloved by the Master , because Elohim from the beginning chose you to be saved – in set-apartness of Spirit , and belief in the truth –
53002014	unto which He called you by our Good News , for the obtaining of the esteem of our Master יהושע Messiah .
53002015	So , then , brothers , stand fast and hold the traditions which you were taught , whether by word or by our letter .
53002016	And our Master יהושע Messiah Himself , and our Elohim and Father , who has loved us and given us everlasting encouragement and good expectation , through favour ,
53002017	encourage your hearts and establish you in every good word and work .
53003001	For the rest , brothers , pray for us , so that the Word of יהוה spreads rapidly and be praised , as also with you ,
53003002	and that we might be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men , for not all have belief .
53003003	But the Master is trustworthy , who shall establish you and guard you from the wicked one .
53003004	And we trust in the Master as to you , both that you do and shall do what we command you .
53003005	And the Master direct your hearts into the love of Elohim and into the endurance for Messiah .
53003006	But we command you , brothers , in the Name of our Master יהושע Messiah , that you withdraw from every brother who walks disorderly and not according to the tradition which you received from us .
53003007	For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us , for we were not disorderly among you ,
53003008	nor did we eat anyone’s bread without paying for it , but worked with labour and toil night and day , in order not to burden any of you ,
53003009	not because we do not have authority , but to make ourselves an example , for you to imitate us .
53003010	For even when we were with you , we commanded you this : If anyone does not wish to work , neither let him eat .
53003011	For we hear of some among you walking disorderly , not working at all , but are busybodies .
53003012	But we command and urge such , through our Master יהושע Messiah , to settle down , work and eat their own bread .
53003013	And you , brothers , do not grow weary in doing good .
53003014	And if anyone does not obey our word in this letter , note that one , and do not keep company with him , so that he is put to shame .
53003015	However , do not regard him as an enemy , but admonish him as a brother .
53003016	And the Master of peace Himself give you peace always in every way . The Master be with you all .
53003017	The greeting of Sha’ul with my own hand , which is a sign in every letter , thus I write .
53003018	The favour of our Master יהושע Messiah be with you all . Amĕn .
54001001	Sha’ul , an emissary of יהושע Messiah , according to a command of Elohim our Saviour , and of the Master יהושע Messiah , our expectation ,
54001002	to Timothy , a genuine child in the belief : Favour , compassion , peace from Elohim our Father and יהושע Messiah our Master .
54001003	As I appealed to you when I went into Makedonia , to remain in Ephesos , in order to command some not to teach differently ,
54001004	nor to pay attention to fables and endless genealogies , which cause disputes rather than an administration of Elohim which is in belief .
54001005	Now the goal of this command is love from a clean heart , from a good conscience and a sincere belief ,
54001006	which some , having missed the goal , turned aside to senseless talk ,
54001007	wishing to be teachers of Torah , understanding neither what they say nor concerning what they strongly affirm .
54001008	And we know that the Torah is good if one uses it legitimately ,
54001009	knowing this : that Torah is not laid down for a righteous being , but for the lawless and unruly , for the wicked and for sinners , for the wrong-doers and profane , for those who kill their fathers or mothers , for murderers ,
54001010	for those who whore , for sodomites , for kidnappers , for liars , for perjurers , and for whatever else that is contrary to sound teaching ,
54001011	according to the esteemed Good News of the blessed Elohim which was entrusted to me .
54001012	And I thank Messiah יהושע our Master who empowered me , because He counted me trustworthy , putting me into service ,
54001013	me , although I was formerly a blasphemer , and a persecutor , and an insulter . But compassion was shown me because being ignorant I did it in unbelief .
54001014	And the favour of our Master was exceedingly increased , with belief and love which are in Messiah יהושע .
54001015	Trustworthy is the word and worthy of all acceptance , that Messiah יהושע came into the world to save sinners , of whom I am foremost .
54001016	But because of this I received compassion , so that in me first , יהושע Messiah might display all patience , as an example to those who are going to believe on Him for everlasting life .
54001017	Now to the Sovereign of the ages , incorruptible , invisible , to Elohim who alone is wise , be respect and esteem forever and ever . Amĕn .
54001018	This charge I entrust to you , son Timothy , according to the prophecies previously made concerning you , that by them you might wage the good campaign ,
54001019	having belief and a good conscience , which some have thrust aside and suffered shipwreck concerning their belief .
54001020	Among these are Humenaios and Alexander , whom I delivered to Satan , in order to be taught not to blaspheme .
54002001	First of all , then , I urge that petitions , prayers , intercessions , and thanksgiving be made for all men ,
54002002	for sovereigns and all those who are in authority , in order that we lead a calm and peaceable life in all reverence and seriousness .
54002003	For this is good and acceptable before Elohim our Saviour ,
54002004	who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth .
54002005	For there is one Elohim , and one Mediator between Elohim and men , the Man Messiah יהושע ,
54002006	who gave Himself a ransom for all , to be witnessed in its own seasons ,
54002007	for which I was appointed a proclaimer and an emissary – I am speaking the truth in Messiah and not lying – a teacher of the gentiles in belief and truth .
54002008	So I resolve that the men pray everywhere , lifting up hands that are set-apart , without wrath and disputing .
54002009	Likewise , that the women dress themselves becomingly , with decency and sensibleness , not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly garments ,
54002010	but with good works , which is becoming for women undertaking worship of Elohim .
54002011	Let a woman learn in silence , in all subjection .
54002012	But I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man , rather , to be in silence .
54002013	Because Aḏam was formed first , then Ḥawwah .
54002014	And Aḏam was not deceived , but the woman , having been deceived , fell into transgression .
54002015	But she shall be saved in childbearing if they continue in belief , and love , and set-apartness , with sensibleness .
54003001	Trustworthy is the word : If a man longs for the position of an overseer , he desires a good work .
54003002	An overseer , then , should be blameless , the husband of one wife , sober , sensible , orderly , kind to strangers , able to teach ,
54003003	not given to wine , no brawler , but gentle , not quarrelsome , no lover of money ,
54003004	one who rules his own house well , having his children in subjection with all reverence ,
54003005	for if a man does not know how to rule his own house , how shall he look after the assembly of Elohim ?
54003006	Not a new convert , lest he become puffed up with pride and fall into the judgment of the devil .
54003007	And he should even have a good witness from those who are outside , lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil .
54003008	Likewise attendants are to be reverent , not double-tongued , not given to much wine , not greedy for filthy gain ,
54003009	holding to the secret of the belief with a clean conscience .
54003010	And let these also be proved first , then let them serve , if they are unreprovable .
54003011	Wives in the same way : reverent , not false accusers , sober , trustworthy in every way .
54003012	Let attendants be the husbands of only one wife , ruling children and their own houses well .
54003013	For those who have served well as attendants gain good standing for themselves , and much boldness in the belief that is in Messiah יהושע .
54003014	I am writing you this , expecting to come to you shortly ,
54003015	but if I delay , that you might know how you should behave in the House of Elohim , which is the assembly of the living Elohim – a strong support and foundation of the truth .
54003016	And , beyond all question , the secret of reverence is great – who was revealed in the flesh , declared right in Spirit , was seen by messengers , was proclaimed among nations , was believed on in the world , was taken up in esteem .
54004001	But the Spirit distinctly says that in latter times some shall fall away from the belief , paying attention to misleading spirits , and teachings of demons ,
54004002	speaking lies in hypocrisy , having been branded on their own conscience ,
54004003	forbidding to marry , saying to abstain from foods which Elohim created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth .
54004004	Because every creature of Elohim is good , and none is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving ,
54004005	for it is set apart by the Word of Elohim and prayer .
54004006	If you present these matters to the brothers , you shall be a good servant of יהושע Messiah , being nourished in the words of belief and of the good teaching which you have followed closely .
54004007	But refuse profane and old wives’ fables , and exercise yourself rather to reverence .
54004008	For bodily exercise is profitable for a little , but reverence is profitable for all , having promise of the present life , and of that which is to come .
54004009	Trustworthy is the word , and worthy of all acceptance .
54004010	It is for this that we labour and struggle , because we trust in the living Elohim , who is the Saviour of all men , particularly of those who believe .
54004011	Command and teach these matters .
54004012	Let no one look down on your youth , but be an example to the believers in word , in behaviour , in love , in spirit , in belief , in cleanliness .
54004013	Until I come , give attention to reading of Scripture , to encouragement , to teaching .
54004014	Do not neglect the gift that is in you , which was given to you by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the elderhood .
54004015	Practise these matters , be in them , so that your progress might be plain to all .
54004016	Pay attention to yourself and to the teaching . Continue in them , for in doing this you shall save both yourself and those who hear you .
54005001	Do not rebuke an older man , but appeal to him as a father , younger ones as brothers ,
54005002	elderly women as mothers , younger ones as sisters , in all cleanliness .
54005003	Respect widows who are truly widows .
54005004	But if any widow has children or grandchildren , let them first learn to treat their own house reverently , and to repay their parents . For this is good and acceptable before Elohim .
54005005	And she who is truly a widow , and left alone , trusts in Elohim and continues in petitions and prayers night and day .
54005006	But she who is living in luxury is dead while she lives .
54005007	And command these matters , in order for them to be blameless .
54005008	And if anyone does not provide for his own , and especially for those of his household , he has denied the belief and is worse than an unbeliever .
54005009	Do not enrol a widow unless she is over sixty years of age , having been the wife of one man ,
54005010	well reported for good works , if she has brought up children , if she has lodged strangers , if she has washed the feet of the set-apart ones , if she has assisted the afflicted , if she has closely followed every good work .
54005011	But refuse the younger widows , for when they become headstrong against the Messiah , they desire to marry ,
54005012	having guilt because they set aside their first belief .
54005013	Moreover , they learn to be idle , going about from house to house , and not only idle but also gossips and busybodies , speaking what is improper .
54005014	So I resolve that the younger widows marry , bear children , manage the house , giving no occasion to the adversary for reviling .
54005015	For already some have turned aside after Satan .
54005016	If any believing man or woman has widows , let such assist them , and do not let the assembly be burdened , in order to assist those who are truly widows .
54005017	Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double respect , especially those who labour in the word and teaching .
54005018	For the Scripture says , “ You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain , ” and , “ The labourer is worthy of his wages . ”
54005019	Do not receive an accusation against an elder except from two or three witnesses .
54005020	Reprove those who are sinning , in the presence of all , so that the rest also might fear .
54005021	I earnestly witness before Elohim and the Master יהושע Messiah , and the chosen messengers , that you watch over these matters without prejudice , doing none at all with partiality .
54005022	Do not lay hands on anyone hastily , nor share in sins of others . Keep yourself clean .
54005023	No longer drink only water , but use a little wine for your stomach’s sake and your frequent ailments .
54005024	The sins of some men are obvious , leading on to judgment , but those of some men follow later .
54005025	In the same way , the good works are obvious , while it is impossible to conceal those that are otherwise .
54006001	Let those who are servants under a yoke regard their own masters worthy of all respect , lest the Name of Elohim and His teaching be blasphemed .
54006002	And those who have believing masters , let them not disregard them because they are brothers , but rather serve them because they are believing and beloved ones , those receiving of the good service in return . Teach and urge these matters .
54006003	If anyone teaches differently and does not agree to the sound words , those of our Master יהושע Messiah , and to the teaching which is according to reverence ,
54006004	he is puffed up , understanding none at all , but is sick about questionings and verbal battles from which come envy , strife , slander , wicked suspicions ,
54006005	worthless disputes of men of corrupt minds and deprived of the truth , who think that reverence is a means of gain – withdraw from such .
54006006	But reverence with contentment is great gain .
54006007	For we brought naught into the world , and it is impossible to take any out .
54006008	When we have food and covering , we shall be satisfied with these .
54006009	But those wishing to be rich fall into trial and a snare , and into many foolish and injurious lusts which plunge men in ruin and destruction .
54006010	For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil , for which some , by longing for it , have strayed from the belief , and pierced themselves through with many pains .
54006011	But you , O man of Elohim , flee from all this , and pursue righteousness , reverence , belief , love , endurance , meekness .
54006012	Fight the good fight of the belief , lay hold on everlasting life , to which you were also called and have confessed the good confession before many witnesses .
54006013	In the sight of Elohim who gives life to all , and of Messiah יהושע who witnessed the good confession before Pontius Pilate , I charge you :
54006014	that you guard the command spotlessly , blamelessly , until the appearing of our Master יהושע Messiah ,
54006015	which in His own seasons He shall reveal – the blessed and only Ruler , the Sovereign of sovereigns and Master of masters ,
54006016	who alone has immortality , dwelling in unapproachable light , whom no one has seen or is able to see , to whom be respect and everlasting might . Amĕn .
54006017	Charge those who are rich in this present age not to be high-minded , nor to trust in the uncertainty of riches , but in the living Elohim , who gives us richly all for enjoyment ,
54006018	to do good , to be rich in good works , to be generous , ready to share ,
54006019	storing up for themselves a good foundation for the time to come , so that they lay hold on everlasting life .
54006020	O Timothy ! Watch over that which has been entrusted to you , turning aside from the profane and empty babblings and contradictions of the falsely called ‘ knowledge , ’
54006021	which some , having professed it , have missed the goal concerning the belief . Favour be with you . Amĕn .
55001001	Sha’ul , an emissary of יהושע Messiah by the desire of Elohim , according to the promise of life which is in Messiah יהושע ,
55001002	to Timothy , my beloved son : Favour , compassion , peace from Elohim the Father , and Messiah יהושע our Master .
55001003	I thank Elohim , whom I serve with a clear conscience , as my forefathers did , as I unceasingly remember you in my prayers night and day ,
55001004	longing to see you , as I remember your tears , so that I might be filled with joy .
55001005	For I recollect the sincere belief which is in you , which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunike , and I am persuaded is in you too .
55001006	For this reason I remind you to stir up the gift of Elohim which is in you through the laying on of my hands .
55001007	For Elohim has not given us a spirit of cowardice , but of power and of love and of self-control .
55001008	So do not be ashamed of the witness of our Master , nor of me His prisoner , but suffer hardship with me for the Good News according to the power of Elohim ,
55001009	who has saved us and called us with a set-apart calling , not according to our works , but according to His own purpose and favour which was given to us in Messiah יהושע before times of old ,
55001010	but now revealed by the appearing of our Saviour יהושע Messiah , who indeed abolished death and brought life and incorruptibility to light through the Good News ,
55001011	for which I was appointed a proclaimer , and an emissary , and a teacher of the gentiles .
55001012	For this reason I also suffer these matters , but I am not ashamed , for I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is able to watch over that which I have entrusted to Him until that Day .
55001013	Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me , in belief and love which are in Messiah יהושע .
55001014	Watch over the good deposit that was entrusted to you , by the Set-apart Spirit dwelling in us .
55001015	You know this , that all those in Asia have turned away from me , among whom are Phugellos and Hermogenes .
55001016	The Master grant compassion unto the household of Onesiphoros , for he often refreshed me , and was not ashamed of my chain ,
55001017	but when he was in Rome , he eagerly searched for me and found me .
55001018	The Master grant to him to find compassion from the Master in that Day . And you know very well how many ways he attended to me at Ephesos .
55002001	You then , my son , be strong in the favour that is in Messiah יהושע .
55002002	And what you have heard from me among many witnesses , entrust these to trustworthy men who shall be competent to teach others as well .
55002003	Suffer hardship with us as a good soldier of יהושע Messiah .
55002004	No one serving as a soldier gets involved in the affairs of this life , in order to please only him who enlisted him as a soldier .
55002005	And if anyone competes in a game , he is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules .
55002006	The hard-working farmer ought to be first to receive his share of the crops .
55002007	Think over what I say , for the Master shall give you understanding into all this .
55002008	Remember that יהושע Messiah , of the seed of Dawiḏ , was raised from the dead according to my Good News ,
55002009	for which I suffer hardship , as a criminal , unto chains , but the Word of Elohim is not chained .
55002010	So I endure through it all for the sake of the chosen , so that they too obtain deliverance which is in Messiah יהושע with everlasting esteem .
55002011	Trustworthy is the word : For if we died with Him , we shall also live with Him .
55002012	If we endure , we shall also reign with Him . If we deny Him , He also shall deny us .
55002013	If we are not trustworthy , He remains trustworthy , it is impossible for Him to deny Himself .
55002014	Remind them of this , earnestly witnessing before the Master , not to wage verbal battles – which is useless – to the overthrowing of the hearers .
55002015	Do your utmost to present yourself approved to Elohim , a worker who does not need to be ashamed , rightly handling the Word of Truth .
55002016	But keep away from profane , empty babblings , for they go on to more wickedness ,
55002017	and their word shall eat its way like gangrene . Humenaios and Philetos are of this sort ,
55002018	who have missed the goal concerning the truth , saying that the resurrection has already taken place , and overthrow the belief of some .
55002019	However , the solid foundation of Elohim stands firm , having this seal , “ יהוה knows those who are His , ” and , “ Let everyone who names the Name of Messiah turn away from unrighteous-ness . ”
55002020	But in a large house there are not only vessels of gold and silver , but also of wood and clay , some unto value and some unto no value .
55002021	If , then , anyone cleanses himself from these matters , he shall be a vessel unto value , having been set apart , of good use to the Master , having been prepared for every good work .
55002022	And flee from the lusts of youth , but pursue righteousness , belief , love , peace with those calling on the Master out of a clean heart .
55002023	But refuse foolish and stupid questions , knowing that they breed quarrels .
55002024	And a servant of the Master should not quarrel but be gentle towards all , able to teach , patient when wronged ,
55002025	in meekness instructing those who are in opposition , lest somehow Elohim gives them repentance unto a thorough knowledge of the truth ,
55002026	and they come to their senses , out of the snare of the devil , having been taken captive by him to do his desire .
55003001	But know this , that in the last days hard times shall come .
55003002	For men shall be lovers of self , lovers of money , boasters , proud , blasphemers , disobedient to parents , thankless , wrong-doers ,
55003003	unloving , unforgiving , slanderers , without self-control , fierce , haters of good ,
55003004	betrayers , reckless , puffed up , lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of Elohim ,
55003005	having a form of reverence but denying its power . And turn away from these !
55003006	For among them are those who creep into households and captivate silly women loaded down with sins , led away by various lusts ,
55003007	always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth .
55003008	And as Yoḥane and Mamrĕ opposed Mosheh , so do these also oppose the truth – men of corrupt minds , found worthless concerning the belief ;
55003009	but they shall not go on further , for their folly shall be obvious to all , as also that of those men became .
55003010	But you did closely follow my teaching , the way of life , the purpose , the belief , the patience , the love , the endurance ,
55003011	the persecutions , the sufferings , which came to me at Antioch , at Ikonion , and at Lustra – what persecutions I bore . Yet out of them all the Master delivered me .
55003012	And indeed , all those wishing to live reverently in Messiah יהושע , shall be persecuted .
55003013	But evil men and impostors shall go on to the worse , leading astray and being led astray .
55003014	But you , stay in what you have learned and trusted , having known from whom you have learned ,
55003015	and that from a babe you have known the Set-apart Scriptures , which are able to make you wise for deliverance through belief in Messiah יהושע .
55003016	All Scripture is breathed by Elohim and profitable for teaching , for reproof , for setting straight , for instruction in righteousness ,
55003017	that the man of Elohim might be fitted , equipped for every good work .
55004001	In the sight of Elohim and the Master יהושע Messiah , who shall judge the living and the dead at His appearing and His reign , I earnestly charge you :
55004002	Proclaim the Word ! Be urgent in season , out of season . Reprove , warn , appeal , with all patience and teaching .
55004003	For there shall be a time when they shall not bear sound teaching , but according to their own desires , they shall heap up for themselves teachers tickling the ear ,
55004004	and they shall indeed turn their ears away from the truth , and be turned aside to myths .
55004005	But you be sober in all matters , suffer hardships , do the work of an evangelist , accomplish your service completely .
55004006	For I am already being poured out , and the time of my departure has arrived .
55004007	I have fought the good fight , I have finished the race , I have guarded the belief .
55004008	For the rest , there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness , which the Master , the righteous Judge , shall give to me on that Day , and not to me only but also to all those loving His appearing .
55004009	Do your best to come to me soon ,
55004010	for Demas , having loved this present world , has deserted me and went to Thessalonike , Crescens to Galatia , Titus to Dalmatia .
55004011	Luke alone is with me . Take Mark and bring him with you , for he is of good use to me for service .
55004012	And Tuchikos I have sent to Ephesos .
55004013	Bring the cloak that I left with Karpos at Troas when you come , and the books , especially the parchments .
55004014	Alexander the coppersmith did many evils to me . The Master shall repay him according to his works .
55004015	You , too , beware of him , for he strongly opposed our words .
55004016	At my first defence no one stood with me , but all forsook me . Let it not be held against them .
55004017	But the Master stood with me and did strengthen me , so that through me the preaching might be completely accomplished , and that all the gentiles should hear . And I was rescued out of the lion’s mouth .
55004018	And the Master shall rescue me from every wicked work and save me for His heavenly reign . To Him be esteem forever and ever . Amĕn !
55004019	Greet Prisca and Aqulas , and the house of Onesiphoros .
55004020	Ěrastos stayed in Corinth , but I left Trophimos sick in Miletos .
55004021	Do your best to come before winter . Eubulos greets you , and Pudes , and Linos , and Klaudia , and all the brothers .
55004022	The Master יהושע Messiah be with your spirit . Favour be with you . Amĕn .
56001001	Sha’ul , a servant of Elohim and an emissary of יהושע Messiah , according to the belief of Elohim’s chosen ones and knowledge of the truth according to reverence ,
56001002	in expectation of everlasting life which Elohim , who does not lie , promised before times of old ,
56001003	but in its own times has manifested His word through preaching , with which I was entrusted according to the command of Elohim our Saviour ,
56001004	to Titus , a genuine child according to our common belief : Favour , compassion , peace from Elohim the Father and the Master יהושע Messiah our Saviour .
56001005	The reason I left you in Crete was that you should straighten out what was left undone , and appoint elders in every city as I commanded you :
56001006	if anyone is unreprovable , the husband of one wife , having believing children not accused of loose behaviour , or unruly .
56001007	For an overseer has to be unreprovable , as a managing one of Elohim , not self-pleasing , not wroth , not given to wine , no brawler , not greedy for filthy gain ,
56001008	but kind to strangers , a lover of what is good , sensible , righteous , set-apart , self-controlled ,
56001009	clinging to the trustworthy word , according to the teaching , in order to be able both to encourage by sound teaching , and to reprove those who oppose it .
56001010	For there are many unruly men , senseless talkers and deceivers , especially those of the circumcision ,
56001011	whose mouths have to be stopped , who upset entire households , teaching what they should not teach , for the sake of filthy gain .
56001012	One of them , a prophet of their own , said , “ Cretans are always liars , evil beasts , lazy gluttons . ”
56001013	This witness is true . Therefore rebuke them sharply , in order for them to be sound in the belief ,
56001014	not paying attention to Yehuḏite fables , and commands of men who turn from the truth .
56001015	Indeed , all matters are clean to the clean , but to those who are defiled and unbelieving no matter is clean , but both their mind and conscience are defiled .
56001016	They profess to know Elohim , but in works they deny Him , being abominable , and disobedient , and unfit for any good work .
56002001	But you , speak what is fitting for sound teaching :
56002002	the older men are to be sober , serious , sensible , sound in belief , in love , in endurance ,
56002003	the older women likewise are to be set-apart in behaviour , not slanderers , not given to much wine , teachers of what is good ,
56002004	in order for them to train the young women to love their husbands , to love their children ,
56002005	to be sensible , blameless , workers at home , good , subject to their own husbands , in order that the word of Elohim is not evil spoken of .
56002006	Likewise urge the young men to be sensible .
56002007	Show yourself to them an example of good works in all matters . In teaching show uncorruptness , seriousness ,
56002008	soundness of speech beyond reproach , in order that the opponent is put to shame , having no evil word to say about you .
56002009	Servants should be subject to their own masters , to be well-pleasing in every way , not back-talking ,
56002010	not stealing , but showing all good trustworthiness , so that they adorn the teaching of Elohim our Saviour in every way .
56002011	For the saving Gift of Elohim has appeared to all men ,
56002012	instructing us to renounce wickedness and worldly lusts , and to live sensibly , righteously , and reverently in the present age ,
56002013	looking for the blessed expectation and esteemed appearance of the great Elohim and our Saviour יהושע Messiah ,
56002014	who gave Himself for us , to redeem us from all lawlessness and to cleanse for Himself a people , His own possession , ardent for good works .
56002015	Speak these matters , urge , and reprove with all authority . Let no one despise you .
56003001	Remind them to be subject to rulers and authorities , to obey , to be ready for every good work ,
56003002	not to slander anyone , not to be quarrelsome , to be gentle , showing all meekness to all men .
56003003	For we ourselves were also once foolish , disobedient , led astray , serving various lusts and pleasures , living in evil and envy , being hated and hating one another .
56003004	But when the kindness and the love of Elohim our Saviour toward man appeared ,
56003005	He saved us , not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to His compassion , through the washing of rebirth , and renewal by the Set-apart Spirit ,
56003006	which He poured out on us richly through יהושע Messiah our Saviour ,
56003007	that having been declared right by His favour we should become heirs according to the expectation of everlasting life .
56003008	Trustworthy is the word , and in this regard I wish you to strongly affirm , that those who have believed in Elohim should keep their minds on maintaining good works . This is good and profitable to men .
56003009	But keep away from foolish questions , and genealogies , and strife and quarrels about the Torah , for they are unprofitable and useless .
56003010	Reject a divisive man after the first and second warning ,
56003011	knowing that such a one has been perverted , and sins , being self-condemned .
56003012	When I shall send Artemas to you , or Tuchikos , do your best to come to me at Nikopolis , for I have decided to spend the winter there .
56003013	Do your best to send Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey , so that they lack none at all .
56003014	And our brothers should also learn to maintain good works , to meet urgent needs , so that they shall not be without fruit .
56003015	All those with me greet you . Greet those who love us in the belief . Favour be with you all . Amĕn .
57001001	Sha’ul , a prisoner of Messiah יהושע , and Timothy the brother , to Philemon our beloved one and fellow worker ,
57001002	and Apphia our sister , and Archippos our fellow soldier , and the assembly at your house :
57001003	Favour to you and peace from Elohim our Father and the Master יהושע Messiah .
57001004	I always thank my Elohim when I mention you in my prayers ,
57001005	hearing of your love and the belief which you have toward the Master יהושע and toward all the set-apart ones ,
57001006	so that the sharing of your belief might become working in the knowledge of all the good which is in you toward Messiah יהושע .
57001007	For we have much joy and encouragement in your love , because the tender affections of the set-apart ones have been refreshed by you , brother .
57001008	Therefore , although I have much boldness in Messiah to command you what is fitting ,
57001009	because of love , I rather appeal – being such a one as Sha’ul , the aged , and now also a prisoner of יהושע Messiah –
57001010	I appeal to you for my child Onesimos , whom I brought forth while in my chains ,
57001011	who formerly was of no use to you , but now is of good use to you and to me ,
57001012	whom I sent back to you , and receive him , that is , my own tender affections ,
57001013	whom I wished to keep with me , that on your behalf he might serve me in my chains for the Good News .
57001014	But without your opinion I wished to do none at all , so that your good deed should not be by way of necessity , but voluntary .
57001015	For he parted from you for a while , possibly because of this , so that you might have him back forever ,
57001016	no longer as a slave but more than a slave , as a beloved brother , especially to me , and how much more to you , both in the flesh and in the Master .
57001017	So , if you regard me as your partner , receive him as you would me .
57001018	But if he has wronged you or owes you whatever , put that on my account .
57001019	I , Sha’ul , wrote with my own hand . I shall repay – not to mention to you that you indeed owe yourself to me also .
57001020	Yes , brother , let me derive pleasure from you in the Master , refresh my tender affections in the Master .
57001021	Trusting in your obedience , I wrote to you , knowing that you shall do even more than I say .
57001022	And at the same time also prepare a place for me to stay , for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given to you .
57001023	Epaphras , fellow prisoner of me in Messiah יהושע , greets you ,
57001024	and Mark , Aristarchos , Demas , Luke , my fellow workers .
57001025	The favour of our Master יהושע Messiah be with your spirit . Amĕn .
58001001	Elohim , having of old spoken in many portions and many ways to the fathers by the prophets ,
58001002	has in these last days spoken to us by the Son , whom He has appointed heir of all , through whom also He made the ages ,
58001003	who being the brightness of the esteem and the exact representation of His substance , and sustaining all by the word of His power , having made a cleansing of our sins through Himself , sat down at the right hand of the Greatness on high ,
58001004	having become so much better than the messengers , as He has inherited a more excellent Name than them .
58001005	For to which of the messengers did He ever say , “ You are My Son , today I have brought You forth ” ? And again , “ I shall be to Him a Father , and He shall be to Me a Son ” ?
58001006	And when He again brings the first-born into the world , He says , “ Let all the messengers of Elohim do reverence to Him . ”
58001007	And of the messengers indeed He says , “ . . . who is making His messengers spirits and His servants a flame of fire . ”
58001008	But to the Son He says , “ Your throne , O Elohim , is forever and ever , a sceptre of straightness is the sceptre of Your reign .
58001009	“ You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness . Because of this , Elohim , Your Elohim , has anointed You with the oil of gladness more than Your companions . ”
58001010	And , “ You , Master , did found the earth in the beginning , and the heavens are the work of Your hands .
58001011	“ They shall perish , but You remain . And they shall all grow old like a garment ,
58001012	and like a mantle You shall fold them up , and they shall be changed . But You are the same , and Your years shall not fail . ”
58001013	And to which of the messengers did He ever say , “ Sit at My right hand , until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet ” ?
58001014	Are they not all serving spirits sent out to attend those who are about to inherit deliverance ?
58002001	Because of this we have to pay more attention to what we have heard , lest we drift away .
58002002	For if the word spoken through messengers proved to be firm , and every transgression and disobedience received a right reward ,
58002003	how shall we escape if we neglect so great a deliverance , which first began to be spoken by the Master , and was confirmed to us by those that heard ,
58002004	Elohim also bearing witness both with signs and wonders , with various miracles , and gifts of the Set-apart Spirit , distributed according to His own desire ?
58002005	For it is not to messengers that He has subjected the world to come , concerning which we speak .
58002006	But somewhere one has witnessed , saying , “ What is man that You remember him , or the son of man that You look after him ?
58002007	“ You have made him a little lower than the messengers . You have crowned him with esteem and respect , and set him over the works of Your hands .
58002008	“ You have put all in subjection under his feet . ” For in that He put all in subjection under him , He left none that is not subjected to him . But now we do not yet see all subjected to him .
58002009	But we do see Him who was made for a little while lower than the messengers , יהושע , because of the suffering of death crowned with esteem and respect , that by the favour of Elohim He should taste death for everyone .
58002010	For it was fitting for Him , because of whom all are and through whom all are , in bringing many sons to esteem , to make the Princely Leader of their deliverance perfect through sufferings .
58002011	For both He who sets apart and those who are being set apart are all of One , for which reason He is not ashamed to call them brothers ,
58002012	saying , “ I shall announce Your Name to My brothers , in the midst of the congregation I shall sing praise to You . ”
58002013	And again , “ I shall put My trust in Him . ” And again , “ See , I and the children whom Elohim gave Me . ”
58002014	Therefore , since the children share in flesh and blood , He Himself similarly shared in the same , so that by means of His death He might destroy him having the power of death , that is , the devil ,
58002015	and deliver those who throughout life were held in slavery by fear of death .
58002016	For , doubtless , He does not take hold of messengers , but He does take hold of the seed of Aḇraham .
58002017	So in every way He had to be made like His brothers , in order to become a compassionate and trustworthy High Priest in matters related to Elohim , to make atonement for the sins of the people .
58002018	For in what He had suffered , Himself being tried , He is able to help those who are tried .
58003001	Therefore , set-apart brothers , partakers of the heavenly calling , closely consider the Emissary and High Priest of our confession , Messiah יהושע ,
58003002	who was trustworthy to Him who appointed Him , as also Mosheh in all His house .
58003003	For this One has been deemed worthy of more esteem than Mosheh , as much as He who built the house enjoys more respect than the house .
58003004	For every house is built by someone , but He who built all is Elohim .
58003005	And Mosheh indeed was trustworthy in all His house as a servant , for a witness of what would be spoken later ,
58003006	but Messiah as a Son over His own house , whose house we are if we hold fast the boldness and the boasting of the expectation firm to the end .
58003007	Therefore , as the Set-apart Spirit says , “ Today , if you hear His voice ,
58003008	do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion , in the day of trial in the wilderness ,
58003009	where your fathers tried Me , proved Me , and saw My works forty years .
58003010	“ Therefore I was grieved with that generation , and said , ‘ They always go astray in their heart , and they have not known My ways . ’
58003011	“ As I swore in My wrath , ‘ If they shall enter into My rest . . . ’ ”
58003012	Look out , brothers , lest there be in any of you a wicked heart of unbelief in falling away from the living Elohim ,
58003013	but encourage one another daily , while it is called “ Today , ” lest any of you be hardened by the deceivableness of sin .
58003014	For we have become partakers of Messiah if we hold fast the beginning of our trust firm to the end ,
58003015	while it is said , “ Today , if you hear His voice , do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion . ”
58003016	For who , having heard , rebelled ? Was it not all who came out of Mitsrayim , led by Mosheh ?
58003017	And with whom was He grieved forty years ? Was it not with those who sinned , whose corpses fell in the wilderness ?
58003018	And to whom did He swear that they would not enter into His rest , but to those who did not obey ?
58003019	So we see that they were unable to enter in because of unbelief .
58004001	Therefore , since a promise remains of entering into His rest , let us fear lest any of you seem to have come short of it .
58004002	For indeed the Good News was brought to us as well as to them , but the word which they heard did not profit them , not having been mixed with belief in those who heard it .
58004003	For we who have believed do enter into that rest , as He has said , “ As I swore in My wrath , if they shall enter into My rest . . . ” And yet His works have come into being from the foundation of the world .
58004004	For somewhere He has said thus about the seventh day , “ And Elohim rested on the seventh day from all His works , ”
58004005	and in this again , “ If they shall enter into My rest . . . ”
58004006	Since then it remains for some to enter into it , and those who formerly received the Good News did not enter in because of disobedience ,
58004007	He again defines a certain day , “ Today , ” saying through Dawiḏ so much later , as it has been said , “ Today , if you hear His voice , do not harden your hearts . ”
58004008	For if Yehoshua had given them rest , He would not have spoken of another day after that .
58004009	So there remains a Sabbath-keeping for the people of Elohim .
58004010	For the one , having entered into His rest , has himself also rested from his works , as Elohim rested from His own .
58004011	Let us therefore do our utmost to enter into that rest , lest anyone fall after the same example of disobedience .
58004012	For the Word of Elohim is living , and working , and sharper than any two-edged sword , cutting through even to the dividing of being and spirit , and of joints and marrow , and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart .
58004013	And there is no creature hidden from His sight , but all are naked and laid bare before the eyes of Him with whom is our account .
58004014	Therefore , since we have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens , יהושע the Son of Elohim , let us hold fast our confession .
58004015	For we do not have a High Priest unable to sympathize with our weaknesses , but One who was tried in all respects as we are , apart from sin .
58004016	Therefore , let us come boldly to the throne of favour , in order to receive compassion , and find favour for timely help .
58005001	For every priest taken from among men is appointed on behalf of men in matters relating to Elohim , to offer both gifts and offerings for sins ,
58005002	being able to have a measure of feeling for those not knowing and being led astray , since he himself is also surrounded by weakness .
58005003	And on account of this he has to offer for sins – as for the people , so also for himself .
58005004	And no one obtains this esteem for himself , but he who is called by Elohim , even as Aharon also was .
58005005	So also the Messiah did not extol Himself to become High Priest , but it was He who said to Him , “ You are My Son , today I have brought You forth . ”
58005006	As He also says in another place , “ You are a priest forever according to the order of Malkitseḏeq , ”
58005007	who , in the days of His flesh , when He had offered up prayers and petitions with strong crying and tears to Him who was able to save Him from death , and was heard because of His reverent fear ,
58005008	though being a Son , He learned obedience by what He suffered .
58005009	And having been perfected , He became the Causer of everlasting deliverance to all those obeying Him ,
58005010	having been designated by Elohim a High Priest “ according to the order of Malkitseḏeq , ”
58005011	concerning whom we have much to say , and hard to explain , since you have become dull of hearing .
58005012	For indeed , although by this time you ought to be teachers , you need someone to teach you again the first elements of the Words of Elohim . And you have become such as need milk and not solid food .
58005013	For everyone partaking of milk is inexperienced in the word of righteousness , for he is a babe .
58005014	But solid food is for the mature whose senses have been trained by practice to discern both good and evil .
58006001	Therefore , having left the word of the beginning of the Messiah , let us go on to perfection , not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works , and of belief toward Elohim ,
58006002	of the teaching of immersions , and of laying on of hands , and of resurrection of the dead , and of everlasting judgment .
58006003	And this we shall do , if Elohim indeed permits .
58006004	For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened , and have tasted the heavenly gift , and have become partakers of the Set-apart Spirit ,
58006005	and have tasted the good Word of Elohim and the powers of the age to come ,
58006006	and fall away , to renew them again to repentance – having impaled for themselves the Son of Elohim again , and put Him to open shame .
58006007	For ground that is drinking the rain often falling on it , and is bearing plants fit for those by whom it is tilled , receives blessing from Elohim ,
58006008	but if it brings forth thorns and thistles , it is rejected and near to being cursed , and ends up by being burned .
58006009	But although we speak in this way , beloved , we are persuaded , concerning you , of better matters which possess deliverance .
58006010	For Elohim is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love which you have shown toward His Name , in that you have attended to the set-apart ones , and still attend .
58006011	And we desire that each one of you show the same eagerness , to the entire confirmation of expectation until the end ,
58006012	in order that you do not become sluggish , but imitate those who through belief and patience inherit the promises .
58006013	For Elohim , having promised Aḇraham , since He could swear by no one greater , swore by Himself ,
58006014	saying , “ Truly , blessing I shall bless you , and increasing I shall increase you . ”
58006015	And so , after being patient , he obtained the promise .
58006016	For men do indeed swear by the one greater , and an oath for confirmation is for them an end of all dispute .
58006017	In this way Elohim , resolving to show even more clearly to the heirs of promise the unchangeableness of His purpose , confirmed it by an oath ,
58006018	so that by two unchangeable matters in which it is impossible for Elohim to lie , we might have strong encouragement , we who have fled for refuge to lay hold of the expectation set before us ,
58006019	which we have as an anchor of the life , both safe and firm , and entering into that within the veil ,
58006020	where יהושע has entered as a forerunner for us , having become High Priest forever according to the order of Malkitseḏeq .
58007001	For this Malkitseḏeq , sovereign of Shalĕm , priest of the Most High Elohim , who met Aḇraham returning from the slaughter of the sovereigns and blessed him ,
58007002	to whom also Aḇraham gave a tenth part of all , his name being translated , indeed , first , ‘ sovereign of righteousness , ’ and then also sovereign of Shalĕm , that is , ‘ sovereign of peace , ’
58007003	without father , without mother , without genealogy , having neither beginning of days nor end of life , but having been made like the Son of Elohim , remains a priest for all time .
58007004	Now see how great this one was , to whom even the ancestor Aḇraham gave a tenth of the choicest booty .
58007005	And truly , those who are of the sons of Lĕwi , who receive the priesthood , have a command to receive tithes from the people according to the Torah , that is , from their brothers , though they have come from the loins of Aḇraham ,
58007006	however , the one whose genealogy is not derived from them received tithes from Aḇraham , and blessed the one who held the promises .
58007007	And it is beyond all dispute that the lesser is blessed by the better .
58007008	And here it is men who die that receive tithes , but there it is someone of whom it is witnessed that he lives .
58007009	And one might say that through Aḇraham even Lĕwi , who received tithes , gave tithes ,
58007010	for he was still in the loins of his father when Malkitseḏeq met him .
58007011	Truly , then , if perfection were through the Lĕwitical priesthood – for under it the people were given the Torah – why was there still need for another priest to arise according to the order of Malkitseḏeq , and not be called according to the order of Aharon ?
58007012	For the priesthood being changed , of necessity there takes place a change of law also .
58007013	For He of whom this is said belongs to another tribe , from which no one had attended at the altar .
58007014	For it is perfectly clear that our Master arose from Yehuḏah , a tribe about which Mosheh never spoke of concerning priesthood ,
58007015	and this is clearer still , if another priest arises in the likeness of Malkitseḏeq ,
58007016	who has become , not according to the Torah of fleshly command , but according to the power of an endless life ,
58007017	for He does witness , “ You are a priest forever according to the order of Malkitseḏeq . ”
58007018	For there is indeed a setting aside of the former command because of its weakness and unprofitableness ,
58007019	for the Torah perfected naught , but the bringing in of a better expectation , through which we draw near to Elohim .
58007020	And it was not without an oath !
58007021	For they indeed became priests without an oath , but He became Priest with an oath by Him who said to Him , “ יהוה has sworn and shall not regret , ‘ You are a priest forever according to the order of Malkitseḏeq . ’ ”
58007022	By as much as this יהושע has become a guarantor of a better covenant .
58007023	And indeed , those that became priests were many , because they were prevented by death from continuing ,
58007024	but He , because He remains forever , has an unchangeable priesthood .
58007025	Therefore He is also able to save completely those who draw near to Elohim through Him , ever living to make intercession for them .
58007026	For it was fitting that we should have such a High Priest – kind , innocent , undefiled , having been separated from sinners , and exalted above the heavens ,
58007027	who does not need , as those high priests , to offer up slaughter offerings day by day , first for His own sins and then for those of the people , for this He did once for all when He offered up Himself .
58007028	For the Torah appoints as high priests men who have weakness , but the word of the oath which came after the Torah , appoints the Son having been perfected forever .
58008001	Now the summary of what we are saying is : We have such a High Priest , who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Greatness in the heavens ,
58008002	and who serves in the set-apart place and of the true Tent , which יהוה set up , and not man .
58008003	For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and slaughters . So it was also necessary for this One to have somewhat to offer .
58008004	For if indeed He were on earth , He would not be a priest , since there are priests who offer the gifts according to the Torah ,
58008005	who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly , as Mosheh was warned when he was about to make the Tent . For He said , “ See that you make all according to the pattern shown you on the mountain . ”
58008006	But now He has obtained a more excellent service , inasmuch as He is also Mediatorof a better covenant , which was constituted on better promises .
58008007	For if that first covenant had been faultless , then no place would have been sought for a second .
58008008	For finding fault with them , He says , “ See , the days are coming , ” says יהוה , “ when I shall conclude with the house of Yisra’ĕl and with the house of Yehuḏah a renewed covenant ,
58008009	not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Mitsrayim , because they did not continue in My covenant , and I disregarded them , ” says יהוה .
58008010	“ Because this is the covenant that I shall make with the house of Yisra’ĕl after those days , says יהוה , giving My laws in their mind , and I shall write them on their hearts , and I shall be their Elohim , and they shall be My people .
58008011	“ And they shall by no means teach each one his neighbour , and each one his brother , saying , ‘ Know יהוה , ’ because they all shall know Me , from the least of them to the greatest of them .
58008012	“ Because I shall forgive their unrighteousness , and their sins and their lawlessnesses I shall no longer remember . ”
58008013	By saying , ‘ renewed , ’ He has made the first old . Now what becomes old and growing aged is near disappearing .
58009001	Now the first covenant indeed had regulations of worship and the earthly set-apart place .
58009002	For a Tent was prepared : the first part , in which was the lampstand , and the table , and the showbread , which is called the Set-apart Place .
58009003	And after the second veil , the part of the Tent which is called Most Set-apart ,
58009004	to which belonged the golden censer , and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold , in which were the golden pot that held the manna , and the rod of Aharon that budded , and the tablets of the covenant ,
58009005	and above it the keruḇim of esteem were overshadowing the place of atonement – about which we do not now speak in detail .
58009006	And these having been prepared like this , the priests always went into the first part of the Tent , accomplishing the services .
58009007	But into the second part the high priest went alone once a year , not without blood , which he offered for himself and for sins of ignorance of the people ,
58009008	the Set-apart Spirit signifying this , that the way into the Most Set-apart Place was not yet made manifest while the first Tent has a standing ,
58009009	which was a parable for the present time in which both gifts and slaughters are offered which are unable to perfect the one serving , as to his conscience ,
58009010	only as to foods and drinks , and different washings , and fleshly regulations imposed until a time of setting matters straight .
58009011	But Messiah , having become a High Priest of the coming good matters , through the greater and more perfect Tent not made with hands , that is , not of this creation ,
58009012	entered into the Most Set-apart Place once for all , not with the blood of goats and calves , but with His own blood , having obtained everlasting redemption .
58009013	For if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a heifer , sprinkling the defiled , sets apart for the cleansing of the flesh ,
58009014	how much more shall the blood of the Messiah , who through the everlasting Spirit offered Himself unblemished to Elohim , cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living Elohim ?
58009015	And because of this He is the Mediator of a renewed covenant , so that , death having taken place for redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant , those who are called might receive the promise of the everlasting inheritance .
58009016	For where a covenant is , it is necessary for the death of the covenanted one to be established .
58009017	For a covenant over those dead is firm , since it is never valid while the covenanted one is living .
58009018	Therefore not even the first covenant was instituted without blood .
58009019	For when , according to Torah , every command had been spoken by Mosheh to all the people , he took the blood of calves and goats , with water , and scarlet wool , and hyssop , and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people ,
58009020	saying , “ This is the blood of the covenant which Elohim commanded you . ”
58009021	And in the same way he sprinkled with blood both the Tent and all the vessels of the service .
58009022	And , according to the Torah , almost all is cleansed with blood , and without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness .
58009023	It was necessary , then , that the copies of the heavenly ones should be cleansed with these , but the heavenly ones themselves with better slaughter offerings than these .
58009024	For Messiah has not entered into a Set-apart Place made by hand – figures of the true – but into the heaven itself , now to appear in the presence of Elohim on our behalf ,
58009025	not that He should offer Himself often , as the high priest enters into the Set-apart Place year by year with blood not his own .
58009026	For if so , He would have had to suffer often , since the foundation of the world . But now He has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the offering of Himself .
58009027	And as it awaits men to die once , and after this the judgment ,
58009028	so also the Messiah , having been offered once to bear the sins of many , shall appear a second time , apart from sin , to those waiting for Him , unto deliverance .
58010001	For the Torah , having a shadow of the good matters to come , and not the image itself of the matters , was never able to make perfect those who draw near with the same slaughter offerings which they offer continually year by year .
58010002	Otherwise , would they not have ceased to be offered ? Because those who served , once cleansed , would have had no more consciousness of sins .
58010003	But in those offerings is a reminder of sins year by year .
58010004	For it is impossible for blood of bulls and goats to take away sins .
58010005	Therefore , coming into the world , He says , “ Slaughtering and meal offering You did not desire , but a body You have prepared for Me .
58010006	“ In burnt offerings and offerings for sin You did not delight .
58010007	“ Then I said , ‘ See , I come – in the roll of the book it has been written concerning Me – to do Your desire , O Elohim . ’ ”
58010008	Saying above , “ Slaughter and meal offering , and burnt offerings , and offerings for sin You did not desire , nor delighted in , ” which are offered according to the Torah ,
58010009	then He said , “ See , I come to do Your desire , O Elohim . ” He takes away the first to establish the second .
58010010	By that desire we have been set apart through the offering of the body of יהושע Messiah once for all .
58010011	And indeed every priest stands day by day doing service , and repeatedly offering the same slaughter offerings which are never able to take away sins .
58010012	But He , having offered one slaughter offering for sins for all time , sat down at the right hand of Elohim ,
58010013	waiting from that time onward until His enemies are made a footstool for His feet .
58010014	For by one offering He has perfected for all time those who are being set apart .
58010015	And the Set-apart Spirit also witnesses to us , for after having said before ,
58010016	“ This is the covenant that I shall make with them after those days , says יהוה , giving My laws into their hearts , and in their minds I shall write them , ”
58010017	and , “ Their sins and their lawlessnesses I shall remember no more . ”
58010018	Now where there is forgiveness of these , there is no longer a slaughter offering for sin .
58010019	So , brothers , having boldness to enter into the Set-apart Place by the blood of יהושע ,
58010020	by a new and living way which He instituted for us , through the veil , that is , His flesh ,
58010021	and having a High Priest over the House of Elohim ,
58010022	let us draw near with a true heart in completeness of belief , having our hearts sprinkled from a wicked conscience and our bodies washed with clean water .
58010023	Let us hold fast the confession of our expectation without yielding , for He who promised is trustworthy .
58010024	And let us be concerned for one another in order to stir up love and good works ,
58010025	not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together , as is the habit of some , but encouraging , and so much more as you see the Day coming near .
58010026	For if we sin purposely after we have received the knowledge of the truth , there no longer remains a slaughter offering for sins ,
58010027	but some fearsome anticipation of judgment , and a fierce fire which is about to consume the opponents .
58010028	Anyone who has disregarded the Torah of Mosheh dies without compassion on the witness of two or three witnesses .
58010029	How much worse punishment do you think shall he deserve who has trampled the Son of Elohim underfoot , counted the blood of the covenant by which he was set apart as common , and insulted the Spirit of favour ?
58010030	For we know Him who has said , “ Vengeance is Mine , I shall repay , says יהוה . ” And again , “ יהוה shall judge His people . ”
58010031	It is fearsome to fall into the hands of the living Elohim .
58010032	But remember the former days , when , after you were enlightened , you endured a great struggle with sufferings .
58010033	On the one hand you were exposed to reproaches and pressures , and on the other hand you became sharers with those who were so treated ,
58010034	for you sympathised with me in my chains , and you accepted with joy the seizure of your possessions , knowing that you have a better and a lasting possession for yourselves in the heavens .
58010035	Do not , then , lose your boldness , which has great reward .
58010036	For you have need of endurance , so that when you have done the desire of Elohim , you receive the promise :
58010037	“ For yet a little while – He who is coming shall come and shall not delay . ”
58010038	“ But the righteous shall live by belief , but if anyone draws back , my being has no pleasure in him . ”
58010039	But we are not of those who draw back to destruction , but of belief to the preservation of life .
58011001	And belief is the substance of what is expected , the proof of what is not seen .
58011002	For by this the elders obtained witness .
58011003	By belief , we understand that the ages were prepared by the word of Elohim , so that what is seen was not made of what is visible .
58011004	By belief , Heḇel offered to Elohim a greater slaughter offering than Qayin , through which he obtained witness that he was righteous , Elohim witnessing of his gifts . And through it , having died , he still speaks .
58011005	By belief , Ḥanoḵ was translated so as not to see death , “ and was not found because Elohim had translated him . ” For before his translation he obtained witness , that he pleased Elohim .
58011006	But without belief it is impossible to please Him , for he who comes to Elohim has to believe that He is , and that He is a rewarder of those who earnestly seek Him .
58011007	By belief , Noaḥ , having been warned of what was yet unseen , having feared , prepared an ark to save his house , through which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is according to belief .
58011008	By belief , Aḇraham obeyed when he was called to go out to the place which he was about to receive as an inheritance . And he went out , not knowing where he was going .
58011009	By belief , he sojourned in the land of promise as a stranger , dwelling in tents with Yitsḥaq and Ya‛aqoḇ , the heirs with him of the same promise ,
58011010	for he was looking for the city having foundations , whose builder and maker is Elohim .
58011011	By belief also , Sarah herself was enabled to conceive seed , and she bore a child when she was past the normal age , because she deemed Him trustworthy who had promised .
58011012	And so from one , and him as good as dead , were born as numerous as the stars of the heaven , as countless as the sand which is by the seashore .
58011013	In belief all these died , not having received the promises , but seeing them from a distance , welcomed and embraced them , and confessed that they were aliens and strangers on the earth .
58011014	For those who speak this way make it clear that they seek a fatherland .
58011015	And yet , if they had indeed kept remembering that place from which they had come out , they would have had the chance to return .
58011016	But now they long for a better place , that is , a heavenly . Therefore Elohim is not ashamed to be called their Elohim , for He has prepared a city for them .
58011017	By belief , Aḇraham , when he was tried , offered up Yitsḥaq , and he who had received the promises offered up his only brought-forth son ,
58011018	of whom it was said , “ In Yitsḥaq your seed shall be called , ”
58011019	reckoning that Elohim was able to raise , even from the dead , from which he received him back , as a type .
58011020	By belief , Yitsḥaq blessed Ya‛aqoḇ and Ěsaw concerning that which was to come .
58011021	By belief , Ya‛aqoḇ , when he was dying , blessed each of the sons of Yosĕph , and did reverence on the top of his staff .
58011022	By belief , Yosĕph , when he was dying , made mention of the outgoing of the children of Yisra’ĕl , and gave orders concerning his bones .
58011023	By belief , Mosheh , having been born , was hidden three months by his parents , because they saw he was a comely child , and were not afraid of the sovereign’s command .
58011024	By belief , Mosheh , having become great , refused to be called the son of the daughter of Pharaoh ,
58011025	choosing rather to be afflicted with the people of Elohim than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a time ,
58011026	deeming the reproach of Messiah greater riches than the treasures in Mitsrayim , for he was looking to the reward .
58011027	By belief , he left Mitsrayim , not fearing the wrath of the sovereign , for he was steadfast , as seeing Him who is invisible .
58011028	By belief , he performed the Passover and the sprinkling of blood , lest he who destroyed the first-born should touch them .
58011029	By belief , they passed through the Red Sea as by dry land , and when the Mitsrites tried it , they were drowned .
58011030	By belief , the walls of Yeriḥo fell , having been surrounded for seven days .
58011031	By belief , Raḥaḇ the whore did not perish with those who did not believe , having received the spies with peace .
58011032	And what more shall I say ? For the time would fail me to relate of Gid‛on and Baraq and Shimshon and Yiphtaḥ , also of Dawiḏ and Shemu’ĕl and the prophets ,
58011033	who through belief , overcame reigns , worked righteousness , obtained promises , stopped the mouths of lions ,
58011034	quenched the power of fire , escaped the edge of the sword , out of weakness were made strong , became mighty in battle , put foreign armies to flight .
58011035	Women received back their dead by resurrection . And others were tortured , not accepting release , to obtain a better resurrection .
58011036	And others had trial of mockings and floggings and more , of chains and imprisonment .
58011037	They were stoned , they were tried , they were sawn in two , they were slain with the sword . They went about in sheepskins , in goatskins , being in need , afflicted , mistreated ,
58011038	of whom the world was not worthy – wandering in deserts and mountains and caves and holes of the earth .
58011039	And having obtained witness through the belief , all these did not receive the promise ,
58011040	Elohim having provided what is better for us , that they should not be made perfect apart from us .
58012001	We too , then , having so great a cloud of witnesses all around us , let us lay aside every weight and the sin which so easily entangles us , and let us run with endurance the race set before us ,
58012002	looking to the Princely Leader and Perfecter of our belief , יהושע , who for the joy that was set before Him endured the stake , having despised the shame , and sat down at the right hand of the throne of Elohim .
58012003	For consider Him who endured such opposition from sinners against Himself , lest you become weary and faint in your lives .
58012004	You have not yet resisted unto blood , striving against sin .
58012005	And you have forgotten the appeal which speaks to you as to sons , “ My son , do not despise the discipline of יהוה , nor faint when you are reproved by Him ,
58012006	for whom יהוה loves , He disciplines , and flogs every son whom He receives . ”
58012007	If you endure discipline , Elohim is treating you as sons . For what son is there whom a father does not discipline ?
58012008	But if you are without discipline , of which all have become sharers , then you are illegitimate and not sons .
58012009	Moreover , we indeed had fathers of our flesh disciplining us , and we paid them respect . Shall we not much rather be subject to the Father of spirits , and live ?
58012010	For they indeed disciplined us for a few days as seemed best to them , but He does it for our profit , so that we might share His apartness .
58012011	And indeed , no discipline seems pleasant at the time , but grievous , but afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it .
58012012	So , strengthen the hands which hang down and the weak knees ,
58012013	and make straight paths for your feet , lest the lame be turned aside , but instead , to be healed .
58012014	Pursue peace with all , and pursue apartness without which no one shall see the Master .
58012015	See to it that no one falls short of the favour of Elohim , that no root of bitterness springing up causes trouble , by which many become defiled ,
58012016	lest there be anyone who whores , or profane one , like Ěsaw , who for a single meal sold his birthright .
58012017	For you know that afterward , when he wished to inherit the blessing , he was rejected , for he found no place for repentance , though he sought it with tears .
58012018	For you have not drawn near to a mountain touched and scorched with fire , and to blackness , and darkness and storm ,
58012019	and a sound of a trumpet , and a voice of words , so that those who heard it begged that no further Word should be spoken to them ,
58012020	for they could not bear what was commanded , “ If even a beast touches the mountain , it shall be stoned or shot through with an arrow . ”
58012021	And so fearsome was the sight that Mosheh said , “ I exceedingly fear and tremble . ”
58012022	But you have drawn near to Mount Tsiyon and to the city of the living Elohim , to the heavenly Yerushalayim , to myriads of messengers ,
58012023	to the entire gathering and assembly of the first-born having been enrolled in heaven , and to Elohim the Judge of all , and to the spirits of righteous men made perfect ,
58012024	and to יהושע the Mediator of a new covenant , and to the blood of sprinkling which speaks better than the blood of Heḇel .
58012025	Take heed not to refuse the One speaking . For if those did not escape who refused the warning on earth , much less we who turn away from Him from heaven ,
58012026	whose voice shook the earth then , but now He has promised , saying , “ Yet once more I shake not only the earth , but also the heaven . ”
58012027	And this , “ Yet once more , ” makes clear the removal of what is shaken – as having been made – so that the unshaken matters might remain .
58012028	Therefore , receiving an unshakeable reign , let us hold the favour , through which we serve Elohim pleasingly with reverence and awe ,
58012029	for indeed , our Elohim is a consuming fire .
58013001	Let the brotherly love continue .
58013002	Do not forget to receive strangers , for by so doing some have unwittingly entertained messengers .
58013003	Remember the prisoners as if chained with them , and those being mistreated , since you yourselves also are in the body .
58013004	Let marriage be respected by all , and the bed be undefiled . But Elohim shall judge those who whore , and adulterers .
58013005	Let your way of life be without the love of money , and be satisfied with what you have . For He Himself has said , “ I shall never leave you nor forsake you , ”
58013006	so that we boldly say , “ יהוה is my helper , I shall not fear what man shall do to me . ”
58013007	Remember those leading you , who spoke the Word of Elohim to you . Consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their belief .
58013008	יהושע Messiah is the same yesterday , and today , and forever .
58013009	Do not be borne about by various and strange teachings . For it is good for the heart to be established by favour , not with foods which have not profited those who have been occupied with them .
58013010	We have an altar from which those serving the Tent have no authority to eat .
58013011	For the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the Set-apart Place by the high priest for sin , are burned outside the camp .
58013012	And so יהושע also suffered outside the gate , to set apart the people with His own blood .
58013013	Let us , then , go to Him outside the camp , bearing His reproach .
58013014	For we have no lasting city here , but we seek the one coming .
58013015	Through Him then , let us continually offer up a slaughter offering of praise to Elohim , that is , the fruit of our lips , giving thanks to His Name .
58013016	And do not forget to do good and to share , for with such slaughter offerings Elohim is well pleased .
58013017	Obey those leading you , and be subject to them , for they watch for your lives , as having to give account . Let them do so with joy and not groaning , for that would be of no advantage to you .
58013018	Pray for us , for we trust that we have a good conscience , desiring to behave well in every way .
58013019	But I particularly encourage you to do this , that I might be restored to you the sooner .
58013020	And the Elohim of peace who brought up our Master יהושע from the dead , that great Shepherd of the sheep , through the blood of the everlasting covenant ,
58013021	make you perfect in every good work to do His desire , working in you what is pleasing in His sight , through יהושע Messiah , to whom be esteem forever and ever . Amĕn .
58013022	And I call upon you , brothers , bear with the word of encouragement for I have written to you in few words .
58013023	Know that brother Timothy has been released , with whom I shall see you if he comes shortly .
58013024	Greet all those leading you , and all the set-apart ones . Those from Italy greet you .
58013025	Favour be with you all . Amĕn .
59001001	Ya‛aqoḇ , a servant of Elohim and of the Master יהושע Messiah , to the twelve tribes who are in the dispersion : Greetings .
59001002	My brothers , count it all joy when you fall into various trials ,
59001003	knowing that the proving of your belief works endurance .
59001004	And let endurance have a perfect work , so that you be perfect and complete , lacking in naught .
59001005	If any of you lacks wisdom , let him ask of Elohim , who gives to all generously and without reproach , and it shall be given to him .
59001006	But he should ask in belief , not doubting , for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven and tossed by the wind .
59001007	For that man should not think that he shall receive whatever from the Master –
59001008	he is a double-minded man , unstable in all his ways .
59001009	And let the lowly brother boast in his exaltation ,
59001010	but the rich in his humiliation , because as a flower of the field he shall pass away .
59001011	For the sun rose with burning heat , and withered the grass , and its flower fell , and its pretty appearance perished . So also the rich man shall fade away in his ways .
59001012	Blessed is the man who does endure trial , for when he has been proved , he shall receive the crown of life which the Master has promised to those who love Him .
59001013	Let no one say when he is enticed , “ I am enticed by Elohim , ” for Elohim is not enticed by evil matters , and He entices no one .
59001014	But each one is enticed when he is drawn away by his own desires and trapped .
59001015	Then , when desire has conceived , it gives birth to sin . And sin , when it has been accomplished , brings forth death .
59001016	Do not go astray , my beloved brothers .
59001017	Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above , coming down from the Father of lights , with whom there is no change , nor shadow of turning .
59001018	Having purposed it , He brought us forth by the Word of truth , for us to be a kind of first-fruits of His creatures .
59001019	So then , my beloved brothers , let every man be swift to hear , slow to speak , slow to wrath ,
59001020	for the wrath of man does not work the righteousness of Elohim .
59001021	Therefore put away all filthiness and overflow of evil , and receive with meekness the implanted Word , which is able to save your lives .
59001022	And become doers of the Word , and not hearers only , deceiving yourselves .
59001023	Because if anyone is a hearer of the Word and not a doer , he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror ,
59001024	for he looks at himself , and goes away , and immediately forgets what he was like .
59001025	But he that looked into the perfect Torah , that of freedom , and continues in it , not becoming a hearer that forgets , but a doer of work , this one shall be blessed in his doing of the Torah .
59001026	If anyone among you thinks he is religious , and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his own heart , this one’s religion is worthless .
59001027	Clean and undefiled religion before the Elohim and Father is this : to visit orphans and widows in their affliction , and to keep oneself unstained from the world .
59002001	My brothers , do not hold the belief of our Master יהושע Messiah , the Master of esteem , with partiality .
59002002	For if there should come into your meeting a man with gold rings , in a splendid robe , and there should also come in a poor one dressed in rags ,
59002003	and you pay attention to the one wearing the splendid robe and say to him , “ You sit here in a good place , ” and say to the poor one , “ You stand there , ” or , “ Sit here by my feet , ”
59002004	have you not discriminated among yourselves , and become judges with wicked thoughts ?
59002005	Listen , my beloved brothers : Has Elohim not chosen the poor of this world , rich in belief and heirs of the reign which He promised to those who love Him ?
59002006	But you have shown disrespect towards the poor man . Do not the rich oppress you and drag you into the courts ?
59002007	Do they not blaspheme that good Name by which you are called ?
59002008	If you truly accomplish the sovereign law according to the Scripture , “ You shall love your neighbour as yourself , ” you do well ,
59002009	but if you show partiality , you commit sin , being found guilty by the Torah as transgressors .
59002010	For whoever shall guard all the Torah , and yet stumble in one point , he is guilty of all .
59002011	For He who said , “ Do not commit adultery , ” also said , “ Do not murder . ” Now if you do not commit adultery , but you do murder , you have become a transgressor of Torah .
59002012	So speak and so do as those who are to be judged by a Torah of freedom .
59002013	For the judgment is without compassion to the one who has shown no compassion . And compassion boasts over judgment .
59002014	My brothers , what use is it for anyone to say he has belief but does not have works ? This belief is unable to save him .
59002015	And if a brother or sister is naked and in need of daily food ,
59002016	but one of you says to them , “ Go in peace , be warmed and be filled , ” but you do not give them the bodily needs , what use is it ?
59002017	So also belief , if it does not have works , is in itself dead .
59002018	But someone might say , “ You have belief , and I have works . ” Show me your belief without your works , and I shall show you my belief by my works .
59002019	You believe that Elohim is one . You do well . The demons also believe – and shudder !
59002020	But do you wish to know , O foolish man , that the belief without the works is dead ?
59002021	Was not Aḇraham our father declared right by works when he offered Yitsḥaq his son on the altar ?
59002022	Do you see that the belief was working with his works , and by the works the belief was perfected ?
59002023	And the Scripture was filled which says , “ Aḇraham believed Elohim , and it was reckoned to him for righteousness . ” And he was called , “ Elohim’s friend . ”
59002024	You see , then , that a man is declared right by works , and not by belief alone .
59002025	In the same way , was not Raḥaḇ the whore also declared right by works when she received the messengers and sent them out another way ?
59002026	For as the body without the spirit is dead , so also the belief is dead without the works .
59003001	Not many of you should become teachers , my brothers , knowing that we shall receive greater judgment .
59003002	For we all stumble in many matters . If anyone does not stumble in word , he is a perfect man , able also to bridle the entire body .
59003003	Look , we put bits in the mouths of horses , for them to obey us , and we turn their body .
59003004	Look at the ships too : although they are so big and are driven by strong winds , they are turned by a very small rudder wherever the pilot intends .
59003005	So too the tongue is a little member , yet boasts greatly . See how a little fire kindles a great forest !
59003006	And the tongue is a fire , the world of unrighteousness . Among our members the tongue is set , the one defiling the entire body , and setting on fire the wheel of life , and it is set on fire by Gehenna .
59003007	For every kind of beast and bird , of reptile and creature of the sea , is tamed and has been tamed by mankind .
59003008	But no man is able to tame the tongue . It is unruly , evil , filled with deadly poison .
59003009	With it we bless our Elohim and Father , and with it we curse men , who have been made in the likeness of Elohim .
59003010	Out of the same mouth proceed blessing and cursing . My brothers , this should not be so .
59003011	Does the fountain send forth the sweet and the bitter from the same opening ?
59003012	My brothers , is a fig tree able to bear olives , or a grapevine figs ? So neither is a fountain able to make salt and sweet water .
59003013	Who is wise and understanding among you ? Let him show by his good behaviour his works in meekness of wisdom .
59003014	But if you have bitter jealousy and self-seeking in your hearts , do not boast against and lie against the truth .
59003015	This is not the wisdom coming down from above , but it is earthly , unspiritual , demonic .
59003016	For where jealousy and self-seeking are , there is confusion and every foul deed .
59003017	But the wisdom from above is first clean , then peaceable , gentle , ready to obey , filled with compassion and good fruits , without partiality and without hypocrisy .
59003018	And the fruit of righteousnessis sown in peace by those who make peace .
59004001	Where do fightings and strivings come from among you ? Do they not come from your pleasures that battle in your members ?
59004002	You desire , and do not have . You murder , and are jealous , and are unable to obtain . You strive and fight , and you do not possess , because you do not ask .
59004003	You ask and do not receive , because you ask evilly , in order to spend it on your pleasures .
59004004	Adulterers and adulteresses ! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with Elohim ? Whoever therefore intends to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of Elohim .
59004005	Or do you think that the Scripture speaks to no purpose ? Does the Spirit which dwells in us intensely crave unto envy ?
59004006	But He gives greater favour . Because of this He says , “ Elohim resists the proud , but gives favour to the humble . ”
59004007	So then subject yourselves to Elohim . Resist the devil and he shall flee from you .
59004008	Draw near to Elohim and He shall draw near to you . Cleanse hands , sinners . And cleanse the hearts , you double-minded !
59004009	Lament and mourn and weep ! Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to dejection .
59004010	Humble yourselves in the sight of the Master , and He shall lift you up .
59004011	Brothers , do not speak against one another . He that speaks against a brother and judges his brother , speaks against Torah and judges Torah . And if you judge Torah , you are not a doer of Torah but a judge .
59004012	There is one Lawgiver and Judge , who is able to save and to destroy . Who are you to judge another ?
59004013	Come now , you who say , “ Today or tomorrow , let us go to such and such a city , spend a year there , and trade , and make a profit , ”
59004014	when you do not know of tomorrow . For what is your life ? For it is a vapour that appears for a little , and then disappears –
59004015	instead of your saying , “ If the Master desires , we shall live and do this or that . ”
59004016	But now you boast in your proud speeches . All such boasting is wicked .
59004017	To him , then , who knows to do good and does not do it , to him it is sin .
59005001	Come now , rich ones , weep , crying aloud over the hardships coming upon you !
59005002	Your riches have rotted , and your garments have become moth-eaten .
59005003	Your gold and silver have become rusty , and their rust shall be a witness against you and shall eat your flesh like fire . You have laid up treasure in the last days .
59005004	See , the wages of the workmen who mowed your fields , which you kept back , cry out . And the cries of the reapers have reached the ears of יהוה of hosts .
59005005	You have lived on the earth in pleasure and luxury , you have fattened your hearts , as in a day of slaughter .
59005006	You have condemned , you have murdered the righteous – he does not resist you .
59005007	So , brothers , be patient until the coming of the Master . See , the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth , waiting patiently for it until it receives the early and latter rain .
59005008	You too , be patient . Establish your hearts , for the coming of the Master has drawn near .
59005009	Do not grumble against each other , brothers , lest you be judged . See , the Judge is standing at the door !
59005010	My brothers , as an example of suffering and patience , take the prophets , who spoke in the Name of יהוה .
59005011	See , we call those blessed who endure . You have heard of the endurance of Iyoḇ and saw the purpose of יהוה , that He is very sympathetic and compassionate .
59005012	But above all , my brothers , do not swear , either by the heaven or by the earth or with any other oath . But let your Yes be Yes , and your No , No , lest you fall into judgment .
59005013	Is any of you suffering evil ? Let him pray . Is anyone in good spirits ? Let him sing psalms .
59005014	Is anyone among you sick ? Let him call for the elders of the assembly , and let them pray over him , having anointed him with oil in the Name of the Master .
59005015	And the prayer of the belief shall save the sick , and the Master shall raise him up . And if he has committed sins , he shall be forgiven .
59005016	Confess your trespasses to one another , and pray for one another , so that you are healed . The earnest prayer of a righteous one accomplishes much .
59005017	Ěliyahu was a man with feelings like us , and he prayed earnestly that it would not rain . And it did not rain on the land for three years and six months .
59005018	And he prayed again , and the heaven gave rain , and the land brought forth its fruit .
59005019	Brothers , if anyone among you goes astray from the truth , and someone turns him back ,
59005020	let him know that he who turns a sinner from the straying of his way shall save a life from death and cover a great number of sins .
60001001	Kĕpha , an emissary of יהושע Messiah , to the chosen , strangers of the dispersion in Pontos , Galatia , Kappadokia , Asia , and Bithunia ,
60001002	chosen according to the foreknowledge of Elohim the Father , set apart by the Spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of יהושע Messiah : Favour and peace be increased to you .
60001003	Blessed be the Elohim and Father of our Master יהושע Messiah , who according to His great compassion has caused us to be born again to a living expectation through the resurrection of יהושע Messiah from the dead ,
60001004	to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and unfading , having been kept in the heavens for you ,
60001005	who are protected by the power of Elohim through belief , for a deliverance ready to be revealed in the last time ,
60001006	in which you exult , even though for a little while , if need be , you have been grieved by manifold trials ,
60001007	in order that the proving of your belief – much more precious than gold that perishes , and proven by fire – might be found to result in praise and respect and esteem at the revelation of יהושע Messiah ,
60001008	whom having not seen , you love ; in whom you exult with unspeakable and esteemed joy , yet not seeing , but believing ,
60001009	obtaining the goal of your belief : a deliverance of lives .
60001010	Concerning this deliverance the prophets have sought out and searched out , prophesying concerning the favour for you ,
60001011	searching to know what , or what sort of time , the Spirit which was in them was pointing out concerning Messiah , when it was bearing witness beforehand the sufferings of Messiah , and the esteems that would follow ,
60001012	to whom it was revealed that they were serving , not themselves , but you , in these matters which now have been announced to you through those who brought the Good News to you by the Set-apart Spirit sent from heaven – into which messengers long to look into .
60001013	Therefore , having girded up the loins of your mind , being sober , set your expectation perfectly upon the favour that is to be brought to you at the revelation of יהושע Messiah ,
60001014	as obedient children , not conforming yourselves to the former lusts in your ignorance ,
60001015	instead , as the One who called you is set-apart , so you also should become set-apart in all behaviour ,
60001016	because it has been written , “ Be set-apart , for I am set-apart . ”
60001017	And if you call on the Father , who without partiality judges according to each one’s work , pass the time of your sojourning in fear ,
60001018	knowing that you were redeemed from your futile way of life inherited from your fathers , not with what is corruptible , silver or gold ,
60001019	but with the precious blood of Messiah , as of a lamb unblemished and spotless ,
60001020	foreknown , indeed , before the foundation of the world , but manifested in these last times for your sakes ,
60001021	who through Him believe in Elohim who raised Him from the dead and gave Him esteem , so that your belief and expectation are in Elohim .
60001022	Now that you have cleansed your lives in obeying the truth through the Spirit to unfeigned brotherly love , love one another fervently with a clean heart ,
60001023	having been born again – not of corruptible seed , but incorruptible – through the living Word of Elohim , which remains forever ,
60001024	because “ All flesh is as grass , and all the esteem of man as the flower of the grass . The grass withers , and its flower falls away ,
60001025	but the Word of Elohim remains forever . ” And this is the Word , announced as Good News to you .
60002001	Having put aside , then , all evil , and all deceit , and hypocrisies , and envyings , and all evil words ,
60002002	as newborn babes , desire the unadulterated milk of the Word , in order that you grow by it ,
60002003	if indeed you have tasted that the Master is good .
60002004	Drawing near to Him , a living Stone – rejected indeed by men , but chosen by Elohim and precious –
60002005	you also , as living stones , are being built up , a spiritual house , a set-apart priesthood , to offer up spiritual slaughter offerings acceptable to Elohim through יהושע Messiah .
60002006	Because it is contained in the Scripture , “ See , I lay in Tsiyon a chief corner-stone , chosen , precious , and he who believes on Him shall by no means be put to shame . ”
60002007	This preciousness , then , is for you who believe ; but to those who are disobedient , “ The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief corner-stone , ”
60002008	and “ A stone of stumbling and a rock that makes for falling , ” who stumble because they are disobedient to the Word , to which they also were appointed .
60002009	But you are a chosen race , a royal priesthood , a set-apart nation , a people for a possession , that you should proclaim the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvellous light ,
60002010	who once were not a people , but now the people of Elohim ; who had not obtained compassion , but now obtained compassion .
60002011	Beloved ones , I appeal to you as sojourners and pilgrims , to abstain from fleshly lusts which battle against the life ,
60002012	having your behaviour among the gentiles good so that when they speak against you as evil-doers , let them , by observing your good works , esteem Elohim in a day of visitation .
60002013	Be subject to every institution of man because of the Master , whether to the sovereign as supreme ,
60002014	or to governors , as to those who are sent by him for the punishment of doers of evil , and a praise for those who do good .
60002015	Because such is the desire of Elohim , that by doing good you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men ,
60002016	as free , yet not using your freedom as a cloak for evil , but as servants of Elohim .
60002017	Respect all , love the brotherhood , fear Elohim , respect the sovereign .
60002018	Servants , be subject to your masters with all fear , not only to the good and gentle , but also to the crooked ones .
60002019	For this is favour , if because of conscience toward Elohim anyone bears up under grief , suffering unrighteously .
60002020	For what credit is there in enduring a beating when you sin ? But if you suffer for doing good and you endure , this finds favour with Elohim .
60002021	For to this you were called , because Messiah also suffered for us , leaving us an example , that you should follow His steps ,
60002022	“ who committed no sin , nor was deceit found in His mouth , ”
60002023	who , being reviled , did not revile in return ; suffering , did not threaten , but committed Himself to Him who judges righteously ;
60002024	who Himself bore our sins in His body on the timber , so that we , having died to sins , might live unto righteousness – by whose stripes you were healed .
60002025	For you were like sheep going astray , but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your lives .
60003001	In the same way , wives , be subject to your own husbands , so that if any are disobedient to the Word , they , without a word , might be won by the behaviour of their wives ,
60003002	having seen your blameless behaviour in fear .
60003003	Your adornment should not be outward – arranging the hair , wearing gold , or putting on dresses –
60003004	but the hidden Man of the heart , with the incorruptible ornament of a meek and peaceable spirit , which is of great value before Elohim .
60003005	For in this way , in former times , the set-apart women who trusted in Elohim also adorned themselves , being subject to their own husbands ,
60003006	as Sarah obeyed Aḇraham , calling him master , of whom you became children , doing good , and not frightened by any fear .
60003007	In the same way , husbands , live understandingly together , giving respect to the wife , as to the weaker vessel , and as being heirs together of the favour of life , so that your prayers are not hindered .
60003008	To sum up , let all of you be like-minded , sympathetic , loving as brothers , tenderhearted , humble-minded ,
60003009	not returning evil for evil or reviling for reviling , but on the contrary blessing , knowing that you were called to this , in order to inherit a blessing .
60003010	For “ He who wishes to love life and see good days , let him keep his tongue from evil , and his lips from speaking deceit ,
60003011	let him turn away from evil and do good , let him seek peace and pursue it .
60003012	“ Because the eyes of יהוה are on the righteous , and his ears are open to their prayers , but the face of יהוה is against those who do evil . ”
60003013	And who is the one doing evil to you , if you become imitators of the good ?
60003014	But even if you suffer for righteousness’ sake , you are blessed . “ And do not fear their threats , neither be troubled . ”
60003015	But set apart יהוה Elohim in your hearts , and always be ready to give an answer to everyone asking you a reason concerning the expectation that is in you , with meekness and fear ,
60003016	having a good conscience , so that when they speak against you as doers of evil , those who falsely accuse your good behaviour in Messiah , shall be ashamed .
60003017	For it is better , if it is the desire of Elohim , to suffer for doing good than for doing evil .
60003018	Because even Messiah once suffered for sins , the righteous for the unrighteous , to bring you to Elohim , having been put to death indeed in flesh but made alive in the Spirit ,
60003019	in which also He went and proclaimed unto the spirits in prison ,
60003020	who were disobedient at one time when the patience of Elohim waited in the days of Noaḥ , while the ark was being prepared , in which a few , that is , eight beings , were saved through water ,
60003021	which figure now also saves us : immersion – not a putting away of the filth of the flesh , but the answer of a good conscience toward Elohim – through the resurrection of יהושע Messiah ,
60003022	who , having gone into heaven , is at the right hand of Elohim , messengers and authorities and powers having been subjected to Him .
60004001	Therefore , since Messiah suffered in the flesh , arm yourselves also with the same mind , because he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin ,
60004002	so that he no longer lives the rest of his time in the flesh for the lusts of men , but according to the desire of Elohim .
60004003	For we have spent enough of our past lifetime in doing the desire of the gentiles , having walked in indecencies , lusts , drunkenness , orgies , wild parties , and abominable idolatries ,
60004004	in which they are surprised that you do not run with them in the same flood of loose behaviour , blaspheming ,
60004005	who shall give an account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead .
60004006	For this reason the Good News was also brought to those who are dead , so that , whereas they are judged according to men in the flesh , they might live according to Elohim in the spirit .
60004007	But the end of all has drawn near . Therefore be sober-minded , and be attentive in the prayers .
60004008	And above all have fervent love for one another , because love covers a great number of sins .
60004009	Welcome one another without grumbling .
60004010	As each one has received a gift , serve one another , as good trustees of the manifold favour of Elohim .
60004011	If anyone speaks , let it be as the Words of Elohim . If anyone serves , let it be as with the strength which Elohim provides , so that Elohim might be praised in it all through יהושע Messiah , to whom belong the esteem and the rule forever and ever . Amĕn .
60004012	Beloved ones , do not be surprised at the fiery trial that is coming upon you , to try you , as though some unusual matter has befallen you ,
60004013	but as you share Messiah’s sufferings , rejoice , in order that you might rejoice exultingly at the revelation of His esteem .
60004014	If you are reproached for the Name of Messiah , you are blessed , because the Spirit of esteem and of Elohim rests upon you . On their part He is blasphemed , but on your part He is praised .
60004015	For do not let any of you suffer as a murderer , or thief , or doer of evil , or as a meddler .
60004016	But if one suffers being Messianic , let him not be ashamed , but let him esteem Elohim in this matter .
60004017	Because it is time for judgment to begin from the House of Elohim . And if firstly from us , what is the end of those who do not obey the Good News of Elohim ?
60004018	And if the righteous one is scarcely saved , where shall the wicked and the sinner appear ?
60004019	So then , those who suffer according to the desire of Elohim should commit their lives to a trustworthy Creator , in doing good .
60005001	Therefore , as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Messiah , and also a sharer of the esteem that is to be revealed , I appeal to the elders among you :
60005002	Shepherd the flock of Elohim which is among you , serving as overseers , not by compulsion but voluntarily , not out of greed for filthy gain , but eagerly ,
60005003	neither as being masters over those entrusted to you , but being examples to the flock .
60005004	And when the Chief Shepherd appears , you shall receive the never-fading crown of esteem .
60005005	In the same way , you younger ones , be subject to elders . And gird yourselves with humility toward one another , for “ Elohim resists the proud , but gives favour to the humble . ”
60005006	Humble yourselves , then , under the mighty hand of Elohim , so that He exalts you in due time ,
60005007	casting all your worry upon Him , for He is concerned about you .
60005008	Be sober , watch , because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion , seeking someone to devour .
60005009	Resist him , firm in the belief , knowing that the same hardships are experienced by your brotherhood in the world .
60005010	And the Elohim of all favour , who called you to His everlasting esteem by Messiah יהושע , after you have suffered a while , Himself perfect , establish , strengthen , and settle you .
60005011	To Him be the esteem and the might forever and ever . Amĕn .
60005012	Through Sila the trustworthy brother , as I reckon , I have written to you briefly , encouraging and witnessing that this is the true favour of Elohim . In this stand fast .
60005013	She who is in Baḇel , chosen together with you , greets you , also my son , Mark .
60005014	Greet one another with a kiss of love . Peace to all of you who are in Messiah יהושע . Amĕn .
61001001	Shim‛on Kĕpha , a servant and emissary of יהושע Messiah , to those who have obtained a belief as precious as ours by the righteousness of our Elohim and Saviour יהושע Messiah :
61001002	Favour and peace be increased to you in the knowledge of Elohim and of יהושע our Master ,
61001003	as His Mighty-like power has given to us all we need for life and reverence , through the knowledge of Him who called us to esteem and uprightness .
61001004	Through these there have been given to us exceedingly great and precious promises , so that through these you might be partakers of the Mighty-like nature , having escaped from the corruption in the world , caused by lust .
61001005	And for this reason do your utmost to add to your belief uprightness , to uprightness knowledge ,
61001006	to knowledge self-control , to self-control endurance , to endurance reverence ,
61001007	to reverence brotherly affection , and to brotherly affection love .
61001008	For if these are in you and increase , they cause you to be neither inactive nor without fruit in the knowledge of our Master יהושע Messiah .
61001009	For he in whom these are not present is blind , being shortsighted , and has forgotten that he has been cleansed from his old sins .
61001010	For this reason , brothers , all the more do your utmost to make firm your calling and choosing , for if you are doing these matters you shall never stumble at all ,
61001011	for in this way an entrance into the everlasting reign of our Master and Saviour יהושע Messiah shall be richly supplied to you .
61001012	And so I intend to remind you of these matters again and again , though you know them and have been established in the present truth .
61001013	But I think it is right , as long as I am in this tent , to stir you up by a reminder ,
61001014	knowing that the putting off of my tent is soon , even as our Master יהושע Messiah made clear to me .
61001015	And I shall do my utmost also , to see to it that you always have a reminder of these matters after my departure .
61001016	For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we made known to you the power and coming of our Master יהושע Messiah , but were eye-witnesses of His superbness .
61001017	For when He received respect and esteem from Elohim the Father , such a voice came to Him from the Excellent Esteem , “ This is My Son , the Beloved in whom I did delight . ”
61001018	And we heard this voice which came from heaven when we were with Him on the set-apart mountain .
61001019	And we have the prophetic word made more certain , which you do well to heed as a light that shines in a dark place , until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts ,
61001020	knowing this first , that no prophecy of Scripture came to be of one’s own interpretation ,
61001021	for prophecy never came by the desire of man , but men of Elohim spoke , being moved by the Set-apart Spirit .
61002001	But there also came to be false prophets among the people , as also among you there shall be false teachers , who shall secretly bring in destructive heresies , and deny the Master who bought them , bringing swift destruction on themselves .
61002002	And many shall follow their destructive ways , because of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of ,
61002003	and in greed , with fabricated words , they shall use you for gain . From of old their judgment does not linger , and their destruction does not slumber .
61002004	For if Elohim did not spare the messengers who sinned , but sent them to Tartaros , and delivered them into chains of darkness , to be kept for judgment ,
61002005	and did not spare the world of old , but preserved Noaḥ , a proclaimer of righteousness , and seven others , bringing in the flood on the world of the wicked ,
61002006	and having reduced to ashes the cities of Seḏom and Amorah condemned them to destruction – having made them an example to those who afterward would live wickedly ,
61002007	and rescued righteous Lot , who was oppressed with the indecent behaviour of the lawless
61002008	( for day after day that righteous man , dwelling among them , tortured his righteous being by seeing and hearing their lawless works ) ,
61002009	then יהוה knows how to rescue the reverent ones from trial and to keep the unrighteous unto the day of judgment , to be punished ,
61002010	and most of all those walking after the flesh in filthy lust and despising authority – bold , headstrong , speaking evil of esteemed ones ,
61002011	whereas messengers who are greater in strength and power do not bring a slanderous accusation against them before the Master .
61002012	But these , like natural unreasoning beasts , having been born to be caught and destroyed , blaspheme that which they do not know , shall be destroyed in their destruction ,
61002013	being about to receive the wages of unrighteousness , deeming indulgence in the day of pleasure , spots and blemishes , revelling in their own deceptions while they feast with you ,
61002014	having eyes filled with an adulteress , and unable to cease from sin , enticing unstable beings , having a heart trained in greed , children of a curse ,
61002015	having left the right way they went astray , having followed the way of Bil‛am the son of Be‛or , who loved the wages of unrighteousness ,
61002016	but he was rebuked for his transgression : a dumb donkey speaking with the voice of a man restrained the madness of the prophet .
61002017	These are fountains without water , clouds driven by a storm , to whom the blackest darkness is kept forever .
61002018	For speaking arrogant nonsense , they entice – through the lusts of the flesh , through indecencies – the ones who have indeed escaped from those living in delusion ,
61002019	promising them freedom , though themselves being slaves of corruption – for one is a slave to whatever overcomes him .
61002020	For if , after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of the Master and Saviour יהושע Messiah , they are again entangled in them and overcome , the latter end is worse for them than the first .
61002021	For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness , than having known it , to turn from the set-apart command delivered unto them .
61002022	For them the proverb has proved true , “ A dog returns to his own vomit , ” and , “ A washed sow returns to her rolling in the mud . ”
61003001	This is now , beloved ones , the second letter I write to you , in which I stir up your sincere mind , to remember
61003002	the words previously spoken by the set-apart prophets , and of the command of the Master and Saviour , spoken by your emissaries ,
61003003	knowing this first : that mockers shall come in the last days with mocking , walking according to their own lusts ,
61003004	and saying , “ Where is the promise of His coming ? For since the fathers fell asleep , all continues as from the beginning of creation . ”
61003005	For they choose to have this hidden from them : that the heavens were of old , and the earth standing out of water and in the water , by the Word of Elohim ,
61003006	through which the world at that time was destroyed , being flooded with water .
61003007	And the present heavens and the earth are treasured up by the same Word , being kept for fire , to a day of judgment and destruction of wicked men .
61003008	But , beloved ones , let not this one matter be hidden from you : that with יהוה one day is as a thousand years , and a thousand years as one day .
61003009	יהוה is not slow in regard to the promise , as some count slowness , but is patient toward us , not wishing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance .
61003010	But the day of יהוה shall come as a thief in the night , in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise , and the elements shall melt with intense heat , and the earth and the works that are in it shall be burned up .
61003011	Seeing all these are to be destroyed in this way , what kind of people ought you to be in set-apart behaviour and reverence ,
61003012	looking for and hastening the coming of the day of Elohim , through which the heavens shall be destroyed , being set on fire , and the elements melt with intense heat !
61003013	But according to His promise we wait for a renewed heavens and a renewed earth in which righteousness dwells .
61003014	So then , beloved ones , looking forward to this , do your utmost to be found by Him in peace , spotless and blameless ,
61003015	and reckon the patience of our Master as deliverance , as also our beloved brother Sha’ul wrote to you , according to the wisdom given to him ,
61003016	as also in all his letters , speaking in them concerning these matters , in which some are hard to understand , which those who are untaught and unstable twist to their own destruction , as they do also the other Scriptures .
61003017	You , then , beloved ones , being forewarned , watch , lest you also fall from your own steadfastness , being led away with the delusion of the lawless ,
61003018	but grow in the favour and knowledge of our Master and Saviour יהושע Messiah . To Him be the esteem both now and to a day that abides . Amĕn .
62001001	What was from the beginning , what we have heard , what we have seen with our eyes , what we have looked upon , and our hands have handled , concerning the Word of life :
62001002	And the life was manifested , and we have seen , and bear witness , and announce to you that everlasting life which was with the Father and was manifested to us .
62001003	We announce to you what we have seen and heard , so that you too might have fellowship with us . And truly our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son יהושע Messiah .
62001004	And we write this to you in order that your joy might be complete .
62001005	And this is the message which we have heard from Him and announce to you , that Elohim is light and in Him is no darkness at all .
62001006	If we say that we have fellowship with Him , and walk in darkness , we lie and are not doing the truth .
62001007	But if we walk in the light as He is in the light , we have fellowship with one another , and the blood of יהושע Messiah His Son cleanses us from all sin .
62001008	If we say that we have no sin , we are misleading ourselves , and the truth is not in us .
62001009	If we confess our sins , He is trustworthy and righteous to forgive us the sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness .
62001010	If we say that we have not sinned , we make Him a liar , and His Word is not in us .
62002001	My little children , I write this to you , so that you do not sin . And if anyone sins , we have an Intercessor with the Father , יהושע Messiah , a righteous One .
62002002	And He Himself is an atoning offering for our sins , and not for ours only but also for all the world .
62002003	And by this we know that we know Him , if we guard His commands .
62002004	The one who says , “ I know Him , ” and does not guard His commands , is a liar , and the truth is not in him .
62002005	But whoever guards His Word , truly the love of Elohim has been perfected in him . By this we know that we are in Him .
62002006	The one who says he stays in Him ought himself also to walk , even as He walked .
62002007	Beloved , I write no fresh command to you , but an old command which you have had from the beginning . The old command is the Word which you heard from the beginning .
62002008	Again I write you a fresh command , which is true in Him and in you , because the darkness is passing away , and the true light now shines .
62002009	The one who says he is in the light , and hates his brother , is in the darkness until now .
62002010	The one who loves his brother stays in the light , and there is no stumbling-block in him .
62002011	But the one who hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness , and does not know where he is going , because the darkness has blinded his eyes .
62002012	I write to you , little children , because your sins have been forgiven on account of His Name .
62002013	I write to you , fathers , because you have known Him from the beginning . I write to you , young men , because you have overcome the wicked one . I write to you , little children , because you have known the Father .
62002014	I wrote to you , fathers , because you have known Him from the beginning . I wrote to you , young men , because you are strong , and the Word of Elohim stays in you , and you have overcome the wicked one .
62002015	Do not love the world nor that which is in the world . If anyone loves the world , the love of the Father is not in him .
62002016	Because all that is in the world – the lust of the flesh , the lust of the eyes , and the pride of life – is not of the Father but is of the world .
62002017	And the world passes away , and the lust of it , but the one doing the desire of Elohim remains forever .
62002018	Little children , it is the last hour . And as you have heard that the anti-messiah is coming , even now many anti-messiahs have come . This is how we know that it is the last hour .
62002019	They went out from us , but they were not of us , for if they had been of us , they would have stayed with us – but in order that it might be made manifest that none of them were of us .
62002020	And you have an anointing from the Set-apart One , and you know all .
62002021	I did not write to you because you do not know the truth , but because you know it , and because no falsehood is of the truth .
62002022	Who is the liar , except the one denying that יהושע is the Messiah ? This is the anti-messiah , the one denying the Father and the Son .
62002023	No one denying the Son has the Father . The one confessing the Son has the Father as well .
62002024	As for you , let that stay in you which you heard from the beginning . If what you heard from the beginning stays in you , you also shall stay in the Son and in the Father .
62002025	And this is the promise that He has promised us : everlasting life .
62002026	I have written this to you concerning those who lead you astray .
62002027	But the anointing which you have received from Him stays in you , and you have no need that anyone should teach you . But as the same anointing does teach you concerning all , and is true , and is no falsehood , and even as it has taught you , you stay in Him .
62002028	And now , little children , stay in Him , so that when He appears , we might have boldness and not be ashamed before Him at His coming .
62002029	If you know that He is righteous , you know that everyone doing righteousness has been born of Him .
62003001	See what love the Father has given us , that we should be called children of Elohim ! For this reason the world does not know us , because it did not know Him .
62003002	Beloved ones , now we are children of Elohim . And it has not yet been revealed what we shall be , but we know that when He is revealed , we shall be like Him , for we shall see Him as He is .
62003003	And everyone having this expectation in Him cleanses himself , as He is clean .
62003004	Everyone doing sin also does lawlessness , and sin is lawlessness .
62003005	And you know that He was manifested to take away our sins , and in Him there is no sin .
62003006	Everyone staying in Him does not sin . Everyone sinning has neither seen Him nor known Him .
62003007	Little children , let no one lead you astray . The one doing righteousness is righteous , even as He is righteous .
62003008	The one doing sin is of the devil , because the devil has sinned from the beginning . For this purpose the Son of Elohim was manifested : to destroy the works of the devil .
62003009	Everyone having been born of Elohim does not sin , because His seed stays in him , and he is powerless to sin , because he has been born of Elohim .
62003010	In this the children of Elohim and the children of the devil are manifest : Everyone not doing righteousness is not of Elohim , neither the one not loving his brother .
62003011	Because this is the message that you heard from the beginning , that we should love one another ,
62003012	not as Qayin who was of the wicked one and killed his brother . And why did he kill him ? Because his works were wicked but those of his brother were righteous .
62003013	Do not marvel , my brothers , if the world hates you .
62003014	We know that we have passed out of death into life , because we love the brothers . The one not loving his brother stays in death .
62003015	Everyone hating his brother is a murderer , and you know that no murderer has everlasting life staying in him .
62003016	By this we have known love , because He laid down His life for us . And we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers .
62003017	But whoever has this world’s goods , and sees his brother in need , and shuts up his tender affections from him , how does the love of Elohim stay in him ?
62003018	My little children , let us not love in word or in tongue , but in deed and in truth .
62003019	And by this we know that we are of the truth , and shall set our hearts at rest before Him ,
62003020	that if our heart condemns us , Elohim is greater than our heart , and knows all .
62003021	Beloved ones , if our heart does not condemn us , we have boldness toward Elohim .
62003022	And whatever we ask we receive from Him , because we guard His commands and do what is pleasing in His sight .
62003023	And this is His command , that we should believe in the Name of His Son יהושע Messiah and love one another , as He gave us command .
62003024	And the one guarding His commands stays in Him , and He in him . And by this we know that He stays in us , by the Spirit which He gave us .
62004001	Beloved ones , do not believe every spirit , but prove the spirits , whether they are of Elohim , because many false prophets have gone out into the world .
62004002	By this you know the Spirit of Elohim : Every spirit that confesses that יהושע Messiah has come in the flesh is of Elohim ,
62004003	and every spirit that does not confess that יהושע Messiah has come in the flesh is not of Elohim . And this is the spirit of the anti-messiah which you heard is coming , and now is already in the world .
62004004	You are of Elohim , little children , and have overcome them , because He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world .
62004005	They are of the world , therefore they speak as of the world , and the world hears them .
62004006	We are of Elohim – the one knowing Elohim hears us . He who is not of Elohim does not hear us . By this we know the Spirit of the Truth and the spirit of the delusion .
62004007	Beloved ones , let us love one another , because love is of Elohim , and everyone who loves has been born of Elohim , and knows Elohim .
62004008	The one who does not love does not know Elohim , for Elohim is love .
62004009	By this the love of Elohim was manifested in us , that Elohim has sent His only brought-forth Son into the world , in order that we might live through Him .
62004010	In this is love , not that we loved Elohim , but that He loved us and sent His Son to be an atoning offering for our sins .
62004011	Beloved ones , if Elohim so loved us , we also ought to love one another .
62004012	No one has seen Elohim at any time . If we love one another , Elohim does stay in us , and His love has been perfected in us .
62004013	By this we know that we stay in Him , and He in us , because He has given us of His Spirit .
62004014	And we have seen and bear witness that the Father has sent the Son , Saviour of the world .
62004015	Whoever confesses that יהושע is the Son of Elohim , Elohim stays in him , and he in Elohim .
62004016	And we have known and believed the love that Elohim has for us . Elohim is love , and he who stays in love stays in Elohim , and Elohim in him .
62004017	By this love has been perfected with us , in order that we might have boldness in the day of judgment , because as He is so are we in this world .
62004018	There is no fear in love , but perfect love casts out fear , because fear holds punishment , and he who fears has not been made perfect in love .
62004019	We love Him because He first loved us .
62004020	If someone says , “ I love Elohim , ” and hates his brother , he is a liar . For the one not loving his brother whom he has seen , how is he able to love Elohim whom he has not seen ?
62004021	And we have this command from Him , that the one loving Elohim should love his brother too .
62005001	Everyone who believes that יהושע is the Messiah has been born of Elohim , and everyone who loves the One bringing forth also loves the one having been born of Him .
62005002	By this we know that we love the children of Elohim , when we love Elohim and guard His commands .
62005003	For this is the love for Elohim , that we guard His commands , and His commands are not heavy ,
62005004	because everyone having been born of Elohim overcomes the world . And this is the overcoming that has overcome the world : our belief .
62005005	Who is the one who overcomes the world but he who believes that יהושע is the Son of Elohim ?
62005006	This is the One that came by water and blood : יהושע Messiah , not only by water , but by water and blood . And it is the Spirit who bears witness , because the Spirit is the Truth .
62005007	Because there are three who bear witness :
62005008	the Spirit , and the water , and the blood . And the three are in agreement .
62005009	If we receive the witness of men , the witness of Elohim is greater , because this is the witness of Elohim which He has witnessed concerning His Son .
62005010	The one who believes in the Son of Elohim has the witness in himself , the one who does not believe Elohim has made Him a liar , because he has not believed the witness that Elohim has given concerning His Son .
62005011	And this is the witness : that Elohim has given us everlasting life , and this life is in His Son .
62005012	He who possesses the Son possesses life , he who does not possess the Son of Elohim does not possess life .
62005013	I have written this to you who believe in the Name of the Son of Elohim , so that you know that you possess everlasting life , and so that you believe in the Name of the Son of Elohim .
62005014	And this is the boldness that we have in Him , that if we ask whatever according to His desire , He hears us .
62005015	And if we know that He hears us , whatever we ask , we know that we have the petitions that we have asked of Him .
62005016	If anyone sees his brother sinning a sin , not unto death , he shall ask , and He shall give him life for those not sinning unto death . There is a sin unto death . I do not say that he should pray about that .
62005017	All unrighteousness is sin , and there is a sin not unto death .
62005018	We know that everyone having been born of Elohim does not sin , but the one having been born of Elohim guards himself , and the wicked one does not touch him .
62005019	We know that we are of Elohim , and all the world lies in the wicked one .
62005020	And we know that the Son of Elohim has come and has given us an understanding , so that we might know the true One . And we are in the true One , in His Son יהושע Messiah . This is the true Elohim and everlasting life .
62005021	Little children , keep yourselves from idols . Amĕn .
63001001	The elder , to a chosen Kuria and her children , whom I love in truth , and not only I , but also all those who have known the truth ,
63001002	because of the truth which stays in us and shall be with us forever :
63001003	Favour , compassion , peace be with you from Elohim the Father , and from the Master יהושע Messiah , the Son of the Father , in truth and love .
63001004	I rejoiced greatly because I found some of your children walking in truth , as we received a command from the Father .
63001005	And now I ask you , Kuria , not as though I wrote a fresh command to you , but that which we have had from the beginning : that we love one another .
63001006	And this is the love , that we walk according to His commands . This is the command , that as you have heard from the beginning , you should walk in it .
63001007	Because many who are leading astray went out into the world who do not confess יהושע Messiah as coming in the flesh . This one is he who is leading astray and the anti-messiah .
63001008	See to yourselves , that we do not lose what we worked for , but that we might receive a complete reward .
63001009	Everyone who is transgressing and not staying in the teaching of Messiah does not possess Elohim . The one who stays in the teaching of Messiah possesses both the Father and the Son .
63001010	If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching , do not receive him into your house nor greet him ,
63001011	for he who greets him shares in his wicked works .
63001012	Having much to write to you , I did not wish to do so with paper and ink , but I expect to come to you and speak face to face , so that our joy might be complete .
63001013	The children of your chosen sister greet you . Amĕn .
65001001	Yehuḏah , a servant of יהושע Messiah , and brother of Ya‛aqoḇ , to those who are called , set-apart by Elohim the Father , and preserved in יהושע Messiah :
65001002	Compassion , and peace , and love be increased to you .
65001003	Beloved ones , making all haste to write to you concerning our common deliverance , I felt the necessity to write to you urging you to earnestly contend for the belief which was once for all delivered to the set-apart ones .
65001004	For certain men have slipped in , whose judgment was written about long ago , wicked ones perverting the favour of our Elohim for indecency , and denying the only Master יהוה and our Master יהושע Messiah .
65001005	But I intend to remind you , though you once knew this , that יהוה , having saved a people out of the land of Mitsrayim , afterward destroyed those who did not believe .
65001006	And the messengers who did not keep their own principality , but left their own dwelling , He has kept in everlasting shackles under darkness for the judgment of the great day .
65001007	Even as Seḏom and Amorah and the cities around them in a similar way to these , having given themselves over to whoring and gone after strange flesh , are set forth as an example , undergoing judicial punishment of everlasting fire .
65001008	In the same way , indeed , these dreamers defile the flesh , and reject authority , and speak evil of esteemed ones .
65001009	But Miḵa’ĕl the chief messenger , in contending with the devil , when he disputed about the body of Mosheh , presumed not to bring against him a blasphemous accusation , but said , “ יהוה rebuke you ! ”
65001010	But these blaspheme that which they do not know . And that which they know naturally , like unreasoning beasts , in these they corrupt themselves .
65001011	Woe to them ! Because they have gone in the way of Qayin , and gave themselves to the delusion of Bil‛am for a reward , and perished in the rebellion of Qoraḥ .
65001012	These are rocky reefs in your love feasts , feasting with you , feeding themselves without fear , waterless clouds borne about by the winds , late autumn trees without fruit , twice dead , pulled up by the roots ,
65001013	wild waves of the sea foaming up their own shame , straying stars for whom blackness of darkness is kept forever .
65001014	And Ḥanoḵ , the seventh from Adam , also prophesied of these , saying , “ See , יהוה comes with His myriads of set-apart ones ,
65001015	to execute judgment on all , to punish all who are wicked among them concerning all their wicked works which they have committed in a wicked way , and concerning all the harsh words which wicked sinners have spoken against Him . ”
65001016	These are grumblers , complainers , who walk according to their own lusts , and their mouth speaks proudly , admiring faces of others for the sake of gain .
65001017	But you , beloved ones , remember the words spoken before by the emissaries of our Master יהושע Messiah ,
65001018	because they told you that there would be mockers in the last time who would walk according to their own wicked lusts .
65001019	These are the ones who cause divisions , not having the Spirit .
65001020	But you , beloved ones , building yourselves up on your most set-apart belief , praying in the Set-apart Spirit ,
65001021	keep yourselves in the love of Elohim , looking for the compassion of our Master יהושע Messiah unto everlasting life .
65001022	And show compassion toward some who are doubting ,
65001023	but others save with fear , snatching them out of the fire , hating , even the garment defiled by the flesh .
65001024	And to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling , and to present you blameless before the presence of His esteem with exceeding joy ,
65001025	to the only wise Elohim , our Saviour , be esteem and greatness and might and authority , both now and forever . Amĕn .
66001001	Revelation of יהושע Messiah , which Elohim gave Him to show His servants what has to take place with speed . And He signified it by sending His messenger to His servant Yoḥanan ,
66001002	who bore witness to the Word of Elohim , and the witness of יהושע Messiah – to all he saw .
66001003	Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of this prophecy , and guard what is written in it , for the time is near .
66001004	Yoḥanan , to the seven assemblies that are in Asia : Favour to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is coming , and from the seven Spirits that are before His throne ,
66001005	and from יהושע Messiah , the trustworthy witness , the first-born from the dead , and the ruler of the sovereigns of the earth . To Him who loved us and washed us from our sins in His own blood ,
66001006	and has made us sovereigns and priests to His Elohim and Father , to Him be esteem and rule forever and ever . Amĕn .
66001007	See , He is coming with the clouds , and every eye shall see Him , even they who pierced Him . And all the tribes of the earth shall mourn because of Him . Yes , Amĕn .
66001008	“ I am the ‘ Aleph’ and the ‘ Taw’ , Beginning and End , ” says יהוה “ who is and who was and who is to come , the Almighty . ”
66001009	I , Yoḥanan , both your brother and co-sharer in pressure , and in the reign and endurance of יהושע Messiah , came to be on the island that is called Patmos for the Word of Elohim and for the witness of יהושע Messiah .
66001010	I came to be in the Spirit on the Day of יהוה , and I heard behind me a loud voice , as of a trumpet ,
66001011	saying , “ I am the ‘ Aleph’ and the ‘ Taw’ , the First and the Last , ” and , “ Write in a book what you see and send it to the seven assemblies of Asia – to Ephesos , and to Smurna , and to Pergamos , and to Thyatira , and to Sardis , and to Philadelphia , and to Laodikeia . ”
66001012	And I turned to see the voice which spoke with me . And having turned , I saw seven golden lampstands ,
66001013	and in the midst of the seven lampstands One like the Son of Aḏam , dressed in a robe down to the feet and girded about the chest with a golden band .
66001014	And His head and hair were white as white wool , as snow , and His eyes as a flame of fire ,
66001015	and His feet like burnished brass , as if refined in a furnace , and His voice as the sound of many waters .
66001016	And in His right hand He held seven stars , and out of His mouth went a sharp two-edged sword , and His face was as the sun shining in its strength .
66001017	And when I saw Him , I fell at His feet as dead , and He placed His right hand on me , saying , “ Do not be afraid , I am the First and the Last ,
66001018	and the living One . And I became dead , and see , I am living forever and ever . Amĕn . And I possess the keys of the grave and of death .
66001019	“ Write therefore what you have seen , both what is now and what shall take place after these :
66001020	“ The secret of the seven stars which you saw in My right hand , and the seven golden lampstands : The seven stars are messengers of the seven assemblies , and the seven lampstands which you saw are seven assemblies .
66002001	“ To the messenger of the assembly of Ephesos write , ‘ He who is holding the seven stars in His right hand , who is walking in the midst of the seven golden lampstands , says this :
66002002	“ I know your works , and your labour , and your endurance , and that you are not able to bear evil ones , and have tried those who say they are emissaries and are not , and have found them false ;
66002003	and you have been bearing up and have endurance , and have laboured for My Name’s sake and have not become weary .
66002004	“ But I hold this against you , that you have left your first love .
66002005	“ So remember from where you have fallen , and repent and do the first works , or else I shall come to you speedily and remove your lampstand from its place , unless you repent .
66002006	“ Yet this you have , that you hate the works of the Nikolaites , which I also hate .
66002007	“ He who has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies . To him who overcomes I shall give to eat from the tree of life , which is in the midst of the Paradise of Elohim . ” ’
66002008	“ And to the messenger of the assembly in Smurna write , ‘ This says the First and the Last , who became dead , and came to life :
66002009	“ I know your works , and pressure , and poverty – yet you are rich – and the blasphemy of those who say they are Yehuḏim and are not , but are a congregation of Satan .
66002010	“ Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer . See , the devil is about to throw some of you into prison , in order to try you , and you shall have pressure ten days . Be trustworthy until death , and I shall give you the crown of life .
66002011	“ He who has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies . He who overcomes shall by no means be harmed by the second death . ” ’
66002012	“ And to the messenger of the assembly in Pergamos write , ‘ He who has the sharp two-edged sword , says this :
66002013	“ I know your works , and where you dwell , where the throne of Satan is . And you hold fast to My Name , and did not deny the belief in Me , even in the days in which Antipas was My trustworthy witness , who was killed near you , where Satan dwells .
66002014	“ But I hold a few matters against you , because you have there those who adhere to the teaching of Bil‛am , who taught Balaq to put a stumbling-block before the children of Yisra’ĕl , to eat food offered to idols , and to commit whoring .
66002015	“ So you also have those who adhere to the teaching of the Nikolaites , which teaching I hate .
66002016	“ Repent , or else I shall come to you speedily and fight against them with the sword of My mouth .
66002017	“ He who has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies . To him who overcomes I shall give some of the hidden manna to eat . And I shall give him a white stone , and on the stone a renewed Name written which no one knows except him who receives it . ” ’
66002018	“ And to the messenger of the assembly in Thyatira write , ‘ This says the Son of Elohim , who has eyes like a flame of fire , and His feet like burnished brass :
66002019	“ I know your works , and love , and service , and belief , and your endurance . And as for your works , the last are more than the first .
66002020	“ But I hold against you that you allow that woman Izeḇel , who calls herself a prophetess , to teach and lead My servants astray to commit whoring and to eat food offered to idols .
66002021	“ And I gave her time to repent of her whoring , and she did not repent .
66002022	“ See , I am throwing her into a sickbed , and those who commit adultery with her into great affliction , unless they repent of their works .
66002023	“ And I shall slay her children with death . And all the assemblies shall know that I am the One searching the kidneys and hearts . And I shall give to each one of you according to your works .
66002024	“ And to you I say , and to the rest in Thyatira , as many as do not possess this teaching , and who have not known the depths of Satan , as they call them , I am not putting on you another burden .
66002025	“ But hold fast what you have until I come .
66002026	“ And he who overcomes , and guards My works until the end , to him I shall give authority over the nations ,
66002027	and he shall shepherd them with a rod of iron , as the potter’s vessels shall be broken to pieces , as I also have received from My Father .
66002028	“ And I shall give him the morning star .
66002029	“ He who has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies . ” ’
66003001	“ And to the messenger of the assembly in Sardis write , ‘ He who has the seven Spirits of Elohim and the seven stars , says this , “ I know your works , that you have a name that you are alive , but you are dead .
66003002	“ Wake up , and strengthen what remains and is about to die , for I have not found your works complete before Elohim .
66003003	“ Remember , then , how you have received , and heard . And watch and repent . If , then , you do not wake up , I shall come upon you as a thief , and you shall not know at all what hour I come upon you .
66003004	“ Nevertheless , you have a few names in Sardis who have not defiled their garments . And they shall walk with Me in white , because they are worthy .
66003005	“ He who overcomes shall be dressed in white robes , and I shall by no means blot out his name from the Book of Life , but I shall confess his name before My Father and before His messengers .
66003006	“ He who has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies . ” ’
66003007	“ And to the messenger of the assembly in Philadelphia write , ‘ He who is set-apart , He who is true , He who has the key of Dawiḏ , He who opens and no one shuts , and shuts and no one opens , says this :
66003008	“ I know your works – see , I have set before you an open door , and no one is able to shut it – that you have little power , yet have guarded My Word , and have not denied My Name .
66003009	“ See , I am giving up those of the congregation of Satan , who say they are Yehuḏim and are not , but lie . See , I am making them come and worship before your feet , and to know that I have loved you .
66003010	“ Because you have guarded My Word of endurance , I also shall guard you from the hour of trial which shall come upon all the world , to try those who dwell on the earth .
66003011	“ See , I am coming speedily ! Hold what you have that no one take your crown .
66003012	“ He who overcomes , I shall make him a supporting post in the Dwelling Place of My Elohim , and he shall by no means go out . And I shall write on him the Name of My Elohim and the name of the city of My Elohim , the renewed Yerushalayim , which comes down out of the heaven from My Elohim , and My renewed Name .
66003013	“ He who has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies . ” ’
66003014	“ And to the messenger of the assembly in Laodikeia write , ‘ The Amĕn , the Trustworthy and True Witness , the Beginning of the creation of Elohim , says this :
66003015	“ I know your works , that you are neither cold nor hot . I would that you were cold or hot .
66003016	“ So , because you are lukewarm , and neither cold nor hot , I am going to vomit you out of My mouth .
66003017	“ Because you say , ‘ Rich I am , and I am made rich , and need none at all , ’ and do not know that you are wretched , and pitiable , and poor , and blind , and naked .
66003018	“ I advise you to buy from Me gold refined in the fire , so that you become rich ; and white garments , so that you become dressed , so that the shame of your nakedness might not be shown ; and anoint your eyes with ointment , so that you see .
66003019	“ As many as I love , I reprove and discipline . So be ardent and repent .
66003020	“ See , I stand at the door and knock . If anyone hears My voice and opens the door , I shall come in to him and dine with him , and he with Me .
66003021	“ To him who overcomes I shall give to sit with Me on My throne , as I also overcame and sat down with My Father on His throne .
66003022	“ He who has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies . ” ’ ”
66004001	After this I looked and saw a door having been opened in the heaven . And the first voice which I heard was like a trumpet speaking with me , saying , “ Come up here and I shall show you what has to take place after this . ”
66004002	And immediately I came to be in the Spirit and saw a throne set in the heaven , and One sat on the throne .
66004003	And He who sat there was like a jasper and a ruby stone in appearance . And there was a rainbow around the throne , like an emerald in appearance .
66004004	And around the throne were twenty-four thrones , and on the thrones I saw twenty-four elders sitting , dressed in white robes . And they had crowns of gold on their heads .
66004005	And out of the throne came lightnings , and thunders , and voices . And seven lamps of fire were burning before the throne , which are the seven Spirits of Elohim .
66004006	And before the throne there was a sea of glass , like crystal . And in the midst of the throne , and around the throne , were four living creatures , covered with eyes in front and in back .
66004007	And the first living creature was like a lion , and the second living creature like a calf , and the third living creature had a face like a man , and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle .
66004008	And the four living creatures , each having six wings , were covered with eyes around and within . And they do not cease , day or night , saying , “ Set-apart , set-apart , set-apart , יהוה Ěl Shaddai , who was , and who is , and who is coming ! ”
66004009	And when the living creatures give esteem and respect and thanks to Him who sits on the throne , who lives forever and ever ,
66004010	the twenty-four elders fall down before Him who sits on the throne and bow before Him who lives forever and ever , and they cast their crowns before the throne , saying ,
66004011	“ You are worthy , O יהוה , to receive esteem and respect and power , for You have created all , and because of Your desire they are , and were created . ”
66005001	And I saw in the right hand of Him who sat on the throne a scroll written inside and on the back , having been sealed with seven seals .
66005002	And I saw a strong messenger proclaiming with a loud voice , “ Who is worthy to open the scroll and to loosen its seals ? ”
66005003	And no one in the heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll , or to look at it .
66005004	And I wept much , because no one was found worthy to open and read the scroll , or to look at it .
66005005	And one of the elders said to me , “ Do not weep . See , the Lion of the tribe of Yehuḏah , the Root of Dawiḏ , overcame to open the scroll and to loosen its seven seals . ”
66005006	And I looked and saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures , and in the midst of the elders a Lamb standing , as having been slain , having seven horns and seven eyes , which are the seven Spirits of Elohim sent out into all the earth .
66005007	And He came and took the scroll out of the right hand of Him sitting on the throne .
66005008	And when He took the scroll , the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb , each holding a harp , and golden bowls filled with incense , which are the prayers of the set-apart ones .
66005009	And they sang a renewed song , saying , “ You are worthy to take the scroll , and to open its seals , because You were slain , and have redeemed us to Elohim by Your blood out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation ,
66005010	and made us sovereigns and priests to our Elohim , and we shall reign upon the earth . ”
66005011	And I looked , and I heard the voice of many messengers around the throne , and the living creatures , and the elders . And the number of them was myriads of myriads , and thousands of thousands ,
66005012	saying with a loud voice , “ Worthy is the Lamb having been slain to receive power and riches and wisdom , and strength and respect and esteem and blessing ! ”
66005013	And every creature which is in the heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea , and all that are in them , I heard saying , “ To Him sitting on the throne , and to the Lamb , be the blessing and the respect and the esteem and the might , forever and ever ! ”
66005014	And the four living creatures said , “ Amĕn ! ” And the twenty-four elders fell down and bowed before Him who lives forever and ever .
66006001	And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals , and I heard one of the four living creatures saying , like a sound of thunder , “ Come and see . ”
66006002	And I looked and saw a white horse , and he who sat on it holding a bow . And a crown was given to him , and he went out overcoming and to overcome .
66006003	And when He opened the second seal , I heard the second living creature saying , “ Come and see . ”
66006004	And another horse , fiery red , went out . And it was given to the one who sat on it to take peace from the earth , and that they should slay one another . And a great sword was given to him .
66006005	And when He opened the third seal , I heard the third living creature say , “ Come and see . ” And I looked and saw a black horse , and he who sat on it holding a pair of scales in his hand .
66006006	And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying , “ A quart of wheat for a day’s wage , and three quarts of barley for a day’s wage . And do not harm the oil and the wine . ”
66006007	And when He opened the fourth seal , I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying , “ Come and see . ”
66006008	And I looked and saw a pale horse . And he who sat on it had the name Death , and the grave followed with him . And authority was given to them over a fourth of the earth , to kill with sword , and with hunger , and with death , and by the beasts of the earth .
66006009	And when He opened the fifth seal , I saw under the altar the beings of those having been slain for the Word of Elohim and for the witness which they held ,
66006010	and they cried with a loud voice , saying , “ How long , O Master , set-apart and true , until You judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth ? ”
66006011	And there was given to each one a white robe , and they were told that they should rest a little while longer , until both the number of their fellow servants and their brothers , who would be killed as they were , was completed .
66006012	And I looked when He opened the sixth seal and saw a great earthquake came to be . And the sun became black as sackcloth of hair , and the moon became as blood .
66006013	And the stars of the heaven fell to the earth , as a fig tree drops its unripe figs , being shaken by a strong wind .
66006014	And heaven departed like a scroll being rolled up , and every mountain and island was moved out of its place .
66006015	And the sovereigns of the earth , and the great ones , and the rich ones , and the commanders , and the mighty , and every slave and every free one , hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains ,
66006016	and said to the mountains and rocks , “ Fall on us and hide us from the face of Him sitting on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb ,
66006017	because the great day of His wrath has come , and who is able to stand ? ”
66007001	And after this I saw four messengers standing at the four corners of the earth , holding the four winds of the earth , that the wind should not blow on the earth , nor on the sea , nor on any tree .
66007002	And I saw another messenger coming up from the rising of the sun , holding the seal of the living Elohim . And he cried with a loud voice to the four messengers to whom it was given to harm the earth and the sea ,
66007003	saying , “ Do not harm the earth , nor the sea , nor the trees until we have sealed the servants of our Elohim upon their foreheads . ”
66007004	And I heard the number of those who were sealed , one hundred and forty-four thousand , sealed out of all the tribes of the children of Yisra’ĕl :
66007005	of the tribe of Yehuḏah twelve thousand were sealed , of the tribe of Re’uḇĕn twelve thousand were sealed , of the tribe of Gaḏ twelve thousand were sealed ,
66007006	of the tribe of Ashĕr twelve thousand were sealed , of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand were sealed , of the tribe of Menashsheh twelve thousand were sealed ,
66007007	of the tribe of Shim‛on twelve thousand were sealed , of the tribe of Lĕwi twelve thousand were sealed , of the tribe of Yissasḵar twelve thousand were sealed ,
66007008	of the tribe of Zeḇulun twelve thousand were sealed , of the tribe of Yosĕph twelve thousand were sealed , of the tribe of Binyamin twelve thousand were sealed .
66007009	After this I looked and saw a great crowd which no one was able to count , out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues , standing before the throne and before the Lamb , dressed in white robes , and palm branches in their hands ,
66007010	and crying out with a loud voice , saying , “ Deliverance belongs to our Elohim who sits on the throne , and to the Lamb ! ”
66007011	And all the messengers stood around the throne and the elders and the four living creatures , and fell on their faces before the throne and worshipped Elohim ,
66007012	saying , “ Amĕn ! The blessing , and the esteem , and the wisdom , and the thanksgiving , and the respect , and the power , and the might , to our Elohim forever and ever . Amĕn . ”
66007013	And one of the elders responded , saying to me , “ Who are these dressed in white robes , and where did they come from ? ”
66007014	And I said to him , “ Master , you know . ” And he said to me , “ These are those coming out of the great distress , having washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb .
66007015	“ Because of this they are before the throne of Elohim , and serve Him day and night in His Dwelling Place . And He who sits on the throne shall spread His Tent over them .
66007016	“ They shall hunger no more , neither thirst any more , neither shall the sun strike them , nor any heat ,
66007017	because the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne shall shepherd them and lead them to fountains of waters of life . And Elohim shall wipe away every tear from their eyes . ”
66008001	And when He opened the seventh seal , there came to be silence in the heaven for about half an hour .
66008002	And I saw the seven messengers who stand before Elohim , and to them were given seven trumpets .
66008003	And another messenger came and stood at the altar , holding a golden censer , and much incense was given to him , that he should offer it with the prayers of all the set-apart ones upon the golden altar which was before the throne .
66008004	And the smoke of the incense , with the prayers of the set-apart ones , went up before Elohim from the hand of the messenger .
66008005	And the messenger took the censer , and filled it with fire from the altar , and threw it to the earth . And there were noises , and thunders , and lightnings , and an earthquake .
66008006	And the seven messengers who held the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound .
66008007	And the first messenger sounded , and there came to be hail and fire mixed with blood , and they were thrown to the earth . And a third of the trees were burned up , and all green grass was burned up .
66008008	And the second messenger sounded , and what looked like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea , and a third of the sea became blood ,
66008009	and a third of the living creatures in the sea died , and a third of the ships were destroyed .
66008010	And the third messenger sounded , and a great star fell from the heaven , burning like a torch , and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the fountains of water ,
66008011	and the name of the star is called Wormwood . And a third of the waters became wormwood , and many men died from the waters , because they were made bitter .
66008012	And the fourth messenger sounded , and a third of the sun was struck , and a third of the moon , and a third of the stars , so that a third of them were darkened . And a third of the day did not shine , and likewise the night .
66008013	And I looked , and I heard an eagle flying in mid-heaven , crying with a loud voice , “ Woe , woe , woe to those dwelling upon the earth , because of the remaining blasts of the trumpet of the three messengers who are about to sound ! ”
66009001	And the fifth messenger sounded , and I saw a star from the heaven which had fallen to the earth . And the key to the pit of the deep was given to it .
66009002	And he opened the pit of the deep , and smoke went up out of the pit like the smoke of a great furnace . And the sun was darkened , also the air , because of the smoke of the pit .
66009003	And out of the smoke locusts came upon the earth , and authority was given to them as the scorpions of the earth possess authority .
66009004	And it was said to them that they shall not harm the grass of the earth , or any green matter , or any tree , but only those men who do not have the seal of Elohim upon their foreheads .
66009005	And it was given to them that they should not kill them , but to torture them for five months . And their torture was like the torture of a scorpion when it stings a man .
66009006	And in those days men shall seek death and shall not find it . And they shall long to die , but death shall flee from them .
66009007	And the locusts looked like horses prepared for battle , and on their heads were crowns like gold , and their faces were like the faces of men .
66009008	And they had hair like women’s hair , and their teeth were like lions’ teeth .
66009009	And they had breastplates like breastplates of iron , and the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots of many horses running into battle .
66009010	And they have tails like scorpions , and stings . And in their tails is their authority to harm men five months .
66009011	And they have over them a sovereign , the messenger of the pit of the deep , whose name in Heḇrew is Abaddon , but in Greek he has the name Apolluon .
66009012	The first woe is past . See , two woes are still coming after this .
66009013	And the sixth messenger sounded , and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before Elohim ,
66009014	saying to the sixth messenger who had the trumpet , “ Release the four messengers , those having been bound at the great river Euphrates . ”
66009015	And the four messengers , those having been prepared for the hour and day and month and year , were released to kill a third of mankind .
66009016	And the number of the armies of the horsemen was two hundred million , and I heard the number of them .
66009017	And this is how I saw the horses in the vision and those who sat on them , having breastplates of fiery red , and hyacinth blue , and sulphur yellow . And the heads of the horses were like the heads of lions , and out of their mouths came fire , and smoke , and sulphur .
66009018	A third of mankind was killed by these three plagues , by the fire and the smoke and the sulphur which came out of their mouths .
66009019	For the authority of the horses is in their mouth and in their tails , for their tails are like serpents , having heads . And with them they do harm .
66009020	And the rest of mankind , who were not killed by these plagues , did not repent of the works of their hands , that they should not worship the demons , and idols of gold , and of silver , and of brass , and of stone , and of wood , which are neither able to see , nor to hear , nor to walk .
66009021	And they did not repent of their murders , nor of their drug sorceries , nor of their whoring , nor of their thefts .
66010001	And I saw another strong messenger coming down from the heaven , robed in a cloud , and a rainbow on his head , and his face was like the sun , and his feet like columns of fire ,
66010002	and having in his hand a little book opened . And he placed his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land ,
66010003	and cried with a loud voice , as when a lion roars . And when he cried out , seven thunders spoke their sounds .
66010004	And when the seven thunders spoke their sounds , I was about to write , but I heard a voice from the heaven saying to me , “ Seal up what the seven thunders spoke , and do not write them . ”
66010005	And the messenger whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted up his right hand to the heaven ,
66010006	and swore by Him who lives forever and ever , who created the heaven and what is in it , the earth and what is in it , and the sea and what is in it , that there shall be no further delay ,
66010007	but in the days of the sounding of the seventh messenger , when he is about to sound , the secret of Elohim shall also be ended , as He declared to His servants the prophets .
66010008	And the voice which I heard out of the heaven spoke to me again and said , “ Go , take the little book which is opened in the hand of the messenger standing on the sea and on the earth . ”
66010009	And I went to the messenger and said to him , “ Give me the little book . ” And he said to me , “ Take and eat it , and it shall make your stomach bitter , but it shall be as sweet as honey in your mouth . ”
66010010	And I took the little book out of the messenger’s hand and ate it , and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth , but when I had eaten it , my stomach was made bitter .
66010011	And he said to me , “ You have to prophesy again concerning many peoples and nations and tongues and sovereigns . ”
66011001	And a reed like a measuring rod was given to me , and the messenger stood , saying , “ Rise and measure the Dwelling Place of Elohim , and the altar , and those worshipping in it .
66011002	“ But cast out the court which is outside the Dwelling Place , and do not measure it , for it has been given to the gentiles , and they shall trample the set-apart city under foot for forty-two months .
66011003	“ And I shall give unto my two witnesses , and they shall prophesy one thousand two hundred and sixty days , clad in sackcloth . ”
66011004	These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that are standing before the Elohim of the earth .
66011005	And if anyone wishes to harm them , fire comes out from their mouth and consumes their enemies . And if anyone wishes to harm them , he has to be killed in that way .
66011006	These possess authority to shut the heaven , so that no rain falls in the days of their prophecy . And they possess authority over waters to turn them to blood , and to smite the earth with all plagues , as often as they wish .
66011007	And when they have ended their witness , the beast coming up out of the pit of the deep shall fight against them , and overcome them , and kill them ,
66011008	and their dead bodies lie in the street of the great city which spiritually is called Seḏom and Mitsrayim , where also our Master was impaled ,
66011009	and some of the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations see their dead bodies for three and a half days , and not allow their dead bodies to be placed into tombs ,
66011010	and those dwelling on the earth rejoice over them and exult . And they shall send gifts to each other , because these two prophets tortured those dwelling on the earth .
66011011	And after the three and a half days a spirit of life from Elohim entered into them , and they stood upon their feet , and great fear fell on those who saw them .
66011012	And they heard a loud voice from the heaven saying to them , “ Come up here . ” And they went up into the heaven in a cloud , and their enemies saw them .
66011013	And in that hour there came to be a great earthquake , and a tenth of the city fell . And in the earthquake seven thousand men were killed , and the rest became afraid and gave esteem to the Elohim of the heaven .
66011014	The second woe is past , and see , the third woe is coming speedily .
66011015	And the seventh messenger sounded , and there came to be loud voices in the heaven , saying , “ The reign of this world has become the reign of our Master , and of His Messiah , and He shall reign forever and ever ! ”
66011016	And the twenty-four elders sitting before Elohim on their thrones fell on their faces and worshipped Elohim ,
66011017	saying , “ We give You thanks , O יהוה Ěl Shaddai , the One who is and who was and who is coming , because You have taken Your great power and reigned .
66011018	“ And the nations were enraged , and Your wrath has come , and the time of the dead to be judged , and to give the reward to Your servants the prophets and to the set-apart ones , and to those who fear Your Name , small and great , and to destroy those who destroy the earth . ”
66011019	And the Dwelling Place of Elohim was opened in the heaven , and the ark of His covenant was seen in His Dwelling Place . And there came to be lightnings , and voices , and thunders , and an earthquake , and great hail .
66012001	And a great sign was seen in the heaven : a woman clad with the sun , with the moon under her feet , and on her head a crown of twelve stars .
66012002	And being pregnant , she cried out in labour and in pain to give birth .
66012003	And another sign was seen in the heaven : and see , a great , fiery red dragon having seven heads and ten horns , and seven crowns on his heads .
66012004	And his tail draws a third of the stars of the heaven and throws them to the earth . And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth , to devour her child as soon as it was born .
66012005	And she bore a male child who was to shepherd all nations with a rod of iron . And her child was caught away to Elohim and to His throne .
66012006	And the woman fled into the wilderness , where she has a place prepared by Elohim , to be nourished there one thousand two hundred and sixty days .
66012007	And there came to be fighting in the heaven : Miḵa’ĕl and his messengers fought against the dragon . And the dragon and his messengers fought ,
66012008	but they were not strong enough , nor was a place found for them in the heaven any longer .
66012009	And the great dragon was thrown out , that serpent of old , called the Devil and Satan , who leads all the world astray . He was thrown to the earth , and his messengers were thrown out with him .
66012010	And I heard a loud voice saying in the heaven , “ Now have come the deliverance and the power and the reign of our Elohim , and the authority of His Messiah , for the accuser of our brothers , who accused them before our Elohim day and night , has been thrown down .
66012011	“ And they overcame him because of the Blood of the Lamb , and because of the Word of their witness , and they did not love their lives to the death .
66012012	“ Because of this rejoice , O heavens , and you who dwell in them ! Woe to the earth and the sea , because the devil has come down to you , having great wrath , knowing that he has little time . ”
66012013	And when the dragon saw that he had been thrown to the earth , he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male child .
66012014	And the woman was given two wings of a great eagle , to fly into the wilderness to her place , where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time , from the presence of the serpent .
66012015	And out of his mouth the serpent spewed water like a river after the woman , to cause her to be swept away by the river .
66012016	And the earth helped the woman , and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the river which the dragon had spewed out of his mouth .
66012017	And the dragon was enraged with the woman , and he went to fight with the remnant of her seed , those guarding the commands of Elohim and possessing the witness of יהושע Messiah .
66013001	And I stood on the sand of the sea . And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea , having seven heads and ten horns , and on his horns ten crowns , and on his heads names of blasphemy .
66013002	And the beast I saw was like a leopard , and his feet were like the feet of a bear , and his mouth like the mouth of a lion . And the dragon gave him his power , and his throne , and great authority .
66013003	And I saw one of his heads , as having been slain to death , and his deadly wound was healed . And all the earth marvelled after the beast .
66013004	And they worshipped the dragon who gave authority to the beast . And they worshipped the beast , saying , “ Who is like the beast ? Who is able to fight with him ? ”
66013005	And he was given a mouth speaking great matters and blasphemies , and he was given authority to do so forty-two months .
66013006	And he opened his mouth in blasphemies against Elohim , to blaspheme His Name , and His Tent , and those dwelling in the heaven .
66013007	And it was given to him to fight with the set-apart ones and to overcome them . And authority was given to him over every tribe and tongue and nation .
66013008	And all those dwelling on the earth , whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the slain Lamb , from the foundation of the world shall worship him .
66013009	If anyone has an ear , let him hear .
66013010	He who brings into captivity shall go into captivity , he who kills with the sword has to be killed with the sword . Here is the endurance and the belief of the set-apart ones .
66013011	And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth , and he had two horns like a lamb and spoke like a dragon .
66013012	And he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence , and causes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast , whose deadly wound was healed .
66013013	And he does great signs , so that he even makes fire come down from the heaven on the earth before men .
66013014	And he leads astray those dwelling on the earth because of those signs which he was given to do before the beast , saying to those dwelling on the earth to make an image to the beast who was wounded by the sword , yet lived .
66013015	And there was given to him to give spirit to the image of the beast , that the image of the beast should both speak and cause to be killed as many as would not worship the image of the beast .
66013016	And he causes all , both small and great , and rich and poor , and free and slave , to be given a mark upon their right hand or upon their foreheads ,
66013017	and that no one should be able to buy or sell except he that has the mark or the name of the beast , or the number of his name .
66013018	Here is the wisdom ! He who has understanding , let him calculate the number of the beast , for it is the number of a man , and his number is 666 .
66014001	And I looked and saw a Lamb standing on Mount Tsiyon , and with Him one hundred and forty-four thousand , having His Father’s Name written upon their foreheads .
66014002	And I heard a voice out of the heaven , like the voice of many waters , and like the voice of loud thunder , and I heard the sound of harpists playing their harps .
66014003	And they sang a renewed song before the throne , and before the four living creatures , and the elders . And no one was able to learn that song except the hundred and forty-four thousand who were redeemed from the earth .
66014004	They are those who were not defiled with women , for they are maidens . They are those following the Lamb wherever He leads them on . They were redeemed from among men , being first-fruits to Elohim and to the Lamb .
66014005	And in their mouth was found no falsehood , for they are blameless before the throne of Elohim .
66014006	And I saw another messenger flying in mid-heaven , holding the everlasting Good News to announce to those dwelling on the earth , even to every nation and tribe and tongue and people ,
66014007	saying with a loud voice , “ Fear Elohim and give esteem to Him , because the hour of His judgment has come . And worship Him who made the heaven and the earth , and sea , and fountains of water . ”
66014008	And another messenger followed , saying , “ Baḇel is fallen , is fallen , that great city , because she has made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her whoring . ”
66014009	And a third messenger followed them , saying with a loud voice , “ If anyone worships the beast and his image , and receives his mark upon his forehead or upon his hand ,
66014010	he also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of Elohim , which is poured out undiluted into the cup of His wrath . And he shall be tortured with fire and sulphur before the set-apart messengers and before the Lamb .
66014011	“ And the smoke of their torture goes up forever and ever . And they have no rest day or night , those worshipping the beast and his image , also if anyone receives the mark of his name . ”
66014012	Here is the endurance of the set-apart ones , here are those guarding the commands of Elohim and the belief of יהושע .
66014013	And I heard a voice out of the heaven saying to me , “ Write , ‘ Blessed are the dead who die in the Master from now on . ’ ” “ Yes , ” says the Spirit , “ in order that they rest from their labours , and their works follow with them . ”
66014014	And I looked and saw a white cloud , and sitting on the cloud was One like the Son of Aḏam , having on His head a golden crown , and in His hand a sharp sickle .
66014015	And another messenger came out of the Dwelling Place , crying with a loud voice to the One sitting on the cloud , “ Send Your sickle and reap , because the hour has come for You to reap , because the harvest of the earth is ripe . ”
66014016	And the One sitting on the cloud thrust in His sickle on the earth , and the earth was reaped .
66014017	And another messenger came out of the Dwelling Place which is in the heaven , and he too held a sharp sickle .
66014018	And another messenger came out from the altar , having authority over the fire , and he cried with a loud cry to him having the sharp sickle , saying , “ Send your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth , because her grapes are ripe . ”
66014019	And the messenger thrust his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth , and threw it into the great winepress of the wrath of Elohim .
66014020	And the winepress was trodden outside the city , and blood came out of the winepress , up to the bridles of the horses , for about three hundred kilometres .
66015001	And I saw another sign in the heaven , great and marvellous : seven messengers having the seven last plagues , for the wrath of Elohim was ended in them .
66015002	And I saw like a sea of glass mixed with fire , and those overcoming the beast and his image and his mark and the number of his name , standing on the sea of glass , holding harps of Elohim .
66015003	And they sing the song of Mosheh the servant of Elohim , and the song of the Lamb , saying , “ Great and marvellous are Your works , יהוה Ěl Shaddai ! Righteous and true are Your ways , O Sovereign of the set-apart ones !
66015004	“ Who shall not fear You , O יהוה , and esteem Your Name ? Because You alone are kind . Because all nations shall come and worship before You , for Your righteousnesses have been made manifest . ”
66015005	And after this I looked and saw the Dwelling Place of the Tent of Witness in the heaven was opened .
66015006	And out of the Dwelling Place came the seven messengers having the seven plagues , dressed in clean bright linen , and having their chests girded with golden bands .
66015007	And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven messengers seven golden bowls filled with the wrath of Elohim who lives forever and ever .
66015008	And the Dwelling Place was filled with smoke from the esteem of Elohim and from His power , and no one was able to enter the Dwelling Place until the seven plagues of the seven messengers were ended .
66016001	And I heard a loud voice from the Dwelling Place saying to the seven messengers , “ Go and pour out the bowls of the wrath of Elohim on the earth . ”
66016002	And the first went and poured out his bowl upon the earth , and an evil and wicked sore came upon the men , those having the mark of the beast and those worshipping his image .
66016003	And the second messenger poured out his bowl on the sea , and it became blood , as of a dead one , and every living creature in the sea died .
66016004	And the third messenger poured out his bowl on the rivers and fountains of water , and they became blood .
66016005	And I heard the messenger of the waters saying , “ You are righteous , O יהוה , the One who is and who was and who shall be , because You have judged these .
66016006	“ Because they have shed the blood of set-apart ones and prophets , and You have given them blood to drink . For they deserve it . ”
66016007	And I heard another out of the altar saying , “ Yes , יהוה Ěl Shaddai , true and righteous are Your judgments . ”
66016008	And the fourth messenger poured out his bowl on the sun , and it was given to him to burn men with fire .
66016009	And men were burned with great heat , and they blasphemed the Name of Elohim who possesses authority over these plagues . And they did not repent , to give Him esteem .
66016010	And the fifth messenger poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast , and his reign became darkened . And they gnawed their tongues from pain .
66016011	And they blasphemed the Elohim of the heaven for their pains and their sores , and did not repent of their works .
66016012	And the sixth messenger poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates , and its water was dried up , in order to prepare the way of the sovereigns from the east .
66016013	And I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon , and out of the mouth of the beast , and out of the mouth of the false prophet , three unclean spirits , as frogs ,
66016014	for they are spirits of demons , doing signs , which go out to the sovereigns of the entire world , to gather them to the battle of that great day of יהוה the Almighty .
66016015	“ See , I am coming as a thief . Blessed is he who is staying awake and guarding his garments , lest he walk naked and they see his shame . ”
66016016	And they gathered them together to the place called in Heḇrew , Har Meg̅iddo .
66016017	And the seventh messenger poured out his bowl into the air , and a loud voice came out of the Dwelling Place of the heaven , from the throne , saying , “ It is done ! ”
66016018	And there came to be noises and thunders and lightnings . And there came to be a great earthquake , such a mighty and great earthquake as had not came to be since men were on the earth .
66016019	And the great city became divided into three parts , and the cities of the nations fell . And great Baḇel was remembered before Elohim , to give her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of His wrath .
66016020	And every island fled away , and the mountains were not found .
66016021	And great hail from the heaven fell upon men , every hailstone about the weight of a talent . And men blasphemed Elohim for the plague of the hail , because that plague was exceedingly great .
66017001	And one of the seven messengers who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me , saying to me , “ Come , I shall show you the judgment of the great whore sitting on many waters ,
66017002	with whom the sovereigns of the earth committed whoring , and the inhabitants of the earth were made drunk with the wine of her whoring . ”
66017003	And he carried me away in the Spirit into the wilderness . And I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast covered with names of blasphemy , having seven heads and ten horns .
66017004	And the woman was dressed in purple and scarlet , and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls , holding in her hand a golden cup filled with abominations and the filthiness of her whoring ,
66017005	and upon her forehead a name written , a secret : BAḆEL THE GREAT , THE MOTHER OF THE WHORES AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH .
66017006	And I saw the woman , drunk with the blood of the set-apart ones , and with the blood of the witnesses of יהושע . And having seen her , I marvelled – greatly marvelled !
66017007	And the messenger said to me , “ Why did you marvel ? Let me explain to you the secret of the woman and of the beast she rides , which has the seven heads and the ten horns .
66017008	“ The beast that you saw was , and is not , and is about to come up out of the pit of the deep and goes to destruction . And those dwelling on the earth , whose names are not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world , shall marvel when they see the beast that was , and is not , and yet is .
66017009	“ Here is the mind having wisdom : The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits .
66017010	“ And there are seven sovereigns : five have fallen , and one is , and the other has not yet come . And when he comes , he has to remain a little while .
66017011	“ And the beast that was , and is not , is himself also the eighth , and is of the seven , and goes to destruction .
66017012	“ And the ten horns which you saw are ten sovereigns who have not yet received a reign , but receive authority as sovereigns with the beast for one hour .
66017013	“ They have one mind , and they shall give their power and authority to the beast .
66017014	“ They shall fight with the Lamb , and the Lamb shall overcome them , for He is Master of masters and Sovereign of sovereigns . And those with Him are called , and chosen , and trustworthy . ”
66017015	And he said to me , “ The waters which you saw , where the whore sits , are peoples , and crowds , and nations , and tongues .
66017016	“ And the ten horns which you saw on the beast , these shall hate the whore , and lay her waste and naked , and eat her flesh and burn her with fire .
66017017	“ For Elohim did give it into their hearts to do His mind , to be of one mind , and to give their reign to the beast , until the words of Elohim shall be accomplished .
66017018	“ And the woman whom you saw is that great city having sovereignty over the sovereigns of the earth . ”
66018001	And after this I saw another messenger coming down from the heaven , having great authority , and the earth was lightened from his esteem .
66018002	And he cried with a mighty voice , saying , “ Baḇel the great is fallen , is fallen , and has become a dwelling place of demons , a haunt for every unclean spirit , and a haunt for every unclean and hated bird ,
66018003	because all the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her whoring , and the sovereigns of the earth have committed whoring with her , and the merchants of the earth have become rich through the power of her riotous living . ”
66018004	And I heard another voice from the heaven saying , “ Come out of her , my people , lest you share in her sins , and lest you receive of her plagues .
66018005	“ Because her sins have piled up to reach the heaven , and Elohim has remembered her unrighteousnesses .
66018006	“ Render to her as she indeed did render , and repay her double according to her works . In the cup which she has mixed , mix for her double .
66018007	“ As much as she esteemed herself and lived riotously , so much torture and grief give to her , because in her heart she says , ‘ I sit as sovereigness , and I am not a widow , and I do not see mourning at all . ’
66018008	“ Because of this her plagues shall come in one day : death and mourning and scarcity of food . And she shall be burned up with fire , because יהוה Elohim who judges her is mighty .
66018009	“ And the sovereigns of the earth who committed whoring and lived riotously with her shall weep and mourn over her , when they see the smoke of her burning ,
66018010	standing at a distance for fear of her torture , saying , ‘ Woe ! Woe , the great city Baḇel , the mighty city , because your judgment has come in one hour ! ’
66018011	“ And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her , because no one buys their merchandise any more –
66018012	merchandise of gold and silver , and precious stone and pearls , and fine linen and purple , and silk and scarlet , and all citron wood , and every object of ivory , and every object of most precious wood and bronze and iron and marble ,
66018013	and cinnamon and incense , and fragrant oil and frankincense , and wine and oil , and fine flour and wheat , and cattle and sheep , and horses and carriages , and bodies and lives of men .
66018014	“ And the fruit that your being longed for has gone from you . And all your riches and splendour are lost to you , and you shall find them no more , not at all .
66018015	“ The merchants of these , those who became rich by her , shall stand at a distance for fear of her torture , weeping and mourning ,
66018016	and saying , ‘ Woe ! Woe , the great city that was dressed in fine linen and purple and scarlet , and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls !
66018017	‘ For in one hour such great riches was laid waste . ’ And every shipmaster , and every passenger , and sailors , and as many as work the sea for their living , stood at a distance ,
66018018	and cried out when they saw the smoke of her burning , saying , ‘ What is like this great city ? ’
66018019	“ And they threw dust on their heads and cried out , weeping and mourning , and saying , ‘ Woe ! Woe , the great city , in which all who had ships on the sea became rich by her wealth ! For in one hour she was laid waste . ’
66018020	“ Rejoice over her , O heaven , and you set-apart emissaries and prophets , for Elohim has completely avenged you on her ! ”
66018021	And one mighty messenger picked up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea , saying , “ With such a rush the great city Baḇel shall be thrown down , and shall not be found any more at all .
66018022	“ And the sound of harpists , and musicians , and flutists , and trumpeters shall not be heard in you any more at all . And no craftsman of any trade shall be found in you any more at all . And the sound of a millstone shall not be heard in you any more at all .
66018023	“ And the light of a lamp shall not shine in you any more at all . And the voice of bridegroom and bride shall not be heard in you any more at all . For your merchants were the great ones of the earth , for by your drug sorcery all the nations were led astray .
66018024	“ And in her was found the blood of prophets and set-apart ones , and of all who were slain on the earth . ”
66019001	And after this I heard a loud voice of a great crowd in the heaven , saying , “ Halleluyah ! Deliverance and esteem and respect and power to יהוה our Elohim !
66019002	“ Because true and righteous are His judgments , because He has judged the great whore who corrupted the earth with her whoring . And He has avenged on her the blood of His servants shed by her . ”
66019003	And a second time they said , “ Halleluyah ! And her smoke rises up forever and ever ! ”
66019004	And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped Elohim who sat on the throne , saying , “ Amĕn ! Halleluyah ! ”
66019005	And a voice came from the throne , saying , “ Praise our Elohim , all you His servants and those who fear Him , both small and great ! ”
66019006	And I heard as the voice of a great crowd , as the sound of many waters and as the sound of mighty thunders , saying , “ Halleluyah , for יהוה Ěl Shaddai reigns !
66019007	“ Let us be glad and rejoice and give Him praise , for the marriage of the Lamb has come , and His wife prepared herself . ”
66019008	And to her it was given to be dressed in fine linen , clean and bright , for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the set-apart ones .
66019009	And he said to me , “ Write , ‘ Blessed are those who have been called to the marriage supper of the Lamb ! ’ ” And he said to me , “ These are the true words of Elohim . ”
66019010	And I fell at his feet to worship him , but he said to me , “ See , do not do it ! I am your fellow servant , and of your brothers who possess the witness of יהושע . Worship Elohim ! For the witness of יהושע is the spirit of prophecy . ”
66019011	And I saw the heaven opened , and there was a white horse . And He who sat on him was called Trustworthy and True , and in righteousness He judges and fights .
66019012	And His eyes were as a flame of fire , and on His head were many crowns , having a Name that had been written , which no one had perceived except Himself –
66019013	and having been dressed in a robe dipped in blood – and His Name is called : The Word of יהוה .
66019014	And the armies in the heaven , dressed in fine linen , white and clean , followed Him on white horses .
66019015	And out of His mouth goes a sharp sword , that with it He should smite the nations . And He shall shepherd them with a rod of iron . And He treads the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Ěl Shaddai .
66019016	And on His robe and on His thigh He has a name written : SOVEREIGN OF SOVEREIGNS AND MASTER OF MASTERS .
66019017	And I saw one messenger standing in the sun , and he cried with a loud voice , saying to all the birds that fly in mid-heaven , “ Come and gather together for the supper of the great Elohim ,
66019018	to eat the flesh of sovereigns , and the flesh of commanders , and the flesh of strong ones , and the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them , and the flesh of all people , free and slave , both small and great . ”
66019019	And I saw the beast , and the sovereigns of the earth , and their armies , gathered together to fight Him who sat on the horse and His army .
66019020	And the beast was seized , and with him the false prophet who worked signs in his presence , by which he led astray those who received the mark of the beast and those who worshipped his image . The two were thrown alive into the lake of fire burning with sulphur .
66019021	And the rest were killed with the sword which came from the mouth of Him who sat on the horse , and all the birds were filled with their flesh .
66020001	And I saw a messenger coming down from the heaven , having the key to the pit of the deep and a great chain in his hand .
66020002	And he seized the dragon , the serpent of old , who is the Devil and Satan , and bound him for a thousand years ,
66020003	and he threw him into the pit of the deep , and shut him up , and set a seal on him , so that he should lead the nations no more astray until the thousand years were ended . And after that he has to be released for a little while .
66020004	And I saw thrones – and they sat on them , and judgment was given to them – and the lives of those who had been beheaded because of the witness they bore to יהושע and because of the Word of Elohim , and who did not worship the beast , nor his image , and did not receive his mark upon their foreheads or upon their hands . And they lived and reigned with Messiah for a thousand years
66020005	( and the rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended ) – this is the first resurrection .
66020006	Blessed and set-apart is the one having part in the first resurrection . The second death possesses no authority over these , but they shall be priests of Elohim and of Messiah , and shall reign with Him a thousand years .
66020007	And when the thousand years have ended , Satan shall be released from his prison ,
66020008	and he shall go out to lead the nations astray which are in the four corners of the earth , Gog̅ and Mag̅og̅ , to gather them together for battle , whose number is as the sand of the sea .
66020009	And they came up over the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of the set-apart ones and the beloved city . And fire came down from Elohim out of the heaven and consumed them .
66020010	And the devil , who led them astray , was thrown into the lake of fire and sulphur where the beast and the false prophet are . And they shall be tortured day and night forever and ever .
66020011	And I saw a great white throne and Him who was sitting on it , from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away , and no place was found for them .
66020012	And I saw the dead , small and great , standing before the throne , and books were opened . And another book was opened , which is the Book of Life . And the dead were judged from what was written in the books , according to their works .
66020013	And the sea gave up the dead who were in it , and death and the grave gave up the dead who were in them . And they were judged , each one according to his works .
66020014	And the death and the grave were thrown into the lake of fire . This is the second death .
66020015	And if anyone was not found written in the Book of Life , he was thrown into the lake of fire .
66021001	And I saw a renewed heaven and a renewed earth , for the former heaven and the former earth had passed away , and the sea is no more .
66021002	And I , Yoḥanan , saw the set-apart city , renewed Yerushalayim , coming down out of the heaven from Elohim , prepared as a bride adorned for her husband .
66021003	And I heard a loud voice from the heaven saying , “ See , the Booth of Elohim is with men , and He shall dwell with them , and they shall be His people , and Elohim Himself shall be with them and be their Elohim .
66021004	“ And Elohim shall wipe away every tear from their eyes , and there shall be no more death , nor mourning , nor crying . And there shall be no more pain , for the former matters have passed away . ”
66021005	And He who was sitting on the throne said , “ See , I make all matters new . ” And He said to me , “ Write , for these words are true and trustworthy . ”
66021006	And He said to me , “ It is done ! I am the ‘ Aleph’ and the ‘ Taw’ , the Beginning and the End . To the one who thirsts I shall give of the fountain of the water of life without payment .
66021007	“ The one who overcomes shall inherit all this , and I shall be his Elohim and he shall be My son .
66021008	“ But as for the cowardly , and untrustworthy , and abominable , and murderers , and those who whore , and drug sorcerers , and idolaters , and all the false , their part is in the lake which burns with fire and sulphur , which is the second death . ”
66021009	And one of the seven messengers who held the seven bowls filled with the seven last plagues came to me and spoke with me , saying , “ Come , I shall show you the bride , the Lamb’s wife . ”
66021010	And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain , and showed me the great city , the set-apart Yerushalayim , descending out of the heaven from Elohim ,
66021011	having the esteem of Elohim , and her light was like a most precious stone , like a jasper stone , clear as crystal ,
66021012	and having a great and high wall , having twelve gates , and at the gates twelve messengers , and names written on them , which are those of the twelve tribes of the children of Yisra’ĕl :
66021013	three gates on the east , three gates on the north , three gates on the south , and three gates on the west .
66021014	And the wall of the city had twelve foundations , and on them were the names of the twelve emissaries of the Lamb .
66021015	And he who spoke with me had a golden measuring rod , to measure the city , and its gates , and its wall .
66021016	And the city lies four-cornered , and its length is as great as its breadth . And he measured the city with the rod : two thousand two hundred kilometres – the length , and the breadth , and height of it are equal .
66021017	And he measured its wall : sixty-five metres , according to the measure of a man , that is , of a messenger .
66021018	And the structure of its wall was jasper . And the city was clean gold , like clear glass .
66021019	And the foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with all kinds of precious stones : the first foundation jasper , the second sapphire , the third agate , the fourth emerald ,
66021020	the fifth sardonyx , the sixth ruby , the seventh chrysolite , the eighth beryl , the ninth topaz , the tenth chrysoprase , the eleventh jacinth , and the twelfth amethyst .
66021021	And the twelve gates were twelve pearls – each one of the gates was a single pearl . And the street of the city was clean gold , like transparent glass .
66021022	And I saw no Dwelling Place in it , for יהוה Ěl Shaddai is its Dwelling Place , and the Lamb .
66021023	And the city had no need of the sun , nor of the moon , to shine in it , for the esteem of Elohim lightened it , and the Lamb is its lamp .
66021024	And the gentiles , of those who are saved , shall walk in its light , and the sovereigns of the earth bring their esteem into it .
66021025	And its gates shall not be shut at all by day , for night shall not be there .
66021026	And they shall bring the esteem and the appreciation of the gentiles into it .
66021027	And there shall by no means enter into it whatever is unclean , neither anyone doing abomination and falsehood , but only those who are written in the Lamb’s Book of Life .
66022001	And he showed me a river of water of life , clear as crystal , coming from the throne of Elohim and of the Lamb .
66022002	In the middle of its street , and on either side of the river , was the tree of life , which bore twelve fruits , each tree yielding its fruit every month . And the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations .
66022003	And no longer shall there be any curse , and the throne of Elohim and of the Lamb shall be in it , and His servants shall serve Him .
66022004	And they shall see His face , and His Name shall be upon their foreheads .
66022005	And night shall be no more , and they shall have no need of a lamp or the light of the sun , because יהוה Elohim shall give them light . And they shall reign forever and ever .
66022006	And he said to me , “ These words are trustworthy and true . And יהוה Elohim of the set-apart prophets has sent His messenger to show His servants what has to take place with speed .
66022007	“ See , I am coming speedily ! Blessed is he who guards the words of the prophecy of this book . ”
66022008	And I , Yoḥanan , saw and heard these matters . And when I heard and saw , I fell down to worship before the feet of the messenger who showed me these matters .
66022009	And he said to me , “ See , do not ! For I am your fellow servant , and of your brothers the prophets , and of those who are guarding the words of this book . Worship Elohim . ”
66022010	And he said to me , “ Do not seal the words of the prophecy of this book , because the time is near .
66022011	“ He who does wrong , let him do more wrong ; he who is filthy , let him be more filthy ; he who is righteous , let him be more righteous ; he who is set-apart , let him be more set-apart .
66022012	“ And see , I am coming speedily , and My reward is with Me , to give to each according to his work .
66022013	“ I am the ‘ Aleph’ and the ‘ Taw’ , the Beginning and the End , the First and the Last .
66022014	“ Blessed are those doing His commands , so that the authority shall be theirs unto the tree of life , and to enter through the gates into the city .
66022015	“ But outside are the dogs and those who enchant with drugs , and those who whore , and the murderers , and the idolaters , and all who love and do falsehood .
66022016	“ I , יהושע , have sent My messenger to witness to you these matters in the assemblies . I am the Root and the Offspring of Dawiḏ , the Bright and Morning Star . ”
66022017	And the Spirit and the bride say , “ Come ! ” And he who hears , let him say , “ Come ! ” And he who thirsts , come ! And he who desires it , take the water of life without paying !
66022018	For I witness to everyone hearing the words of the prophecy of this book : If anyone adds to them , Elohim shall add to him the plagues that are written in this book ,
66022019	and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy , Elohim shall take away his part from the Book of Life , and out of the set-apart city , which are written in this Book .
66022020	He that bears witness of these matters says , “ Yes , I am coming speedily . ” Amĕn . Yes , come , Master יהושע !
66022021	The favour of our Master יהושע Messiah be with the set-apart ones . Amĕn .
