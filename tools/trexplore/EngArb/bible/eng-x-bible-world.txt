40001017	So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations ; from David to the exile to Babylon fourteen generations ; and from the carrying away to Babylon to the Christ , fourteen generations .
40001018	Now the birth of Jesus Christ was like this ; because when his mother , Mary , had been engaged to Joseph , before they came together , she was found pregnant by the Holy Spirit .
40001019	Joseph , her husband , being a righteous man , and not willing to make her a public example , intended to put her away secretly .
40001020	But when he thought about these things , behold , an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream , saying , " Joseph , you son of David , don't be afraid to take to yourself Mary , your wife , for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit .
40001021	She shall bring forth a son . You shall call his name JESUS , for it is he who shall save his people from their sins . "
40001022	Now all this has happened , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet , saying ,
40001023	" Behold , the virgin shall be with child , and shall bring forth a son . They shall call his name Immanuel ; " which is , being interpreted , " God with us . "
40001024	Joseph arose from his sleep , and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him , and took his wife to himself ;
40001025	and didn't know her sexually until she had brought forth her firstborn son . He named him JESUS .
40002001	Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod , the king , behold , wise men from the east came to Jerusalem , saying ,
40002002	" Where is he who is born King of the Jews ? For we saw his star in the east , and have come to worship him . "
40002003	When Herod the king heard it , he was troubled , and all Jerusalem with him .
40002004	Gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people , he asked them where the Christ would be born .
40002005	They said to him , " In Bethlehem of Judea , for thus it is written through the prophet ,
40002006	' You Bethlehem , land of Judah , Are in no way least among the princes of Judah : For out of you shall come forth a governor , Who shall shepherd my people , Israel ' " .
40002007	Then Herod secretly called the wise men , and learned from them exactly what time the star appeared .
40002008	He sent them to Bethlehem , and said , " Go and search diligently for the young child . When you have found him , bring me word , so that I also may come and worship him . "
40002009	They , having heard the king , went their way ; and behold , the star , which they saw in the east , went before them , until it came and stood over where the young child was .
40002010	When they saw the star , they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy .
40002011	They came into the house and saw the young child with Mary , his mother , and they fell down and worshipped him . Opening their treasures , they offered to him gifts : gold , frankincense , and myrrh .
40002012	Being warned in a dream that they shouldn't return to Herod , they went back to their own country another way .
40002013	Now when they had departed , behold , an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream , saying , " Arise and take the young child and his mother , and flee into Egypt , and stay there until I tell you , for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him . "
40002014	He arose and took the young child and his mother by night , and departed into Egypt ,
40002015	and was there until the death of Herod ; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet , saying , " Out of Egypt I called my son . "
40002016	Then Herod , when he saw that he was mocked by the wise men , was exceedingly angry , and sent forth , and killed all the male children who were in Bethlehem , and in all the surrounding countryside , from two years old and under , according to the exact time which he had learned from the wise men .
40002017	Then that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled , saying ,
40002018	" A voice was heard in Ramah , Lamentation , weeping and great mourning , Rachel weeping for her children ; She wouldn't be comforted , because they are no more . "
40002019	But when Herod was dead , behold , an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt , saying ,
40002020	" Arise and take the young child and his mother , and go into the land of Israel , for those who sought the young child's life are dead . "
40002021	He arose and took the young child and his mother , and came into the land of Israel .
40002022	But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in the place of his father , Herod , he was afraid to go there . Being warned in a dream , he withdrew into the region of Galilee ,
40002023	and came and lived in a city called Nazareth ; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets : " He will be called a Nazarene . "
40003001	In those days , John the Baptizer came , preaching in the wilderness of Judea , saying ,
40003002	" Repent , for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand ! "
40003003	For this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet , saying , " The voice of one crying in the wilderness , Make ready the way of the Lord , Make his paths straight . "
40003004	Now John himself had clothing made of camel's hair , and a leather belt around his waist . His food was locusts and wild honey .
40003005	Then people from Jerusalem , all of Judea , and all the region around the Jordan went out to him .
40003006	They were baptized by him in the Jordan , confessing their sins .
40003007	But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for his baptism , he said to them , " You offspring of vipers , who warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
40003008	Therefore bring forth fruit worthy of repentance !
40003009	Don't think to yourselves , ' We have Abraham for our father , ' for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones .
40003010	Even now the ax lies at the root of the trees . Therefore , every tree that doesn't bring forth good fruit is cut down , and cast into the fire .
40003011	I indeed baptize you in water for repentance , but he who comes after me is mightier than I , whose shoes I am not worthy to carry . He shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit .
40003012	His winnowing fork is in his hand , and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor . He will gather his wheat into the barn , but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire . "
40003013	Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John , to be baptized by him .
40003014	But John would have hindered him , saying , " I need to be baptized by you , and you come to me ? "
40003015	But Jesus , answering , said to him , " Allow it now , for this is the fitting way for us to fulfill all righteousness . " Then he allowed him .
40003016	Jesus , when he was baptized , went up directly from the water : and behold , the heavens were opened to him . He saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove , and coming on him .
40003017	Behold , a voice out of the heavens said , " This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased . "
40004001	Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil .
40004002	When he had fasted forty days and forty nights , he was hungry afterward .
40004003	The tempter came and said to him , " If you are the Son of God , command that these stones become bread . "
40004004	But he answered , " It is written , ' Man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God . ' "
40004005	Then the devil took him into the holy city . He set him on the pinnacle of the temple ,
40004006	and said to him , " If you are the Son of God , throw yourself down , for it is written , ' He will give his angels charge concerning you . ' and , ' On their hands they will bear you up , So that you don't dash your foot against a stone . ' "
40004007	Jesus said to him , " Again , it is written , ' You shall not test the Lord , your God . ' "
40004008	Again , the devil took him to an exceedingly high mountain , and showed him all the kingdoms of the world , and their glory .
40004009	He said to him , " I will give you all of these things , if you will fall down and worship me . "
40004010	Then Jesus said to him , " Get behind me , Satan ! For it is written , ' You shall worship the Lord your God , and him only shall you serve . ' "
40004011	Then the devil left him , and behold , angels came and ministered to him .
40004012	Now when Jesus heard that John was delivered up , he withdrew into Galilee .
40004013	Leaving Nazareth , he came and lived in Capernaum , which is by the sea , in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali ,
40004014	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet , saying ,
40004015	" The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali , Toward the sea , beyond the Jordan , Galilee of the Gentiles ,
40004016	The people who sat in darkness saw a great light , To those who sat in the region and shadow of death , To them did light spring up . "
40004017	From that time , Jesus began to preach , and to say , " Repent ! For the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand . "
40004018	Walking by the sea of Galilee , he saw two brothers : Simon , who is called Peter , and Andrew , his brother , casting a net into the sea ; for they were fishermen .
40004019	He said to them , " Come , follow me , and I will make you fishers for men . "
40004020	They immediately left their nets , and followed him .
40004021	Going on from there , he saw two other brothers , James , the son of Zebedee , and John , his brother , in the boat with Zebedee , their father , mending their nets . He called them .
40004022	They immediately left the boat and their father , and followed him .
40004023	Jesus went about in all Galilee , teaching in their synagogues , preaching the gospel of the kingdom , and healing every disease and every sickness among the people .
40004024	The report about him went forth into all Syria . They brought to him all who were sick , afflicted with various diseases and torments , possessed with demons , epileptics , and paralytics ; and he healed them .
40004025	Great multitudes from Galilee , Decapolis , Jerusalem , Judea and from beyond the Jordan followed him .
40005001	Seeing the multitudes , he went up onto a mountain . When he had sat down , his disciples came to him .
40005002	He opened his mouth and taught them , saying ,
40005003	" Blessed are the poor in spirit , for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven .
40005004	" Blessed are those who mourn , for they shall be comforted .
40005005	" Blessed are the humble , for they shall inherit the earth .
40005006	" Blessed are those who hunger and thirst after righteousness , for they shall be filled .
40005007	" Blessed are the merciful , for they shall obtain mercy .
40005008	" Blessed are the pure in heart , for they shall see God .
40005009	" Blessed are the peacemakers , for they shall be called sons of God .
40005010	" Blessed are those who have been persecuted for righteousness ' sake , for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven .
40005011	" Blessed are you when people reproach you , persecute you , and say all kinds of evil against you falsely , for my sake .
40005012	" Rejoice , and be exceedingly glad , for great is your reward in heaven . For that is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you .
40005013	You are the salt of the earth , but if the salt has lost its flavor , what will it be salted with ? It is then good for nothing , but to be cast out and trodden under the feet of men .
40005014	You are the light of the world . A city set on a hill can't be hid .
40005015	Neither do you light a lamp , and put it under a bushel basket , but on a stand ; and it shines to all who are in the house .
40005016	Even so , let your light shine before men ; that they may see your good works , and glorify your Father who is in heaven .
40005017	Don't think that I came to destroy the law or the prophets . I didn't come to destroy , but to fulfill .
40005018	For most assuredly , I tell you , until heaven and earth pass away , not even one smallest letter or one tiny pen stroke shall in any way pass away from the law , until all things are accomplished .
40005019	Whoever , therefore , shall break one of these least commandments , and teach others to do so , shall be called least in the Kingdom of Heaven ; but whoever shall do and teach them shall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven .
40005020	For I tell you , that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees , there is no way you shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven .
40005021	" You have heard that it was said to them of old time , ' You shall not murder ; ' and ' Whoever shall murder shall be in danger of the judgment . '
40005022	But I tell you , that everyone who is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment ; and whoever shall say to his brother , ' Raca , ' shall be in danger of the council ; and whoever shall say , ' You fool , ' shall be in danger of the fire of Gehenna .
40005023	If therefore you are offering your gift at the altar , and there remember that your brother has anything against you ,
40005024	leave your gift there before the altar , and go your way . First be reconciled to your brother , and then come and offer your gift .
40005025	Agree with your adversary quickly , while you are with him in the way ; lest perhaps the prosecutor deliver you to the judge , and the judge deliver you to the officer , and you be cast into prison .
40005026	Most assuredly I tell you , you shall by no means get out of there , until you have paid the last penny .
40005027	" You have heard that it was said , ' You shall not commit adultery ; '
40005028	but I tell you that everyone who gazes at a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart .
40005029	If your right eye causes you to stumble , pluck it out and cast it from you . For it is profitable for you that one of your members should perish , than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna .
40005030	If your right hand causes you to stumble , cut it off , and cast it from you : for it is profitable for you that one of your members should perish , and not your whole body be cast into Gehenna .
40005031	" It was also said , ' Whoever shall put away his wife , let him give her a writing of divorce , '
40005032	but I tell you that whoever who puts away his wife , except for the cause of sexual immorality , makes her an adulteress ; and whoever shall marry her when she is put away commits adultery .
40005033	" Again you have heard that it was said to them of old time , ' You shall not make false vows , but shall perform to the Lord your vows , '
40005034	but I tell you , don't swear at all : neither by heaven , for it is the throne of God ;
40005035	nor by the earth , for it is the footstool of his feet ; nor by Jerusalem , for it is the city of the great King .
40005036	Neither shall you swear by your head , for you can't make one hair white or black .
40005037	But let your speech be , ' Yes , yes ; No , no . ' Whatever is more than these is of the evil one .
40005038	You have heard that it was said , ' An eye for an eye , and a tooth for a tooth . '
40005039	But I tell you , don't resist him who is evil ; but whoever strikes you on your right cheek , turn to him the other also .
40005040	If any man would go to law with you and take away your coat , let him have your cloak also .
40005041	Whoever compels you to go one mile , go with him two .
40005042	Give to him who asks you , and don't turn away him who desires to borrow from you .
40005043	" You have heard that it was said , ' You shall love your neighbor , and hate your enemy . '
40005044	But I tell you , love your enemies , bless those who curse you , do good to those who hate you , and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you ,
40005045	that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven . For he makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good , and sends rain on the just and the unjust .
40005046	For if you love those who love you , what reward do you have ? Don't even the tax collectors do the same ?
40005047	If you only greet your friends , what more do you do than others ? Don't even the tax collectors do the same ?
40005048	Therefore you shall be perfect , just as your Father in heaven is perfect .
40006001	" Be careful that you don't do your charitable giving before men , to be seen by them , or else you have no reward with your Father who is in heaven .
40006002	Therefore when you do merciful deeds , don't sound a trumpet before you , as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets , that they may get glory from men . Most assuredly , I tell you , they have received their reward .
40006003	But when you do merciful deeds , don't let your left hand know what your right hand does ,
40006004	so that your merciful deeds may be in secret , then your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly .
40006005	" When you pray , you shall not be as the hypocrites , for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets , that they may be seen by men . Most assuredly , I tell you , they have received their reward .
40006006	But you , when you pray , enter into your inner chamber , and having shut your door , pray to your Father who is in secret , and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly .
40006007	In praying , don't use vain repetitions , as the Gentiles do ; for they think that they will be heard for their much speaking .
40006008	Therefore don't be like them , for your Father knows what things you need , before you ask him .
40006009	Pray like this . ' Our Father , who is in heaven , may your name be kept holy .
40006010	May your kingdom come . May your will be done , as in heaven , so on earth .
40006011	Give us this day our daily bread .
40006012	Forgive us our debts , as we also forgive our debtors .
40006013	Bring us not into temptation , but deliver us from evil . For yours is the kingdom , the power and the glory forever . Amen . '
40006014	For if you forgive men their trespasses , your heavenly Father will also forgive you .
40006015	But if you don't forgive men their trespasses , neither will your Father forgive your trespasses .
40006016	" Moreover when you fast , don't be , as the hypocrites , with sad faces . For they disfigure their faces , that they may be seen by men to be fasting . Most assuredly I tell you , they have received their reward .
40006017	But you , when you fast , anoint your head , and wash your face ;
40006018	that you are not seen by men to be fasting , but by your Father who is in secret , and your Father , who sees in secret , will reward you .
40006019	" Don't lay up treasures for yourselves on the earth , where moth and rust consume , and where thieves break through and steal ;
40006020	but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven , where neither moth nor rust consume , and where thieves don't break through and steal ;
40006021	for where your treasure is , your heart will be there also .
40006022	The lamp of the body is the eye : if therefore your eye is sound , your whole body will be full of light .
40006023	But if your eye is evil , your whole body will be full of darkness . If therefore the light that is in you is darkness , how great is the darkness !
40006024	" No one can serve two masters , for either he will hate the one , and love the other ; or else he will hold to one , and despise the other . You can't serve both God and Mammon .
40006025	Therefore , I tell you , don't be anxious for your life , what you will eat , or what you will drink ; nor yet for your body , what you will put on . Isn't life more than food , and the body more than clothing ?
40006026	See the birds of the sky , that they don't sow , neither do they reap , nor gather into barns . Your heavenly Father feeds them . Aren't you of much more value than they ?
40006027	Which of you , by being anxious , can add one cubit to the measure of his life ?
40006028	Why are you anxious about clothing ? Consider the lilies of the field , how they grow . They don't toil , neither do they spin ,
40006029	yet I tell you that even Solomon in all his glory was not dressed like one of these .
40006030	But if God so clothes the grass of the field , which today exists , and tomorrow is cast into the oven , won't he much more clothe you , you of little faith ?
40006031	Therefore don't be anxious , saying , ' What will we eat ? ' , ' What will we drink ? ' or , ' With what will we be clothed ? '
40006032	For the Gentiles seek after all these things , for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things .
40006033	But seek first God's Kingdom , and his righteousness ; and all these things will be added to you .
40006034	Therefore don't be anxious for tomorrow , for tomorrow will be anxious for itself . Each day's own evil is sufficient .
40007001	" Don't judge , so that you won't be judged .
40007002	For with whatever judgment you judge , you will be judged : and with whatever measure you measure , it will be measured to you .
40007003	Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye , but don't consider the beam that is in your own eye ?
40007004	Or how will you tell your brother , ' Let me remove the speck from your eye ; ' and behold , the beam is in your own eye ?
40007005	You hypocrite ! First remove the beam out of your own eye , and then you can see clearly to remove the speck out of your brother's eye .
40007006	" Don't give that which is holy to the dogs , neither cast your pearls before the pigs , lest perhaps they trample them under their feet , and turn and tear you to pieces .
40007007	" Ask , and it will be given you . Seek , and you will find . Knock , and it will be opened to you .
40007008	For everyone who asks receives . He who seeks finds . To him who knocks it will be opened .
40007009	Or what man is there of you , who , if his son asks him for bread , will give him a stone ?
40007010	Or if he asks for a fish , who will give him a serpent ?
40007011	If you then , being evil , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him !
40007012	Therefore whatever you desire for men to do to you , you shall also do to them ; for this is the law and the prophets .
40007013	Enter in by the narrow gate ; for wide is the gate , and broad is the way , that leads to destruction , and many are those who enter in by it .
40007014	How narrow is the gate , and restricted is the way that leads to life ! Few are those who find it .
40007015	" Beware of false prophets , who come to you in sheep's clothing , but inwardly are ravening wolves .
40007016	By their fruits you will know them . Do you gather grapes from thorns , or figs from thistles ?
40007017	Even so , every good tree brings forth good fruit ; but the corrupt tree brings forth evil fruit .
40007018	A good tree can't bring forth evil fruit , neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit .
40007019	Every tree that doesn't grow good fruit is cut down , and thrown into the fire .
40007020	Therefore , by their fruits you will know them .
40007021	Not everyone who says to me , ' Lord , Lord , ' will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven ; but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven .
40007022	Many will tell me in that day , ' Lord , Lord , didn't we prophesy by your name , by your name cast out demons , and by your name do many mighty works ? '
40007023	Then I will tell them , ' I never knew you . Depart from me , you who work iniquity . '
40007024	" Everyone therefore who hears these words of mine , and does them , I will liken him to a wise man , who built his house on a rock .
40007025	The rain came down , the floods came , and the winds blew , and beat on that house ; and it didn't fall , for it was founded on the rock .
40007026	Everyone who hears these words of mine , and doesn't do them will be like a foolish man , who built his house on the sand .
40007027	The rain came down , the floods came , and the winds blew , and beat on that house ; and it fell - - and great was its fall . "
40007028	It happened , when Jesus had finished saying these things , that the multitudes were astonished at his teaching ,
40007029	for he taught them with authority , and not like the scribes .
40008001	When he came down from the mountain , great multitudes followed him .
40008002	Behold , a leper came to him and worshipped him , saying , " Lord , if you want to , you can make me clean . "
40008003	Jesus stretched out his hand , and touched him , saying , " I want to . Be made clean . " Immediately his leprosy was cleansed .
40008004	Jesus said to him , " See that you tell nobody , but go , show yourself to the priest , and offer the gift that Moses commanded , as a testimony to them . "
40008005	When he came into Capernaum , a centurion came to him , asking him ,
40008006	and saying , " Lord , my servant lies in the house paralyzed , grievously tormented . "
40008007	Jesus said to him , " I will come and heal him . "
40008008	The centurion answered , " Lord , I'm not worthy for you to come under my roof . Just say the word , and my servant will be healed .
40008009	For I am also a man under authority , having under myself soldiers . I tell this one , ' Go , ' and he goes ; and to another , ' Come , ' and he comes ; and to my servant , ' Do this , ' and he does it . "
40008010	When Jesus heard it , he marveled , and said to those who followed , " Most assuredly I tell you , I haven't found so great a faith , not even in Israel .
40008011	I tell you that many will come from the east and the west , and will sit down with Abraham , and Isaac , and Jacob , in the Kingdom of Heaven ,
40008012	but the sons of the kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness . There will be weeping and the gnashing of teeth . "
40008013	Jesus said to the centurion , " Go your way . Let it be done for you as you as you have believed . " His servant was healed in that hour .
40008014	When Jesus came into Peter's house , he saw his wife's mother lying sick of a fever .
40008015	He touched her hand , and the fever left her . She got up and served him .
40008016	When evening came , they brought to him many possessed with demons . He cast out the spirits with a word , and healed all who were sick ;
40008017	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet , saying : " He took our infirmities , and bore our diseases . "
40008018	Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him , he gave the order to depart to the other side .
40008019	A scribe came , and said to him , " Teacher , I will follow you wherever you go . "
40008020	Jesus said to him , " The foxes have holes , and the birds of the sky have nests , but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head . "
40008021	Another of his disciples said to him , " Lord , allow me first to go and bury my father . "
40008022	But Jesus said to him , " Follow me , and leave the dead to bury their own dead . "
40008023	When he got into a boat , his disciples followed him .
40008024	Behold , a great tempest arose in the sea , so much that the boat was covered with the waves , but he was asleep .
40008025	They came to him , and woke him up , saying , " Save us , Lord ! We are dying ! "
40008026	He said to them , " Why are you fearful , oh you of little faith ? " Then he got up , rebuked the wind and the sea , and there was a great calm .
40008027	The men marveled , saying , " What kind of man is this , that even the wind and the sea obey him ? "
40008028	When he came to the other side , into the country of the Gergesenes , two people possessed with demons met him there , coming forth out of the tombs , exceedingly fierce , so that no man could pass by that way .
40008029	Behold , they cried out , saying , " What do we have to do with you , Jesus , Son of God ? Have you come here to torment us before the time ? "
40008030	Now there was a herd of many pigs feeding far away from them .
40008031	The demons begged him , saying , " If you cast us out , permit us to go away into the herd of pigs . "
40008032	He said to them , " Go ! " They came out , and went into the herd of pigs : and behold , the whole herd of pigs rushed down the cliff into the sea , and died in the water .
40008033	Those who fed them fled , and went away into the city , and told everything , and what happened to those who were possessed with demons .
40008034	Behold , all the city came out to meet Jesus . When they saw him , they begged that he would depart from their borders .
40009001	He entered into a boat , and crossed over , and came into his own city .
40009002	Behold , they brought to him a man who was paralyzed , lying on a bed . Jesus , seeing their faith , said to the paralytic , " Son , cheer up ! Your sins are forgiven you . "
40009003	Behold , some of the scribes said to themselves , " This man blasphemes . "
40009004	Jesus , knowing their thoughts , said , " Why do you think evil in your hearts ?
40009005	For which is easier , to say , ' Your sins are forgiven ; ' or to say , ' Get up , and walk ? '
40009006	But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins . . . " ( then he said to the paralytic ) , " Get up , and take up your mat , and go up to your house . "
40009007	He arose and departed to his house .
40009008	But when the multitudes saw it , they marveled and glorified God , who had given such authority to men .
40009009	As Jesus passed by from there , he saw a man called Matthew , sitting at the tax collection office . He said to him , " Follow me . " He got up and followed him .
40009010	It happened , as he sat at the table in the house , behold , many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with Jesus and his disciples .
40009011	When the Pharisees saw it , they said to his disciples , " Why does your teacher eat with the tax collectors and sinners ? "
40009012	When Jesus heard it , he said to them , " Those who are healthy have no need for a physician , but those who are sick do .
40009013	But you go and learn what this means : ' I desire mercy , and not sacrifice , ' for I came not to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance . "
40009014	Then John's disciples came to him , saying , " Why do we and the Pharisees fast often , but your disciples don't fast ? "
40009015	Jesus said to them , " Can the friends of the bridegroom mourn , as long as the bridegroom is with them ? But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them , and then they will fast .
40009016	No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment ; for the patch would tear away from the garment , and a worse hole is made .
40009017	Neither do people put new wine into old wineskins , or else the skins would burst , and the wine be spilled , and the skins ruined . No , they put new wine into fresh wineskins , and both are preserved . "
40009018	While he told these things to them , behold , a ruler came and worshipped him , saying , " My daughter has just died , but come and lay your hand on her , and she will live . "
40009019	Jesus got up and followed him , as did his disciples .
40009020	Behold , a woman , who had an issue of blood for twelve years , came behind him , and touched the tassels of his garment ;
40009021	for she said within herself , " If I just touch his garment , I will be made well . "
40009022	But Jesus , turning around and seeing her , said , " Daughter , cheer up ! Your faith has made you well . " And the woman was made well from that hour .
40009023	When Jesus came into the ruler's house , and saw the flute players , and the crowd in noisy disorder ,
40009024	he said to them , " Make room , because the young lady isn't dead , but sleeping . " They laughed him to scorn .
40009025	But when the crowd was put out , he entered in , took her by the hand , and the young lady arose .
40009026	The report of this went forth into all that land .
40009027	As Jesus passed by from there , two blind men followed him , calling out and saying , " Have mercy on us , son of David ! "
40009028	When he had come into the house , the blind men came to him . Jesus said to them , " Do you believe that I am able to do this ? " They told him , " Yes , Lord . "
40009029	Then he touched their eyes , saying , " According to your faith be it done to you . "
40009030	Their eyes were opened . Jesus strictly charged them , saying , " See that no one knows about this . "
40009031	But they went out and spread abroad his fame in all that land .
40009032	As they went forth , behold , there was brought to him a mute man who was demon possessed .
40009033	When the demon was cast out , the mute man spoke . The multitudes marveled , saying , " Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel ! "
40009034	But the Pharisees said , " By the prince of the demons , he casts out demons . "
40009035	Jesus went about all the cities and the villages , teaching in their synagogues , and preaching the gospel of the kingdom , and healing every disease and every sickness among the people .
40009036	But when he saw the multitudes , he was moved with compassion for them , because they were weary and scattered , as sheep without a shepherd .
40009037	Then he said to his disciples , " The harvest indeed is plentiful , but the laborers are few .
40009038	Pray therefore that the Lord of the harvest will send forth laborers into his harvest . "
40010001	He called to himself his twelve disciples , and gave them authority over unclean spirits , to cast them out , and to heal every disease and every sickness .
40010002	Now the names of the twelve apostles are these . The first , Simon , who is called Peter ; Andrew , his brother ; James the son of Zebedee ; John , his brother ;
40010003	Philip ; Bartholomew ; Thomas ; Matthew , the tax collector ; James the son of Alphaeus ; and Lebbaeus , whose surname was Thaddaeus ;
40010004	Simon the Canaanite ; and Judas Iscariot , who also betrayed him .
40010005	Jesus sent these twelve forth , and charged them , saying , " Don't go among the Gentiles , and don't enter into any city of the Samaritans .
40010006	Rather , go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel .
40010007	As you go , preach , saying , ' The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand . '
40010008	Heal the sick , cleanse the lepers , and cast out demons . Freely you received , so freely give .
40010009	Don't take any gold , nor silver , nor brass in your money belts .
40010010	Take no bag for your journey , neither two coats , nor shoes , nor staff : for the laborer is worthy of his food .
40010011	Into whatever city or village you enter , find out who in it is worthy ; and stay there until you go on .
40010012	As you enter into the household , greet it .
40010013	If the household is worthy , let your peace come on it , but if it isn't worthy , let your peace return to you .
40010014	Whoever doesn't receive you , nor hear your words , as you go forth out of that house or that city , shake off the dust from your feet .
40010015	Most assuredly I tell you , It will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment , than for that city .
40010016	Behold , I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves . Therefore be wise as serpents , and harmless as doves .
40010017	But beware of men : for they will deliver you up to councils , and in their synagogues they will scourge you .
40010018	Yes , and you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake , for a testimony to them and to the Gentiles .
40010019	But when they deliver you up , don't be anxious how or what you will say , for it will be given you in that hour what you will say .
40010020	For it is not you who speak , but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you .
40010021	Brother will deliver up brother to death , and the father his child . Children will rise up against parents , and cause them to be put to death .
40010022	You will be hated by all men for my name's sake , but he who endures to the end , the same will be saved .
40010023	But when they persecute you in this city , flee into the next , for most assuredly I tell you , you will not have gone through the cities of Israel , until the Son of Man has come .
40010024	" A disciple is not above his teacher , nor a servant above his lord .
40010025	It is enough for the disciple that he be like his teacher , and the servant like his lord . If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul , how much more them of his household !
40010026	Therefore don't be afraid of them , for there is nothing covered , that will not be revealed ; and hidden , that will not be known .
40010027	What I tell you in the darkness , speak in the light ; and what you hear whispered in the ear , proclaim on the housetops .
40010028	Don't be afraid of those who kill the body , but are not able to kill the soul . Rather , fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna .
40010029	" Aren't two sparrows sold for an assarion ? Not one of them falls on the ground apart from your Father's will ,
40010030	but the very hairs of your head are all numbered .
40010031	Therefore don't be afraid , you are of more value than many sparrows .
40010032	Everyone therefore who confesses me before men , him will I also confess before my Father who is in heaven .
40010033	But whoever denies me before men , him will I also deny before my Father who is in heaven .
40010034	" Don't think that I came to send peace on the earth . I didn't come to send peace , but a sword .
40010035	For I came to set a man at odds against his father , and the daughter against her mother , and the daughter in law against her mother in law .
40010036	A man's foes will be those of his own household .
40010037	He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me ; and he who loves son or daughter more than me isn't worthy of me .
40010038	He who doesn't take his cross and follow after me , isn't worthy of me .
40010039	He who finds his life will lose it ; and he who loses his life for my sake will find it .
40010040	He who receives you receives me , and he who receives me receives him who sent me .
40010041	He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet's reward : and he who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man will receive a righteous man's reward .
40010042	Whoever gives one of these little ones just a cup of cold water to drink , in the name of a disciple , most assuredly I tell you he will in no way lose his reward . "
40011001	It happened that when Jesus had finished directing his twelve disciples , he departed there to teach and preach in their cities .
40011002	Now when John heard in the prison the works of Christ , he sent two of his disciples
40011003	and said to him , " Are you he who comes , or should we look for another ? "
40011004	Jesus answered them , " Go and tell John the things which you hear and see :
40011005	the blind receive their sight , the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed , the deaf hear , the dead are raised up , and the poor have good news preached to them .
40011006	Blessed is he , whoever finds no occasion for stumbling in me . "
40011007	As these went their way , Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John , " What did you go out into the wilderness to see ? A reed shaken with the wind ?
40011008	But what did you go out to see ? A man in soft clothing ? Behold , those who wear soft clothing are in king's houses .
40011009	But why did you go out ? To see a prophet ? Yes , I tell you , and much more than a prophet .
40011010	For this is he , of whom it is written , ' Behold , I send my messenger before your face , who will prepare your way before you . '
40011011	Most assuredly I tell you , among those who are born of women there has not arisen anyone greater than John the Baptizer ; yet he who is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he .
40011012	From the days of John the Baptizer until now , the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence , and the violent take it by force .
40011013	For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John .
40011014	If you are willing to receive it , this is Elijah , who is to come .
40011015	He who has ears to hear , let him hear .
40011016	" But what will I compare this generation to ? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces , who call to their companions
40011017	and say , ' We played the flute for you , and you didn't dance . We mourned for you , and you didn't lament . '
40011018	For John came neither eating nor drinking , and they say , ' He has a demon . '
40011019	The Son of Man came eating and drinking , and they say , ' Behold , a gluttonous man and a drunkard , a friend of tax collectors and sinners ! ' But wisdom is justified by her children . "
40011020	Then he began to denounce the cities in which most of his mighty works were done , because they didn't repent .
40011021	" Woe to you , Chorazin ! Woe to you , Bethsaida ! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you , they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes .
40011022	But I tell you , it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you .
40011023	You , Capernaum , who are exalted to Heaven , you will go down to Hades . For if the mighty works had been done in Sodom which were done in you , it would have remained until this day .
40011024	But I tell you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom , in the day of judgment , than for you . "
40011025	At that time , Jesus answered , " I thank you , Father , Lord of heaven and earth , that you hid these things from the wise and understanding , and revealed them to infants .
40011026	Yes , Father , for so it was well-pleasing in your sight .
40011027	All things have been delivered to me by my Father . No one knows the Son , except the Father ; neither does anyone know the Father , except the Son , and he to whoever the Son wants to reveal him .
40011028	" Come to me , all you who labor and are heavily burdened , and I will give you rest .
40011029	Take my yoke on you , and learn from me , for I am humble and lowly in heart ; and you will find rest for your souls .
40011030	For my yoke is easy , and my burden is light . "
40012001	At that time , Jesus went on the Sabbath day through the grain fields . His disciples were hungry and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat .
40012002	But the Pharisees , when they saw it , said to him , " Behold , your disciples do what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath . "
40012003	But he said to them , " Haven't you read what David did , when he was hungry , and those who were with him ;
40012004	how he entered into the house of God , and ate the show bread , which was not lawful for him to eat , neither for those who were with him , but only for the priests ?
40012005	Or have you not read in the law , that on the Sabbath day , the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath , and are guiltless ?
40012006	But I tell you that one greater than the temple is here .
40012007	But if you had known what this means , ' I desire mercy , and not sacrifice , ' you would not have condemned the guiltless .
40012008	For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath . "
40012009	He departed there , and went into their synagogue .
40012010	And behold there was , a man with a withered hand . They asked him , " Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath day ? " that they might accuse him .
40012011	He said to them , " What man is there among you , who has one sheep , and if this one falls into a pit on the Sabbath day , will he not grab on to it , and lift it out ?
40012012	How much , then , is a man of more value than a sheep ! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath day . "
40012013	Then he told the man , " Stretch out your hand . " He stretched it out ; and it was restored whole , just like the other .
40012014	But the Pharisees went out , and took counsel against him , how they might destroy him .
40012015	Jesus , perceiving that , withdrew from there . Great multitudes followed him ; and he healed them all ,
40012016	and charged them that they should not make him known :
40012017	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet , saying ,
40012018	" Behold , my servant whom I have chosen ; My beloved in whom my soul is well pleased : I will put my Spirit on him , He will declare judgment to the Gentiles .
40012019	He will not strive , nor shout ; Neither will anyone hear his voice in the streets .
40012020	He won't break a bruised reed , He won't quench a smoking flax , Until he sends forth judgment to victory .
40012021	In his name , the Gentiles will hope . "
40012022	Then there was brought to him one possessed by a demon , blind and mute , and he healed him , so that the blind and mute man both spoke and saw .
40012023	All the multitudes were amazed , and said , " Can this be the son of David ? "
40012024	But when the Pharisees heard it , they said , " This man does not cast out demons , except by Beelzebul , the prince of the demons . "
40012025	Knowing their thoughts , Jesus said to them , " Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation , and every city or house divided against itself will not stand .
40012026	If Satan casts out Satan , he is divided against himself . How then will his kingdom stand ?
40012027	If I by Beelzebul cast out demons , by whom do your sons cast them out ? Therefore they will be your judges .
40012028	But if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons , then the kingdom of God has come on you .
40012029	Or how can one enter into the house of the strong man , and plunder his goods , except he first bind the strong man ? Then he will plunder his house .
40012030	" He who is not with me is against me , and he who doesn't gather with me , scatters .
40012031	Therefore I tell you , every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men , but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven men .
40012032	Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man , it will be forgiven him ; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit , it will not be forgiven him , neither in this world , nor in that which is to come .
40012033	" Either make the tree good , and its fruit good , or make the tree corrupt , and its fruit corrupt ; for the tree is known by its fruit .
40012034	You offspring of vipers , how can you , being evil , speak good things ? For out of the abundance of the heart , the mouth speaks .
40012035	The good man out of his good treasure brings forth good things , and the evil man out of his evil treasure brings forth evil things .
40012036	I tell you that every idle word that men speak , they will give account of it in the day of judgment .
40012037	For by your words you will be justified , and by your words you will be condemned . "
40012038	Then certain of the scribes and Pharisees answered , saying , " Teacher , we want to see a sign from you . "
40012039	But he answered them , " An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign , and there will no sign be given it but the sign of Jonah , the prophet .
40012040	For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale , so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth .
40012041	The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation , and will condemn it , for they repented at the preaching of Jonah ; and behold , someone greater than Jonah is here .
40012042	The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation , and will condemn it , for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon ; and behold , someone greater than Solomon is here .
40012043	But the unclean spirit , when he is gone out of the man , passes through waterless places , seeking rest , and doesn't find it .
40012044	Then he says , ' I will return into my house whence I came out , ' and when he has come back , he finds it empty , swept , and put in order .
40012045	Then he goes , and takes with himself seven other spirits more evil than himself , and they enter in and dwell there . The last state of that man becomes worse than the first . Even so will it be also to this evil generation . "
40012046	While he was yet speaking to the multitudes , behold , his mother and his brothers stood outside , seeking to speak to him .
40012047	One said to him , " Behold , your mother and your brothers stand outside , seeking to speak to you . "
40012048	But he answered him who told him , " Who is my mother ? Who are my brothers ? "
40012049	He stretched forth his hand towards his disciples , and said , " Behold , my mother and my brothers !
40012050	For whoever will do the will of my Father who is in heaven , he is my brother , and sister , and mother . "
40013001	On that day Jesus went out of the house , and sat by the seaside .
40013002	Great multitudes gathered to him , so that he entered into a boat , and sat , and all the multitude stood on the beach .
40013003	He spoke to them many things in parables , saying , " Behold , the farmer went forth to sow .
40013004	As he sowed , some seeds fell by the roadside , and the birds came and devoured them .
40013005	Others fell on rocky ground , where they didn't have much soil , and immediately they sprang up , because they had no deepness of earth .
40013006	When the sun had risen , they were scorched . Because they had no root , they withered away .
40013007	Others fell on thorns . The thorns grew up and choked them :
40013008	and others fell on good soil , and yielded fruit : some one hundred times , some sixty , and some thirty .
40013009	He who has ears to hear , let him hear . "
40013010	The disciples came , and said to him , " Why do you speak to them in parables ? "
40013011	He answered them , " To you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven , but it is not given to them .
40013012	For whoever has , to him will be given , and he will have abundance , but whoever doesn't have , from him will be taken away even that which he has .
40013013	Therefore I speak to them in parables , because seeing they don't see , and hearing , they don't hear , neither do they understand .
40013014	In them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled , which says , ' By hearing you will hear , and will in no way understand ; Seeing you will see , and will in no way perceive :
40013015	For this people's heart has grown callous , Their ears are dull of hearing , Their eyes they have closed ; Or else perhaps they might perceive with their eyes , Hear with their ears , Understand with their heart , And should turn again ; And I would heal them . '
40013016	" But blessed are your eyes , for they see ; and your ears , for they hear .
40013017	For most assuredly I tell you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which you see , and didn't see them ; and to hear the things which you hear , and didn't hear them .
40013018	" Hear , then , the parable of the farmer .
40013019	When anyone hears the word of the kingdom , and doesn't understand it , the evil one comes , and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart . This is what was sown by the roadside .
40013020	What was sown on the rocky places , this is he who hears the word , and immediately with joy receives it ;
40013021	yet he has no root in himself , but endures for a while . When oppression or persecution arises because of the word , immediately he stumbles .
40013022	What was sown among the thorns , this is he who hears the word , but the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word , and he becomes unfruitful .
40013023	What was sown on the good ground , this is he who hears the word , and understands it , who most assuredly bears fruit , and brings forth , some one hundred times , some sixty , some thirty . "
40013024	He set another parable before them , saying , " The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field ,
40013025	but while people slept , his enemy came and sowed darnel also among the wheat , and went away .
40013026	But when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit , then the darnel appeared also .
40013027	The servants of the householder came and said to him , ' Sir , didn't you sow good seed in your field ? Where did this darnel come from ? '
40013028	He said to them , ' An enemy has done this . ' The servants asked him , ' Do you want us to go and gather them up ? '
40013029	But he said , ' No , lest perhaps while you gather up the darnel , you root up the wheat with them .
40013030	Let both grow together until the harvest , and in the harvest time I will tell the reapers , " First , gather up the darnel , and bind them in bundles to burn them ; but gather the wheat into my barn . " ' "
40013031	He set another parable before them , saying , " The Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed , which a man took , and sowed in his field ;
40013032	which indeed is smaller than all seeds . But when it is grown , it is greater than the herbs , and becomes a tree , so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its branches . "
40013033	He spoke another parable to them . " The Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast , which a woman took , and hid in three measures of meal , until it was all leavened . "
40013034	Jesus spoke all these things in parables to the multitudes ; and without a parable , he didn't speak to them ,
40013035	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet , saying , " I will open my mouth in parables ; I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world . "
40013036	Then Jesus sent the multitudes away , and went into the house . His disciples came to him , saying , " Explain to us the parable of the darnel of the field . "
40013037	He answered them , " He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man ,
40013038	the field is the world ; and the good seed , these are the sons of the kingdom ; and the darnel are the sons of the evil one .
40013039	The enemy who sowed them is the devil . The harvest is the end of the age , and the reapers are angels .
40013040	As therefore the darnel is gathered up and burned with fire ; so will it be in the end of this age .
40013041	The Son of Man will send forth his angels , and they will gather out of his kingdom all things that cause stumbling , and those who do iniquity ,
40013042	and will cast them into the furnace of fire . There will be weeping and the gnashing of teeth .
40013043	Then the righteous will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father . He who has ears to hear , let him hear .
40013044	" The Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field , which a man found , and hid . In his joy , he goes and sells all that he has , and buys that field .
40013045	" Again , the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a merchant seeking fine pearls ,
40013046	who having found one pearl of great price , he went and sold all that he had , and bought it .
40013047	" Again , the Kingdom of Heaven is like a dragnet , that was cast into the sea , and gathered some fish of every kind ,
40013048	which , when it was filled , they drew up on the beach . They sat down , and gathered the good into containers , but the bad they threw away .
40013049	So will it be in the end of the world . The angels will come forth , and separate the wicked from among the righteous ,
40013050	and will cast them into the furnace of fire . There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth . "
40013051	Jesus said to them , " Have you understood all these things ? " They answered him , " Yes , Lord . "
40013052	He said to them , " Therefore , every scribe who has been made a disciple to the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a householder , who brings forth out of his treasure new and old things . "
40013053	It happened , when Jesus had finished these parables , he departed from there .
40013054	Coming into his own country , he taught them in their synagogue , so much that they were astonished , and said , " Where did this man get this wisdom , and these mighty works ?
40013055	Isn't this the carpenter's son ? Isn't his mother called Mary , and his brothers , James , Joses , Simon , and Judas ?
40013056	Aren't all of his sisters with us ? Where , then did this man get all of these things ? "
40013057	They were offended by him . But Jesus said to them , " A prophet is not without honor , except in his own country , and in his own house . "
40013058	He didn't do many mighty works there because of their unbelief .
40014001	At that time , Herod , the tetrarch , heard the report concerning Jesus ,
40014002	and said to his servants , " This is John the Baptizer . He is risen from the dead . That is why these powers work in him . "
40014003	For Herod had laid hold of John , and bound him , and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias , his brother Philip's wife .
40014004	For John said to him , " It is not lawful for you to have her . "
40014005	When he would have put him to death , he feared the multitude , because they counted him as a prophet .
40014006	But when Herod's birthday came , the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst , and pleased Herod .
40014007	Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatever she should ask .
40014008	She , being put forward by her mother , said , " Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptizer . "
40014009	The king was grieved , but for the sake of his oaths , and of those who sat at the table with him , he commanded it to be given ,
40014010	and he sent and beheaded John in the prison .
40014011	His head was brought on a platter , and given to the young lady : and she brought it to her mother .
40014012	His disciples came , and took up the body , and buried it ; and they went and told Jesus .
40014013	Now when Jesus heard this , he withdrew from there in a boat , to a desert place apart . When the multitudes heard it , they followed him on foot from the cities .
40014014	Jesus went out , and he saw a great multitude . He had compassion on them , and healed their sick .
40014015	When evening had come , his disciples came to him , saying , " The place is a desert , and the time is already past . Send the multitudes away , that they may go into the villages , and buy themselves food . "
40014016	But Jesus said to them , " They don't need to go away . You give them something to eat . "
40014017	They told him , " We only have here five loaves and two fish . "
40014018	He said , " Bring them here to me . "
40014019	He commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass ; and he took the five loaves and the two fish , and looking up to heaven , he blessed , broke and gave the loaves to the disciples , and the disciples to the multitudes .
40014020	They all ate , and were filled . They took up twelve baskets full of that which remained left over from the broken pieces .
40014021	Those who ate were about five thousand men , besides women and children .
40014022	Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat , and to go ahead of him to the other side , while he sent the multitudes away .
40014023	After he had sent the multitudes away , he went up into the mountain apart to pray . When evening had come , he was there alone .
40014024	But the boat was now in the midst of the sea , distressed by the waves , for the wind was contrary .
40014025	In the fourth watch of the night Jesus came to them , walking on the sea .
40014026	When the disciples saw him walking on the sea , they were troubled , saying , " It is a ghost ! " and they cried out for fear .
40014027	But immediately Jesus spoke to them , saying " Cheer up ! I AM ! Don't be afraid . "
40014028	Peter answered him and said , " Lord , if it is you , command me to come to you on the waters . "
40014029	He said , " Come ! " Peter went down from the boat , and walked on the waters to come to Jesus .
40014030	But when he saw that the wind was strong , he was afraid , and beginning to sink , he cried out , saying , " Lord , save me ! "
40014031	Immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand , and took hold of him , and said to him , " You of little faith , why did you doubt ? "
40014032	When they got up into the boat , the wind ceased .
40014033	Those who were in the boat came and worshipped him , saying , " You are truly the Son of God ! "
40014034	When they had crossed over , they came to the land of Gennesaret .
40014035	When the men of that place recognized him , they sent into all that region round about , and brought to him all who were sick ,
40014036	and they begged him that they might only touch the fringe of his garment . As many as touched it were made whole .
40015001	Then Pharisees and scribes come to Jesus from Jerusalem , saying ,
40015002	" Why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the elders ? For they don't wash their hands when they eat bread . "
40015003	He answered them , " Why do you also disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition ?
40015004	For God commanded , ' Honor your father and your mother , ' and , ' He who speaks evil of father or mother , let him be put to death . '
40015005	But you say , ' Whoever will tell his father or his mother , " Whatever help you might otherwise have gotten from me is a gift devoted to God , "
40015006	he will not honor his father or mother . ' You have made the commandment of God void because of your tradition .
40015007	You hypocrites ! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you , saying ,
40015008	' These people draw near to me with their mouth , And honor me with their lips ; But their heart is far from me .
40015009	But in vain do they worship me , Teaching as doctrine rules made by men . ' "
40015010	He called the multitude to himself , and said to them , " Hear , and understand .
40015011	That which enters into the mouth doesn't defile the man ; but that which proceeds out of the mouth , this defiles the man . "
40015012	Then the disciples came , and said to him , " Do you know that the Pharisees were offended , when they heard this saying ? "
40015013	But he answered , " Every plant which my heavenly Father didn't plant will be uprooted .
40015014	Let them alone . They are blind guides of the blind . If the blind guide the blind , both will fall into a pit . "
40015015	Peter answered him , " Explain the parable to us . "
40015016	So Jesus said , " Do you also still not understand ?
40015017	Don't you understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the belly , and then out of the body ?
40015018	But the things which proceed out of the mouth come forth out of the heart , and they defile the man .
40015019	For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts , murders , adulteries , sexual sins , thefts , false testimony , and blasphemies .
40015020	These are the things which defile the man ; but to eat with unwashed hands doesn't defile the man . "
40015021	Jesus went out from there , and withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon .
40015022	Behold , a Canaanite woman came out from those borders , and cried , saying , " Have mercy on me , Lord , you son of David . My daughter is grievously vexed with a demon . "
40015023	But he answered her not a word . His disciples came and begged him , saying , " Send her away ; for she cries after us . "
40015024	But he answered , " I wasn't sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the house of Israel . "
40015025	But she came and worshipped him , saying , " Lord , help me . "
40015026	But he answered , " It is not appropriate to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs . "
40015027	But she said , " Yes , Lord , but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters ' table . "
40015028	Then Jesus answered her , " Woman , great is your faith ! Be it done to you even as you desire . " And her daughter was healed from that hour .
40015029	Jesus departed there , and came near to the sea of Galilee ; and he went up into the mountain , and sat there .
40015030	There came to him great multitudes , having with them the lame , blind , mute , maimed , and many others , and they put them down at his feet . He healed them ,
40015031	so that the multitude wondered , when they saw the mute speaking , the injured whole , lame walking , and the blind seeing - - and they glorified the God of Israel .
40015032	Jesus called his disciples to him , and said , " I have compassion on the multitude , because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat . I don't want to send them away fasting , or they might faint on the way . "
40015033	The disciples said to him , " Where should we get so many loaves in a desert place as to fill so great a multitude ? "
40015034	Jesus said to them , " How many loaves do you have ? " They said , " Seven , and a few small fish . "
40015035	He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground ;
40015036	and he took the seven loaves and the fish . He gave thanks and broke them , and gave to the disciples , and the disciples to the multitudes .
40015037	They all ate , and were filled . They took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over .
40015038	Those who ate were four thousand men , besides women and children .
40015039	He sent away the multitudes , and entered into the boat , and came into the borders of Magdala .
40016001	The Pharisees and Sadducees came , and testing him , asked him to show them a sign from heaven .
40016002	But he answered them , " When it is evening , you say , ' It will be fair weather , for the sky is red . '
40016003	In the morning , ' It will be foul weather today , for the sky is red and threatening . ' Hypocrites ! You know how to discern the appearance of the sky , but you can't discern the signs of the times .
40016004	An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign , and there will be no sign given to it , but the sign of the prophet Jonah . " He left them , and departed .
40016005	The disciples came to the other side and forgot to take bread .
40016006	Jesus said to them , " Take heed and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees . "
40016007	They reasoned among themselves , saying , " We took no bread . "
40016008	Jesus , perceiving it , said , " Why do you reason among yourselves , you of little faith , ' because you have brought no bread ? '
40016009	Don't you yet perceive , neither remember the five loaves for the five thousand , and how many baskets you took up ?
40016010	Nor the seven loaves for the four thousand , and how many baskets you took up ?
40016011	How is it that you don't perceive that I didn't speak to you concerning bread ? But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees . "
40016012	Then they understood that he didn't tell them to beware of the yeast of bread , but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees .
40016013	Now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi , he asked his disciples , saying , " Who do men say that I , the Son of Man , am ? "
40016014	They said , " Some say John the Baptizer , some , Elijah , and others , Jeremiah , or one of the prophets . "
40016015	He said to them , " But who do you say that I am ? "
40016016	Simon Peter answered , " You are the Christ , the Son of the living God . "
40016017	Jesus answered him , " Blessed are you , Simon Bar-jonah , for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you , but my Father who is in heaven .
40016018	I also tell you , that you are Peter , and on this rock I will build my assembly , and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it .
40016019	I will give to you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven , and whatever you will bind on earth will be bound in heaven ; and whatever you will loose on earth will be loosed in heaven . "
40016020	Then he charged the disciples that they should tell no man that he was the Christ .
40016021	From that time , Jesus began to show to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders , chief priests , and scribes , and be killed , and the third day be raised up .
40016022	Peter took him aside , and began to rebuke him , saying , " Far be it from you , Lord ! This will never be done to you . "
40016023	But he turned , and said to Peter , " Get behind me , Satan ! You are a stumbling-block to me , for you are not setting your mind on the things of God , but the things of men . "
40016024	Then Jesus said to his disciples , " If any man desires to come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
40016025	For whoever desires to save his life will lose it , and whoever will lose his life for my sake will find it .
40016026	For what will it profit a man , if he will gain the whole world , and forfeit his life ? Or what will a man give in exchange for his life ?
40016027	For the Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father with his angels , and then will he render to every man according to his deeds .
40016028	Most assuredly I tell you , there are some standing here , who will in no way taste of death , until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom . "
40017001	After six days , Jesus took with him Peter , James , and John , his brother , and brought them up into a high mountain by themselves .
40017002	He was transfigured before them . His face shone like the sun , and his garments became white as the light .
40017003	Behold , there appeared to them Moses and Elijah talking with him .
40017004	Peter answered , and said to Jesus , " Lord , it is good for us to be here . If you want , let's make three tents here : one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . "
40017005	While he was still speaking , behold , a bright cloud overshadowed them . Behold , a voice out of the cloud , saying , " This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased . Listen to him . "
40017006	When the disciples heard it , they fell on their faces , and were very afraid .
40017007	Jesus came and touched them and said , " Get up , and don't be afraid . "
40017008	Lifting up their eyes , they saw no one , except Jesus alone .
40017009	As they were coming down from the mountain , Jesus commanded them , saying , " Don't tell anyone what you saw , until the Son of Man has risen from the dead . "
40017010	His disciples asked him , saying , " Then why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first ?
40017011	Jesus answered them , " Elijah indeed comes first , and will restore all things ,
40017012	but I tell you that Elijah has come already , and they didn't recognize him , but did to him whatever they wanted to . Even so will the Son of Man also suffer by them . "
40017013	Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the Baptizer .
40017014	When they came to the multitude , there came to him a man , kneeling to him , saying ,
40017015	" Lord , have mercy on my son , for he is epileptic , and suffers grievously ; for he often falls into the fire , and often into the water .
40017016	So I brought him to your disciples , and they could not cure him . "
40017017	Jesus answered , " Faithless and perverse generation ! How long will I be with you ? How long will I bear with you ? Bring him here to me . "
40017018	Jesus rebuked him , the demon went out of him , and the boy was cured from that hour .
40017019	Then the disciples came to Jesus privately , and said , " Why couldn't we cast it out ? "
40017020	He said to them , " Because of your unbelief . For most assuredly I tell you , if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed , you will tell this mountain , ' Move from here to there , ' and it will move ; and nothing will be impossible to you .
40017021	But this kind doesn't go out except by prayer and fasting . "
40017022	While they were staying in Galilee , Jesus said to them , " The Son of Man is about to be delivered up into the hands of men ,
40017023	and they will kill him , and the third day he will be raised up . " They were exceedingly sorry .
40017024	When they were come to Capernaum , those who collected the didrachmas came to Peter , and said , " Doesn't your teacher pay the didrachma ? "
40017025	He said , " Yes . " When he came into the house , Jesus anticipated him , saying , " What do you think , Simon ? From whom do the kings of the earth receive toll or tribute ? From their sons , or from strangers ? "
40017026	Peter said to him , " From strangers . " Jesus said to him , " Therefore the sons are exempt .
40017027	But , lest we cause them to stumble , go to the sea , and cast a hook , and take up the first fish that comes up . When you have opened his mouth , you will find a stater . Take that , and give it to them for me and you . "
40018001	In that hour the disciples came to Jesus , saying , " Who then is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven ? "
40018002	Jesus called a little child to himself , and set him in the midst of them ,
40018003	and said , " Most assuredly I tell you , unless you turn , and become as little children , you will in no way enter into the Kingdom of Heaven .
40018004	Whoever therefore will humble himself as this little child , the same is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven .
40018005	Whoever will receive one such little child in my name receives me ,
40018006	but whoever will cause one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble , it would be better for him that a huge millstone should be hung around his neck , and that he should be sunk in the depths of the sea .
40018007	Woe to the world because of occasions of stumbling ! For it must be that the occasions come , but woe to that person through whom the occasion comes !
40018008	If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble , cut it off , and cast it from you . It is better for you to enter into life maimed or crippled , rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the eternal fire .
40018009	If your eye causes you to stumble , pluck it out , and cast it from you . It is better for you to enter into life with one eye , rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna of fire .
40018010	See that you don't despise one of these little ones , for I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven .
40018011	For the Son of Man came to save that which was lost .
40018012	" What do you think ? If a man has one hundred sheep , and one of them goes astray , doesn't he leave the ninety-nine , go to the mountains , and seek that which has gone astray ?
40018013	If he happens to find it , most assuredly I tell you , he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine which have not gone astray .
40018014	Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish .
40018015	" If your brother sins against you , go , show him his fault between you and him alone . If he listens to you , you have gained back your brother .
40018016	But if he doesn't listen , take one or two more with you , that at the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established .
40018017	If he refuses to listen to them , tell it to the assembly . If he refuses to hear the assembly also , let him be to you as a Gentile or a tax collector .
40018018	Most assuredly I tell you , whatever things you will bind on earth will be bound in heaven , and whatever things you will loose on earth will be loosed in heaven .
40018019	Again , assuredly I tell you , that if two of you will agree on earth concerning anything that they will ask , it will be done for them by my Father who is in heaven .
40018020	For where two or three are gathered together in my name , there I am in the midst of them . "
40018021	Then Peter came and said to him , " Lord , how often will my brother sin against me , and I forgive him ? Until seven times ? "
40018022	Jesus said to him , " I don't tell you until seven times , but , until seventy times seven .
40018023	Therefore the Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king , who wanted to reconcile accounts with his servants .
40018024	When he had begun to reconcile , one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents .
40018025	But because he couldn't pay , his lord commanded him to be sold , with his wife , his children , and all that he had , and payment to be made .
40018026	The servant therefore fell down and kneeled before him , saying , ' Lord , have patience with me , and I will repay you all . '
40018027	The lord of that servant , being moved with compassion , released him , and forgave him the debt .
40018028	But that servant went out , and found one of his fellow-servants , who owed him one hundred denarii , and he laid hold on him , and took him by the throat , saying , ' Pay me what you owe ! '
40018029	So his fellow-servant fell down at his feet and begged him , saying , ' Have patience with me , and I will repay you . '
40018030	He would not , but went and cast him into prison , until he should pay back that which was due .
40018031	So when his fellow-servants saw what was done , they were exceedingly sorry , and came and told to their lord all that was done .
40018032	Then his lord called him in , and said to him , ' You wicked servant ! I forgave you all that debt , because you begged me .
40018033	Shouldn't you also have had mercy on your fellow-servant , even as I had mercy on you ? '
40018034	His lord was angry , and delivered him to the tormentors , until he should pay all that was due to him .
40018035	So will my heavenly Father also do to you , if you don't each forgive his brother from your hearts for his misdeeds . "
40019001	It happened when Jesus had finished these words , he departed from Galilee , and came into the borders of Judea beyond the Jordan .
40019002	Great multitudes followed him , and he healed them there .
40019003	Pharisees came to him , testing him , and saying , " Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason ? "
40019004	He answered , " Haven't you read that he who made them from the beginning made them male and female ,
40019005	and said , ' For this cause a man will leave his father and mother , and will join to his wife ; and the two will become one flesh ? '
40019006	So that they are no more two , but one flesh . What therefore God has joined together , don't let man tear apart . "
40019007	They asked him , " Why then did Moses command us to give her a bill of divorce , and divorce her ? "
40019008	He said to them , " Moses , because of the hardness of your hearts , allowed you to divorce your wives , but from the beginning it has not been so .
40019009	I tell you that whoever will put away his wife , except for sexual immorality , and will marry another , commits adultery ; and he who marries her when she is put away commits adultery . "
40019010	His disciples said to him , " If this is the case of the man with his wife , it is not expedient to marry . "
40019011	But he said to them , " Not all men can receive this saying , but they to whom it is given .
40019012	For there are eunuchs , who were born that way from their mother's womb , and there are eunuchs , who were made eunuchs by men : and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven's sake . He who is able to receive it , let him receive it . "
40019013	Then little children were brought to him , that he should lay his hands on them , and pray ; and the disciples rebuked them .
40019014	But Jesus said , " Allow the little children , and don't forbid them to come to me ; for to such belongs the Kingdom of Heaven . "
40019015	He laid his hands on them , and departed there .
40019016	Behold , one came to him and said , " Good teacher , what good thing shall I do , that I may have eternal life ? "
40019017	He said to him , " Why do you call me good ? No one is good but one , that is , God . But if you want to enter into life , keep the commandments . "
40019018	He said to him , " Which ones ? " Jesus said , " You shall not kill . You shall not commit adultery . You shall not steal . You shall not offer false testimony .
40019019	Honor your father and mother . And , you shall love your neighbor as yourself . "
40019020	The young man said to him , " All these things I have observed from my youth . What do I still lack ? "
40019021	Jesus said to him , " If you want to be perfect , go , sell what you have , and give to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven ; and come , follow me . "
40019022	But when the young man heard the saying , he went away sad , for he was one who had great possessions .
40019023	Jesus said to his disciples , " Most assuredly I say to you , a rich man will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven with difficulty .
40019024	Again I tell you , it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God . "
40019025	When the disciples heard it , they were exceedingly astonished , saying , " Who then can be saved ? "
40019026	Looking at them , Jesus said , " With men this is impossible ; but with God all things are possible . "
40019027	Then Peter answered , " Behold , we have left everything , and followed you . What then will we have ? "
40019028	Jesus said to them , " Most assuredly I tell you , that you who have followed me , in the regeneration when the Son of Man will sit on the throne of his glory , you also will sit on twelve thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
40019029	Everyone who has left houses , or brothers , or sisters , or father , or mother , or wife , or children , or lands , for my name's sake , will receive one hundred times , and will inherit eternal life .
40019030	But many will be last who are first ; and first who are last .
40020001	" For the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who was the master of a household , who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard .
40020002	When he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius a day , he sent them into his vineyard .
40020003	He went out about the third hour , and saw others standing idle in the marketplace .
40020004	To them he said , ' You also go into the vineyard , and whatever is right I will give you . ' So they went their way .
40020005	Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour , and did likewise .
40020006	About the eleventh hour he went out , and found others standing idle . He said to them , ' Why do you stand here all day idle ? '
40020007	They said to him , ' Because no one has hired us . ' He said to them , ' You also go into the vineyard , and you will receive whatever is right . '
40020008	When evening had come , the lord of the vineyard said to his steward , ' Call the laborers and pay them their hire , beginning from the last to the first . '
40020009	When they who were hired at about the eleventh hour came , they each received a denarius .
40020010	When the first came , they supposed that they would receive more ; and they likewise each received a denarius .
40020011	When they received it , they murmured against the master of the household ,
40020012	saying , ' These last have spent one hour , and you have made them equal to us , who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat ! '
40020013	But he answered one of them , ' Friend , I am doing you no wrong . Didn't you agree with me for a denarius ?
40020014	Take that which is yours , and go your way . It is my will to give to this last just as much as to you .
40020015	Isn't it lawful for me to do what I want to with what I own ? Or is your eye evil , because I am good ? '
40020016	So the last will be first , and the first last . For many are called , but few are chosen . "
40020017	As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem , he took the twelve disciples aside , and on the way he said to them ,
40020018	" Behold , we are going up to Jerusalem , and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes , and they will condemn him to death ,
40020019	and will hand him over to the Gentiles to mock , to scourge , and to crucify ; and the third day he will be raised up . "
40020020	Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee with her sons , kneeling and asking a certain thing of him .
40020021	He said to her , " What do you want ? " She said to him , " Command that these , my two sons , may sit , one on your right hand , and one on your left hand , in your kingdom . "
40020022	But Jesus answered , " You don't know what you ask . Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink , and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ? " They said to him , " We are able . "
40020023	He said to them , " You will indeed drink my cup , and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with , but to sit on my right hand , and on my left hand , is not mine to give ; but it is for whom it has been prepared by my Father . "
40020024	When the ten heard it , they were moved with indignation concerning the two brothers .
40020025	But Jesus called them to him , and said , " You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them , and their great ones exercise authority over them .
40020026	It shall not be so among you , but whoever would become great among you will be your servant .
40020027	Whoever would be first among you will be your bondservant ,
40020028	even as the Son of Man came not to be served , but to serve , and to give his life as a ransom for many . "
40020029	As they went out from Jericho , a great multitude followed him .
40020030	Behold , two blind men sitting by the road , when they heard that Jesus was passing by , cried out , " Lord , have mercy on us , you son of David ! "
40020031	The multitude rebuked them , telling them that they should be quiet , but they cried out even more , " Lord , have mercy on us , you son of David ! "
40020032	Jesus stood still , and called them , and asked , " What do you want me to do for you ? "
40020033	They told him , " Lord , that our eyes may be opened . "
40020034	Jesus , being moved with compassion , touched their eyes ; and immediately their eyes received their sight , and they followed him .
40021001	When they drew near to Jerusalem , and came to Bethsphage , to the Mount of Olives , then Jesus sent two disciples ,
40021002	saying to them , " Go into the village that is opposite you , and immediately you will find a donkey tied , and a colt with her . Untie them , and bring them to me .
40021003	If anyone says anything to you , you will say , ' The Lord needs them , ' and immediately he will send them . "
40021004	All this was done , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet , saying ,
40021005	" Tell the daughter of Zion , Behold , your King comes to you , Humble , and riding on a donkey , On a colt , the foal of a donkey . "
40021006	The disciples went , and did just as Jesus commanded them ,
40021007	and brought the donkey and the colt , and laid their clothes on them ; and he sat on them .
40021008	A very great multitude spread their clothes on the road . Others cut branches from the trees , and spread them on the road .
40021009	The multitudes who went before him , and who followed , cried , " Hosanna to the son of David ! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord ! Hosanna in the highest ! "
40021010	When he had come into Jerusalem , all the city was stirred , saying , " Who is this ? "
40021011	The multitudes said , " This is the prophet , Jesus , from Nazareth of Galilee . "
40021012	Jesus entered into the temple of God , and drove out all of those who sold and bought in the temple , and overthrew the money-changers ' tables , and the seats of those who sold the doves .
40021013	He said to them , " It is written , ' My house will be called a house of prayer , ' but you have made it a den of robbers ! "
40021014	The blind and the lame came to him in the temple , and he healed them .
40021015	But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did , and the children who were crying in the temple and saying , " Hosanna to the son of David ! " they were moved with indignation ,
40021016	and said to him , " Do you hear what these are saying ? " Jesus said to them , " Yes . Did you never read , ' Out of the mouth of babes and nursing babies you have perfected praise ? ' "
40021017	He left them , and went forth out of the city to Bethany , and lodged there .
40021018	Now in the morning , as he returned to the city , he was hungry .
40021019	Seeing a fig tree by the road , he came to it , and found nothing on it but leaves . He said to it , " Let there be no fruit from you forever ! " Immediately the fig tree withered away .
40021020	When the disciples saw it , they marveled , saying , " How did the fig tree immediately wither away ? "
40021021	Jesus answered them , " Most assuredly I tell you , if you have faith , and don't doubt , you will not only do what is done to the fig tree , but even if you will tell this mountain , ' Be taken up and cast into the sea , ' it will be done .
40021022	All things , whatever you will ask in prayer , believing , you will receive . "
40021023	When he had come into the temple , the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching , and said , " By what authority do you do these things ? Who gave you this authority ? "
40021024	Jesus answered them , " I also will ask you one question , which if you tell me , I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things .
40021025	The baptism of John , where was it from ? From heaven or from men ? " They reasoned with themselves , saying , " If we will say , ' From heaven , ' he will tell us , ' Why then did you not believe him ? '
40021026	But if we will say , ' From men , ' we fear the multitude , for all hold John as a prophet . "
40021027	They answered Jesus , and said , " We don't know . " He also said to them , " Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things .
40021028	But what do you think ? A man had two sons , and he came to the first , and said , ' Son , go work today in my vineyard . '
40021029	He answered , ' I will not , ' but afterward he repented himself , and went .
40021030	He came to the second , and said likewise . He answered , ' I go , sir , ' but he didn't go .
40021031	Which of the two did the will of his father ? " They said to him , " The first . " Jesus says to them , " Most assuredly I tell you , that the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering into the kingdom of God before you .
40021032	For John came to you in the way of righteousness , and you didn't believe him , but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him . When you saw it , you didn't even repent afterward , that you might believe him .
40021033	" Hear another parable . There was a man who was a master of a household , who planted a vineyard , set a hedge about it , dug a winepress in it , built a tower , leased it out to farmers , and went into another country .
40021034	When the season of the fruits drew near , he sent his servants to the farmers , to receive his fruits .
40021035	The farmers took his servants , beat one , killed another , and stoned another .
40021036	Again , he sent other servants more than the first : and they did to them in like manner .
40021037	But afterward he sent to them his son , saying , ' They will respect my son . '
40021038	But the farmers , when they saw the son , said among themselves , ' This is the heir . Come , let's kill him , and seize his inheritance . '
40021039	So they took him , and threw him out of the vineyard , and killed him .
40021040	When therefore the lord of the vineyard will come , what will he do to those farmers ? "
40021041	They told him , " He will miserably destroy those miserable men , and will lease out the vineyard to other farmers , who will give him the fruits in their seasons . "
40021042	Jesus said to them , " Did you never read in the scriptures , ' The stone which the builders rejected , The same was made the head of the corner . This was from the Lord . It is marvelous in our eyes ? '
40021043	" Therefore I tell you , the kingdom of God will be taken away from you , and will be given to a nation bringing forth its fruits .
40021044	He who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces , but on whoever it will fall , it will scatter him as dust . "
40021045	When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables , they perceived that he spoke of them .
40021046	When they sought to lay hold on him , they feared the multitudes , because they took him for a prophet .
40022001	Jesus answered and spoke again in parables to them , saying ,
40022002	" The Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king , who made a marriage feast for his son ,
40022003	and sent forth his servants to call those who were invited to the marriage feast , but they would not come .
40022004	Again he sent forth other servants , saying , ' Tell those who are invited , " Behold , I have made ready my dinner . My oxen and my fatlings are killed , and all things are ready . Come to the marriage feast . " '
40022005	But they made light of it , and went their ways , one to his own farm , another to his merchandise ,
40022006	and the rest grabbed his servants , and treated them shamefully , and killed them .
40022007	But the king was angry , and he sent his armies , destroyed those murderers , and burned their city .
40022008	Then he said to his servants , ' The wedding is ready , but they who were invited were not worthy .
40022009	Go therefore to the intersections of the highways , and as many as you may find , invite to the marriage feast . '
40022010	Those servants went out into the highways , and gathered together as many as they found , both bad and good . The wedding was filled with guests .
40022011	But when the king came in to see the guests , he saw there a man who didn't have on wedding-clothing ,
40022012	and he said to him , ' Friend , how did you come in here not having wedding-clothing ? ' He was speechless .
40022013	Then the king said to the servants , ' Bind him hand and foot , take him away , and throw him into the outer darkness ; there is where the weeping and grinding of teeth will be . '
40022014	For many are called , but few chosen . "
40022015	Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how they might entrap him in his talk .
40022016	They sent their disciples to him , along with the Herodians , saying , " Teacher , we know that you are honest , and teach the way of God in truth , no matter who you teach , for you aren't partial to anyone .
40022017	Tell us therefore , what do you think ? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar , or not ? "
40022018	But Jesus perceived their wickedness , and said , " Why do you test me , you hypocrites ?
40022019	Show me the tax money . " They brought to him a denarius .
40022020	He asked them , " Whose is this image and inscription ? "
40022021	They said to him , " Caesar's . " Then he said to them , " Give therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's , and to God the things that are God's . "
40022022	When they heard it , they marveled , and left him , and went away .
40022023	On that day Sadducees ( those who say that there is no resurrection ) came to him . They asked him ,
40022024	saying , " Teacher , Moses said , ' If a man dies , having no children , his brother will marry his wife , and raise up seed for his brother . '
40022025	Now there were with us seven brothers . The first married and died , and having no seed left his wife to his brother .
40022026	In like manner the second also , and the third , to the seventh .
40022027	After them all , the woman died .
40022028	In the resurrection therefore , whose wife will she be of the seven ? For they all had her . "
40022029	But Jesus answered them , " You are mistaken , not knowing the scriptures , nor the power of God .
40022030	For in the resurrection they neither marry , nor are given in marriage , but are like God's angels in heaven .
40022031	But concerning the resurrection of the dead , haven't you read that which was spoken to you by God , saying ,
40022032	' I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ? ' God is not the God of the dead , but of the living . "
40022033	When the multitudes heard it , they were astonished at his teaching .
40022034	But the Pharisees , when they heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence , gathered themselves together .
40022035	One of them , a lawyer , asked him a question , testing him .
40022036	" Teacher , which is the greatest commandment in the law ? "
40022037	Jesus said to him , " ' You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart , and with all your soul , and with all your mind . '
40022038	This is the first and great commandment .
40022039	A second likewise is this , ' You shall love your neighbor as yourself . '
40022040	The whole law and the prophets depend on these two commandments . "
40022041	Now while the Pharisees were gathered together , Jesus asked them a question ,
40022042	saying , " What do you think of the Christ ? Whose son is he ? " They said to him , " Of David . "
40022043	He said to them , " How then does David in the Spirit call him Lord , saying ,
40022044	' The Lord said to my Lord , Sit on my right hand , Until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet ? '
40022045	" If then David calls him Lord , how is he his son ? "
40022046	No one was able to answer him a word , neither dared any man from that day forth ask him any more questions .
40023001	Then Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to his disciples ,
40023002	saying , " The scribes and the Pharisees sat on Moses ' seat .
40023003	All things therefore whatever they tell you to observe , observe and do , but don't do their works ; for they say , and don't do .
40023004	For they bind heavy burdens that are grievous to be borne , and lay them on men's shoulders ; but they themselves will not lift a finger to help them .
40023005	But all their works they do to be seen by men . They make their phylacteries broad , enlarge the fringes of their garments ,
40023006	and love the chief place at feasts , the chief seats in the synagogues ,
40023007	the salutations in the marketplaces , and to be called ' Rabbi , Rabbi ' by men .
40023008	But don't you be called ' Rabbi , ' for one is your teacher , the Christ , and all of you are brothers .
40023009	Call no man on the earth your father , for one is your Father , he who is in heaven .
40023010	Neither be called masters , for one is your master , the Christ .
40023011	But he who is greatest among you will be your servant .
40023012	Whoever will exalt himself will be humbled , and whoever will humble himself will be exalted .
40023013	" Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! For you devour widows ' houses , and as a pretense you make long prayers . Therefore you will receive greater condemnation .
40023014	" But woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! Because you shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against men ; for you don't enter in yourselves , neither do you allow those who are entering in to enter .
40023015	Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! For you travel around by sea and land to make one proselyte ; and when he becomes one , you make him twice as much of a son of Gehenna as yourselves .
40023016	Woe to you , you blind guides , who say , ' Whoever swears by the temple , it is nothing ; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple , he is a debtor . '
40023017	You blind fools ! For which is greater , the gold , or the temple that sanctifies the gold ?
40023018	' Whoever will swear by the altar , it is nothing ; but whoever will swear by the gift that is on it , he is a debtor . '
40023019	You blind fools ! For which is greater , the gift , or the altar that sanctifies the gift ?
40023020	He therefore who swears by the altar , swears by it , and by everything on it .
40023021	He who swears by the temple , swears by it , and by him who is living in it .
40023022	He who swears by the heaven , swears by the throne of God , and by him who sits on it .
40023023	Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! For you tithe mint , dill , and cumin , and have left undone the weightier matters of the law - justice , mercy , and faith . But you ought to have done these , and not to have left the other undone .
40023024	You blind guides , who strain out a gnat , and swallow a camel !
40023025	Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! For you clean the outside of the cup and of the platter , but within they are full of extortion and unrighteousness .
40023026	You blind Pharisee , first clean the inside of the cup and of the platter , that the outside of it may become clean also .
40023027	Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! For you are like whitened tombs , which outwardly appear beautiful , but inwardly are full of dead men's bones , and of all uncleanness .
40023028	Even so you also outwardly appear righteous to men , but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity .
40023029	Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! For you build the tombs of the prophets , and decorate the tombs of the righteous ,
40023030	and say , ' If we had been in the days of our fathers , we should not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets . '
40023031	Therefore you testify to yourselves that you are sons of those who killed the prophets .
40023032	Fill up , then , the measure of your fathers .
40023033	You serpents , you offspring of vipers , how will you escape the judgment of Gehenna ?
40023034	Therefore , behold , I send to you prophets , wise men , and scribes . Some of them will you kill and crucify ; and some of them will you scourge in your synagogues , and persecute from city to city ;
40023035	that on you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth , from the blood of Abel the righteous to the blood of Zachariah son of Barachiah , whom you killed between the sanctuary and the altar .
40023036	Most assuredly I tell you , all these things will come on this generation .
40023037	" Jerusalem , Jerusalem , that kills the prophets , and stones those who are sent to her ! How often would I have gathered your children together , even as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings , and you would not !
40023038	Behold , your house is left to you desolate .
40023039	For I tell you , you will not see me from now on , until you will say , ' Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord . ' "
40024001	Jesus went out from the temple , and was going on his way . His disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple .
40024002	But he answered them , " Don't you see all of these things ? Most assuredly I tell you , there will not be left here one stone on another , that will not be thrown down . "
40024003	As he sat on the Mount of Olives , the disciples came to him privately , saying , " Tell us , when will these things be ? What is the sign of your coming , and of the end of the world ? "
40024004	Jesus answered them , " Be careful that no one leads you astray .
40024005	For many will come in my name , saying , ' I am the Christ , ' and will lead many astray .
40024006	You will hear of wars and rumors of wars . See that you aren't troubled , for all this must happen , but the end is not yet .
40024007	For nation will rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom ; and there will be famines , plagues , and earthquakes in various places .
40024008	But all these things are the beginning of birth pains .
40024009	Then they will deliver you up to oppression , and will kill you . You will be hated by all of the nations for my name's sake .
40024010	Then will many stumble , and will deliver up one another , and will hate one another .
40024011	Many false prophets will arise , and will lead many astray .
40024012	Because iniquity will be multiplied , the love of many will grow cold .
40024013	But he who endures to the end , the same will be saved .
40024014	This gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world for a testimony to all the nations , and then the end will come .
40024015	When , therefore , you see the abomination of desolation , which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet , standing in the holy place ( let the reader understand ) ,
40024016	then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains .
40024017	Let him who is on the housetop not go down to take out things that are in his house .
40024018	Let him who is in the field not return back to take his cloak .
40024019	But woe to those who are with child and to nursing mothers in those days !
40024020	Pray that your flight will not be in the winter , nor on a Sabbath ,
40024021	for then will be great oppression , such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now , no , nor ever will be .
40024022	Except those days had been shortened , no flesh would have been saved . But for the elect's sake , those days will be shortened .
40024023	Then if any man will tell you , ' Behold , here is the Christ , ' or , ' There , ' don't believe it .
40024024	For there will arise false Christs , and false prophets , and they will show great signs and wonders , so as to lead astray , if possible , even the elect .
40024025	Behold , I have told you beforehand .
40024026	If therefore they tell you , ' Behold , he is in the wilderness ! ' don't go out ; ' Behold , he is in the inner chambers , ' don't believe it .
40024027	For as the lightning comes forth from the east , and is seen even to the west , so will be the coming of the Son of Man .
40024028	For wherever the carcass is , there will the vultures be gathered together .
40024029	But immediately after the oppression of those days , the sun will be darkened , the moon will not give her light , the stars will fall from the sky , and the powers of the heavens will be shaken ;
40024030	and then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky . Then all the tribes of the earth will mourn , and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory .
40024031	He will send forth his angels with a great sound of a trumpet , and they will gather together his elect from the four winds , from one end of the sky to the other .
40024032	" Now from the fig tree learn her parable . When its branch has now become tender , and puts forth its leaves , you know that the summer is near .
40024033	Even so you also , when you see all these things , know that it is near , even at the doors .
40024034	Most assuredly I tell you , this generation will not pass away , until all these things are accomplished .
40024035	Heaven and earth will pass away , but my words will not pass away .
40024036	But no one knows of that day and hour , not even the angels of heaven , but my Father only .
40024037	As the days of Noah , so will be the coming of the Son of Man .
40024038	For as in those days which were before the flood they were eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , until the day that Noah entered into the ark ,
40024039	and they didn't know until the flood came , and took them all away , so will be the coming of the Son of Man .
40024040	Then will two men be in the field : one is taken , and one is left ;
40024041	two women grinding at the mill , one is taken , and one is left .
40024042	Watch therefore , for you don't know in what hour your Lord comes .
40024043	But know this , that if the master of the house had known in what watch the thief was coming , he would have watched , and would not have allowed his house to be broken into .
40024044	Therefore also be ready , for in an hour that you don't expect , the Son of Man will come .
40024045	Who then is the faithful and wise servant , whom his lord has set over his household , to give them their food in due season ?
40024046	Blessed is that servant , whom his lord will find doing so when he comes .
40024047	Most assuredly I tell you , that he will set him over all that he has .
40024048	But if that evil servant should say in his heart , ' My lord is delaying his coming , '
40024049	and began to beat his fellow-servants , and eat and drink with the drunken ,
40024050	the lord of that servant will come in a day when he doesn't expect it , and in an hour when he doesn't know it ,
40024051	and will cut him in pieces , and appoint his portion with the hypocrites ; there is where the weeping and grinding of teeth will be .
40025001	" Then the Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten virgins , who took their lamps , and went forth to meet the bridegroom .
40025002	Five of them were foolish , and five were wise .
40025003	Those who were foolish , when they took their lamps , took no oil with them ,
40025004	but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps .
40025005	Now while the bridegroom delayed , they all slumbered and slept .
40025006	But at midnight there was a cry , ' Behold ! The bridegroom is coming ! Come out to meet him ! '
40025007	Then all those virgins arose , and trimmed their lamps .
40025008	The foolish said to the wise , ' Give us some of your oil , for our lamps are going out . '
40025009	But the wise answered , saying , ' What if there will not be enough for us and you ? You go rather to those who sell , and buy for yourselves . '
40025010	While they went away to buy , the bridegroom came , and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast , and the door was shut .
40025011	Afterward the other virgins also came , saying , ' Lord , Lord , open to us . '
40025012	But he answered , ' Most assuredly I tell you , I don't know you . '
40025013	Watch therefore , for you don't know the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man is coming .
40025014	" For it is like a man , going into another country , who called his own servants , and delivered his goods to them .
40025015	To one he gave five talents , to another two , to another one ; to each according to his own ability , and he went on his journey .
40025016	Immediately he who received the five talents went and traded with them , and made another five talents .
40025017	In like manner he also who got the two gained another two .
40025018	But he who received the one went away and dug in the earth , and hid his lord's money .
40025019	Now after a long time the lord of those servants came , and reconciled accounts with them .
40025020	He who received the five talents came and brought another five talents , saying , ' Lord , you delivered to me five talents . Behold , I have gained another five talents besides them . '
40025021	His lord said to him , ' Well done , good and faithful servant . You have been faithful over a few things , I will set you over many things . Enter into the joy of your lord . '
40025022	He also who got the two talents came and said , ' Lord , you delivered to me two talents . Behold , I have gained another two talents besides them . '
40025023	His lord said to him , ' Well done , good and faithful servant . You have been faithful over a few things , I will set you over many things . Enter into the joy of your lord . '
40025024	He also who had received the one talent came and said , ' Lord , I knew you that you are a hard man , reaping where you did not sow , and gathering where you did not scatter .
40025025	I was afraid , and went away and hid your talent in the earth . Behold , you have your own . '
40025026	But his lord answered him , ' You wicked and slothful servant . You knew that I reap where I didn't sow , and gather where I didn't scatter .
40025027	You ought therefore to have deposited my money with the bankers , and at my coming I should have received back my own with interest .
40025028	Take away therefore the talent from him , and give it to him who has the ten talents .
40025029	For to everyone who has will be given , and he will have abundance , but from him who has not , even that which he has will be taken away .
40025030	Throw out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness ; there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth . '
40025031	" But when the Son of Man comes in his glory , and all the holy angels with him , then will he sit on the throne of his glory .
40025032	Before him all the nations will be gathered , and he will separate them one from another , as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats .
40025033	He will set the sheep on his right hand , but the goats on the left .
40025034	Then the King will tell them on his right hand , ' Come , blessed of my Father , inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world ;
40025035	for I was hungry , and you gave me food to eat ; I was thirsty , and you gave me drink ; I was a stranger , and you took me in ;
40025036	naked , and you clothed me ; I was sick , and you visited me ; I was in prison , and you came to me . '
40025037	Then the righteous will answer him , saying , ' Lord , when did we see you hungry , and feed you ; or thirsty , and give you a drink ?
40025038	When did we see you as a stranger , and take you in ; or naked , and clothe you ?
40025039	When did we see you sick , or in prison , and come to you ? '
40025040	The King will answer them , ' Most assuredly I tell you , inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers , you did it to me . '
40025041	Then will he say also to them on the left hand , ' Depart from me , you cursed , into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels ;
40025042	for I was hungry , and you didn't give me food to eat ; I was thirsty , and you gave me no drink ;
40025043	I was a stranger , and you didn't take me in ; naked , and you didn't clothe me ; sick , and in prison , and you didn't visit me . '
40025044	Then will they also answer , saying , ' Lord , when did we see you hungry , or thirsty , or a stranger , or naked , or sick , or in prison , and did not help you ? '
40025045	Then will he answer them , saying , ' Most assuredly I tell you , inasmuch as you didn't do it to one of these least , you didn't do it to me . '
40025046	These will go away into eternal punishment , but the righteous into eternal life . "
40026001	It happened , when Jesus had finished all these words , that he said to his disciples ,
40026002	" You know that after two days the Passover is coming , and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified . "
40026003	Then the chief priests , the scribes , and the elders of the people were gathered together in the court of the high priest , who was called Caiaphas .
40026004	They took counsel together that they might take Jesus by deceit , and kill him .
40026005	But they said , " Not during the feast , lest a riot occur among the people . "
40026006	Now when Jesus was in Bethany , in the house of Simon the leper ,
40026007	a woman came to him having an alabaster jar of very expensive ointment , and she poured it on his head as he sat at the table .
40026008	But when his disciples saw it , they were indignant , saying , " Why this waste ?
40026009	For this ointment might have been sold for much , and given to the poor . "
40026010	But Jesus , knowing this , said to them , " Why do you trouble the woman ? For she has done a good work for me .
40026011	For you always have the poor with you ; but you don't always have me .
40026012	For in that she poured this ointment on my body , she did it to prepare me for burial .
40026013	Most assuredly I tell you , wherever this gospel will be preached in the whole world , what this woman has done will also be spoken of for a memorial of her . "
40026014	Then one of the twelve , who was called Judas Iscariot , went to the chief priests ,
40026015	and said , " What are you willing to give me , and I will deliver him to you ? " They weighed out for him thirty pieces of silver .
40026016	From that time he sought opportunity to betray him .
40026017	Now on the first day of unleavened bread , the disciples came to Jesus , saying to him , " Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover ? "
40026018	He said , " Go into the city to a certain person , and tell him , ' The Teacher says , " My time is at hand . I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples . " ' "
40026019	The disciples did as Jesus commanded them , and they prepared the Passover .
40026020	Now when evening had come , he was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples .
40026021	As they were eating , he said , " Most assuredly I tell you , that one of you will betray me . "
40026022	They were exceedingly sorrowful , and each began to ask him , " It isn't me , is it , Lord ? "
40026023	He answered , " He who dipped his hand with me in the dish , the same will betray me .
40026024	The Son of Man goes , even as it is written of him , but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed ! It would be better for that man if he had not been born . "
40026025	Judas , who betrayed him , answered , " It isn't me , is it , Rabbi ? " He said to him , " So you have said . "
40026026	As they were eating , Jesus took bread , gave thanks for it , and broke it . He gave to the disciples , and said , " Take , eat ; this is my body . "
40026027	He took the cup , gave thanks , and gave to them , saying , " Drink all of it ,
40026028	for this is my blood of the new covenant , which is poured out for many for the remission of sins .
40026029	But I tell you that I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on , until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father's kingdom . "
40026030	When they had sung a hymn , they went out to the Mount of Olives .
40026031	Then Jesus said to them , " All of you will be offended by me tonight , for it is written , ' I will strike the shepherd , and the sheep of the flock will be scattered abroad . '
40026032	But after I am raised up , I will go before you into Galilee . "
40026033	But Peter answered him , " Even if all will be offended by you , I will never be offended . "
40026034	Jesus said to him , " Most assuredly I tell you , that tonight , before the cock crows , you will deny me three times . "
40026035	Peter said to him , " Even if I must die with you , I will not deny you . " All of the disciples also said likewise .
40026036	Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane , and said to his disciples , " Sit here , while I go there and pray . "
40026037	He took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee , and began to be sorrowful and severely troubled .
40026038	Then he said to them , " My soul is exceedingly sorrowful , even to death . Stay here , and watch with me . "
40026039	He went forward a little , fell on his face , and prayed , saying , " My Father , if it is possible , let this cup pass away from me ; nevertheless , not what I want , but what you want . "
40026040	He came to the disciples , and found them sleeping , and said to Peter , " What , couldn't you watch with me for one hour ?
40026041	Watch and pray , that you don't enter into temptation . The spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak . "
40026042	Again , a second time he went away , and prayed , saying , " My Father , if this cup can't pass away from me , unless I drink it , your will be done . "
40026043	He came again and found them sleeping , for their eyes were heavy .
40026044	He left them again , went away , and prayed a third time , saying the same words .
40026045	Then he came to his disciples , and said to them , " Sleep on now , and take your rest . Behold , the hour is at hand , and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
40026046	Arise , let us be going . Behold , he who betrays me is at hand . "
40026047	While he was still speaking , behold , Judas , one of the twelve , came , and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs , from the chief priest and elders of the people .
40026048	Now he who betrayed him gave them a sign , saying , " Whoever I will kiss , that is he . Take him . "
40026049	Immediately he came to Jesus , and said , " Hail , Rabbi ! " and kissed him .
40026050	Jesus said to him , " Friend , why are you here ? " Then they came and laid hands on Jesus , and took him .
40026051	Behold , one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand , and drew his sword , and struck the servant of the high priest , and struck off his ear .
40026052	Then Jesus said to him , " Put your sword back into its place , for all those who take the sword will die by the sword .
40026053	Or do you think that I can't ask my Father , and he would even now send me more than twelve legions of angels ?
40026054	How then would the scriptures be fulfilled that it must be so ? "
40026055	In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes , " Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to seize me ? I sat daily in the temple teaching , and you didn't arrest me .
40026056	But all this has happened , that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled . " Then all the disciples left him , and fled .
40026057	Those who had taken Jesus led him away to Caiaphas , the high priest , where the scribes and the elders were gathered together .
40026058	But Peter followed him from a distance , to the court of the high priest , and entered in , and sat with the officers , to see the end .
40026059	Now the chief priests , the elders , and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus , that they might put him to death ;
40026060	and they found none . Even though many false witnesses came forward , they found none . But at last two false witnesses came forward ,
40026061	and said , " This man said , ' I am able to destroy the temple of God , and to build it in three days . ' "
40026062	The high priest stood up , and answered him , " Have you no answer ? What is this that these testify against you ? "
40026063	But Jesus held his peace . The high priest said to him , " I adjure you by the living God , that you tell us whether you are the Christ , the Son of God . "
40026064	Jesus said to him , " You have said it . Nevertheless , I tell you , henceforth you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power , and coming on the clouds of the sky . "
40026065	Then the high priest tore his clothing , saying , " He has spoken blasphemy ! Why do we need any more witnesses ? Behold , now you have heard his blasphemy .
40026066	What do you think ? " They answered , " He is worthy of death ! "
40026067	Then they spit in his face and beat him with their fists , and some slapped him ,
40026068	saying , " Prophesy to us , you Christ ! Who hit you ? "
40026069	Now Peter was sitting outside in the court , and a maid came to him , saying , " You were also with Jesus , the Galilean . "
40026070	But he denied before them all , saying , " I don't know what you are talking about . "
40026071	When he had gone out onto the porch , someone else saw him , and said to those who were there , " This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth . "
40026072	Again he denied with an oath , " I don't know the man . "
40026073	After a little while those who stood by came and said to Peter , " Surely you are also one of them , for your speech makes you known . "
40026074	Then began he to curse and to swear , " I don't know the man ! " Immediately the cock crowed .
40026075	Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said to him , " Before the cock crows , you will deny me three times . " He went out and wept bitterly .
40027001	Now when morning had come , all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death :
40027002	and they bound him , and led him away , and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate , the governor .
40027003	Then Judas , who betrayed him , when he saw that he was condemned , repented himself , and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders ,
40027004	saying , " I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood . " But they said , " What is that to us ? You see to it . "
40027005	He threw down the pieces of silver in the sanctuary , and departed . He went away and hanged himself .
40027006	The chief priests took the pieces of silver , and said , " It is not lawful to put them into the treasury , since it is the price of blood . "
40027007	They took counsel , and bought with them the potter's field , to bury strangers in .
40027008	Therefore that field was called " The Field of Blood " to this day .
40027009	Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled , saying , " They took the thirty pieces of silver , the price of him who was priced , whom some of the children of Israel did price ,
40027010	and they gave them for the potter's field , as the Lord commanded me . "
40027011	Now Jesus stood before the governor : and the governor asked him , saying , " Are you the King of the Jews ? " Jesus said to him , " So you say . "
40027012	When he was accused by the chief priests and elders , he answered nothing .
40027013	Then Pilate said to him , " Don't you hear how many things they testify against you ? "
40027014	He gave him no answer , not even one word , so that the governor marveled greatly .
40027015	Now at the feast the governor used to release to the multitude one prisoner , whom they wanted .
40027016	They had then a notable prisoner , called Barabbas .
40027017	When therefore they were gathered together , Pilate said to them , " Whom do you want me to release to you ? Barabbas , or Jesus , who is called Christ ? "
40027018	For he knew that because of envy they had delivered him up .
40027019	While he was sitting on the judgment seat , his wife sent to him , saying , " Have nothing to do with that righteous man , for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him . "
40027020	Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes that they should ask for Barabbas , and destroy Jesus .
40027021	But the governor answered them , " Which of the two do you want me to release to you ? " They said , " Barabbas ! "
40027022	Pilate said to them , " What then will I do to Jesus , who is called Christ ? " They all said to him , " Let him be crucified ! "
40027023	But the governor said , " Why ? What evil has he done ? " But they cried out exceedingly , saying , " Let him be crucified ! "
40027024	So when Pilate saw that nothing was gained , but rather that a disturbance was starting , he took water , and washed his hands before the multitude , saying , " I am innocent of the blood of this righteous person . You see to it . "
40027025	All the people answered , " May his blood be on us , and on our children ! "
40027026	Then he released to them Barabbas , but Jesus he flogged and delivered to be crucified .
40027027	Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium , and gathered to him the whole cohort .
40027028	They stripped him , and put a scarlet robe on him .
40027029	They braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head , and a reed in his right hand ; and they kneeled down before him , and mocked him , saying , " Hail , King of the Jews ! "
40027030	They spat on him , and took the reed and struck him on the head .
40027031	When they had mocked him , they took the robe off from him , and put his clothes on him , and led him away to crucify him .
40027032	As they came out , they found a man of Cyrene , Simon by name , and they compelled him to go with them , that he might carry his cross .
40027033	They came to a place called " Golgotha , " that is to say , " The place of a skull . "
40027034	They gave him sour wine to drink mixed with gall . When he had tasted it , he would not drink .
40027035	When they had crucified him , they divided his clothing among them , casting lots ,
40027036	and they sat and watched him there .
40027037	They set up over his head his accusation written , " THIS IS JESUS , THE KING OF THE JEWS . "
40027038	Then there were two robbers crucified with him , one on his right hand and one on the left .
40027039	Those who passed by blasphemed him , wagging their heads ,
40027040	and saying , " You who destroy the temple , and build it in three days , save yourself ! If you are the Son of God , come down from the cross ! "
40027041	Likewise the chief priests also mocking , with the scribes , the Pharisees , and the elders , said ,
40027042	" He saved others , but he can't save himself . If he is the King of Israel , let him come down from the cross now , and we will believe in him .
40027043	He trusts in God . Let him deliver him now , if he wants him ; for he said , ' I am the Son of God . ' "
40027044	The robbers also who were crucified with him cast on him the same reproach .
40027045	Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour .
40027046	About the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice , saying , " Eli , Eli , lama sabachthani ? " That is , " My God , my God , why have you forsaken me ? "
40027047	Some of them who stood there , when they heard it , said , " This man calls Elijah . "
40027048	Immediately one of them ran , and took a sponge , and filled it with vinegar , and put it on a reed , and gave him a drink .
40027049	The rest said , " Let him be . Let's see whether Elijah comes to save him . "
40027050	Jesus cried again with a loud voice , and yielded up his spirit .
40027051	Behold , the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom . The earth quaked and the rocks were split .
40027052	The tombs were opened , and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised ;
40027053	and coming forth out of the tombs after his resurrection , they entered into the holy city and appeared to many .
40027054	Now the centurion , and those who were with him watching Jesus , when they saw the earthquake , and the things that were done , feared exceedingly , saying , " Truly this was the Son of God . "
40027055	Many women were there watching from afar , who had followed Jesus from Galilee , serving him ,
40027056	among whom was Mary Magdalene , Mary the mother of James and Joses , and the mother of the sons of Zebedee .
40027057	When evening had come , there came a rich man from Arimathaea , named Joseph , who also himself was Jesus ' disciple .
40027058	This man went to Pilate , and asked for the body of Jesus . Then Pilate commanded the body to be given up .
40027059	Joseph took the body , and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth ,
40027060	and laid it in his own new tomb , which he had hewn out in the rock , and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb , and departed .
40027061	Mary Magdalene was there , and the other Mary , sitting opposite the tomb .
40027062	Now on the next day , which is the day after the Preparation , the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together to Pilate ,
40027063	saying , " Sir , we remember what that deceiver said while he was still alive : ' After three days I will rise again . '
40027064	Command therefore that the tomb be made secure until the third day , lest perhaps his disciples come at night and steal him away , and tell the people , ' He is risen from the dead ; ' and the last deception will be worse than the first . "
40027065	Pilate said to them , " You have a guard . Go , make it as secure as you can . "
40027066	So they went , and made the tomb secure , sealing the stone , the guard being with them .
40028001	Now after the Sabbath , as it began to dawn on the first day of the week , Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb .
40028002	Behold , there was a great earthquake , for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky , and came and rolled away the stone from the door , and sat on it .
40028003	His appearance was like lightning , and his clothing white as snow .
40028004	For fear of him , the guards shook , and became like dead men .
40028005	The angel answered the women , " Don't be afraid , for I know that you seek Jesus , who has been crucified .
40028006	He is not here , for he has risen , just like he said . Come , see the place where the Lord was lying .
40028007	Go quickly and tell his disciples , ' He has risen from the dead , and behold , he goes before you into Galilee ; there you will see him . ' Behold , I have told you . "
40028008	They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy , and ran to bring his disciples word .
40028009	As they went to tell his disciples , behold , Jesus met them , saying , " Rejoice ! " They came and took hold of his feet , and worshiped him .
40028010	Then Jesus said to them , " Don't be afraid . Go tell my brothers that they may go into Galilee , and there they will see me . "
40028011	Now while they were going , behold , some of the guards came into the city , and told the chief priests all the things that had happened .
40028012	When they were assembled with the elders , and had taken counsel , they gave a large amount of silver to the soldiers ,
40028013	saying , " Say that his disciples came by night , and stole him away while we slept .
40028014	If this comes to the governor's ears , we will persuade him and make you free of worry . "
40028015	So they took the money and did as they were told . This saying was spread abroad among the Jews , and continues until this day .
40028016	But the eleven disciples went into Galilee , to the mountain where Jesus had sent them .
40028017	When they saw him , they bowed down to him , but some doubted .
40028018	Jesus came to them and spoke to them , saying , " All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth .
40028019	Go , and make disciples of all nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit ,
40028020	teaching them to observe all things which I commanded you . Behold , I am with you always , even to the end of the age . " Amen .
41001001	The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ , the Son of God .
41001002	As it is written in the prophets , " Behold , I send my messenger before your face , Who will prepare your way before you .
41001003	The voice of one crying in the wilderness , ' Make ready the way of the Lord , Make his paths straight . ' "
41001004	John came baptizing in the wilderness and preaching the baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins .
41001005	There went out to him all the country of Judea , and all those of Jerusalem . They were baptized by him in the Jordan river , confessing their sins .
41001006	John was clothed with camel's hair and a leather belt around his loins . He ate locusts and wild honey .
41001007	He preached , saying , " After me comes he who is mightier than I , the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and loosen .
41001008	I baptized you in water , but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit . "
41001009	It happened in those days , that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee , and was baptized by John in the Jordan .
41001010	Immediately coming up from the water , he saw the heavens parting , and the Spirit descending on him like a dove .
41001011	A voice came out of the sky , " You are my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased . "
41001012	Immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness .
41001013	He was there in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan . He was with the wild animals . The angels ministered to him .
41001014	Now after John was taken into custody , Jesus came into Galilee , preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God ,
41001015	and saying , " The time is fulfilled , and the kingdom of God is at hand ! Repent , and believe in the gospel . "
41001016	Passing along by the sea of Galilee , he saw Simon and Andrew , the brother of Simon , casting a net in the sea , for they were fishermen .
41001017	Jesus said to them , " Come after me , and I will make you into fishers for men . "
41001018	Immediately they left their nets , and followed him .
41001019	Going on a little further from there , he saw James , the son of Zebedee , and John , his brother , who also were in the boat mending the nets .
41001020	Immediately he called them , and they left their father , Zebedee , in the boat with the hired servants , and went after him .
41001021	They went into Capernaum , and immediately on the Sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught .
41001022	They were astonished at his teaching , for he taught them as having authority , and not as the scribes .
41001023	Immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit , and he cried out ,
41001024	saying , " Ha ! What do we have to do with you , Jesus , you Nazarene ? Have you come to destroy us ? I know you who you are : the Holy One of God . "
41001025	Jesus rebuked him , saying , " Be quiet , and come out of him ! "
41001026	The unclean spirit , convulsing him and crying with a loud voice , came out of him .
41001027	They were all amazed , so that they questioned among themselves , saying , " What is this ? A new teaching ? For with authority he commands even the unclean spirits , and they obey him . "
41001028	The report of him went out immediately everywhere into all the region of Galilee and its surrounding area .
41001029	Immediately , when they had come out of the synagogue , they came into the house of Simon and Andrew , with James and John .
41001030	Now Simon's wife's mother lay sick with a fever , and immediately they told him about her .
41001031	He came and took her by the hand , and raised her up . The fever left her , and she served them .
41001032	At evening , when the sun had set , they brought to him all who were sick , and those who were possessed with demons .
41001033	All the city was gathered together at the door .
41001034	He healed many who were sick with various diseases , and cast out many demons . He didn't allow the demons to speak , because they knew him .
41001035	Early in the night , he rose up and went out , and departed into a desert place , and there prayed .
41001036	Simon and those who were with him followed after him ;
41001037	and they found him , and told him , " All are seeking you . "
41001038	He said to them , " Let's go elsewhere into the next towns , that I may preach there also , for to this end I came forth . "
41001039	He went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee , preaching and casting out demons .
41001040	There came to him a leper , begging him , kneeling down to him , and saying to him , " If you want to , you can make me clean . "
41001041	Being moved with compassion , he stretched forth his hand , and touched him , and said to him , " I want to . Be made clean . "
41001042	When he had said this , immediately the leprosy departed from him , and he was made clean .
41001043	He strictly charged him , and immediately sent him out ,
41001044	and said to him , " See you say nothing to anybody , but go show yourself to the priest , and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded , for a testimony to them . "
41001045	But he went out , and began to proclaim it much , and to spread about the matter , so that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city , but was outside in desert places : and they came to him from everywhere .
41002001	When he entered again into Capernaum after some days , it was heard that he was in the house .
41002002	Immediately many were gathered together , so that there was no more room , not even around the door ; and he spoke the word to them .
41002003	Four people came , carrying a paralytic to him .
41002004	When they could not come near to him for the crowd , they removed the roof where he was . When they had broken it up , they let down the mat that the paralytic was laying on .
41002005	Jesus , seeing their faith , said to the paralytic , " Son , your sins are forgiven you . "
41002006	But there were some of the scribes sitting there , and reasoning in their hearts ,
41002007	" Why does this man speak blasphemies like that ? He blasphemes ! Who can forgive sins but one - God ? "
41002008	Immediately Jesus , perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves , said to them , " Why do you reason these things in your hearts ?
41002009	Which is easier , to tell the paralytic , ' Your sins are forgiven ; ' or to say , ' Arise , and take up your bed , and walk ? '
41002010	But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins " - - he said to the paralytic ,
41002011	" I tell you , arise , take up your mat , and go to your house . "
41002012	He arose , and immediately took up the mat , and went out in front of them all ; so that they were all amazed , and glorified God , saying , " We never saw anything like this ! "
41002013	He went out again by the seaside . All the multitude came to him , and he taught them .
41002014	As he passed by , he saw Levi , the son of Alphaeus , sitting at the place of toll , and he said to him , " Follow me . " And he arose and followed him .
41002015	It happened , that he was reclining at the table in his house , and many tax collectors and sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples , for there were many , and they followed him .
41002016	The scribes and the Pharisees , when they saw that he was eating with the sinners and tax collectors , said to his disciples , " Why is it that he eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners ? "
41002017	When Jesus heard it , he said to them , " Those who are healthy have no need for a physician , but those who are sick . I came not to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance . "
41002018	John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting , and they came and asked him , " Why do John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast , but your disciples don't fast ? "
41002019	Jesus said to them , " Can the sons of the bride chamber fast , while the bridegroom is with them ? As long as they have the bridegroom with them , they can't fast .
41002020	But the days will come , when the bridegroom will be taken away from them , and then will they fast in that day .
41002021	No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment , or else the patch shrinks and the new tears away from the old , and a worse hole is made .
41002022	No one puts new wine into old wineskins , or else the new wine will burst the skins , and the wine pours out , and the skins will be destroyed ; but they put new wine into fresh wineskins . "
41002023	It happened , that he was going on the Sabbath day through the grain fields , and his disciples began , as they went , to pluck the ears of grain .
41002024	The Pharisees said to him , " Behold , why do they do that which is not lawful on the Sabbath day ? "
41002025	He said to them , " Did you never read what David did , when he had need , and was hungry , he , and they who were with him ?
41002026	How he entered into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest , and ate the show bread , which it is not lawful to eat except for the priests , and gave also to those who were with him ? "
41002027	He said to them , " The Sabbath was made for man , not man for the Sabbath .
41002028	Therefore the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath . "
41003001	He entered again into the synagogue , and there was a man there who had his hand withered .
41003002	They watched him , whether he would heal him on the Sabbath day , that they might accuse him .
41003003	He said to the man who had his hand withered , " Stand up . "
41003004	He said to them , " Is it lawful on the Sabbath day to do good , or to do harm ? To save a life , or to kill ? " But they were silent .
41003005	When he had looked around at them with anger , being grieved at the hardening of their hearts , he said to the man , " Stretch out your hand . " He stretched it out , and his hand was restored as healthy as the other .
41003006	The Pharisees went out , and immediately took counsel with the Herodians against him , how they might destroy him .
41003007	Jesus withdrew to the sea with his disciples , and a great multitude followed him from Galilee , from Judea ,
41003008	from Jerusalem , from Idumaea , beyond the Jordan , and those from around Tyre and Sidon . A great multitude , hearing what great things he did , came to him .
41003009	He spoke to his disciples , that a little boat should stay near him because of the crowd , so that they wouldn't press on him .
41003010	For he had healed many , so that as many as had diseases pressed on him that they might touch him .
41003011	The unclean spirits , whenever they saw him , fell down before him , and cried , " You are the Son of God ! "
41003012	He sternly warned them that they should not make him known .
41003013	He went up into the mountain , and called to himself whom he wanted , and they went to him .
41003014	He appointed twelve , that they might be with him , and that he might send them out to preach ,
41003015	and to have authority to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons :
41003016	Simon , to whom he gave the name Peter ;
41003017	James the son of Zebedee ; John , the brother of James , and them he surnamed Boanerges , which is , Sons of thunder ;
41003018	Andrew ; Philip ; Bartholomew ; Matthew ; Thomas ; James , the son of Alphaeus ; Thaddaeus ; Simon the Zealot ;
41003019	and Judas Iscariot , who also betrayed him . He came into a house .
41003020	The multitude came together again , so that they could not so much as eat bread .
41003021	When his friends heard it , they went out to lay hold on him : for they said , " He is insane . "
41003022	The scribes who came down from Jerusalem said , " He has Beelzebul , " and , " By the prince of the demons he casts out the demons . "
41003023	He called them to him , and said to them in parables , " How can Satan cast out Satan ?
41003024	If a kingdom is divided against itself , that kingdom cannot stand .
41003025	If a house is divided against itself , that house cannot stand .
41003026	If Satan has risen up against himself , and is divided , he can't stand , but has an end .
41003027	But no one can enter into the house of the strong man to plunder , unless he first binds the strong man ; and then he will plunder his house .
41003028	Most assuredly I tell you , all their sins will be forgiven to the sons of men , and their blasphemies with which they may blaspheme ;
41003029	but whoever may blaspheme against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness , but is guilty of an eternal sin "
41003030	- - because they said , " He has an unclean spirit . "
41003031	His mother and his brothers came , and standing outside , they sent to him , calling him .
41003032	A multitude was sitting around him , and they told him , " Behold , your mother , your brothers , and your sisters are outside looking for you . "
41003033	He answered them , " Who are my mother and my brothers ? "
41003034	Looking around at those who sat around him , he said , " Behold , my mother and my brothers !
41003035	For whoever may do the will of God , the same is my brother , and my sister , and mother . "
41004001	Again he began to teach by the seaside . A great multitude was gathered to him , so that he entered into a boat in the sea , and sat down . All the multitude were on the land by the sea .
41004002	He taught them many things in parables , and told them in his teaching ,
41004003	" Listen ! Behold , the farmer went forth to sow ,
41004004	and it happened , as he sowed , some seed fell by the road , and the birds came and devoured it .
41004005	Others fell on the rocky ground , where it had little soil , and immediately it sprang up , because it had no depth of soil .
41004006	When the sun had risen , it was scorched ; and because it had no root , it withered away .
41004007	Others fell among the thorns , and the thorns grew up , and choked it , and it yielded no fruit .
41004008	Others fell into the good ground , and yielded fruit , growing up and increasing . Some brought forth thirty times , some sixty times , and some one hundred times as much . "
41004009	He said , " Whoever has ears to hear , let him hear . "
41004010	When he was alone , those who were around him with the twelve asked him about the parables .
41004011	He said to them , " To you is given the mystery of the kingdom of God , but to those who are outside , all things are done in parables ,
41004012	that ' seeing they may see , and not perceive ; and hearing they may hear , and not understand ; lest perhaps they should turn again , and their sins should be forgiven them . ' "
41004013	He said to them , " Don't you understand this parable ? How will you understand all of the parables ?
41004014	The farmer sows the word .
41004015	These are they by the road , where the word is sown ; and when they have heard , immediately Satan comes , and takes away the word which has been sown in them .
41004016	These in like manner are those who are sown on the rocky places , who , when they have heard the word , immediately receive it with joy .
41004017	They have no root in themselves , but endure for a while , then , when oppression or persecution arises because of the word , immediately they stumble .
41004018	Others are those who are sown among the thorns . These are those who have heard the word ,
41004019	and the cares of this age , and the deceitfulness of riches , and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word , and it becomes unfruitful .
41004020	These are those who were sown on the good ground : such as hear the word , and accept it , and bear fruit , some thirty times , some sixty times , and some one hundred times . "
41004021	He said to them , " Is the lamp brought to be put under a basket or under the bed ? Isn't it put on the lampstand ?
41004022	For there is nothing hidden , except that it should be made known ; neither was anything made secret , but that it should come to light .
41004023	If any man has ears to hear , let him hear . "
41004024	He said to them , " Take heed what you hear . With whatever measure you measure , it will be measured to you , and more will be given to you who hear .
41004025	For whoever has , to him will more be given , and he who has not , from him will be taken away even that which he has . "
41004026	He said , " So is the kingdom of God , as if a man should cast seed on the earth ,
41004027	and should sleep and rise night and day , and the seed should spring up and grow , he doesn't know how .
41004028	For the earth bears fruit : first the blade , then the ear , then the full grain in the ear .
41004029	But when the fruit is ripe , immediately he puts forth the sickle , because the harvest has come . "
41004030	He said , " How will we liken the kingdom of God ? Or by what parable will we compare it ?
41004031	It is like a grain of mustard seed , which , when it is sown in the earth , though it is less than all the seeds that are on the earth ,
41004032	yet when it is sown , grows up , and becomes greater than all the herbs , and puts out great branches , so that the birds of the sky can lodge under its shadow . "
41004033	With many such parables he spoke the word to them , as they were able to hear it .
41004034	Without a parable he didn't speak to them ; but privately to his own disciples he explained all things .
41004035	On that day , when evening had come , he said to them , " Let's go over to the other side . "
41004036	Leaving the multitude , they took him with them , even as he was , in the boat . Other small boats were also with him .
41004037	There arose a great wind storm , and the waves beat into the boat , so much that the boat was already filled .
41004038	He himself was in the stern , asleep on the cushion , and they woke him up , and told him , " Teacher , don't you care that we are dying ? "
41004039	He awoke , and rebuked the wind , and said to the sea , " Peace . Be still . " The wind ceased , and there was a great calm .
41004040	He said to them , " Why are you so afraid ? How is it that you have no faith ? "
41004041	They were greatly afraid , and said to one another , " Who then is this , that even the wind and the sea obey him ? "
41005001	They came to the other side of the sea , into the country of the Gadarenes .
41005002	When he had come out of the boat , immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit ,
41005003	who had his dwelling in the tombs . Nobody could bind him any more , not even with chains ,
41005004	because he had been often bound with fetters and chains , and the chains had been torn apart by him , and the fetters broken in pieces . Nobody had the strength to tame him .
41005005	Always , night and day , in the tombs and in the mountains , he was crying out , and cutting himself with stones .
41005006	When he saw Jesus from afar , he ran and bowed down to him ,
41005007	and crying out with a loud voice , he said , " What have I to do with you , Jesus , you Son of the Most High God ? I adjure you by God , don't torment me . "
41005008	For he said to him , " Come out of the man , you unclean spirit ! "
41005009	He asked him , " What is your name ? " He said to him , " My name is Legion , for we are many . "
41005010	He begged him much that he would not send them away out of the country .
41005011	Now there was there on the mountainside a great herd of pigs feeding .
41005012	All the demons begged him , saying , " Send us into the pigs , that we may enter into them . "
41005013	At once Jesus gave them permission . The unclean spirits came out , and entered into the pigs . The herd of about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea , and they were drowned in the sea .
41005014	Those who fed them fled , and told it in the city , and in the country . The people came to see what it was that had happened .
41005015	They came to Jesus , and saw him who was possessed by demons sitting , clothed and in his right mind , even him who had the legion ; and they were afraid .
41005016	Those who saw it declared to them how it happened to him who was possessed by demons , and about the pigs .
41005017	They began to beg him to depart from their borders .
41005018	As he was entering into the boat , he who had been possessed by demons begged him that he might be with him .
41005019	He didn't allow him , but said to him , " Go to your house , to your friends , and tell them how the Lord has done great things for you , and how he had mercy on you . "
41005020	He went his way , and began to proclaim in Decapolis how Jesus had done great things for him , and everyone marveled .
41005021	When Jesus had crossed back over in the boat to the other side , a great multitude was gathered to him ; and he was by the sea .
41005022	Behold , one of the rulers of the synagogue , Jairus by name , came ; and seeing him , he fell at his feet ,
41005023	and begged him much , saying , " My little daughter is at the point of death . Please come and lay your hands on her , that she may be made healthy , and live . "
41005024	He went with him , and a great multitude followed him , and they pressed upon him on all sides .
41005025	A certain woman , who had an issue of blood for twelve years ,
41005026	and had suffered many things by many physicians , and had spent all that she had , and was no better , but rather grew worse ,
41005027	having heard the things concerning Jesus , came up behind him in the crowd , and touched his clothes .
41005028	For she said , " If I just touch his clothes , I will be made well . "
41005029	Immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up , and she felt in her body that she was healed of her plague .
41005030	Immediately Jesus , perceiving in himself that the power had gone forth from him , turned around in the crowd , and asked , " Who touched my clothes ? "
41005031	His disciples said to him , " You see the multitude pressing against you , and you say , ' Who touched me ? ' "
41005032	He looked around to see her who had done this thing .
41005033	But the woman , fearing and trembling , knowing what had been done to her , came and fell down before him , and told him all the truth .
41005034	He said to her , " Daughter , your faith has made you well . Go in peace , and be cured of your disease . "
41005035	While he was still speaking , they came from the synagogue ruler's house saying , " Your daughter is dead . Why bother the Teacher any more ? "
41005036	But Jesus , not heeding the word spoken , immediately said to the ruler of the synagogue , " Don't be afraid , only believe . "
41005037	He allowed no one to follow him , except Peter , James , and John , the brother of James .
41005038	He came to the synagogue ruler's house , and he saw an uproar , weeping , and great wailing .
41005039	When he had entered in , he said to them , " Why do you make an uproar and weep ? The child is not dead , but is asleep . "
41005040	They laughed him to scorn . But he , having put them all out , took the father of the child and her mother and those who were with him , and went in where the child was lying .
41005041	Taking the child by the hand , he said to her , " Talitha cumi ; " which means , being interpreted , " Young lady , I tell you , get up . "
41005042	Immediately the young lady rose up , and walked , for she was twelve years old . They were amazed with great amazement .
41005043	He charged them much that no one should know this . He commanded that something should be given to her to eat .
41006001	He went out from there . He came into his own country , and his disciples followed him .
41006002	When the Sabbath had come , he began to teach in the synagogue , and many hearing him were astonished , saying , " Where did this man get these things ? " and , " What is the wisdom that is given to this man , that such mighty works come about by his hands ?
41006003	Isn't this the carpenter , the son of Mary , and brother of James , Joses , Judas , and Simon ? Aren't his sisters here with us ? " They were offended by him .
41006004	Jesus said to them , " A prophet is not without honor , except in his own country , and among his own relatives , and in his own house . "
41006005	He could do no mighty work there , except that he laid his hands on a few sick folk , and healed them .
41006006	He marveled because of their unbelief . He went around the villages teaching .
41006007	He called to himself the twelve , and began to send them out two by two ; and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits .
41006008	He charged them that they should take nothing for their journey , except a staff only : no bread , no wallet , no money in their purse ,
41006009	but to wear sandals , and not put on two tunics .
41006010	He said to them , " Wherever you enter into a house , stay there until you depart from there .
41006011	Whoever will not receive you nor hear you , as you depart from there , shake off the dust that is under your feet for a testimony against them . Assuredly , I tell you , it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city ! "
41006012	They went out , and preached that people should repent .
41006013	They cast out many demons , and anointed many with oil who were sick , and healed them .
41006014	King Herod heard this , for his name had become known , and he said , " John the Baptizer has risen from the dead , and therefore these powers work in him . "
41006015	But others said , " It is Elijah . " Others said , " It is the Prophet , or like one of the prophets . "
41006016	But Herod , when he heard this , said , " This is John , whom I beheaded . He has risen from the dead . "
41006017	For Herod himself had sent out and laid hold on John , and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias , his brother Philip's wife , for he had married her .
41006018	For John said to Herod , " It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife . "
41006019	Herodias set herself against him , and desired to kill him , but she couldn't ,
41006020	for Herod feared John , knowing that he was a righteous and holy man , and kept him safe . When he heard him , he did many things , and he heard him gladly .
41006021	When a convenient day had come , that Herod on his birthday made a supper for his lords , and the high captains , and the chief men of Galilee ;
41006022	and when the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced , she pleased Herod and those reclining with him . The king said to the young lady , " Ask me whatever you want , and I will give it to you . "
41006023	He swore to her , " Whatever you shall ask of me , I will give you , up to half of my kingdom . "
41006024	She went out , and said to her mother , " What shall I ask ? " She said , " The head of John the Baptizer . "
41006025	She came in immediately with haste to the king , and asked , " I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptizer on a platter . "
41006026	The king was exceedingly sorry , but for the sake of his oaths , and of his dinner guests , he didn't wish to refuse her .
41006027	Immediately the king sent forth a soldier of his guard , and commanded to bring John's head , and he went and beheaded him in the prison ,
41006028	and brought his head on a platter , and gave it to the young lady ; and the young lady gave it to her mother .
41006029	When his disciples heard this , they came and took up his corpse , and laid it in a tomb .
41006030	The apostles gathered themselves together to Jesus , and they told him all things , whatever they had done , and whatever they had taught .
41006031	He said to them , " You come apart into a desert place , and rest awhile . " For there were many coming and going , and they had no leisure so much as to eat .
41006032	They went away in the boat to a desert place by themselves .
41006033	They saw them going , and many recognized him and ran there on foot from all the cities . They arrived before them and came together to him .
41006034	Jesus came out , saw a great multitude , and he had compassion on them , because they were like sheep without a shepherd , and he began to teach them many things .
41006035	When it was late in the day , his disciples came to him , and said , " This place is a desert , and it is late in the day .
41006036	Send them away , that they may go into the surrounding country and villages , and buy themselves bread , for they have nothing to eat . "
41006037	But he answered them , " You give them something to eat . " They asked him , " Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread , and give them something to eat ? "
41006038	He said to them , " How many loaves do you have ? Go see . " When they knew , they said , " Five , and two fish . "
41006039	He commanded those that all should sit down by companies on the green grass .
41006040	They sat down in ranks , by hundreds and by fifties .
41006041	He took the five loaves and the two fish , and looking up to heaven , he blessed , and broke the loaves , and he gave to his disciples to set before them , and he divided the two fish among them all .
41006042	They all ate , and were filled .
41006043	They took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and also of the fish .
41006044	Those who ate the loaves were five thousand men .
41006045	Immediately he made his disciples enter into the boat , and to go ahead to the other side , to Bethsaida , while he himself sent the multitude away .
41006046	After he had taken leave of them , he departed into the mountain to pray .
41006047	When evening had come , the boat was in the midst of the sea , and he was alone on the land .
41006048	Seeing them distressed in rowing , for the wind was contrary to them ; and about the fourth watch of the night he came to them , walking on the sea , and he would have passed by them ,
41006049	but they , when they saw him walking on the sea , supposed that it was a ghost , and cried out ;
41006050	for they all saw him , and were troubled . But he immediately spoke with them , and said to them , " Cheer up ! It is I ! Don't be afraid . "
41006051	He went up to them into the boat ; and the wind ceased , and they were very amazed among themselves , and marveled .
41006052	for they hadn't understood about the loaves , but their hearts were hardened .
41006053	When they had crossed over , they came to the land to Gennesaret , and moored to the shore .
41006054	When they had come out of the boat , immediately the people recognized him ,
41006055	and ran around that whole region , and began to carry around those who were sick , on their mats , to where they heard he was .
41006056	Wherever he entered , into villages , or into cities , or into the country , they laid the sick in the marketplaces , and begged him that they might touch just the fringe of his garment ; and as many as touched him were made well .
41007001	Then the Pharisees , and some of the scribes gathered together to him , having come from Jerusalem .
41007002	Now when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled , that is , unwashed , hands , they found fault .
41007003	( For the Pharisees , and all the Jews , don't eat unless they wash their hands and forearms , holding to the tradition of the elders .
41007004	They don't eat when they come from the marketplace , unless they bathe themselves , and there are many other things , which they have received to hold to : washings of cups , pitchers , bronze vessels , and couches . )
41007005	The Pharisees and the scribes asked him , " Why don't your disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders , but eat their bread with unwashed hands ? "
41007006	He answered them , " Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites , as it is written , ' This people honors me with their lips , But their heart is far from me .
41007007	But in vain do they worship me , Teaching as doctrines the commandments of men . '
41007008	" For you set aside the commandment of God , and hold tightly to the tradition of men - - the washing of pitchers and cups , and you do many other such things . "
41007009	He said to them , " Full well do you reject the commandment of God , that you may keep your tradition .
41007010	For Moses said , ' Honor your father and your mother ; ' and , ' He who speaks evil of father or mother , let him be put to death . '
41007011	But you say , ' If a man will tell his father or his mother , " Whatever you might have been profited by me is Corban , that is to say , given to God ; " '
41007012	and you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother ,
41007013	making void the word of God by your tradition , which you have handed down . You do many things like this . "
41007014	He called all the multitude to himself , and said to them , " Hear me , all of you , and understand .
41007015	There is nothing from outside of the man , that going into him can defile him ; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man .
41007016	If anyone has ears to hear , let him hear ! "
41007017	When he had entered into the house from the multitude , his disciples asked him about the parable .
41007018	He said to them , " Are you so without understanding also ? Don't you perceive that whatever goes into the man from outside can't defile him ,
41007019	because it doesn't go into his heart , but into his belly , and into the latrine , thus making all foods clean ? "
41007020	He said , " That which proceeds out of the man , that defiles the man .
41007021	For from within , out of the hearts of men , proceed evil thoughts , adulteries , sexual sins , murders , thefts ,
41007022	covetings , wickedness , deceit , lustful desires , an evil eye , blasphemy , pride , and foolishness .
41007023	All these evil things proceed from within , and defile the man . "
41007024	From there he arose , and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon . He entered into a house , and wanted no one to know it , but he couldn't escape detection .
41007025	For a woman , whose little daughter had an unclean spirit , having heard of him , came and fell down at his feet .
41007026	Now the woman was a Greek , a Syrophoenician by race . She begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter .
41007027	But Jesus said to her , " Let the children be filled first , for it is not appropriate to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs . "
41007028	But she answered him , " Yes , Lord . For even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs . "
41007029	He said to her , " For this saying , go your way . The demon has gone out of your daughter . "
41007030	She went away to her house , and found the child laying on the bed , with the demon gone out .
41007031	Again he departed from the borders of Tyre and Sidon , and came to the sea of Galilee , through the midst of the borders of Decapolis .
41007032	They brought to him one who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech . They begged him to lay his hand on him .
41007033	He took him aside from the multitude , privately , and put his fingers into his ears , and he spat , and touched his tongue .
41007034	Looking up to heaven , he sighed , and said to him , " Ephphatha ! " that is , " Be opened ! "
41007035	Immediately his ears were opened , and the bond of his tongue was loosed , and he spoke clearly .
41007036	He charged them that they should tell no one , but the more he charged them , so much the more widely they proclaimed it .
41007037	They were astonished beyond measure , saying , " He has done all things well . He makes even the deaf hear , and the mute speak ! "
41008001	In those days , when there was a very great multitude , and they had nothing to eat , Jesus called his disciples to himself , and said to them ,
41008002	" I have compassion on the multitude , because they continue with me now three days , and have nothing to eat .
41008003	If I send them away fasting to their home , they will faint on the way , for some of them have come a long way . "
41008004	His disciples answered him , " From where will one be able to fill these men with bread here in a desert place ? "
41008005	He asked them , " How many loaves do you have ? " They said , " Seven . "
41008006	He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground , and he took the seven loaves . Having given thanks , he broke them , and gave them to his disciples to serve , and they served the multitude .
41008007	They had a few small fish . Having blessed them , he said to serve these also .
41008008	They ate , and were filled . They took up seven baskets of broken pieces that were left over .
41008009	Those who had eaten were about four thousand . Then he sent them away .
41008010	Immediately he entered into the boat with his disciples , and came into the region of Dalmanutha .
41008011	The Pharisees came out and began to question him , seeking a sign from heaven from him , and tempting him .
41008012	He sighed deeply in his spirit , and said , " Why does this generation seek a sign ? Most assuredly I tell you , there will no sign be given to this generation . "
41008013	He left them , and again entering into the boat , departed to the other side .
41008014	They forgot to take bread ; and they didn't have more than one loaf in the boat with them .
41008015	He charged them , saying , " Take heed : beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod . "
41008016	They reasoned with one another , saying , " It's because we have no bread . "
41008017	Jesus , perceiving it , said to them , " Why do you reason that it's because you have no bread ? Don't you perceive yet , neither understand ? Is your heart still hardened ?
41008018	Having eyes , don't you see ? Having ears , don't you hear ? Don't you remember ?
41008019	When I broke the five loaves among the five thousand , how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up ? " They told him , " Twelve . "
41008020	" When the seven loaves fed the four thousand , how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up ? " They told him , " Seven . "
41008021	He asked them , " Don't you understand , yet ? "
41008022	He came to Bethsaida . They brought a blind man to him , and begged him to touch him .
41008023	He took hold of the blind man by the hand , and brought him out of the village . When he had spit on his eyes , and laid his hands on him , he asked him if he saw anything .
41008024	He looked up , and said , " I see men ; for I see them like trees walking . "
41008025	Then again he laid his hands on his eyes . He looked intently , and was restored , and saw everyone clearly .
41008026	He sent him away to his house , saying , " Don't enter into the village , nor tell anyone in the village . "
41008027	Jesus went forth , with his disciples , into the villages of Caesarea Philippi . On the way he asked his disciples , " Who do men say that I am ? "
41008028	They told him , " John the Baptizer , and others , Elijah , but others , one of the prophets . "
41008029	He asked them , " But who do you say that I am ? " Peter answered , " You are the Christ . "
41008030	He charged them that they should tell no one about him .
41008031	He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things , and be rejected by the elders , the chief priests , and the scribes , and be killed , and after three days rise again .
41008032	He spoke to them openly . Peter took him , and began to rebuke him .
41008033	But he , turning around , and seeing his disciples , rebuked Peter , and said , " Get behind me , Satan ! For you have in mind not the things of God , but the things of men . "
41008034	He called the multitude to himself with his disciples , and said to them , " Whoever wants to come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
41008035	For whoever wants to save his life will lose it ; and whoever will lose his life for my sake and the gospel's will save it .
41008036	For what does it profit a man , to gain the whole world , and forfeit his life ?
41008037	For what should a man give in exchange for his life ?
41008038	For whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation , the Son of Man also will be ashamed of him , when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels . "
41009001	He said to them , " Most assuredly I tell you , there are some standing here who will in no way taste death , until they see the kingdom of God come with power . "
41009002	After six days Jesus took with him Peter , James , and John , and brought them up onto a high mountain privately by themselves , and he was changed into another form in front of them .
41009003	His clothing became glistening , exceedingly white , like snow , such as no launderer on earth can whiten them .
41009004	Elijah and Moses appeared to them , and they were talking with Jesus .
41009005	Peter answered Jesus , " Rabbi , it is good for us to be here . Let's make three tents : one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . "
41009006	For he didn't know what to say , for they were very afraid .
41009007	A cloud came , overshadowing them , and a voice came out of the cloud , " This is my beloved Son . Listen to him . "
41009008	Suddenly looking around , they saw no one with them any more , except Jesus only .
41009009	As they were coming down from the mountain , he charged them that they should tell no one what things they had seen , until the Son of Man had risen again from the dead .
41009010	They kept the saying , questioning among themselves what the rising again from the dead should mean .
41009011	They asked him , saying , " Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first ? "
41009012	He said to them , " Elijah indeed comes first , and restores all things . How is it written about the Son of Man , that he should suffer many things and be despised ?
41009013	But I tell you , that Elijah has come , and they have also done to him whatever they wanted to , even as it is written about him . "
41009014	Coming to the disciples , he saw a great multitude around them , and scribes questioning them .
41009015	Immediately all the multitude , when they saw him , were greatly amazed , and running to him greeted him .
41009016	He asked the scribes , " What are you asking them ? "
41009017	One of the multitude answered , " Teacher , I brought to you my son , who has a mute spirit ;
41009018	and wherever it seizes him , it dashes him down , and he foams at the mouth , and grinds his teeth , and wastes away . I asked your disciples to cast it out , and they weren't able . "
41009019	He answered them , " Unbelieving generation , how long will I be with you ? How long will I bear with you ? Bring him to me . "
41009020	They brought him to him , and when he saw him , immediately the spirit convulsed him , and he fell on the ground , wallowing and foaming at the mouth .
41009021	He asked his father , " How long has it been since this has come to him ? " He said , " From childhood .
41009022	Often it has cast him both into the fire and into the water , to destroy him . But if you can do anything , have compassion on us , and help us . "
41009023	Jesus said to him , " If you can believe ? All things are possible to him who believes . "
41009024	Immediately the father of the child cried out with tears , " I believe . Help my unbelief ! "
41009025	When Jesus saw that a multitude came running together , he rebuked the unclean spirit , saying to him , " You mute and deaf spirit , I command you , come out of him , and enter no more into him ! "
41009026	Having cried out , and convulsed him greatly , it came out . The boy became like one dead ; so much that most of them said , " He is dead . "
41009027	But Jesus took him by the hand , and raised him up ; and he arose .
41009028	When he had come into the house , his disciples asked him privately , " Why couldn't we cast it out ? "
41009029	He said to them , " This kind can come out by nothing , except by prayer and fasting . "
41009030	They went forth from there , and passed through Galilee . He didn't want anyone to know it .
41009031	For he taught his disciples , and said to them , " The Son of Man is delivered up into the hands of men , and they will kill him ; and when he is killed , on the third day he will rise again . "
41009032	But they didn't understand the saying , and were afraid to ask him .
41009033	He came to Capernaum , and when he was in the house he asked them , " What were you arguing among yourselves on the way ? "
41009034	But they were silent , for they had disputed one with another on the way about who was the greatest .
41009035	He sat down , and called the twelve ; and he said to them , " If any man wants to be first , he will be last of all , and servant of all . "
41009036	He took a little child , and set him in the midst of them . Taking him in his arms , he said to them ,
41009037	" Whoever receives one such little child in my name , receives me , and whoever receives me , doesn't receive me , but him who sent me . "
41009038	John said to him , " Teacher , we saw someone who doesn't follow us casting out demons in your name ; and we forbade him , because he doesn't follow us . "
41009039	But Jesus said , " Don't forbid him , for there is no one who will do a mighty work in my name , and be able quickly to speak evil of me .
41009040	For whoever is not against us is on our side .
41009041	For whoever will give you a cup of water to drink in my name , because you are Christ's , most assuredly I tell you , he will in no way lose his reward .
41009042	Whoever will cause one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble , it would be better for him if a millstone were hanged about his neck , and he were cast into the sea .
41009043	If your hand causes you to stumble , cut it off . It is better for you to enter into life maimed , rather than having your two hands to go into Gehenna , into the unquenchable fire ,
41009044	' where their worm doesn't die , and the fire is not quenched . '
41009045	If your foot causes you to stumble , cut it off . It is better for you to enter into life lame , rather than having your two feet to be cast into Gehenna , into the fire that will never be quenched - -
41009046	' where their worm doesn't die , and the fire is not quenched . '
41009047	If your eye causes you to stumble , cast it out . It is better for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye , rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna of fire ,
41009048	' where their worm doesn't die , and the fire is not quenched . '
41009049	For everyone will be salted with fire , and every sacrifice will be seasoned with salt .
41009050	Salt is good , but if the salt has lost its saltiness , with what will you season it ? Have salt in yourselves , and be at peace with one another . "
41010001	He arose from there and came into the borders of Judea and beyond the Jordan . Multitudes came together to him again . As he usually did , he taught them again .
41010002	There came to him Pharisees testing him , and asked him , " Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife ? "
41010003	He answered , " What did Moses command you ? "
41010004	They said , " Moses allowed a bill of divorce to be written , and to divorce her . "
41010005	But Jesus said to them , " For your hardness of heart , he wrote you this commandment .
41010006	But from the beginning of the creation , ' God made them male and female .
41010007	For this cause will a man leave his father and mother , and will join to his wife ,
41010008	and the two will become one flesh , ' so that they are no longer two , but one flesh .
41010009	What therefore God has joined together , let no man separate . "
41010010	In the house , his disciples asked him again about the same matter .
41010011	He said to them , " Whoever will divorce his wife , and marry another , commits adultery against her .
41010012	If a woman herself divorces her husband , and marries another , she commits adultery . "
41010013	They were bringing to him little children , that he should touch them , but the disciples rebuked those who were bringing them .
41010014	But when Jesus saw it , he was moved with indignation , and said to them , " Allow the little children to come to me ! Don't forbid them , for to such belong the kingdom of God .
41010015	Most assuredly I tell you , whoever will not receive the kingdom of God as a little child , he will in no way enter therein . "
41010016	He took them in his arms , and blessed them , laying his hands on them .
41010017	As he was going forth into the way , one ran to him , kneeled to him , and asked him , " Good Teacher , what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life ? "
41010018	Jesus said to him , " Why do you call me good ? No one is good except one - - God .
41010019	You know the commandments : ' Do not murder , ' ' Do not commit adultery , ' ' Do not steal , ' ' Do not give false testimony , ' ' Do not defraud , ' ' Honor your father and mother . ' "
41010020	He said to him , " Teacher , all these things have I observed from my youth . "
41010021	Jesus looking at him loved him , and said to him , " One thing you lack . Go , sell whatever you have , and give to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven ; and come , follow me , taking up the cross . "
41010022	But his face fell at that saying , and he went away sorrowful , for he was one who had great possessions .
41010023	Jesus looked around , and said to his disciples , " How difficult it is for those who have riches to enter into the kingdom of God ! "
41010024	The disciples were amazed at his words . But Jesus answered again , " Children , how hard is it for those who trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God !
41010025	It is easier for a camel to go through the needle's eye , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God . "
41010026	They were exceedingly astonished , saying to him , " Then who can be saved ? "
41010027	Jesus , looking at them , said , " With men it is impossible , but not with God , for all things are possible with God . "
41010028	Peter began to tell him , " Behold , we have left all , and have followed you . "
41010029	Jesus said , " Most assuredly I tell you , there is no one who has left house , or brothers , or sisters , or father , or mother , or wife , or children , or land , for my sake , and for the gospel's sake ,
41010030	but he will receive one hundred times now in this time , houses , brothers , sisters , mothers , children , and land , with persecutions ; and in the age to come eternal life .
41010031	But many who are first will be last ; and the last first . "
41010032	They were on the way , going up to Jerusalem ; and Jesus was going in front of them , and they were amazed ; and those who followed were afraid . He again took the twelve , and began to tell them the things that were going to happen to him .
41010033	" Behold , we are going up to Jerusalem . The Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes . They will condemn him to death , and will deliver him to the Gentiles .
41010034	They will mock him , spit on him , scourge him , and kill him . On the third day he will rise again . "
41010035	James and John , the sons of Zebedee , came near to him , saying , " Teacher , we want you to do for us whatever we will ask . "
41010036	He said to them , " What do you want me to do for you ? "
41010037	They said to him , " Grant to us that we may sit , one at your right hand , and one at your left hand , in your glory . "
41010038	But Jesus said to them , " You don't know what you ask . Are you able to drink the cup that I drink , and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ? "
41010039	They said to him , " We are able . " Jesus said to them , " You shall indeed drink the cup that I drink , and you shall be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ;
41010040	but to sit at my right hand and at my left hand is not mine to give , but for whom it has been prepared . "
41010041	When the ten heard it , they began to be moved with indignation towards James and John .
41010042	Jesus called them to him , and said to them , " You know that they who are recognized as rulers over the Gentiles lord it over them , and their great ones exercise authority over them .
41010043	But it shall not be so among you , but whoever wants to become great among you , will be your servant .
41010044	Whoever of you wants to become first among you , shall be servant of all .
41010045	For the Son of Man also came not to be served , but to serve , and to give his life as a ransom for many . "
41010046	They came to Jericho . As he went out from Jericho , with his disciples and a great multitude , the son of Timaeus , Bartimaeus , a blind beggar , was sitting by the road .
41010047	When he heard that it was Jesus , the Nazarene , he began to cry out , and say , " Jesus , you son of David , have mercy on me ! "
41010048	Many rebuked him , that he should be quiet , but he cried out the more a great deal , " You son of David , have mercy on me ! "
41010049	Jesus stood still , and said , " Call him . " They called the blind man , saying to him , " Cheer up ! Get up . He is calling you . "
41010050	He , casting away his cloak , sprang up , and came to Jesus .
41010051	Jesus answered him , " What do you want me to do for you ? " The blind man said to him , " Rhabboni , that I may see again . "
41010052	Jesus said to him , " Go your way . Your faith has made you well . " Immediately he received his sight , and followed Jesus in the way .
41011001	When they drew near to Jerusalem , to Bethsphage and Bethany , at the Mount of Olives , he sent two of his disciples ,
41011002	and said to them , " Go your way into the village that is opposite you . Immediately as you enter into it , you will find a colt tied , on which no one has sat . Untie him , and bring him .
41011003	If anyone asks you , ' Why are you doing this ? ' say , ' The Lord needs him ; ' and immediately he will send him back here . "
41011004	They went away , and found a colt tied at the door outside in the open street , and they untied him .
41011005	Some of those who stood there asked them , " What are you doing , untying the colt ? "
41011006	They said to them just as Jesus had said , and they let them go .
41011007	They brought the colt to Jesus , and threw their garments on him , and Jesus sat on him .
41011008	Many spread their garments on the way , and others were cutting down branches from the trees , and spreading them on the road .
41011009	Those who went in front , and those who followed , cried , " Hosanna ! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord !
41011010	Blessed is the kingdom of our father David that is coming in the name of the Lord ! Hosanna in the highest ! "
41011011	Jesus entered into the temple in Jerusalem . When he had looked around at everything , it being now evening , he went out to Bethany with the twelve .
41011012	The next day , when they had come out from Bethany , he was hungry .
41011013	Seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves , he came to see if perhaps he might find anything on it . When he came to it , he found nothing but leaves , for it was not the season for figs .
41011014	Jesus told it , " May no one ever eat fruit from you again ! " and his disciples heard it .
41011015	They came to Jerusalem , and Jesus entered into the temple , and began to throw out those who sold and those who bought in the temple , and overthrew the tables of the money-changers , and the seats of those who sold the doves .
41011016	He would not allow anyone to carry a container through the temple .
41011017	He taught , saying to them , " Isn't it written , ' My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations ? ' But you have made it a den of robbers ! "
41011018	The chief priests and the scribes heard it , and sought how they might destroy him . For they feared him , for all the multitude was astonished at his teaching .
41011019	When evening came , he went forth out of the city .
41011020	As they passed by in the morning , they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots .
41011021	Peter , remembering , said to him , " Rabbi , look ! The fig tree which you cursed has withered away . "
41011022	Jesus answering said to them , " Have faith in God .
41011023	For most assuredly I tell you , whoever may tell this mountain , ' Be taken up and cast into the sea , ' and doesn't doubt in his heart , but believes that what he says happens ; he shall have whatever he says .
41011024	Therefore I tell you , all things whatever you pray and ask for , believe that you receive them , and you shall have them .
41011025	Whenever you stand praying , forgive , if you have anything against anyone ; so that your Father , who is in heaven , may also forgive you your transgressions .
41011026	But if you do not forgive , neither will your Father in heaven forgive your transgressions . "
41011027	They came again to Jerusalem , and as he was walking in the temple , the chief priests , and the scribes , and the elders came to him ,
41011028	and they were asking him , " By what authority do you these things ? Or who gave you this authority to do these things ? "
41011029	Jesus said to them , " I will ask you one question . Answer me , and I will tell you by what authority I do these things .
41011030	The baptism of John , was it from heaven , or from men ? Answer me . "
41011031	They reasoned with themselves , saying , " If we should say , ' From heaven ; ' he will say , ' Why then did you not believe him ? '
41011032	If we should say , ' From men ' " -- they feared the people , for all held John to really be a prophet .
41011033	They answered Jesus , " We don't know . " Jesus said to them , " Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things . "
41012001	He began to speak to them in parables . " A man planted a vineyard , set a hedge around it , dug a pit for the winepress , built a tower , rented it out to a farmer , and went into another country .
41012002	When it was time , he sent a servant to the farmer to get from the farmer his share of the fruit of the vineyard .
41012003	They took him , beat him , and sent him away empty .
41012004	Again , he sent another servant to them ; and they threw stones at him , wounded him in the head , and sent him away shamefully treated .
41012005	Again he sent another ; and they killed him ; and many others , beating some , and killing some .
41012006	Therefore he had yet one , a beloved son , he sent him last to them , saying , ' They will respect my son . '
41012007	But those farmers said among themselves , ' This is the heir . Come , let's kill him , and the inheritance will be ours . '
41012008	They took him , killed him , and cast him forth out of the vineyard .
41012009	What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do ? He will come and destroy the farmers , and will give the vineyard to others .
41012010	Haven't you even read this scripture : ' The stone which the builders rejected , The same was made the head of the corner .
41012011	This was from the Lord , It is marvelous in our eyes ' ? "
41012012	They tried to seize him , but they feared the multitude ; for they perceived that he spoke the parable against them . They left him , and went away .
41012013	They sent some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians to him , that they might catch him in words .
41012014	When they had come , they asked him , " Teacher , we know that you are honest , and don't defer to anyone ; for you aren't partial to anyone , but truly teach the way of God . Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar , or not ?
41012015	Shall we give , or shall we not give ? " But he , knowing their hypocrisy , said to them , " Why do you test me ? Bring me a denarius , that I may see it . "
41012016	They brought it . He said to them , " Whose is this image and inscription ? " They said to him , " Caesar's . "
41012017	Jesus answered them , " Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's , and to God the things that are God's . " They marveled greatly at him .
41012018	There came to him Sadducees , who say that there is no resurrection . They asked him , saying ,
41012019	" Teacher , Moses wrote to us , ' If a man's brother dies , and leaves a wife behind him , and leaves no child , that his brother should take his wife , and raise up children to his brother . '
41012020	There were seven brothers . The first took a wife , and dying left no children .
41012021	The second took her , and died , leaving no children behind him . The third likewise ;
41012022	and the seven took her and left no children . Last of all the woman also died .
41012023	In the resurrection , when they rise , whose wife will she be of them ? For the seven had her as a wife . "
41012024	Jesus answered them , " Isn't this because you are mistaken , not knowing the scriptures , nor the power of God ?
41012025	For when they will rise from the dead , they neither marry , nor are given in marriage , but are like angels in heaven .
41012026	But about the dead , that they are raised ; haven't you read in the book of Moses , at the Bush , how God spoke to him , saying , ' I am the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ? '
41012027	He is not the God of the dead , but of the living . You are therefore badly mistaken . "
41012028	One of the scribes came , and heard them questioning together . Knowing that he had answered them well , asked him , " What commandment is the greatest of all ? "
41012029	Jesus answered , " The greatest is , ' Hear , Israel , the Lord our God , the Lord is one :
41012030	you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart , and with all your soul , and with all your mind , and with all your strength . ' This is the primary commandment .
41012031	The second is like this , ' You shall love your neighbor as yourself . ' There is no other commandment greater than these . "
41012032	The scribe said to him , " Truly , teacher , you have said well that he is one , and there is none other but he ,
41012033	and to love him with all the heart , and with all the understanding , with all the soul , and with all the strength , and to love his neighbor as himself , is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices . "
41012034	When Jesus saw that he answered wisely , he said to him , " You are not far from the kingdom of God . " No one dared ask him any question after that .
41012035	Jesus responded , as he taught in the temple , " How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David ?
41012036	For David himself said in the Holy Spirit , ' The Lord said to my Lord , Sit at my right hand , Until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet . '
41012037	Therefore David himself calls him Lord , so how can he be his son ? " The common people heard him gladly .
41012038	In his teaching he said to them , " Beware of the scribes , who desire to walk in long robes , and to get greetings in the marketplaces ,
41012039	and chief seats in the synagogues , and chief places at feasts :
41012040	those who devour widows ' houses , and for a pretense make long prayers . These will receive greater condemnation . "
41012041	Jesus sat down opposite the treasury , and saw how the multitude cast money into the treasury . Many who were rich cast in much .
41012042	There came a poor widow , and she cast in two lepta , which make a quadrans .
41012043	He called his disciples to himself , and said to them , " Most assuredly I tell you , this poor widow gave more than all those who are giving into the treasury ,
41012044	for they all gave out of their abundance , but she , out of her poverty , gave all that she had to live on . "
41013001	As he went forth out of the temple , one of his disciples said to him , " Teacher , see what kind of stones and what kind of buildings ! "
41013002	Jesus said to him , " Do you see these great buildings ? There will not be left here one stone on another , which will not be thrown down . "
41013003	As he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple , Peter , James , John , and Andrew asked him privately ,
41013004	" Tell us , when will these things be ? What is the sign that these things are all about to be accomplished ? "
41013005	Jesus , answering , began to tell them , " Be careful that no one leads you astray .
41013006	For many will come in my name , saying , ' I am he ! ' and will lead many astray .
41013007	When you hear of wars and rumors of wars , don't be troubled . For those must happen , but the end is not yet .
41013008	For nation will rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom . There will be earthquakes in various places . There will be famines and troubles . These things are the beginning of birth pains .
41013009	But watch yourselves , for they will deliver you up to councils . You will be beaten in synagogues . Before governors and kings will you stand for my sake , for a testimony to them .
41013010	The gospel must first be preached to all the nations .
41013011	When they lead you away and deliver you up , don't be anxious beforehand , or premeditate what you will say , but say whatever will be given you in that hour . For it is not you who speak , but the Holy Spirit .
41013012	" Brother will deliver up brother to death , and the father his child . Children will rise up against parents , and cause them to be put to death .
41013013	You will be hated by all men for my name's sake , but he who endures to the end , the same will be saved .
41013014	But when you see the abomination of desolation , spoken of by Daniel the prophet , standing where it ought not ( let the reader understand ) , then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains ,
41013015	and let him who is on the housetop not go down , nor enter in , to take anything out of his house .
41013016	Let him who is in the field not return back to take his cloak .
41013017	But woe to those who are with child and to those who nurse babies in those days !
41013018	Pray that your flight won't be in the winter .
41013019	For in those days there will be oppression , such as there has not been the like from the beginning of the creation which God created until now , and never will be .
41013020	Unless the Lord had shortened the days , no flesh would have been saved ; but for the elect's sake , whom he chose , he shortened the days .
41013021	Then if anyone tells you , ' Look , here is the Christ ! ' or , ' Look , there ! ' don't believe it .
41013022	For there will arise false christs and false prophets , and will show signs and wonders , that they may lead astray , if possible , also the elect .
41013023	But you watch . " Behold , I have told you all things beforehand .
41013024	But in those days , after that oppression , the sun will be darkened , the moon will not give her light ,
41013025	the stars will be falling from the sky , and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken .
41013026	Then will they see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory .
41013027	Then will he send forth his angels , and will gather together his elect from the four winds , from the ends of the earth to the ends of the sky .
41013028	" Now from the fig tree , learn this parable . When the branch has now become tender , and puts forth its leaves , you know that the summer is near ;
41013029	even so you also , when you see these things coming to pass , know that it is near , at the doors .
41013030	Most assuredly I say to you , this generation will not pass away until all these things are accomplished .
41013031	Heaven and earth will pass away , but my words will not pass away .
41013032	But of that day or that hour no one knows , not even the angels in heaven , neither the Son , but only the Father .
41013033	Watch , keep alert , and pray ; for you don't know when the time is .
41013034	" It is like a man , traveling to another country , having left his house , and given authority to his servants , and to each one his work , and also commanded the doorkeeper to keep watch .
41013035	Watch therefore , for you don't know when the lord of the house is coming , whether at evening , or at midnight , or when the rooster crows , or in the morning ;
41013036	lest coming suddenly he might find you sleeping .
41013037	What I tell you , I tell all : Watch . "
41014001	It was now two days before the feast of the Passover and the unleavened bread , and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might sieze him by deception , and kill him .
41014002	For they said , " Not during the feast , because there might be a riot of the people . "
41014003	While he was at Bethany , in the house of Simon the leper , as he sat at the table , there came a woman having an alabaster jar of ointment of pure nard - - very costly . She broke the jar , and poured it over his head .
41014004	But there were some who had indignation among themselves , saying , " Why has this ointment been wasted ?
41014005	For this might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii , and given to the poor . " They grumbled against her .
41014006	But Jesus said , " Leave her alone . Why do you trouble her ? She has done a good work for me .
41014007	For you always have the poor with you , and whenever you want to , you can do them good ; but you will not always have me .
41014008	She has done what she could . She has anointed my body beforehand for the burying .
41014009	Most assuredly I tell you , wherever this gospel may be preached throughout the whole world , that also which this woman has done will be spoken of for a memorial of her . "
41014010	Judas Iscariot , who was one of the twelve , went away to the chief priests , that he might deliver him to them .
41014011	They , when they heard it , were glad , and promised to give him money . He sought how he might conveniently deliver him .
41014012	On the first day of unleavened bread , when they sacrificed the Passover , his disciples asked him , " Where do you want us to go and make ready that you may eat the Passover ? "
41014013	He sent two of his disciples , and said to them , " Go into the city , and there you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water . Follow him ,
41014014	and wherever he enters in , tell the master of the house , ' The Teacher says , " Where is the guest room , where I may eat the Passover with my disciples ? " '
41014015	He will himself show you a large upper room furnished and ready . Make ready for us there . "
41014016	His disciples went out , and came into the city , and found things as he had said to them , and they prepared the Passover .
41014017	When it was evening he came with the twelve .
41014018	As they sat and were eating , Jesus said , " Most assuredly I tell you , one of you will betray me - - he who eats with me . "
41014019	They began to be sorrowful , and to ask him one by one , " Surely not I ? " And another said , " Surely not I ? "
41014020	He answered them , " It is one of the twelve , he who dips with me in the dish .
41014021	For the Son of Man goes , even as it is written about him , but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed ! It would be better for that man if he had not been born . "
41014022	As they were eating , Jesus took bread , and when he had blessed , he broke it , and gave to them , and said , " Take , eat . This is my body . "
41014023	He took the cup , and when he had given thanks , he gave to them . They all drank of it .
41014024	He said to them , " This is my blood of the new covenant , which is poured out for many .
41014025	Most assuredly I tell you , I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine , until that day when I drink it anew in the kingdom of God . "
41014026	When they had sung a hymn , they went out to the Mount of Olives .
41014027	Jesus said to them , " All of you will be made to stumble because of me tonight , for it is written , ' I will strike the shepherd , and the sheep will be scattered . '
41014028	However , after I am raised up , I will go before you into Galilee . "
41014029	But Peter said to him , " Although all will be offended , yet I will not . "
41014030	Jesus said to him , " Most assuredly I tell you , that you today , even this night , before the cock crows twice , you will deny me three times . "
41014031	But he spoke all the more , " If I must die with you , I will not deny you . " Likewise , they all said so .
41014032	They came to a place which was named Gethsemane . He said to his disciples , " Sit here , while I pray . "
41014033	He took with him Peter , James , and John , and began to be greatly alarmed and distressed .
41014034	He said to them , " My soul is exceedingly sorrowful , even to death . Stay here , and watch . "
41014035	He went forward a little , and fell on the ground , and prayed that , if it were possible , the hour might pass away from him .
41014036	He said , " Abba , Father , all things are possible to you . Please remove this cup from me . However , not what I want , but what you want . "
41014037	He came and found them sleeping , and said to Peter , " Simon , are you sleeping ? Couldn't you watch one hour ?
41014038	Watch and pray , that you not enter into temptation . The spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak . "
41014039	Again he went away , and prayed , saying the same words .
41014040	Again he returned , and found them sleeping , for their eyes were very heavy , and they didn't know what to answer him .
41014041	He came the third time , and said to them , " Sleep on now , and take your rest . It is enough . The hour has come . Behold , the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
41014042	Arise , let us be going . Behold , he who betrays me is at hand . "
41014043	Immediately , while he was still speaking , Judas , one of the twelve , came - - and with him a multitude with swords and clubs , from the chief priests , the scribes , and the elders .
41014044	Now he who betrayed him had given them a sign , saying , " Whoever I will kiss , that is he . Take him , and lead him away safely . "
41014045	When he had come , immediately he came to him , and said , " Rabbi ! Rabbi ! " and kissed him .
41014046	They laid their hands on him , and took him .
41014047	But a certain one of those who stood by drew his sword , and struck the servant of the high priest , and cut off his ear .
41014048	Jesus answered them , " Have you come out , as against a robber , with swords and clubs to seize me ?
41014049	I was daily with you in the temple teaching , and you didn't arrest me . But this is so that the scriptures might be fulfilled . "
41014050	They all left him , and fled .
41014051	A certain young man followed with him , having a linen cloth thrown around him , over his naked body . The young men grabbed him ,
41014052	but he left the linen cloth , and fled from them naked .
41014053	They led Jesus away to the high priest . There came together with him all the chief priests , the elders , and the scribes .
41014054	Peter had followed him afar off , until he came into the court of the high priest . He was sitting with the officers , and warming himself in the light of the fire .
41014055	Now the chief priests and the whole council sought witnesses against Jesus to put him to death , and found none .
41014056	For many gave false testimony against him , and their testimony didn't agree with each other .
41014057	Some stood up , and gave false testimony against him , saying ,
41014058	" We heard him say , ' I will destroy this temple that is made with hands , and in three days I will build another made without hands . ' "
41014059	Even so their testimony did not agree .
41014060	The high priest stood up in the midst , and asked Jesus , " Have you no answer ? What is it which these testify against you ? "
41014061	But he stayed quiet , and answered nothing . Again the high priest asked him , " Are you the Christ , the Son of the Blessed ? "
41014062	Jesus said , " I AM . You will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power , and coming with the clouds of the sky . "
41014063	The high priest tore his clothes , and said , " What further need have we of witnesses ?
41014064	You have heard the blasphemy ! What do you think ? " They all condemned him to be worthy of death .
41014065	Some began to spit on him , and to cover his face , and to beat him with fists , and to tell him , " Prophesy ! " The officers struck him with the palms of their hands .
41014066	As Peter was beneath in the court , one of the maids of the high priest came ,
41014067	and seeing Peter warming himself , she looked at him , and said , " You were also with the Nazarene , Jesus . "
41014068	But he denied it , saying , " I neither know , nor understand what you are saying . " He went out into the porch , and the cock crowed .
41014069	The maid saw him , and began again to tell those who stood by , " This is one of them . "
41014070	But he again denied it . After a little while again those who stood by said to Peter , " You truly are one of them , for you are a Galilean , and your speech shows it . "
41014071	But he began to curse , and to swear , " I don't know this man of whom you speak ! "
41014072	The cock crowed the second time . Peter remembered the word , how that Jesus said to him , " Before the cock crows twice , you will deny me three times . " When he thought about that , he wept .
41015001	Immediately in the morning the chief priests , with the elders and scribes , and the whole council , held a consultation , and bound Jesus , and carried him away , and delivered him up to Pilate .
41015002	Pilate asked him , " Are you the King of the Jews ? " He answered , " So you say . "
41015003	The chief priests accused him of many things .
41015004	Pilate again asked him , " Have you no answer ? See how many things they testify against you ! "
41015005	But Jesus made no further answer , so Pilate marveled .
41015006	Now at the feast he used to release to them one prisoner , whom they asked of him .
41015007	There was one called Barabbas , bound with those who had made insurrection , men who in the insurrection had committed murder .
41015008	The multitude , crying aloud , began to ask him to do as he always did for them .
41015009	Pilate answered them , saying , " Do you you want me to release to you the King of the Jews ? "
41015010	For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up .
41015011	But the chief priests stirred up the multitude , that he should release Barabbas to them instead .
41015012	Pilate again asked them , " What then should I do to him whom you call the King of the Jews ? "
41015013	They cried out again , " Crucify him ! "
41015014	Pilate said to them , " Why , what evil has he done ? " But they cried out exceedingly , " Crucify him ! "
41015015	Pilate , wishing to please the multitude , released Barabbas to them , and delivered Jesus , when he had flogged him , to be crucified .
41015016	The soldiers led him away within the court , which is the Praetorium ; and they called together the whole cohort .
41015017	They clothed him with purple , and weaving a crown of thorns , they put it on him .
41015018	They began to salute him , " Hail , King of the Jews ! "
41015019	They struck his head with a reed , and spat on him , and bowing their knees , did homage to him .
41015020	When they had mocked him , they took the purple off of him , and put his own garments on him . They led him out to crucify him .
41015021	They compelled one passing by , coming from the country , Simon of Cyrene , the father of Alexander and Rufus , to go with them , that he might bear his cross .
41015022	They brought him to the place called Golgotha , which is , being interpreted , " The place of a skull . "
41015023	They offered him wine mixed with myrrh to drink , but he didn't take it .
41015024	Crucifying him , they parted his garments among them , casting lots on them , what each should take .
41015025	It was the third hour , and they crucified him .
41015026	The superscription of his accusation was written over him , " THE KING OF THE JEWS . "
41015027	With him they crucified two robbers ; one on his right hand , and one on his left .
41015028	The scripture was fulfilled , which says , " He was numbered with transgressors . "
41015029	Those who passed by blasphemed him , wagging their heads , and saying , " Ha ! You who destroy the temple , and build it in three days ,
41015030	save yourself , and come down from the cross ! "
41015031	Likewise , also the chief priests mocking among themselves with the scribes said , " He saved others . He can't save himself .
41015032	Let the Christ , the King of Israel , now come down from the cross , that we may see and believe him . " Those who were crucified with him reproached him .
41015033	When the sixth hour had come , there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour .
41015034	At the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice , saying , " Eloi , Eloi , lama sabachthani ? " which is , being interpreted , " My God , my God , why have you forsaken me ? "
41015035	Some of those who stood by , when they heard it , said , " Behold , he calls Elijah . "
41015036	One ran , and filling a sponge full of vinegar , put it on a reed , and gave it to him to drink , saying , " Let him be . Let's see whether Elijah comes to take him down . "
41015037	Jesus cried out with a loud voice , and gave up the spirit .
41015038	The veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom .
41015039	When the centurion , who stood by opposite him , saw that he cried out like this and breathed his last , he said , " Truly this man was the Son of God ! "
41015040	There were also women watching from afar , among whom were both Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses , and Salome ;
41015041	who , when he was in Galilee , followed him , and served him ; and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem .
41015042	When evening had now come , because it was the Preparation , that is , the day before the Sabbath ,
41015043	Joseph of Arimathaea , a member of the council of honorable estate , who also himself was looking for the kingdom of God , came . He boldly went in to Pilate , and asked for Jesus ' body .
41015044	Pilate marveled if he were already dead : and calling to him the centurion , he asked him whether he had been dead for a while .
41015045	When he learned it from the centurion , he granted the body to Joseph .
41015046	He bought a linen cloth , and taking him down , wound him in the linen cloth , and laid him in a tomb which had been cut out of a rock . He rolled a stone against the door of the tomb .
41015047	Mary Magdalene and Mary , the mother of Joses , saw where he was laid .
41016001	When the Sabbath was past , Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James , and Salome , bought spices , that they might come and anoint him .
41016002	Very early on the first day of the week , they came to the tomb when the sun had risen .
41016003	They were saying among themselves , " Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us ? "
41016004	for it was very big . Looking up , they saw that the stone was rolled back
41016005	Entering into the tomb , they saw a young man sitting on the right side , dressed in a white robe , and they were amazed .
41016006	He said to them , " Don't be amazed . You seek Jesus , the Nazarene , who has been crucified . He has risen . He is not here . Behold , the place where they laid him !
41016007	But go , tell his disciples and Peter , ' He goes before you into Galilee . There you will see him , as he said to you . ' "
41016008	They went out , and fled from the tomb , for trembling and astonishment had come on them . They said nothing to anyone ; for they were afraid .
41016009	Now when he had risen early on the first day of the week , he appeared first to Mary Magdalene , from whom he had cast out seven demons .
41016010	She went and told those who had been with him , as they mourned and wept .
41016011	When they heard that he was alive , and had been seen by her , they disbelieved .
41016012	After these things he was revealed in another form to two of them , as they walked , on their way into the country .
41016013	They went away and told it to the rest . They didn't believe them , either .
41016014	Afterward he was revealed to the eleven themselves as they sat at the table , and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart , because they didn't believe those who had seen him after he had risen .
41016015	He said to them , " Go into all the world , and preach the gospel to the whole creation .
41016016	He who believes and is baptized will be saved ; but he who disbelieves will be condemned .
41016017	These signs will accompany those who believe : in my name they will cast out demons ; they will speak with new languages ;
41016018	they will take up serpents , and if they drink any deadly thing , it will in no way hurt them ; they will lay hands on the sick , and they will recover . "
41016019	So then the Lord Jesus , after he had spoken to them , was received up into heaven , and sat down at the right hand of God .
41016020	They went forth , and preached everywhere , the Lord working with them , and confirming the word by the signs that followed . Amen .
42001001	Because many have undertaken to draw up a narrative concerning those matters which have been fulfilled among us ,
42001002	even as they delivered them to us , who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word ,
42001003	it seemed good to me also , having traced the course of all things accurately from the first , to write to you in order , most excellent Theophilus ;
42001004	that you might know the certainty concerning the things in which you were instructed .
42001005	There was in the days of Herod , the king of Judea , a certain priest named Zacharias , of the priestly division of Abijah . He had a wife of the daughters of Aaron , and her name was Elizabeth .
42001006	They were both righteous before God , walking blamelessly in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord .
42001007	But they had no child , because Elizabeth was barren , and they both were well advanced in years .
42001008	Now it happened , while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his division ,
42001009	according to the custom of the priest's office , his lot was to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense .
42001010	The whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense .
42001011	An angel of the Lord appeared to him , standing on the right side of the altar of incense .
42001012	Zacharias was troubled when he saw him , and fear fell on him .
42001013	But the angel said to him , " Don't be afraid , Zacharias , because your request has been heard , and your wife , Elizabeth , will bear you a son , and you shall call his name John .
42001014	You will have joy and gladness ; and many will rejoice at his birth .
42001015	For he will be great in the sight of the Lord , and he will drink no wine nor strong drink . He will be filled with the Holy Spirit , even from his mother's womb .
42001016	He will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord , their God .
42001017	He will go before his face in the spirit and power of Elijah , ' to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children , ' and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just ; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord . "
42001018	Zacharias said to the angel , " How can I be sure of this ? For I am an old man , and my wife is well advanced in years . "
42001019	The angel answered him , " I am Gabriel , who stands in the presence of God . I was sent to speak to you , and to bring you this good news .
42001020	Behold , you will be silent and not able to speak , until the day that these things will happen , because you didn't believe my words , which will be fulfilled in their proper time . "
42001021	The people were waiting for Zacharias , and they marveled while he delayed in the temple .
42001022	When he came out , he could not speak to them , and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple . He continued making signs to them , and remained mute .
42001023	It happened , when the days of his service were fulfilled , he departed to his house .
42001024	After these days Elizabeth , his wife , conceived , and she hid herself five months , saying ,
42001025	" Thus has the Lord done to me in the days in which he looked at me , to take away my reproach among men . "
42001026	Now in the sixth month , the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee , named Nazareth ,
42001027	to a virgin pledged to be married to a man whose name was Joseph , of the house of David . The virgin's name was Mary .
42001028	Having come in to her , the angel said , " Rejoice , you highly favored one ! The Lord is with you . Blessed are you among women ! "
42001029	But when she saw him , she was greatly troubled at the saying , and considered what kind of salutation this might be .
42001030	The angel said to her , " Don't be afraid , Mary , for you have found favor with God .
42001031	Behold , you will conceive in your womb , and bring forth a son , and will call his name JESUS .
42001032	He will be great , and will be called the Son of the Most High . The Lord God will give to him the throne of his father , David ,
42001033	and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever . There will be no end of his kingdom . "
42001034	Mary said to the angel , " How will this be , seeing I am a virgin ? "
42001035	The angel answered her , " The Holy Spirit will come on you , and the power of the Most High will overshadow you . Therefore also the holy one which is born from you will be called the Son of God .
42001036	Behold , Elizabeth , your relative , also has conceived a son in her old age ; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren .
42001037	For no word from God will be void of power . "
42001038	Mary said , " Behold , the handmaid of the Lord ; be it to me according to your word . " The angel departed from her .
42001039	Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste , into a city of Judah ,
42001040	and entered into the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth .
42001041	It happened , when Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting , the baby leaped in her womb , and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit .
42001042	She called out with a loud voice , and said , " Blessed are you among women , and blessed is the fruit of your womb !
42001043	Why am I so favored , that the mother of my Lord should come to me ?
42001044	For behold , when the voice of your greeting came into my ears , the baby leaped in my womb for joy !
42001045	Blessed is she who believed , for there will be a fulfillment of the things which have been spoken to her from the Lord ! "
42001046	Mary said , " My soul magnifies the Lord .
42001047	My spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior ,
42001048	For he has looked at the humble state of his handmaid . For behold , from now on , all generations will call me blessed .
42001049	For he who is mighty has done to me great things ; Holy is his name .
42001050	His mercy is for generations of generations on those who fear him .
42001051	He has shown strength with his arm . He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their heart .
42001052	He has put down princes from their thrones . Has exalted the lowly .
42001053	He has filled the hungry with good things . He has sent the rich away empty .
42001054	He has given help to Israel , his servant , that he might remember mercy
42001055	( As he spoke to our fathers ) Toward Abraham and his seed forever . "
42001056	Mary stayed with her about three months , and returned to her house .
42001057	Now the time that Elizabeth should give birth was fulfilled , and she brought forth a son .
42001058	Her neighbors and her relatives heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy towards her ; and they rejoiced with her .
42001059	It happened on the eighth day , that they came to circumcise the child ; and they would have called him Zacharias , after the name of the father .
42001060	His mother answered , " Not so ; but he will be called John . "
42001061	They said to her , " There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name . "
42001062	They made signs to his father , what he would have him called .
42001063	He asked for a writing tablet , and wrote , " His name is John . " They all marveled .
42001064	His mouth was opened immediately , and his tongue freed , and he spoke , blessing God .
42001065	Fear came on all who lived around them , and all these sayings were talked about throughout all the hill country of Judea .
42001066	All who heard them laid them up in their heart , saying , " What then will this child be ? " The hand of the Lord was with him .
42001067	His father , Zacharias , was filled with the Holy Spirit , and prophesied , saying ,
42001068	" Blessed be the Lord , the God of Israel , For he has visited and worked redemption for his people ;
42001069	Has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David
42001070	( As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets who have been from of old ) ,
42001071	Salvation from our enemies , and from the hand of all who hate us ;
42001072	To show mercy towards our fathers , To remember his holy covenant ,
42001073	The oath which he spoke to Abraham , our father ,
42001074	To grant to us that we , being delivered out of the hand of our enemies , should serve him without fear ,
42001075	In holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life .
42001076	And you , child , will be called a prophet of the Most High , For you will go before the face of the Lord to make ready his ways ,
42001077	To give knowledge of salvation to his people by the remission of their sins ,
42001078	Because of the tender mercy of our God , Whereby the dawn from on high will visit us ,
42001079	To shine on those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death ; To guide our feet into the way of peace . "
42001080	The child grew , and grew strong in spirit , and was in the desert until the day of his public appearance to Israel .
42002001	Now it happened in those days , that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be enrolled .
42002002	This was the first enrollment made when Quirinius was governor of Syria .
42002003	All went to enroll themselves , everyone to his own city .
42002004	Joseph also went up from Galilee , out of the city of Nazareth , into Judea , to the city of David , which is called Bethlehem , because he was of the house and family of David ;
42002005	to enroll himself with Mary , who was pledged to be married to him as wife , being great with child .
42002006	It happened , while they were there , that the day had come that she should give birth .
42002007	She brought forth her firstborn son , and she wrapped him in bands of cloth , and laid him in a feeding trough , because there was no room for them in the inn .
42002008	There were shepherds in the same country staying in the field , and keeping watch by night over their flock .
42002009	Behold , an angel of the Lord stood by them , and the glory of the Lord shone around them , and they were terrified .
42002010	The angel said to them , " Don't be afraid , for behold , I bring you good news of great joy which will be to all the people .
42002011	For there is born to you , this day , in the city of David , a Savior , who is Christ the Lord .
42002012	This is the sign to you : you will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth , lying in a feeding trough . "
42002013	Suddenly , there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God , and saying ,
42002014	" Glory to God in the highest , On earth peace , good will toward men . "
42002015	It happened , when the angels went away from them into the sky , that the shepherds said one to another , " Let's go to Bethlehem , now , and see this thing that has happened , which the Lord has made known to us . "
42002016	They came with haste , and found both Mary and Joseph , and the baby lying in the feeding trough .
42002017	When they saw it , they publicized widely the saying which was spoken to them about this child .
42002018	All who heard it wondered at the things which were spoken to them by the shepherds .
42002019	But Mary kept all these sayings , pondering them in her heart .
42002020	The shepherds returned , glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen , even as it was spoken to them .
42002021	When eight days were fulfilled for the circumcision of the child , his name was called JESUS , which was given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb .
42002022	When the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled , they brought him up to Jerusalem , to present him to the Lord
42002023	( as it is written in the law of the Lord , " Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord " ) ,
42002024	and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord , " A pair of turtledoves , or two young pigeons . "
42002025	Behold , there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon ; and this man was righteous and devout , looking for the consolation of Israel , and the Holy Spirit was on him .
42002026	It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death , before he had seen the Lord's Christ .
42002027	He came in the Spirit into the temple . When the parents brought in the child , Jesus , that they might do concerning him according to the custom of the law ,
42002028	then he received him into his arms , and blessed God , and said ,
42002029	" Now let you your servant depart , Lord , According to your word , in peace ;
42002030	For my eyes have seen your salvation ,
42002031	Which you have prepared before the face of all peoples ;
42002032	A light for revelation to the Gentiles , The glory of your people Israel . "
42002033	Joseph and his mother were marveling at the things which were spoken concerning him ,
42002034	and Simeon blessed them , and said to Mary , his mother , " Behold , this child is set for the falling and the rising of many in Israel , and for a sign which is spoken against .
42002035	Yes , a sword will pierce through your own soul , that thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed . "
42002036	There was one Anna , a prophetess , the daughter of Phanuel , of the tribe of Asher ( she was of a great age , having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity ,
42002037	and she had been a widow for about eighty-four years ) , who didn't depart from the temple , worshipping with fastings and petitions night and day .
42002038	Coming up at that very hour , she gave thanks to the Lord , and spoke of him to all those who were looking for redemption in Jerusalem .
42002039	When they had accomplished all things that were according to the law of the Lord , they returned into Galilee , to their own city , Nazareth .
42002040	The child grew , and grew strong in spirit , filled with wisdom , and the grace of God was on him .
42002041	His parents went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover .
42002042	When he was twelve years old , they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast ,
42002043	and when they had fulfilled the days , as they were returning , the boy , Jesus , stayed behind in Jerusalem . Joseph and his mother didn't know it ,
42002044	but supposing him to be in the company , they went a day's journey , and they looked for him among their relatives and acquaintances .
42002045	When they didn't find him , they returned to Jerusalem , looking for him .
42002046	It happened , after three days they found him in the temple , sitting in the midst of the teachers , both listening to them , and asking them questions .
42002047	All who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers .
42002048	When they saw him , they were astonished , and his mother said to him , " Son , why have you treated us this way ? Behold , your father and I were anxiously looking for you . "
42002049	He said to them , " Why were you looking for me ? Didn't you know that I must be in my Father's house ? "
42002050	They didn't understand the saying which he spoke to them .
42002051	He went down with them , and came to Nazareth . He was subject to them , and his mother kept all these sayings in her heart .
42002052	Jesus advanced in wisdom and stature , and in favor with God and men .
42003001	Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar , Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea , and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee , and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis , and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene ,
42003002	in the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas , the word of God came to John , the son of Zacharias , in the wilderness .
42003003	He came into all the region around the Jordan , preaching the baptism of repentance to remission of sins .
42003004	As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet , " The voice of one crying in the wilderness , ' Make ready the way of the Lord . Make his paths straight .
42003005	Every valley will be filled . Every mountain and hill will be brought low . The crooked will become straight , And the rough ways smooth .
42003006	All flesh will see God's salvation . ' "
42003007	He said therefore to the multitudes who went out to be baptized by him , " You offspring of vipers , who warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
42003008	Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance , and don't begin to say among yourselves , ' We have Abraham for our father ; ' for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones !
42003009	Even now the ax also lies at the root of the trees . Every tree therefore that doesn't bring forth good fruit is cut down , and thrown into the fire . "
42003010	The multitudes asked him , " What then must we do ? "
42003011	He answered them , " He who has two coats , let him give to him who has none . He who has food , let him do likewise . "
42003012	Tax collectors also came to be baptized , and they said to him , " Teacher , what must we do ? "
42003013	He said to them , " Extort no more than that which is appointed you . "
42003014	Soldiers also asked him , saying , " What about us ? What must we do ? " He said to them , " Extort from no one by violence , neither accuse anyone wrongfully . Be content with your wages . "
42003015	As the people were in expectation , and all men reasoned in their hearts concerning John , whether perhaps he was the Christ ,
42003016	John answered them all , " I indeed baptize you with water , but he comes who is mightier than I , the latchet of whose sandals I am not worthy to loosen . He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire ,
42003017	whose fan is in his hand , and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor , and will gather the wheat into his barn ; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire . "
42003018	Then with many other exhortations he preached good news to the people ,
42003019	but Herod the tetrarch , being reproved by him for Herodias , his brother's wife , and for all the evil things which Herod had done ,
42003020	added this also to them all , that he shut up John in prison .
42003021	Now it happened , when all the people were baptized , that , Jesus also having been baptized , and praying , the sky was opened ,
42003022	and the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form , as a dove , on him , and a voice came out of the sky , saying " You are my beloved Son . In you I am well pleased . "
42003023	Jesus himself , when he began to teach , was about thirty years old , being the son ( as was supposed ) of Joseph , the son of Heli ,
42003024	the son of Matthat , the son of Levi , the son of Melchi , the son of Jannai , the son of Joseph ,
42003025	the son of Mattathias , the son of Amos , the son of Nahum , the son of Esli , the son of Naggai ,
42003026	the son of Maath , the son of Mattathias , the son of Semein , the son of Joseph , the son of Judah ,
42003027	the son of Joanan , the son of Rhesa , the son of Zerubbabel , the son of Shealtiel , the son of Neri ,
42003028	the son of Melchi , the son of Addi , the son of Cosam , the son of Elmodam , the son of Er ,
42003029	the son of Josa , the son of Eliezer , the son of Jorim , the son of Matthat , the son of Levi ,
42003030	the son of Simeon , the son of Judah , the son of Joseph , the son of Jonan , the son of Eliakim ,
42003031	the son of Melea , the son of Menan , the son of Mattatha , the son of Nathan , the son of David ,
42003032	the son of Jesse , the son of Obed , the son of Boaz , the son of Salmon , the son of Nahshon ,
42003033	the son of Amminadab , the son of Aram , the son of Joram , the son of Hezron , the son of Perez , the son of Judah ,
42003034	the son of Jacob , the son of Isaac , the son of Abraham , the son of Terah , the son of Nahor ,
42003035	the son of Serug , the son of Reu , the son of Peleg , the son of Eber , the son of Shelah
42003036	the son of Cainan , the son of Arphaxad , the son of Shem , the son of Noah , the son of Lamech ,
42003037	the son of Methuselah , the son of Enoch , the son of Jared , the son of Mahalaleel , the son of Cainan ,
42003038	the son of Enos , the son of Seth , the son of Adam , the son of God .
42004001	Jesus , full of the Holy Spirit , returned from the Jordan , and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness
42004002	for forty days , being tempted by the devil . He ate nothing in those days . Afterward , when they were completed , he was hungry .
42004003	The devil said to him , " If you are the Son of God , command this stone to become bread . "
42004004	Jesus answered him , saying , " It is written , ' Man will not live by bread alone , but by every word of God . ' "
42004005	The devil , leading him up on a high mountain , showed him all the kingdoms of the inhabited world in a moment of time .
42004006	The devil said to him , " I will give you all this authority , and their glory , for it has been delivered to me ; and I give it to whomever I want .
42004007	If you therefore will worship before me , it will all be yours . "
42004008	Jesus answered him , " Get behind me Satan ! For it is written , ' You will worship the Lord your God , and him only will you serve . ' "
42004009	He led him to Jerusalem , and set him on the pinnacle of the temple , and said to him , " If you are the Son of God , cast yourself down from here ,
42004010	for it is written , ' He will give his angels charge concerning you , to guard you ; '
42004011	and , ' On their hands they will bear you up , Lest perhaps you dash your foot against a stone . ' "
42004012	Jesus answering , said to him , " It has been said , ' You shall not tempt the Lord your God . ' "
42004013	When the devil had completed every temptation , he departed from him for awhile .
42004014	Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee , and news about him spread through all the surrounding area .
42004015	He taught in their synagogues , being glorified by all .
42004016	He came to Nazareth , where he had been brought up . He entered , as was his custom , into the synagogue on the Sabbath day , and stood up to read .
42004017	The book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him . He opened the book , and found the place where it was written ,
42004018	" The Spirit of the Lord is on me , Because he anointed me to preach good news to the poor . He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted , To proclaim release to the captives , Recovering of sight to the blind , To deliver those who are crushed ,
42004019	And to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord . "
42004020	He closed the book , gave it back to the attendant , and sat down . The eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him .
42004021	He began to tell them , " Today , this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing . "
42004022	All testified about him , and wondered at the words of grace which proceeded out of his mouth , and they said , " Isn't this Joseph's son ? "
42004023	He said to them , " Doubtless you will tell me this parable , ' Physician , heal yourself . Whatever we have heard done at Capernaum , do also here in your hometown . ' "
42004024	He said , " Most assuredly I tell you , no prophet is acceptable in his hometown .
42004025	But truly I tell you , there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah , when the the sky was shut up three years and six months , when a great famine came over all the land .
42004026	Elijah was sent to none of them , except only to Zarephath , in the land of Sidon , to a woman who was a widow .
42004027	There were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet , yet not one of them was cleansed , except Naaman , the Syrian . "
42004028	They were all filled with wrath in the synagogue , as they heard these things ;
42004029	and they rose up , and threw him out of the city , and led him to the brow of the hill that their city was built on , that they might throw him off the cliff .
42004030	But he , passing through the midst of them , went his way .
42004031	He came down to Capernaum , a city of Galilee . He was teaching them on the Sabbath day ,
42004032	and they were astonished at his teaching , for his word was with authority .
42004033	In the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon , and he cried out with a loud voice ,
42004034	saying , " Ah ! what have we to do with you , Jesus of Nazareth ? Have you come to destroy us ? I know you who you are : the Holy One of God ! "
42004035	Jesus rebuked him , saying , " Be silent , and come out of him ! " When the demon had thrown him down in their midst , he came out of him , having done him no harm .
42004036	Amazement came on all , and they spoke together , one with another , saying , " What is this word ? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits , and they come out ! "
42004037	News about him went forth into every place of the surrounding region .
42004038	He rose up from the synagogue , and entered into Simon's house . Simon's mother-in-law was afflicted with a great fever , and they begged him for her .
42004039	He stood over her , and rebuked the fever ; and it left her . Immediately she rose up and ministered to them .
42004040	When the sun was setting , all those who had any sick with various diseases brought them to him ; and he laid his hands on every one of them , and healed them .
42004041	Demons also came out from many , crying out , and saying , " You are the Christ , the Son of God ! " Rebuking them , he didn't allow them to speak , because they knew that he was the Christ .
42004042	When it was day , he came out and went into an uninhabited place , and the multitudes looked for him , and came to him , and held on to him , so that he wouldn't go away from them .
42004043	But he said to them , " I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other cities also ; for this reason I have been sent . "
42004044	He was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee .
42005001	Now it happened , while the multitude pressed on him and heard the word of God , that he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret .
42005002	He saw two boats standing by the lake , but the fishermen had gone out of them , and were washing their nets .
42005003	He entered into one of the boats , which was Simon's , and asked him to put out a little from the land . He sat down and taught the multitudes out of the boat .
42005004	When he had finished speaking , he said to Simon , " Put out into the deep , and let down your nets for a catch . "
42005005	Simon answered him , " Master , we worked all night , and took nothing ; but at your word I will let down the net . "
42005006	When they had done this , they caught a great multitude of fish , and their net was breaking .
42005007	They beckoned to their partners in the other boat , that they should come and help them . They came , and filled both boats , so that they began to sink .
42005008	But Simon Peter , when he saw it , fell down at Jesus ' knees , saying , " Depart from me , for I am a sinful man , Lord . "
42005009	For he was amazed , and all who were with him , at the catch of fish which they had caught ;
42005010	and so also were James and John , sons of Zebedee , who were partners with Simon . Jesus said to Simon , " Don't be afraid . From now on you will catch men alive . "
42005011	When they had brought their boats to land , they left everything , and followed him .
42005012	It happened , while he was in one of the cities , behold , there was a man full of leprosy . When he saw Jesus , he fell on his face , and begged him , saying , " Lord , if you want to , you can make me clean . "
42005013	He stretched forth his hand , and touched him , saying , " I want to . Be made clean . " Immediately the leprosy departed from him .
42005014	He charged him to tell no one , " But go your way , and show yourself to the priest , and offer for your cleansing , according to what Moses commanded , for a testimony to them . "
42005015	But the report concerning him spread much more , and great multitudes came together to hear , and to be healed by him of their infirmities .
42005016	But he withdrew himself into the desert , and prayed .
42005017	It happened on one of those days , that he was teaching ; and there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by , who had come out of every village of Galilee , Judea , and Jerusalem . The power of the Lord was with him to heal them .
42005018	Behold , men brought a paralyzed man on a cot , and they sought to bring him in to lay before him .
42005019	Not finding a way to bring him in because of the multitude , they went up to the housetop , and let him down through the tiles with his cot into the midst before Jesus .
42005020	Seeing their faith , he said to him , " Man , your sins are forgiven you . "
42005021	The scribes and the Pharisees began to reason , saying , " Who is this that speaks blasphemies ? Who can forgive sins , but God alone ? "
42005022	But Jesus , perceiving their thoughts , answered them , " Why are you reasoning so in your hearts ?
42005023	Which is easier to say , ' Your sins are forgiven you ; ' or to say , ' Arise and walk ? '
42005024	But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins " ( he said to the paralyzed man ) , " I tell you , arise , and take up your cot , and go to your house . "
42005025	Immediately he rose up before them , and took up that which he was laying on , and departed to his house , glorifying God .
42005026	Amazement took hold on all , and they glorified God . They were filled with fear , saying , " We have seen strange things today . "
42005027	After these things he went out , and saw a tax collector , named Levi , sitting at the tax office , and said to him , " Follow me . "
42005028	He left everything , and rose up and followed him .
42005029	Levi made him a great feast for him in his house . There was a great crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining with them .
42005030	Their scribes and the Pharisees murmured against his disciples , saying , " Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners ? "
42005031	Jesus answered them , " Those who are healthy have no need for a physician , but those who are sick do .
42005032	I have not come to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance . "
42005033	They said to him , " Why do John's disciples often fast and pray , likewise also the disciples of the Pharisees , but yours eat and drink ? "
42005034	He said to them , " Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast , while the bridegroom is with them ?
42005035	But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them . Then will they fast in those days . "
42005036	He also told a parable to them . " No one puts a piece from a new garment on an old garment , or else he will tear the new , and also the piece from the new will not match the old .
42005037	No one puts new wine into old wineskins , or else the new wine will burst the skins , and it will be spilled , and the skins will be destroyed .
42005038	But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins , and both are preserved .
42005039	No man having drunk old wine immediately desires new , for he says , ' The old is better . ' "
42006001	Now it happened on the second Sabbath after the first , that he was going through the grain fields , and his disciples plucked the heads of grain , and ate , rubbing them in their hands .
42006002	But some of the Pharisees said to them , " Why do you do that which is not lawful to do on the Sabbath day ? "
42006003	Jesus , answering them , said , " Haven't you read this , what David did , when he was hungry , he , and those who were with him ;
42006004	how he entered into the house of God , and took and ate the show bread , and gave also to those who were with him , which is not lawful to eat except for the priests alone ? "
42006005	He said to them , " The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath . "
42006006	It also happened on another Sabbath , that he entered into the synagogue and taught . There was a man there , and his right hand was withered .
42006007	The scribes and the Pharisees watched him , to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath , that they might find an accusation against him .
42006008	But he knew their thoughts ; and he said to the man who had the withered hand , " Rise up , and stand in the middle . " He arose and stood .
42006009	Then Jesus said to them , " I will ask you something : Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good , or to do harm ? To save a life , or to kill ? "
42006010	He looked around at them all , and said to him , " Stretch out your hand . " He did , and his hand was restored as sound as the other .
42006011	But they were filled with rage , and talked with one another about what they might do to Jesus .
42006012	It happened in these days , that he went out into the mountain to pray , and he continued all night in prayer to God .
42006013	When it was day , he called his disciples , and from them he chose twelve , whom he also named apostles :
42006014	Simon , whom he also named Peter ; Andrew , his brother ; James ; John ; Philip ; Bartholomew ;
42006015	Matthew ; Thomas ; James , the son of Alphaeus ; Simon , who was called the Zealot ;
42006016	Judas the son of James ; and Judas Iscariot , who also became a traitor .
42006017	He came down with them , and stood on a level place , with a crowd of his disciples , and a great number of the people from all Judea and Jerusalem , and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon , who came to hear him , and to be healed of their diseases ;
42006018	also those who were troubled with unclean spirits , and they were being healed .
42006019	All the multitude sought to touch him , for power came forth from him , and healed them all .
42006020	He lifted up his eyes to his disciples , and said , " Blessed are you poor , for yours is the kingdom of God .
42006021	" Blessed are you who hunger now , for you will be filled . " Blessed are you who weep now , for you will laugh .
42006022	" Blessed are you when men shall hate you , and when they shall separate you from them and reproach you , and throw out your name as evil , for the Son of Man's sake .
42006023	Rejoice in that day , and leap for joy , for behold , your reward is great in heaven , for their fathers did the same thing to the prophets .
42006024	" But woe to you who are rich ! For you have received your consolation .
42006025	" Woe to you , you who are full now ! For you will be hungry . " Woe to you , you who laugh now ! For you will mourn and weep .
42006026	" Woe , when men will speak well of you ! For their fathers did the same thing to the false prophets .
42006027	But I tell you who hear , love your enemies , do good to those who hate you ,
42006028	bless them who curse you , and pray for those who insult you .
42006029	To him who strikes you on the cheek , offer also the other ; and from him who takes away your cloak , don't withhold your coat also .
42006030	Give to everyone who asks you , and don't ask him who takes away your goods to give them back again .
42006031	" As you desire that men should do to you , likewise do to them also .
42006032	If you love those who love you , what credit is that to you ? For even sinners love those who love them .
42006033	If you do good to those who do good to you , what credit is that to you ? For even sinners do the same .
42006034	If you lend to those from whom you hope to receive , what credit is that to you ? Even sinners lend to sinners , to receive back as much .
42006035	But love your enemies , and do good , and lend , expecting nothing back ; and your reward will be great , and you will be sons of the Most High ; for he is kind toward the unthankful and evil .
42006036	Therefore be merciful , even as your Father is also merciful .
42006037	Don't judge , and you will not be judged . Don't condemn , and you will not be condemned . Set free , and you will be set free .
42006038	Give , and it will be given to you , good measure , pressed down , shaken together , and running over , will they give into your bosom . For with the same measure you measure it will be measured back to you . "
42006039	He spoke a parable to them . " Can the blind guide the blind ? Won't they both fall into a pit ?
42006040	A disciple is not above his teacher , but everyone when he is fully trained will be like his teacher .
42006041	Why do you see the speck of chaff that is in your brother's eye , but don't consider the beam that is in your own eye ?
42006042	Or how can you tell your brother , ' Brother , let me remove the speck of chaff that is in your eye , ' when you yourself don't see the beam that is in your own eye ? You hypocrite ! First remove the beam from your own eye , and then you can see clearly to remove the speck of chaff that is in your brother's eye .
42006043	For there is no good tree that brings forth rotten fruit ; nor again a rotten tree that brings forth good fruit .
42006044	For each tree is known by its own fruit . For people don't gather figs from thorns , nor do they gather grapes from a bramble bush .
42006045	The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth that which is good , and the evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth that which is evil , for out of the abundance of the heart , his mouth speaks .
42006046	Why do you call me , ' Lord , Lord , ' and don't do the things which I say ?
42006047	Everyone who comes to me , and hears my words , and does them , I will show you who he is like .
42006048	He is like a man building a house , who dug and went deep , and laid a foundation on the rock . When a flood arose , the stream broke against that house , and could not shake it , because it was founded on the rock .
42006049	But he who hears , and doesn't do , is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation , against which the stream broke , and immediately it fell , and the ruin of that house was great . "
42007001	After he had finished speaking in the hearing of the people , he entered into Capernaum .
42007002	A certain centurion's servant , who was dear to him , was sick and at the point of death .
42007003	When he heard about Jesus , he sent to him elders of the Jews , asking him to come and save his servant .
42007004	When they came to Jesus , they begged him earnestly , saying , " He is worthy for you to do this for him ,
42007005	for he loves our nation , and he built our synagogue for us . "
42007006	Jesus went with them . When he was now not far from the house , the centurion sent friends to him , saying to him , " Lord , don't trouble yourself , for I am not worthy for you to come under my roof .
42007007	Therefore I didn't even think myself worthy to come to you ; but say the word , and my servant will be healed .
42007008	For I also am a man placed under authority , having under myself soldiers . I tell this one , ' Go ! ' and he goes ; and to another , ' Come ! ' and he comes ; and to my servant , ' Do this , ' and he does it . "
42007009	When Jesus heard these things , he marveled at him , and turned and said to the multitude who followed him , " I tell you , I have not found so great faith , no , not in Israel . "
42007010	Those who were sent , returning to the house , found that the servant who had been sick was well .
42007011	It happened soon afterwards , that he went to a city called Nain . Many of his disciples went with him , along with a great multitude .
42007012	Now when he drew near to the gate of the city , behold , one who was dead was carried out , the only son of his mother , and she was a widow . Many people of the city were with her .
42007013	When the Lord saw her , he had compassion on her , and said to her , " Don't cry . "
42007014	He came near and touched the coffin , and the bearers stood still . He said , " Young man , I tell you , arise ! "
42007015	He who was dead sat up , and began to speak . He gave him to his mother .
42007016	Fear took hold on all , and they glorified God , saying , " A great prophet has arisen among us , " and , " God has visited his people . "
42007017	This report went out concerning him in the whole of Judea , and in all the surrounding region .
42007018	The disciples of John told him about all these things .
42007019	John , calling to himself two of his disciples , sent them to Jesus , saying , " Are you he who comes , or should we look for another ? "
42007020	When the men had come to him , they said , " John the Baptizer has sent us to you , saying , ' Are you he who comes , or should we look for another ? ' "
42007021	In that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits ; and to many who were blind he gave sight .
42007022	Jesus answered them , " Go and tell John the things which you have seen and heard : that the blind receive their sight , the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed , the deaf hear , the dead are raised up , and the poor have good news preached to them .
42007023	Blessed is he who is not offended by me . "
42007024	When John's messengers had departed , he began to tell the multitudes about John , " What did you go out into the wilderness to see ? A reed shaken by the wind ?
42007025	But what did you go out to see ? A man clothed in soft clothing ? Behold , those who are gorgeously dressed , and live delicately , are in kings ' courts .
42007026	But what did you go out to see ? A prophet ? Yes , I tell you , and much more than a prophet .
42007027	This is he of whom it is written , ' Behold , I send my messenger before your face , Who will prepare your way before you . '
42007028	" For I tell you , among those who are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptizer , yet he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he . "
42007029	When all the people and the tax collectors heard this , they justified God , being baptized with John's baptism .
42007030	But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God , not being baptized by him themselves .
42007031	The Lord said , " To what then will I liken the men of this generation ? What are they like ?
42007032	They are like children who sit in the marketplace , and call one to another , saying , ' We piped to you , and you didn't dance . We mourned , and you didn't weep . '
42007033	For John the Baptizer came neither eating bread nor drinking wine , and you say , ' He has a demon . '
42007034	The Son of Man has come eating and drinking , and you say , ' Behold , a gluttonous man , and a drunkard ; a friend of tax collectors and sinners ! '
42007035	Wisdom is justified by all her children . "
42007036	One of the Pharisees invited him to eat with him . He entered into the Pharisee's house , and sat at the table .
42007037	Behold , a woman in the city who was a sinner , when she knew that he was reclining in the Pharisee's house , she brought an alabaster jar of ointment .
42007038	Standing behind at his feet weeping , she began to wet his feet with her tears , and she wiped them with the hair of her head , kissed his feet , and anointed them with the ointment .
42007039	Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it , he said to himself , " This man , if he were a prophet , would have perceived who and what kind of woman this is who touches him , that she is a sinner . "
42007040	Jesus answered him , " Simon , I have something to tell you . " He said , " Teacher , say on . "
42007041	" A certain lender had two debtors . The one owed five hundred denarii , and the other fifty .
42007042	When they couldn't pay , he forgave them both . Which of them therefore will love him most ? "
42007043	Simon answered , " He , I suppose , to whom he forgave the most . " He said to him , " You have judged correctly . "
42007044	Turning to the woman , he said to Simon , " Do you see this woman ? I entered into your house , and you gave me no water for my feet , but she has wet my feet with her tears , and wiped them with the hair of her head .
42007045	You gave me no kiss , but she , since the time I came in , has not ceased to kiss my feet .
42007046	You didn't anoint my head with oil , but she has anointed my feet with ointment .
42007047	Therefore I tell you , her sins , which are many , are forgiven , for she loved much . But to whom little is forgiven , the same loves little . "
42007048	He said to her , " Your sins are forgiven . "
42007049	Those who sat at the table with him began to say to themselves , " Who is this who even forgives sins ? "
42007050	He said to the woman , " Your faith has saved you . Go in peace . "
42008001	It happened soon afterwards , that he went about through cities and villages , preaching and bringing the good news of the kingdom of God , and with him the twelve ,
42008002	and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities : Mary who was called Magdalene , from whom seven demons had gone out ;
42008003	and Joanna , the wife of Chuzas , Herod's steward , Susanna ; and many others ; who ministered to them from their possessions .
42008004	When a great multitude came together , and people from every city were coming to him , he spoke by a parable .
42008005	" The farmer went out to sow his seed . As he sowed , some fell by the road , and it was trampled under foot , and the birds of the sky devoured it .
42008006	Other seed fell on the rock , and as soon as it grew , it withered away , because it had no moisture .
42008007	Other fell amid the thorns , and the thorns grew with it , and choked it .
42008008	Other fell into the good ground , and grew , and brought forth fruit one hundred times . " As he said these things , he called out , " He who has ears to hear , let him hear ! "
42008009	Then his disciples asked him , " What does this parable mean ? "
42008010	He said , " To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God , but to the rest in parables ; that ' seeing they may not see , and hearing they may not understand . '
42008011	Now the parable is this : The seed is the word of God .
42008012	Those by the road are those who hear , then the devil comes , and takes away the word from their heart , that they may not believe and be saved .
42008013	Those on the rock are they who , when they hear , receive the word with joy ; but these have no root , who believe for a while , and fall away in time of temptation .
42008014	That which fell among the thorns , these are those who have heard , and as they go on their way they are choked with cares , riches , and pleasures of life , and bring no fruit to maturity .
42008015	That in the good ground , these are such as in an honest and good heart , having heard the word , hold it tightly , and bring forth fruit with patience .
42008016	" No one , when he has lit a lamp , covers it with a container , or puts it under a bed ; but puts it on a stand , that those who enter in may see the light .
42008017	For nothing is hidden , that will not be revealed ; nor anything secret , that will not be known and come to light .
42008018	Be careful therefore how you hear . For whoever has , to him will be given ; and whoever doesn't have , from him will be taken away even that which he thinks he has . "
42008019	His mother and brothers came to him , and they could not come near him for the crowd .
42008020	It was told him by some saying , " Your mother and your brothers stand outside , desiring to see you . "
42008021	But he answered them , " My mother and my brothers are these who hear the word of God , and do it . "
42008022	Now it happened on one of those days , that he entered into a boat , himself and his disciples , and he said to them , " Let's go over to the other side of the lake . " So they launched out .
42008023	But as they sailed , he fell asleep . A wind storm came down on the lake , and they were taking on dangerous amounts of water .
42008024	They came to him , and awoke him , saying , " Master , master , we are dying ! " He awoke , and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water , and they ceased , and it was calm .
42008025	He said to them , " Where is your faith ? " Being afraid they marveled , saying one to another , " Who is this , then , that he commands even the winds and the water , and they obey him ? "
42008026	They arrived at the country of the Gadarenes , which is opposite Galilee .
42008027	When Jesus stepped ashore , a certain man out of the city met him , who had demons for a long time . He wore no clothes , and didn't live in a house , but in the tombs .
42008028	When he saw Jesus , he cried out , and fell down before him , and with a loud voice said , " What do I have to do with you , Jesus , you Son of the Most High God ? I beg you , don't torment me ! "
42008029	For Jesus was commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man . For the unclean spirit had often seized the man . He was kept under guard , and bound with chains and fetters . Breaking the bands apart , he was driven by the demon into the desert .
42008030	Jesus asked him , " What is your name ? " He said , " Legion , " for many demons had entered into him .
42008031	They begged him who he would not command them to go into the abyss .
42008032	Now there was there a herd of many pigs feeding on the mountain , and they begged him that he would allow them to enter into those . He allowed them .
42008033	The demons came out from the man , and entered into the pigs , and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake , and were drowned .
42008034	When those who fed them saw what had happened , they fled , and told it in the city and in the country .
42008035	People went out to see what had happened . They came to Jesus , and found the man from whom the demons were gone out , sitting , clothed and in his right mind , at the feet of Jesus ; and they were afraid .
42008036	Those who saw it told them how he who was possessed with demons was healed .
42008037	All the people of the surrounding country of the Gadarenes asked him to depart from them , for they were very much afraid . He entered into the boat , and returned .
42008038	But the man from whom the demons had gone out begged him that he might go with him , but Jesus sent him away , saying ,
42008039	" Return to your house , and declare what great things God has done for you . " He went his way , proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him .
42008040	It happened , as Jesus returned , the multitude welcomed him , for they were all waiting for him .
42008041	Behold , there came a man named Jairus , and he was a ruler of the synagogue . He fell down at Jesus ' feet , and begged him to come into his house ,
42008042	for he had an only daughter , about twelve years of age , and she was dying . But as he went , the multitudes thronged him .
42008043	A woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years , who had spent all her living on physicians , and could not be healed by any ,
42008044	came behind him , and touched the fringe of his cloak , and immediately the flow of her blood stopped .
42008045	Jesus said , " Who touched me ? " When all denied , Peter and those with him said , " Master , the multitudes press and jostle you , and you say , ' Who touched me ? ' "
42008046	But Jesus said , " Someone did touch me , for I perceived that power has gone out of me . "
42008047	When the woman saw that she was not hidden , she came trembling , and falling down before him declared to him in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched him , and how she was healed immediately .
42008048	He said to her , " Daughter , cheer up . Your faith has made you well . Go in peace . "
42008049	While he still spoke , one from the ruler of the synagogue's house came , saying to him , " Your daughter is dead . Don't trouble the Teacher . "
42008050	But Jesus hearing it , answered him , " Don't be afraid . Only believe , and she will be healed . "
42008051	When he came to the house , he didn't allow anyone to enter in , except Peter , John , James , the father of the girl , and her mother .
42008052	All were weeping , and mourning her , but he said , " Don't weep . She isn't dead , but sleeping . "
42008053	They laughed him to scorn , knowing that she was dead .
42008054	But he put them all outside , and taking her by the hand , he called , saying , " Little girl , arise ! "
42008055	Her spirit returned , and she rose up immediately . He commanded that something be given to her to eat .
42008056	Her parents were amazed , but he charged them to tell no one what had been done .
42009001	He called the twelve together , and gave them power and authority over all demons , and to cure diseases .
42009002	He sent them forth to preach the kingdom of God , and to heal the sick .
42009003	He said to them , " Take nothing for your journey - - neither staffs , nor wallet , nor bread , nor money ; neither have two coats apiece .
42009004	Into whatever house you enter , stay there , and depart from there .
42009005	As many as don't receive you , when you depart from that city , shake off even the dust from your feet for a testimony against them . "
42009006	They departed , and went throughout the villages , preaching the gospel , and healing everywhere .
42009007	Now Herod , the tetrarch , heard of all that was done by him ; and he was very perplexed , because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead ,
42009008	and by some that Elijah had appeared , and by others that one of the old prophets had risen again .
42009009	Herod said , " John I beheaded , but who is this , about whom I hear such things ? " He sought to see him .
42009010	The apostles , when they had returned , told him what things they had done . He took them , and withdrew apart to a deserted place of a city called Bethsaida .
42009011	But the multitudes , perceiving it , followed him . He welcomed them , and spoke to them of the kingdom of God , and he cured those who needed healing .
42009012	The day began to wear away ; and the twelve came , and said to him , " Send the multitude away , that they may go into the surrounding villages and farms , and lodge , and get provisions , for we are here in a desert place . "
42009013	But he said to them , " You give them something to eat . " They said , " We have no more than five loaves and two fish , unless we should go and buy food for all these people . "
42009014	For they were about five thousand men . He said to his disciples , " Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each . "
42009015	They did so , and made them all sit down .
42009016	He took the five loaves and the two fish , and looking up to the sky , he blessed them , and broke them , and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude .
42009017	They ate , and were all filled . They gathered up twelve baskets of broken pieces that were left over .
42009018	It happened , as he was praying alone , the disciples were with him , and he asked them , " Who do the multitudes say that I am ? "
42009019	They answered , " ' John the Baptizer , ' but others say , ' Elijah , ' and others , that one of the old prophets is risen again . "
42009020	He said to them , " But who do you say that I am ? " Peter answered , " The Christ of God . "
42009021	But he warned them , and commanded them to tell this to no one ,
42009022	saying , " The Son of Man must suffer many things , and be rejected by the elders , chief priests , and scribes , and be killed , and the third day be raised up . "
42009023	He said to all , " If anyone desires to come after me , let him deny himself , take up his cross , and follow me .
42009024	For whoever desires to save his life will lose it , but whoever will lose his life for my sake , the same will save it .
42009025	For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world , and loses or forfeits his own self ?
42009026	For whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words , of him will the Son of Man be ashamed , when he comes in the glory of himself , of the Father , and of the holy angels .
42009027	But I tell you the truth : There are some of those who stand here , who will in no way taste of death , until they see the kingdom of God . "
42009028	It happened about eight days after these sayings , that he took with him Peter , John , and James , and went up onto the mountain to pray .
42009029	As he was praying , the appearance of his face was altered , and his clothing became white and dazzling .
42009030	Behold , two men talked with him , who were Moses and Elijah ,
42009031	who appeared in glory , and spoke of his departure , which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem .
42009032	Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep , but when they were fully awake , they saw his glory , and the two men who stood with him .
42009033	It happened , as they were parting from him , that Peter said to Jesus , " Master , it is good for us to be here . Let's make three tents : one for you , and one for Moses , and one for Elijah , " not knowing what he said .
42009034	While he said these things , a cloud came and overshadowed them , and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud .
42009035	A voice came out of the cloud , saying , " This is my beloved Son . Listen to him ! "
42009036	When the voice came , Jesus was found alone . They were silent , and told no one in those days any of the things which they had seen .
42009037	It happened on the next day , when they had come down from the mountain , that a great multitude met him .
42009038	Behold , a man from the crowd called out , saying , " Teacher , I beg you to look at my son , for he is my only child .
42009039	Behold , a spirit takes him , he suddenly cries out , and it convulses him so that he foams , and it hardly departs from him , bruising him severely .
42009040	I begged your disciples to cast it out , and they couldn't . "
42009041	Jesus answered , " Faithless and perverse generation , how long will I be with you and bear with you ? Bring your son here . "
42009042	While he was still coming , the demon threw him down and convulsed him violently . But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and healed the boy , and gave him back to his father .
42009043	They were all astonished at the majesty of God . But while all were marveling at all the things which Jesus did , he said to his disciples ,
42009044	" Let these words sink into your ears , for the Son of Man will be delivered up into the hands of men . "
42009045	But they didn't understand this saying . It was concealed from them , that they should not perceive it , and they were afraid to ask him about this saying .
42009046	There arose an argument among them about which of them was the greatest .
42009047	Jesus , perceiving the reasoning of their heart , took a little child , and set him by his side ,
42009048	and said to them , " Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me . Whoever receives me receives him who sent me . For whoever is least among you all , this one will be great . "
42009049	John answered , " Master , we saw someone casting out demons in your name , and we forbade him , because he doesn't follow with us . "
42009050	Jesus said to him , " Don't forbid him , for he who is not against us is for us . "
42009051	It came to pass , when the days were near that he should be taken up , he intently set his face to go to Jerusalem ,
42009052	and sent messengers before his face . They went , and entered into a village of the Samaritans , so as to prepare for him .
42009053	They didn't receive him , because he was traveling with his face set towards Jerusalem .
42009054	When his disciples , James and John , saw this , they said , " Lord , do you want us to command fire to come down from the sky , and destroy them , just as Elijah did ? "
42009055	But he turned and rebuked them , " You don't know what kind of spirit you are of .
42009056	For the Son of Man didn't come to destroy men's lives , but to save them . " They went to another village .
42009057	As they went on the way , a certain man said to him , " I want to follow you wherever you go , Lord . "
42009058	Jesus said to him , " The foxes have holes , and the birds of the sky have nests , but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head . "
42009059	He said to another , " Follow me . " But he said , " Lord , allow me first to go and bury my father . "
42009060	But Jesus said to him , " Leave the dead to bury their own dead , but you go and announce the kingdom of God . "
42009061	Another also said , " I want to follow you , Lord , but first allow me to bid farewell to those who are at my house . "
42009062	But Jesus said to him , " No one , having put his hand to the plow , and looking back , is fit for the kingdom of God . "
42010001	Now after these things the Lord also appointed seventy others , and sent them two by two before his face into every city and place , where he himself was about to come .
42010002	Then he said to them , " The harvest is indeed plentiful , but the laborers are few . Pray therefore to the Lord of the harvest , that he may send out laborers into his harvest .
42010003	Go your ways . Behold , I send you out as lambs in the midst of wolves .
42010004	Carry no purse , nor wallet , nor sandals . Greet no one on the way .
42010005	Into whatever house you enter , first say , ' Peace be to this house . '
42010006	If a son of peace is there , your peace will rest on him ; but if not , it will return to you .
42010007	Remain in that same house , eating and drinking the things they give , for the laborer is worthy of his wages . Don't go from house to house .
42010008	Into whatever city you enter , and they receive you , eat the things that are set before you .
42010009	Heal the sick who are therein , and tell them , ' The kingdom of God has come near to you . '
42010010	But into whatever city you enter , and they don't receive you , go out into the streets of it and say ,
42010011	' Even the dust from your city that clings to us , we wipe off against you . Nevertheless know this , that the kingdom of God has come near to you . '
42010012	I tell you , it will be more tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that city .
42010013	" Woe to you , Chorazin ! Woe to you , Bethsaida ! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you , they would have repented long ago , sitting in sackcloth and ashes .
42010014	But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you .
42010015	You , Capernaum , who are exalted to heaven , will be brought down to Hades .
42010016	Whoever listens to you listens to me , and whoever rejects you rejects me . Whoever rejects me rejects him who sent me . "
42010017	The seventy returned with joy , saying , " Lord , even the demons are subject to us in your name . "
42010018	He said to them , " I saw Satan having fall like lightning from heaven .
42010019	Behold , I give you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions , and over all the power of the enemy . Nothing will in any way hurt you .
42010020	Nevertheless , don't rejoice in this , that the spirits are subject to you , but rejoice that your names are written in heaven . "
42010021	In that same hour Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit , and said , " I thank you , O Father , Lord of heaven and earth , that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding , and revealed them to little children . Yes , Father , for so it was well-pleasing in your sight . "
42010022	Turning to the disciples , he said , " All things have been delivered to me from my Father . No one knows who the Son is , except the Father , and who the Father is , except the Son , and he to whoever the Son desires to reveal him . "
42010023	Turning to the disciples , he said privately , " Blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see ,
42010024	for I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which you see , and didn't see them , and to hear the things which you hear , and didn't hear them . "
42010025	Behold , a certain lawyer stood up and tested him , saying , " Teacher , what will I do to inherit eternal life ? "
42010026	He said to him , " What is written in the law ? How do you read it ? "
42010027	He answered , " You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart , with all your soul , with all your strength , and with all your mind ; and your neighbor as yourself . "
42010028	He said to him , " You have answered correctly . Do this , and you will live . "
42010029	But he , desiring to justify himself , asked Jesus , " Who is my neighbor ? "
42010030	Jesus answered , " A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho , and he fell among robbers , who both stripped him and beat him , and departed , leaving him half dead .
42010031	By chance a certain priest was going down that way . When he saw him , he passed by on the other side .
42010032	In the same way a Levite also , when he came to the place , and saw him , passed by on the other side .
42010033	But a certain Samaritan , as he journeyed , came where he was . When he saw him , he was moved with compassion ,
42010034	came to him , and bound up his wounds , pouring on oil and wine . He set him on his own animal , and brought him to an inn , and took care of him .
42010035	On the next day , when he departed , he took out two denarii , and gave them to the host , and said to him , ' Take care of him . Whatever you spend beyond that , I will repay you when I return . '
42010036	Now which of these three do you think seemed to be a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers ? "
42010037	He said , " He who showed mercy on him . " Then Jesus said to him , " Go and do likewise . "
42010038	It happened as they went on their way , he entered into a certain village , and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house .
42010039	She had a sister called Mary , who also sat at Jesus ' feet , and heard his word .
42010040	But Martha was distracted with much serving , and she came up to him , and said , " Lord , don't you care that my sister left me to serve alone ? Ask her therefore to help me . "
42010041	Jesus answered her , " Martha , Martha , you are anxious and troubled about many things ,
42010042	but one thing is needed . Mary has chosen the good part , which will not be taken away from her . "
42011001	It happened , that when he finished praying in a certain place , one of his disciples said to him , " Lord , teach us to pray , just as John also taught his disciples . "
42011002	He said to them , " When you pray , say , ' Our Father in heaven , May your name be kept holy . May your kingdom come . May your desire be done on Earth , as it is in heaven .
42011003	Give us day by day our daily bread .
42011004	Forgive us our sins , for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us . Bring us not into temptation , but deliver us from the evil one . ' "
42011005	He said to them , " Which of you , if you go to a friend at midnight , and tell him , ' Friend , lend me three loaves of bread ,
42011006	for a friend of mine has come to me from a journey , and I have nothing to set before him , '
42011007	and he from within will answer and say , ' Don't bother me . The door is now shut , and my children are with me in bed . I can't get up and give it to you ' ?
42011008	I tell you , although he will not rise and give it to him because he is his friend , yet because of his persistence , he will get up and give him as many as he needs .
42011009	I tell you , keep asking , and it will be given you . Keep seeking , and you will find . Keep knocking , and it will be opened to you .
42011010	For everyone who asks receives . He who seeks finds . To him who knocks it will be opened .
42011011	Which of you fathers , if your son asks for bread , will give him a stone ? Or if he asks for a fish , he won't give him a snake instead of a fish , will he ?
42011012	Or if he asks for an egg , he won't give him a scorpion , will he ?
42011013	If you then , being evil , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him ? "
42011014	He was casting out a demon , and it was mute . It happened , when the demon had gone out , the mute man spoke ; and the multitudes marveled .
42011015	But some of them said , " He casts out demons by Beelzebul , the prince of the demons . "
42011016	Others , testing him , sought from him a sign from heaven .
42011017	But he , knowing their thoughts , said to them , " Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation . A house divided against itself falls .
42011018	If Satan also is divided against himself , how will his kingdom stand ? Because you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul .
42011019	But if I cast out demons by Beelzebul , by whom do your sons cast them out ? Therefore will they be your judges .
42011020	But if I by the finger of God cast out demons , then is the kingdom of God come to you .
42011021	When the strong man , fully armed , guards his own dwelling , his goods are safe .
42011022	But when someone stronger comes on him , and overcomes him , he takes from him his whole armor in which he trusted , and divides his spoils .
42011023	He that is not with me is against me . He who doesn't gather with me scatters .
42011024	The unclean spirit , when he has gone out of the man , passes through dry places , seeking rest , and finding none , he says , ' I will turn back to my house whence I came out . '
42011025	When he returns , he finds it swept and put in order .
42011026	Then he goes , and takes seven other spirits more evil than himself , and they enter in and dwell there . The last state of that man becomes worse than the first . "
42011027	It came to pass , as he said these things , a certain woman out of the multitude lifted up her voice , and said to him , " Blessed is the womb that bore you , and the breasts which nursed you ! "
42011028	But he said , " On the contrary , blessed are those who hear the word of God , and keep it . "
42011029	When the multitudes were gathering together to him , he began to say , " This is an evil generation . It seeks after a sign . No sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah , the prophet .
42011030	For even as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites , so will also the Son of Man be to this generation .
42011031	The Queen of the South will rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation , and will condemn them : for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon ; and behold , one greater than Solomon is here .
42011032	The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation , and will condemn it : for they repented at the preaching of Jonah , and behold , one greater than Jonah is here .
42011033	No man , when he has lit a lamp , puts it in a cellar , nor under a basket , but on the stand , that they which enter in may see the light .
42011034	The lamp of the body is the eye . Therefore when your eye is good , your whole body also is full of light ; but when it is evil , your body also is full of darkness .
42011035	Therefore see whether the light that is in you isn't darkness .
42011036	If therefore your whole body is full of light , having no part dark , it will be wholly full of light , as when the lamp with its bright shining gives you light . "
42011037	Now as he spoke , a certain Pharisee asked him to dine with him . He went in , and sat at the table .
42011038	When the Pharisee saw it , he marveled that he had not first washed himself before dinner .
42011039	The Lord said to him , " Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter , but your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness .
42011040	You foolish ones , didn't he who made the outside make the inside also ?
42011041	But give for alms those things which are within , and behold , all things will be clean to you .
42011042	But woe to you Pharisees ! For you tithe mint and rue and every herb , and bypass justice and the love of God . You ought to have done these , and not to leave the other undone .
42011043	Woe to you Pharisees ! For you love the best seats in the synagogues , and the greetings in the marketplaces .
42011044	Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! For you are like hidden graves , and the men who walk over them don't know it . "
42011045	One of the lawyers answered him , " Teacher , in saying this you insult us also . "
42011046	He said , " Woe to you lawyers also ! For you load men with burdens that are difficult to carry , and you yourselves won't even lift one finger to help carry those burdens .
42011047	Woe to you ! For you build the tombs of the prophets , and your fathers killed them .
42011048	So you testify and consent to the works of your fathers . For they killed them , and you build their tombs .
42011049	Therefore also the wisdom of God said , ' I will send to them prophets and apostles ; and some of them they will kill and persecute ,
42011050	that the blood of all the prophets , which was shed from the foundation of the world , may be required of this generation ;
42011051	from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah , who perished between the altar and the sanctuary . ' Yes , I tell you , it will be required of this generation .
42011052	Woe to you lawyers ! For you took away the key of knowledge . You didn't enter in yourselves , and those who were entering in , you hindered . "
42011053	As he said these things to them , the scribes and the Pharisees began to be terribly angry , and to draw many things out of him ;
42011054	laying in wait for him , and seeking to catch him in something he might say , that they might accuse him .
42012001	Meanwhile , when a multitude of many thousands had gathered together , so much so that they trampled on each other , he began to tell his disciples first of all , " Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees , which is hypocrisy .
42012002	But there is nothing covered up , that will not be revealed , nor hidden , that will not be known .
42012003	Therefore whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light . What you have spoken in the ear in the inner chambers will be proclaimed on the housetops .
42012004	I tell you , my friends , don't be afraid of those who kill the body , and after that have no more that they can do .
42012005	But I will warn you whom you shall fear . Fear him , who after he has killed , has power to cast into Gehenna . Yes , I tell you , fear him .
42012006	Aren't five sparrows sold for two assaria ? Not one of them is forgotten by God .
42012007	But the very hairs of your head are all numbered . Therefore don't be afraid . You are of more value than many sparrows .
42012008	I tell you , everyone who confesses me before men , him will the Son of Man also confess before the angels of God ;
42012009	but he who denies me in the presence of men will be denied in the presence of the angels of God .
42012010	Everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven , but those who blaspheme against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven .
42012011	When they bring you before the synagogues , the rulers , and the authorities , don't be anxious how or what you will answer , or what you will say ;
42012012	for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that same hour what you must say . "
42012013	One of the multitude said to him , " Teacher , tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me . "
42012014	But he said to him , " Man , who made me a judge or an arbitrator over you ? "
42012015	He said to them , " Beware ! Keep yourselves from covetousness , for a man's life doesn't consist of the abundance of the things which he possesses . "
42012016	He spoke a parable to them , saying , " The ground of a certain rich man brought forth abundantly .
42012017	He reasoned within himself , saying , ' What will I do , because I don't have room to store my crops ? '
42012018	He said , ' This is what I will do . I will pull down my barns , and build bigger ones , and there I will store all my grain and my goods .
42012019	I will tell my soul , " Soul , you have many goods laid up for many years . Take your ease , eat , drink , be merry . " '
42012020	But God said to him , ' You foolish one , tonight your soul is required of you . The things which you have prepared - - whose will they be ? '
42012021	So is he who lays up treasure for himself , and is not rich toward God . "
42012022	He said to his disciples , " Therefore I tell you , don't be anxious for your life , what you will eat , nor yet for your body , what you will wear .
42012023	Life is more than food , and the body than clothing .
42012024	Consider the ravens : they don't sow , they don't reap , they have no warehouse or barn , and God feeds them . How much more valuable are you than birds !
42012025	Which of you by being anxious can add a cubit to his height ?
42012026	If then you aren't able to do even the least things , why are you anxious about the rest ?
42012027	Consider the lilies , how they grow . They don't toil , neither do they spin ; yet I tell you , even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these .
42012028	But if this is how God clothes the grass in the field , which today exists , and tomorrow is cast into the oven , how much more will he clothe you , you of little faith ?
42012029	Don't seek what you will eat or what you will drink ; neither be anxious .
42012030	For the nations of the world seek after all of these things , but your Father knows that you need these things .
42012031	Yet seek God's kingdom , and all these things will be added to you .
42012032	Don't be afraid , little flock , for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom .
42012033	Sell that which you have , and give alms . Make for yourselves purses which don't grow old , a treasure in the heavens that doesn't fail , where no thief approaches , neither moth destroys .
42012034	For where your treasure is , there will your heart be also .
42012035	Let your loins be girded about , and your lamps burning .
42012036	Be like men looking for their lord , when he will return from the marriage feast ; that , when he comes and knocks , they may immediately open to him .
42012037	Blessed are those servants , whom the lord will find watching when he comes . Most assuredly I tell you , that he will gird himself , and make them recline , and will come and serve them .
42012038	They will be blessed if he comes in the second or third watch , and finds them so .
42012039	But know this , that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming , he would have watched , and not allowed his house to be broken into .
42012040	Therefore be ready also , for the Son of Man is coming in an hour that you don't expect him . "
42012041	Peter said to him , " Lord , are you telling this parable to us , or to everybody ? "
42012042	The Lord said , " Who then is the faithful and wise steward , whom his lord will set over his household , to give them their portion of food at the right times ?
42012043	Blessed is that servant whom his lord will find doing so when he comes .
42012044	Truly I tell you , that he will set him over all that he has .
42012045	But if that servant says in his heart , ' My lord delays his coming , ' and begins to beat the menservants and the maidservants , and to eat and drink , and to be drunken ,
42012046	then the lord of that servant will come in a day when he isn't expecting him , and in an hour that he doesn't know , and will cut him apart , and place his portion with the unfaithful .
42012047	That servant , who knew his lord's will , and didn't prepare , nor do what he wanted , will be beaten with many stripes ,
42012048	but he who didn't know , and did things worthy of stripes , will be beaten with few stripes . To whoever much is given , of him will much be required ; and to whom they deposit much , of him will they ask more .
42012049	" I came to throw fire on the earth , I wish it were already kindled .
42012050	But I have a baptism to be baptized with , and how distressed I am until it is accomplished !
42012051	Do you think that I have come to give peace in the earth ? I tell you , no , but rather division .
42012052	For from now on , there will be five in one house divided , three against two , and two against three .
42012053	They will be divided , father against son , and son against father ; mother against daughter , and daughter against her mother ; mother in law against her daughter in law , and daughter in law against her mother in law . "
42012054	He said to the multitudes also , " When you see a cloud rising from the west , immediately you say , ' A shower is coming , ' and so it happens .
42012055	When a south wind blows , you say , ' There will be a scorching heat , ' and it happens .
42012056	You hypocrites ! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky , but how is it that you don't interpret this time ?
42012057	Why don't you judge for yourselves what is right ?
42012058	For as you are going with your adversary before the magistrate , try diligently on the way to be freed from him , lest perhaps he drag you to the judge , and the judge deliver you to the officer , and the officer throw you into prison .
42012059	I tell you , you will by no means get out of there , until you have paid the very last lepton . "
42013001	Now there were some present at the same time who told him about the Galilaeans , whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices .
42013002	Jesus answered them , " Do you think that these Galilaeans were worse sinners than all the other Galilaeans , because they suffered such things ?
42013003	I tell you , no , but , unless you repent , you will all perish in the same way .
42013004	Or those eighteen , on whom the tower in Siloam fell , and killed them ; do you think that they were worse offenders than all the men who dwell in Jerusalem ?
42013005	I tell you , no , but , unless you repent , you will all perish in the same way . "
42013006	He spoke this parable . " A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard , and he came seeking fruit on it , and found none .
42013007	He said to the vine dresser , ' Behold , these three years I came seeking fruit on this fig tree , and found none . Cut it down . Why does it waste the soil ? '
42013008	He answered , ' Lord , leave it alone this year also , until I dig around it , and fertilize it .
42013009	If it bears fruit , fine ; but if not , after that , you can cut it down . ' "
42013010	He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath day .
42013011	Behold , there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years , and she was bent over , and could in no way lift herself up .
42013012	When Jesus saw her , he called her , and said to her , " Woman , you are freed from your infirmity . "
42013013	He laid his hands on her , and immediately she stood up straight , and glorified God .
42013014	The ruler of the synagogue , being moved with indignation because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath , answered to the multitude , " There are six days in which men ought to work . Therefore come on those days and be healed , and not on the Sabbath day ! "
42013015	Therefore the Lord answered him , " You hypocrites ! Doesn't each one of you free his ox or his donkey from the stall on the Sabbath , and lead him away to water ?
42013016	Ought not this woman , being a daughter of Abraham , whom Satan had bound eighteen long years , to have been freed from this bondage on the Sabbath day ? "
42013017	As he said these things , all his adversaries were put to shame , and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him .
42013018	He said , " To what is the kingdom of God like ? To what shall I compare it ?
42013019	It is like a grain of mustard seed , which a man took , and threw into his own garden . It grew , and became a large tree , and the birds of the sky lodged in the branches of it . "
42013020	Again he said , " What shall I compare to the kingdom of God ?
42013021	It is like yeast , which a woman took and hid in three sata of flour , until it was all leavened . "
42013022	He went on his way through cities and villages , teaching , and traveling on to Jerusalem .
42013023	One said to him , " Lord , are they few who are saved ? " He said to them ,
42013024	" Strive to enter in by the narrow door , for many , I tell you , will seek to enter in , and will not be able .
42013025	When once the master of the house has risen up , and has shut the door , and you begin to stand outside , and to knock at the door , saying , ' Lord , Lord , open to us ! ' then he will answer and tell you , ' I don't know you or where you come from . '
42013026	Then you will begin to say , ' We ate and drink in your presence , and you taught in our streets . '
42013027	He will say , ' I tell you , I don't know where you come from . Depart from me , all you workers of iniquity . '
42013028	There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth , when you see Abraham , Isaac , Jacob , and all the prophets , in the kingdom of God , and yourselves being thrown outside .
42013029	They will come from the east , west , north , and south , and will sit down in the kingdom of God .
42013030	Behold , there are some who are last who will be first , and there are some who are first who will be last . "
42013031	On that same day , some Pharisees came , saying to him , " Get out of here , and go away , for Herod wants to kill you . "
42013032	He said to them , " Go and tell that fox , ' Behold , I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow , and the third day I complete my mission .
42013033	Nevertheless I must go on my way today and tomorrow and the next day , for it can't be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem . '
42013034	" Jerusalem , Jerusalem , that kills the prophets , and stones those who are sent to her ! How often I wanted to gather your children together , like a hen gathers her own brood under her wings , and you refused !
42013035	Behold , your house is left to you desolate . I tell you , you will not see me , until you say , ' Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord ! ' "
42014001	It happened , when he went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a Sabbath to eat bread , that they were watching him .
42014002	Behold , a certain man who had dropsy was in front of him .
42014003	Jesus , answering , spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees , saying , " Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath ? "
42014004	But they were silent . He took him , and healed him , and let him go .
42014005	He answered them , " Which of you , if your son or an ox fell into a well , wouldn't immediately pull him out on a Sabbath day ? "
42014006	They couldn't answer him regarding these things .
42014007	He spoke a parable to those who were invited , when he noticed how they chose the best seats , and said to them ,
42014008	" When you are invited by anyone to a marriage feast , don't sit in the best seat , since perhaps a more honorable man than you might be invited by him ,
42014009	and he who invited both of you would come and tell you , ' Make room for this man . ' Then you would begin , with shame , to take the lowest place .
42014010	But when you are invited , go and sit in the lowest place , so that when he who invited you comes , he may tell you , ' Friend , move up higher . ' Then you will have glory in the presence of all who sit at the table with you .
42014011	For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled , and whoever humbles himself will be exalted . "
42014012	He also said to the one who had invited him , " When you make a dinner or a supper , don't call your friends , nor your brothers , nor your kinsmen , nor rich neighbors , or perhaps they might also return the favor , and pay you back .
42014013	But when you make a feast , ask the poor , the maimed , the lame , or the blind ;
42014014	and you will be blessed , because they don't have the resources to repay you . For you will be repaid in the resurrection of the righteous . "
42014015	When one of those who sat at the table with him heard these things , he said to him , " Blessed is he who will feast in the kingdom of God ! "
42014016	But he said to him , " A certain man made a great supper , and he invited many people .
42014017	He sent out his servant at supper time to tell those who were invited , ' Come , for everything is ready now . '
42014018	They all as one began to make excuses . The first said to him , ' I have bought a field , and I must go and see it . Please have me excused . '
42014019	Another said , ' I have bought five yoke of oxen , and I must go try them out . Please have me excused . '
42014020	Another said , ' I have married a wife , and therefore I can't come . '
42014021	That servant came , and told his lord these things . Then the master of the house , being angry , said to his servant , ' Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city , and bring in here the poor , maimed , blind , and lame . '
42014022	The servant said , ' Lord , it is done as you commanded , and there is still room . '
42014023	The lord said to the servant , ' Go out into the highways and hedges , and compel them to come in , that my house may be filled .
42014024	For I tell you that none of those men who were invited will taste of my supper . ' "
42014025	Now great multitudes went with him . He turned and said to them ,
42014026	" If any man comes to me , and doesn't hate his own father , mother , wife , children , brothers , and sisters , yes , and his own life also , he can't be my disciple .
42014027	Whoever doesn't bear his own cross , and come after me , can't be my disciple .
42014028	For which of you , desiring to build a tower , doesn't first sit down and count the cost , to see if he has enough to complete it ?
42014029	Or perhaps , when he has laid a foundation , and is not able to finish , everyone who sees begins to mock him ,
42014030	saying , ' This man began to build , and wasn't able to finish . '
42014031	Or what king , as he goes to encounter another king in war , will not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand ?
42014032	Or else , while the other is yet a great way off , he sends an envoy , and asks for conditions of peace .
42014033	So therefore whoever of you who doesn't renounce all that he has , he can't be my disciple .
42014034	Salt is good , but if the salt becomes flat and tasteless , with what do you season it ?
42014035	It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile . It is thrown out . He who has ears to hear , let him hear . "
42015001	Now all the tax collectors and sinners were coming close to him to hear him .
42015002	The Pharisees and the scribes murmured , saying , " This man welcomes sinners , and eats with them . "
42015003	He told them this parable .
42015004	" Which of you men , if you had one hundred sheep , and lost one of them , wouldn't leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness , and go after the one that was lost , until he found it ?
42015005	When he has found it , he carries it on his shoulders , rejoicing .
42015006	When he comes home , he calls together his friends and his neighbors , saying to them , ' Rejoice with me , for I have found my sheep which was lost ! '
42015007	I tell you that even so there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents , than over ninety-nine righteous people who need no repentance .
42015008	Or what woman , if she had ten drachma coins , if she lost one drachma , wouldn't light a lamp , sweep the house , and seek diligently until she found it ?
42015009	When she has found it , she calls together her friends and neighbors , saying , ' Rejoice with me , for I have found the drachma which I had lost . '
42015010	Even so , I tell you , there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner repenting . "
42015011	He said , " A certain man had two sons .
42015012	The younger of them said to his father , ' Father , give me my share of your property . ' He divided his living to them .
42015013	Not many days after , the younger son gathered all of this together and took his journey into a far country . There he wasted his property with riotous living .
42015014	When he had spent all of it , there arose a severe famine in that country , and he began to be in need .
42015015	He went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country , and he sent him into his fields to feed pigs .
42015016	He wanted to fill his belly with the husks that the pigs ate , but no one gave him any .
42015017	But when he came to himself he said , ' How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough to spare , and I'm dying with hunger !
42015018	I will get up and go to my father , and will tell him , " Father , I have sinned against heaven , and in your sight .
42015019	I am no more worthy to be called your son . Make me as one of your hired servants . " '
42015020	He arose , and came to his father . But while he was still far off , his father saw him , and was moved with compassion , and ran , and fell on his neck , and kissed him .
42015021	The son said to him , ' Father , I have sinned against heaven , and in your sight . I am no more worthy to be called your son . '
42015022	But the father said to his servants , ' Bring out the best robe , and put it on him . Put a ring on his hand , and shoes on his feet .
42015023	Bring the fattened calf , kill it , and let us eat , and celebrate ;
42015024	for this , my son , was dead , and is alive again . He was lost , and is found . ' They began to be merry .
42015025	Now his elder son was in the field . As he came and drew near to the house , he heard music and dancing .
42015026	He called one of the servants to him , and asked what was going on .
42015027	He said to him , ' Your brother has come , and your father has killed the fattened calf , because he has received him safe and sound . '
42015028	But he was angry , and would not go in . Therefore his father came out , and begged him .
42015029	But he answered his father , ' Behold , these many years I served you , and I never disobeyed a commandment of yours , and you never gave me a goat , that I might celebrate with my friends .
42015030	But when this , your son , came , who has devoured your living with prostitutes , you killed the fattened calf for him . '
42015031	He said to him , ' Son , you are always with me , and all that is mine is yours .
42015032	But it was appropriate to celebrate and be glad , for this , your brother , was dead , and is alive again . He was lost , and is found . ' "
42016001	He said also to his disciples , " There was a certain rich man , who had a manager . The same was accused to him of wasting his possessions .
42016002	He called him , and said to him , ' What is this that I hear about you ? Give an accounting of your management , for you can no longer be manager . '
42016003	The steward said within himself , ' What will I do , seeing that my lord is taking away the management position from me ? I don't have strength to dig . I am ashamed to beg .
42016004	I know what I will do , so that when I am removed from management , they may receive me into their houses . '
42016005	Calling each one of his lord's debtors to him , he said to the first , ' How much do you owe to my lord ? '
42016006	He said , ' A hundred batos of oil . ' He said to him , ' Take your bill , and sit down quickly and write fifty . '
42016007	Then said he to another , ' How much do you owe ? ' He said , ' A hundred cors of wheat . ' He said to him , ' Take your bill , and write eighty . '
42016008	His lord commended the unrighteous steward because he had done wisely , for the sons of this world are , in their own generation , wiser than the sons of the light .
42016009	I tell you , make for yourselves friends by means of unrighteous mammon , so that when you fail , they may receive you into the eternal tents .
42016010	He who is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much . He who is unrighteous in a very little is also unrighteous in much .
42016011	If therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon , who will commit to your trust the true riches ?
42016012	If you have not been faithful in that which is another's , who will give you that which is your own ?
42016013	No servant can serve two masters , for either he will hate the one , and love the other ; or else he will hold to one , and despise the other . You aren't able to serve God and mammon . "
42016014	The Pharisees , who were lovers of money , also heard all these things , and they scoffed at him .
42016015	He said to them , " You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of men , but God knows your hearts . For that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God .
42016016	The law and the prophets were until John . From that time the gospel of the kingdom of God is preached , and everyone is forcing his way into it .
42016017	But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away , than for one tiny stroke of a pen in the law to fall .
42016018	Everyone who divorces his wife , and marries another , commits adultery . He who marries one who is put away from a husband commits adultery .
42016019	" Now there was a certain rich man , and he was clothed in purple and fine linen , living in luxury every day .
42016020	A certain beggar , named Lazarus , was laid at his gate , full of sores ,
42016021	and desiring to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table . Yes , even the dogs came and licked his sores .
42016022	It happened that the beggar died , and that he was carried away by the angels to Abraham's bosom . The rich man also died , and was buried .
42016023	In Hades , he lifted up his eyes , being in torment , and saw Abraham far off , and Lazarus at his bosom .
42016024	He cried and said , ' Father Abraham , have mercy on me , and send Lazarus , that he may dip the tip of his finger in water , and cool my tongue ! For I am in anguish in this flame . '
42016025	But Abraham said , ' Son , remember that you , in your lifetime , received your good things , and Lazarus , in like manner , bad things . But now here he is comforted and you are in anguish .
42016026	Besides all this , between us and you there is a great gulf fixed , that those who want to pass from here to you are not able , and that none may cross over from there to us . '
42016027	He said , ' I ask you therefore , father , that you would send him to my father's house ;
42016028	for I have five brothers , that he may testify to them , lest they also come into this place of torment . '
42016029	But Abraham said to him , ' They have Moses and the prophets . Let them listen to them . '
42016030	He said , ' No , father Abraham , but if one goes to them from the dead , they will repent . '
42016031	He said to him , ' If they don't listen to Moses and the prophets , neither will they be persuaded if one rises from the dead . ' "
42017001	He said to the disciples , " It is impossible that occasions of stumbling should not come , but woe to him through whom they come !
42017002	It would be better for him if a millstone were hanged about his neck , and he were thrown into the sea , rather than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble .
42017003	Be careful . If your brother sins against you , rebuke him . If he repents , forgive him .
42017004	If he sins against you seven times in the day , and seven times turns again , saying , ' I repent , ' you shall forgive him . "
42017005	The apostles said to the Lord , " Increase our faith . "
42017006	The Lord said , " If you had faith as a grain of mustard seed , you would tell this sycamore tree , ' Be uprooted , and be planted in the sea , ' and it would obey you .
42017007	But who is there of you , having a servant plowing or keeping sheep , that will say , when he comes in from the field , ' Come immediately and sit down at the table , '
42017008	and will not rather tell him , ' Prepare my supper , clothe yourself properly , and serve me , while I eat and drink . Afterward you will eat and drink ? '
42017009	Does he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded ? I think not .
42017010	Even so you also , when you have done all the things that are commanded you , say , ' We are unworthy servants . We have done our duty . ' "
42017011	It happened , as he was on his way to Jerusalem , that he was passing along the borders of Samaria and Galilee .
42017012	As he entered into a certain village , ten men who were lepers met him , who stood far away .
42017013	They lifted up their voices , saying , " Jesus , Master , have mercy on us ! "
42017014	When he saw them , he said to them , " Go and show yourselves to the priests . " It happened , as they went , they were cleansed .
42017015	One of them , when he saw that he was healed , turned back , glorifying God with a loud voice .
42017016	He fell on his face at his feet , giving him thanks . He was a Samaritan .
42017017	Jesus answered , " Weren't the ten cleansed ? But where are the nine ?
42017018	Were there none found who returned to give glory to God , except this stranger ? "
42017019	He said to him , " Get up , and go your way . Your faith has healed you . "
42017020	Being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come , he answered them , " The kingdom of God doesn't come with observation ;
42017021	neither will they say , ' Look , here ! ' or , ' Look , there ! ' for behold , the kingdom of God is within you . "
42017022	He said to the disciples , " The days will come , when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man , and you will not see it .
42017023	They will tell you , ' Look , here ! ' or ' Look , there ! ' Don't go away , nor follow after them ,
42017024	for as the lightning , when it flashes out of the one part under the sky , shines to the other part under the sky ; so will the Son of Man be in his day .
42017025	But first , he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation .
42017026	As it happened in the days of Noah , even so will it be also in the days of the Son of Man .
42017027	They ate , they drank , they married , they were given in marriage , until the day that Noah entered into the ark , and the flood came , and destroyed them all .
42017028	Likewise , even as it happened in the days of Lot : they ate , they drank , they bought , they sold , they planted , they built ;
42017029	but in the day that Lot went out from Sodom , it rained fire and sulfur from the sky , and destroyed them all .
42017030	It will be the same way in the day that the Son of Man is revealed .
42017031	In that day , he who will be on the housetop , and his goods in the house , let him not go down to take them away . Let him who is in the field likewise not turn back .
42017032	Remember Lot's wife !
42017033	Whoever seeks to gain his life loses it , but whoever loses his life preserves it .
42017034	I tell you , in that night there will be two people in one bed . The one will be taken , and the other will be left .
42017035	There will be two women grinding together . The one will be taken , and the other will be left . "

42017037	They answering , asked him , " Where , Lord ? " He said to them , " Where the body is , there will the vultures also be gathered together . "
42018001	He also spoke a parable to them that they must always pray , and not give up ,
42018002	saying , " A certain judge was in a city , who didn't fear God , and didn't respect man .
42018003	A widow was in that city , and she came often to him , saying , ' Defend me from my adversary ! '
42018004	He wouldn't for a while , but afterward he said to himself , ' Though I don't fear God , nor respect man ,
42018005	yet because this widow bothers me , I will defend her , or else she will wear me out by her continual coming . ' "
42018006	The Lord said , " Listen to what the unrighteous judge says .
42018007	Won't God avenge his elect , who are crying out to him day and night , and yet he exercises patience with them ?
42018008	I tell you that he will avenge them quickly . Nevertheless , when the Son of Man comes , will he find faith on the earth ? "
42018009	He spoke also this parable to certain people who were convinced of their own righteousness , and who despised all others .
42018010	" Two men went up into the temple to pray ; one was a Pharisee , and the other was a tax collector .
42018011	The Pharisee stood and prayed to himself like this : ' God , I thank you , that I am not like the rest of men , extortioners , unrighteous , adulterers , or even like this tax collector .
42018012	I fast twice in the week . I give tithes of all that I get . '
42018013	But the tax collector , standing far away , wouldn't even lift up as his eyes to heaven , but beat his breast , saying , ' God , be merciful to me , a sinner ! '
42018014	I tell you , this man went down to his house justified rather than the other ; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled , but he who humbles himself will be exalted . "
42018015	They were also bringing their babies to him , that he might touch them . But when the disciples saw it , they rebuked them .
42018016	Jesus called them near , saying , " Allow the little children to come to me , and don't hinder them , for the kingdom of God belongs to ones like these .
42018017	Most assuredly , I tell you , whoever doesn't receive the kingdom of God like a little child , he will in no way enter into it . "
42018018	A certain ruler asked him , saying , " Good Teacher , what do I do to inherit eternal life ? "
42018019	Jesus asked him , " Why do you call me good ? No one is good , except one - - God .
42018020	You know the commandments : ' Don't commit adultery , ' ' Don't murder , ' ' Don't steal , ' ' Don't give false testimony , ' ' Honor your father and your mother . ' "
42018021	He said , " I have observed all these things from my youth up . "
42018022	When Jesus heard these things , he said to him , " You still lack one thing . Sell all that you have , and distribute it to the poor . You will have treasure in heaven . Come , follow me . "
42018023	But when he heard these things , he became very sad , for he was very rich .
42018024	Jesus , seeing that he became very sad , said , " How hard it is for those who have riches to enter into the kingdom of God !
42018025	For it is easier for a camel to enter in through a needle's eye , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God . "
42018026	Those who heard it said , " Then who can be saved ? "
42018027	But he said , " The things which are impossible with men are possible with God . "
42018028	Peter said , " Look , we have left everything , and followed you . "
42018029	He said to them , " Most assuredly I tell you , there is no one who has left house , or wife , or brothers , or parents , or children , for the kingdom of God's sake ,
42018030	who will not receive many times more in this time , and in the world to come , eternal life . "
42018031	He took the twelve aside , and said to them , " Behold , we are going up to Jerusalem , and all the things that are written through the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be completed .
42018032	For he will be delivered up to the Gentiles , will be mocked , treated shamefully , and spit on .
42018033	They will scourge and kill him . On the third day , he will rise again . "
42018034	They understood none of these things . This saying was hidden from them , and they didn't understand the things that were said .
42018035	It happened , as he came near Jericho , a certain blind man sat by the road , begging .
42018036	Hearing a multitude going by , he asked what this meant .
42018037	They told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by .
42018038	He cried out , " Jesus , you son of David , have mercy on me ! "
42018039	Those who led the way rebuked him , that he should be quiet ; but he cried out all the more , " You son of David , have mercy on me ! "
42018040	Jesus , standing , commanded him to be brought to him . When he had come near , he asked him ,
42018041	" What do you want me to do ? " He said , " Lord , that I may see again . "
42018042	Jesus said to him , " Receive your sight . Your faith has healed you . "
42018043	Immediately he received his sight , and followed him , glorifying God . All the people , when they saw it , praised God .
42019001	He entered and was passing through Jericho .
42019002	There was a man named Zacchaeus . He was a chief tax collector , and he was rich .
42019003	He was trying to see who Jesus was , and couldn't because of the crowd , because he was short .
42019004	He ran on ahead , and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him , for he was to pass that way .
42019005	When Jesus came to the place , he looked up and saw him , and said to him , " Zacchaeus , hurry and come down , for today I must stay at your house . "
42019006	He hurried , came down , and received him joyfully .
42019007	When they saw it , they all murmured , saying , " He has gone in to lodge with a man who is a sinner . "
42019008	Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord , " Behold , Lord , half of my goods I give to the poor . If I have wrongfully exacted anything of anyone , I restore four times as much . "
42019009	Jesus said to him , " Today , salvation has come to this house , because he also is a son of Abraham .
42019010	For the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was lost . "
42019011	As they heard these things , he went on and told a parable , because he was near Jerusalem , and they supposed that the kingdom of God would be revealed immediately .
42019012	He said therefore , " A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom , and to return .
42019013	He called ten servants of his , and gave them ten minas , and told them , ' Conduct business until I come . '
42019014	But his citizens hated him , and sent an envoy after him , saying , ' We don't want this man to reign over us . '
42019015	It happened , when he had come back again , having received the kingdom , that he commanded these servants , to whom he had given the money , to be called to him , that he might know what they had gained by conducting business .
42019016	The first came before him , saying , ' Lord , your mina has made ten more minas . '
42019017	He said to him , ' Well done , you good servant ! Because you were found faithful in a very little , you shall have authority over ten cities . '
42019018	The second came , saying , ' Your mina , Lord , has made five minas . '
42019019	He said to him also , ' You also are to be over five cities . '
42019020	Another came , saying , ' Lord , behold , your mina , which I kept laid away in a handkerchief ,
42019021	for I feared you , because you are an exacting man . You take up that which didn't lay down , and reap that which you didn't sow . '
42019022	He said to him , ' Out of your own mouth will I judge you , you wicked servant ! You knew that I am an exacting man , taking up that which I didn't lay down , and reaping that which I didn't sow .
42019023	Then why didn't you deposit my money in the bank , and I at my coming might have earned interest on it ? '
42019024	He said to those who stood by , ' Take the mina away from him , and give it to him who has the ten minas . '
42019025	They said to him , ' Lord , he has ten minas ! '
42019026	' For I tell you that to everyone who has , will more be given ; but from him who doesn't have , even that which he has will be taken away from him .
42019027	But bring those enemies of mine who didn't want me to reign over them here , and kill them before me . ' "
42019028	When he had thus spoken , he went on ahead , going up to Jerusalem .
42019029	It happened , when he drew near to Bethsphage and Bethany , at the mountain that is called Olivet , he sent two of his disciples ,
42019030	saying , " Go your way into the village on the other side , in which , as you enter , you will find a colt tied , whereon no man ever yet sat . Untie him , and bring him .
42019031	If anyone asks you , ' Why are you untying it ? ' say to him : ' The Lord needs it . ' "
42019032	Those who were sent went away , and found things just as he had told them .
42019033	As they were untying the colt , the owners of it said to them , ' Why are you untying the colt ? '
42019034	They said , ' The Lord needs it . '
42019035	They brought it to Jesus . They threw their cloaks on the colt , and set Jesus on them .
42019036	As he went , they spread their cloaks in the way .
42019037	As he was now getting near , at the descent of the Mount of Olives , the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works which they had seen ,
42019038	saying , " Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord ! Peace in heaven , and glory in the highest ! "
42019039	Some of the Pharisees from the multitude said to him , " Teacher , rebuke your disciples ! "
42019040	He answered them , " I tell you that if these were silent , the stones would cry out . "
42019041	When he drew near , he saw the city and wept over it ,
42019042	saying , " If you , even you , had known today the things which belong to your peace ! But now , they are hidden from your eyes .
42019043	For the days will come on you , when your enemies will throw up a barricade against you , surround you , hem you in on every side ,
42019044	and will dash you and your children within you to the ground . They will not leave in you one stone on another , because you didn't know the time of your visitation . "
42019045	He entered into the temple , and began to drive out those who bought and sold in it ,
42019046	saying to them , " It is written , ' My house is a house of prayer , ' but you have made it a ' den of robbers ' ! "
42019047	He was teaching daily in the temple , but the chief priests and the scribes and the leading men among the people sought to destroy him .
42019048	They couldn't find what they might do , for all the people hung on to every word that he said .
42020001	It happened on one of those days , as he was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the gospel , that the chief priests and scribes came to him with the elders .
42020002	They asked him , " Tell us : by what authority do you do these things ? Or who is giving you this authority ? "
42020003	He answered them , " I also will ask you one question . Tell me :
42020004	the baptism of John , was it from heaven , or from men ? "
42020005	They reasoned with themselves , saying , " If we say , ' From heaven , ' he will say , ' Why didn't you believe him ? '
42020006	But if we say , ' From men , ' all the people will stone us , for they are persuaded that John was a prophet . "
42020007	They answered that they didn't know where it was from .
42020008	Jesus said to them , " Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things . "
42020009	He began to tell the people this parable . " A man planted a vineyard , and rented it out to some farmers , and went into another country for a long time .
42020010	At the proper season , he sent a servant to the farmers to collect his share of the fruit of the vineyard . But the farmers beat him , and sent him away empty .
42020011	He sent yet another servant , and they also beat him , and treated him shamefully , and sent him away empty .
42020012	He sent yet a third , and they also wounded him , and threw him out .
42020013	The lord of the vineyard said , ' What will I do ? I will send my beloved son . It may be that seeing him , they will respect him . '
42020014	But when the farmers saw him , they reasoned among themselves , saying , ' This is the heir . Come , let's kill him , that the inheritance may be ours . '
42020015	They threw him out of the vineyard , and killed him . What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them ?
42020016	He will come and destroy these farmers , and will give the vineyard to others . " When they heard it , they said , " God forbid ! "
42020017	But he looked at them , and said , " Then what is this that is written , ' The stone which the builders rejected , The same was made the chief cornerstone ? '
42020018	" Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces , but it will crush whoever it falls on to dust . "
42020019	The chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on Him that very hour , but they feared the people - - for they knew He had spoken this parable against them .
42020020	They watched him , and sent out spies , who pretended to be righteous , that they might trap him in something he said , so as to deliver him up to the rule and to the authority of the governor .
42020021	They asked him , " Teacher , we know that you say and teach what is right , and aren't partial to anyone , but truly teach the way of God .
42020022	Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar , or not ? "
42020023	But he perceived their slyness , and said to them , " Why do you test me ?
42020024	Show me a denarius . Whose image and inscription are on it ? " They answered , " Caesar's . "
42020025	He said to them , " Then give to Caesar the things that are Caesar's , and to God the things that are God's . "
42020026	They weren't able to trap him in his words before the people . They marveled at his answer , and were silent .
42020027	Some of the Sadducees came to him , those who deny that there is a resurrection .
42020028	They asked him , " Teacher , Moses wrote to us that if a man's brother dies having a wife , and he is childless , his brother should take the wife , and raise up children for his brother .
42020029	There were therefore seven brothers . The first took a wife , and died childless .
42020030	The second took her as wife , and he died childless .
42020031	The third took her , and likewise the seven all left no children , and died .
42020032	Afterward the woman also died .
42020033	Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them will she be ? For the seven had her as a wife . "
42020034	Jesus said to them , " The sons of this age marry , and are given in marriage .
42020035	But those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the dead , neither marry , nor are given in marriage .
42020036	For neither can they die any more , for they are like the angels , and are sons of God , being sons of the resurrection .
42020037	But that the dead are raised , even Moses showed at the bush , when he called the Lord ' The God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . '
42020038	Now he is not the God of the dead , but of the living , for all are alive to him . "
42020039	Some of the scribes answered , " Teacher , you speak well . "
42020040	They didn't dare to ask him any more questions .
42020041	He said to them , " Why do they say that the Christ is David's son ?
42020042	David himself says in the book of Psalms , ' The Lord said to my Lord , " Sit at my right hand ,
42020043	Until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet . " '
42020044	" David therefore calls him Lord , so how is he his son ? "
42020045	In the hearing of all the people , he said to his disciples ,
42020046	" Beware of the scribes , who desire to walk in long robes , and love greetings in the marketplaces , the best seats in the synagogues , and the best places at feasts ;
42020047	who devour widows ' houses , and for a pretense make long prayers : these will receive greater condemnation . "
42021001	He looked up , and saw the rich people who were putting their gifts into the treasury .
42021002	He saw a certain poor widow casting in two lepta .
42021003	He said , " Truly I tell you , this poor widow put in more than all of them ,
42021004	for all these put in gifts for God from their abundance , but she , out of her lack , put in all that she had to live on . "
42021005	As some were talking about the temple and how it was decorated with beautiful stones and gifts , he said ,
42021006	" As for these things which you see , the days will come , in which there will not be left here one stone on another that will not be thrown down . "
42021007	They asked him , " Teacher , when therefore will these things be ? What is the sign that these things are about to happen ? "
42021008	He said , " Watch out that you don't get led astray , for many will come in my name , saying , ' I AM , ' and , ' The time is at hand . ' Therefore don't follow them .
42021009	When you hear of wars and disturbances , don't be terrified , for these things must happen first , but the end won't come immediately . "
42021010	Then he said to them , " Nation will rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom .
42021011	There will be great earthquakes , famines , and plagues in various places . There will be terrors and great signs from heaven .
42021012	But before all these things , they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you , delivering you up to synagogues and prisons , bringing you before kings and governors for my name's sake .
42021013	It will turn out as a testimony to you .
42021014	Settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate beforehand how to answer ,
42021015	for I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries will not be able to withstand or to contradict .
42021016	But you will be handed over even by parents , brothers , relatives , and friends . Some of you will they cause to be put to death .
42021017	You will be hated by all men for my name's sake .
42021018	Not a hair of your head will perish .
42021019	By your endurance you will win your souls .
42021020	" But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies , then know that its desolation is at hand .
42021021	Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains . Let them who are in the midst of her depart . Don't let those who are in the country enter therein .
42021022	For these are days of vengeance , that all things which are written may be fulfilled .
42021023	Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who nurse infants in those days ! For there will be great distress in the land , and wrath to this people .
42021024	They will fall by the edge of the sword , and will be led captive into all the nations . Jerusalem will be trampled down by the Gentiles , until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled .
42021025	There will be signs in the sun , moon , and stars ; and on the earth anxiety of nations , in perplexity for the roaring of the sea and the waves ;
42021026	men fainting for fear , and for expectation of the things which are coming on the world : for the powers of the heavens will be shaken .
42021027	Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory .
42021028	But when these things begin to happen , look up , and lift up your heads , because your redemption is near . "
42021029	He told them a parable . " See the fig tree , and all the trees .
42021030	When they are already budding , you see it and know by your own selves that the summer is already near .
42021031	Even so you also , when you see these things happening , know that the kingdom of God is near .
42021032	Most assuredly I tell you , this generation will not pass away until all things are accomplished .
42021033	Heaven and earth will pass away , but my words will by no means pass away .
42021034	" So be careful , or your hearts will be loaded down with carousing , drunkenness , and cares of this life , and that day will come on you suddenly .
42021035	For it will come like a snare on all those who dwell on the surface of all the earth .
42021036	Therefore be watchful all the time , asking that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things that will happen , and to stand before the Son of Man . "
42021037	Every day Jesus was teaching in the temple , and every night he went out , and spent the night on the mountain that is called Olivet .
42021038	All the people came early in the morning to him in the temple , to hear him .
42022001	Now the feast of unleavened bread drew near , which is called the Passover .
42022002	The chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put him to death , for they feared the people .
42022003	Satan entered into Judas , who was called Iscariot , being numbered with the twelve .
42022004	He went away , and talked with the chief priests and captains about how he might deliver him to them .
42022005	They were glad , and agreed to give him money .
42022006	He consented , and sought an opportunity to deliver him to them in the absence of the multitude .
42022007	The day of unleavened bread came , on which the Passover must be sacrificed .
42022008	He sent Peter and John , saying , " Go and prepare the Passover for us , that we may eat . "
42022009	They said to him , " Where do you want us to prepare ? "
42022010	He said to them , " Behold , when you have entered into the city , a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you . Follow him into the house which he enters .
42022011	Tell the master of the house , ' The Teacher says to you , " Where is the guest room , where I may eat the Passover with my disciples ? " '
42022012	He will show you a large , furnished upper room . Make preparations there . "
42022013	They went , found things as he had told them , and they prepared the Passover .
42022014	When the hour had come , he sat down with the twelve apostles .
42022015	He said to them , " I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer ,
42022016	for I tell you , I will no longer by any means eat of it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God . "
42022017	He received a cup , and when he had given thanks , he said , " Take this , and share it among yourselves ,
42022018	for I tell you , I will not drink at all again from the fruit of the vine , until the kingdom of God comes . "
42022019	He took bread , and when he had given thanks , he broke it , and gave to them , saying , " This is my body which is given for you . Do this in memory of me . "
42022020	He took the cup in like manner after supper , saying , " This cup is the new covenant in my blood , that which is poured out for you .
42022021	But behold , the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table .
42022022	The Son of Man indeed goes , as it has been determined , but woe to that man through whom he is betrayed ! "
42022023	They began to question among themselves , which of them it was that would do this thing .
42022024	There arose also a contention among them , which of them was considered to be greatest .
42022025	He said to them , " The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them , and those who have authority over them are called ' benefactors . '
42022026	But not so with you . But one who is the greater among you , let him become as the lesser , and one who is governing , as one who serves .
42022027	For who is greater , one who sits at the table , or one who serves ? Isn't it he who sits at the table ? But I am in the midst of you as one who serves .
42022028	But you are those who have continued with me in my temptations .
42022029	I appoint to you a kingdom , even as my Father appointed to me ,
42022030	that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom . You will sit on thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel . "
42022031	The Lord said , " Simon , Simon , behold , Satan asked to have you , that he might sift you as wheat ,
42022032	but I prayed for you , that your faith wouldn't fail . You , when once you have turned again , establish your brothers . "
42022033	He said to him , " Lord , I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death ! "
42022034	He said , " I tell you , Peter , the rooster will by no means crow today , before you deny that you know me three times . "
42022035	He said to them , " When I sent you out without purse , and wallet , and shoes , did you lack anything ? " They said , " Nothing . "
42022036	Then he said to them , " But now , whoever has a purse , let him take it , and likewise a wallet . Whoever has none , let him sell his cloak , and buy a sword .
42022037	For I tell you that this which is written must still be fulfilled in me : ' He was counted with the lawless . ' For that which concerns me has an end . "
42022038	They said , " Lord , behold , here are two swords . " He said to them , " That is enough . "
42022039	He came out , and went , as his custom was , to the Mount of Olives . His disciples also followed him .
42022040	When he was at the place , he said to them , " Pray that you don't enter into temptation . "
42022041	He was withdrawn from them about a stone's throw , and he knelt down and prayed ,
42022042	saying , " Father , if you are willing , remove this cup from me . Nevertheless , not my will , but yours , be done . "
42022043	An angel from heaven appeared to him , strengthening him .
42022044	Being in agony he prayed more earnestly . His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground .
42022045	When he rose up from his prayer , he came to the disciples , and found them sleeping because of grief ,
42022046	and said to them , " Why do you sleep ? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation . "
42022047	While he was still speaking , behold , a multitude , and he who was called Judas , one of the twelve , went in front of them . He came near to Jesus to kiss him .
42022048	But Jesus said to him , " Judas , do you betray the Son of Man with a kiss ? "
42022049	When those who were around him saw what was about to happen , they said , " Lord , shall we strike with the sword ? "
42022050	A certain one of them struck the servant of the high priest , and cut off his right ear .
42022051	But Jesus answered , " Let me at least do this " - - and he touched his ear , and healed him .
42022052	Jesus said to the chief priests , captains of the temple , and elders , who had come against him , " Have you come out as against a robber , with swords and clubs ?
42022053	When I was with you in the temple daily , you didn't stretch out your hands against me . But this is your hour , and the power of darkness . "
42022054	They seized him , and led him away , and brought him into the high priest's house . But Peter followed from a distance .
42022055	When they had kindled a fire in the midst of the court , and had sat down together , Peter sat in the midst of them .
42022056	A certain servant girl saw him as he sat in the light , and looking intently at him , said , " This man also was with him . "
42022057	He denied Jesus , saying , " Woman , I don't know him . "
42022058	After a little while someone else saw him , and said , " You also are one of them ! " But Peter answered , " Man , I am not ! "
42022059	After about one hour passed , another confidently affirmed , saying , " Truly this man also was with him , for he is a Galilean ! "
42022060	But Peter said , " Man , I don't know what you are talking about ! " Immediately , while he was still speaking , a rooster crowed .
42022061	The Lord turned , and looked at Peter . Peter remembered the Lord's word , how he said to him , " Before the rooster crows you will deny me three times . "
42022062	He went out , and wept bitterly .
42022063	The men who held Jesus mocked him and beat him .
42022064	Having blindfolded him , they struck him on the face and asked him , " Prophesy ! Who is the one who struck you ? "
42022065	They spoke many other things against him , insulting him .
42022066	As soon as it was day , the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together , both chief priests and scribes , and they led him away into their council , saying ,
42022067	" If you are the Christ , tell us . " But he said to them , " If I tell you , you won't believe ,
42022068	and if I ask , you will in no way answer me or let me go .
42022069	From now on , the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God . "
42022070	They all said , " Are you then the Son of God ? " He said to them , " You say it , because I AM . "
42022071	They said , " Why do we need any more witness ? For we ourselves have heard from his own mouth ! "
42023001	The whole company of them rose up and brought him before Pilate .
42023002	They began to accuse him , saying , " We found this man perverting the nation , forbidding paying taxes to Caesar , and saying that he himself is Christ , a king . "
42023003	Pilate asked him , " Are you the King of the Jews ? " He answered him , " So you say . "
42023004	Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes , " I find no basis for a charge against this man . "
42023005	But they insisted , saying , " He stirs up the people , teaching throughout all Judea , beginning from Galilee even to this place . "
42023006	But when Pilate heard Galilee mentioned , he asked if the man was a Galilean .
42023007	When he found out that he was in Herod's jurisdiction , he sent him to Herod , who was also in Jerusalem in those days .
42023008	Now when Herod saw Jesus , he was exceedingly glad , for he had wanted to see him for a long time , because he had heard many things about him . He hoped to see some miracle done by him .
42023009	He questioned him with many words , but he gave no answers .
42023010	The chief priests and the scribes stood , vehemently accusing him .
42023011	Herod with his soldiers humiliated him and mocked him . Dressing him in luxurious clothing , they sent him back to Pilate .
42023012	Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day , for before that they were enemies with each other .
42023013	Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people ,
42023014	and said to them , " You brought this man to me as one that perverts the people , and see , I have examined him before you , and found no basis for a charge against this man concerning those things of which you accuse him .
42023015	Neither has Herod , for I sent you to him , and see , nothing worthy of death has been done by him .
42023016	I will therefore chastise him and release him . "
42023017	Now he had to release one prisoner to them at the feast .
42023018	But they all cried out together , saying , " Away with this man ! Release to us Barabbas ! " - -
42023019	one who was thrown into prison for a certain revolt in the city , and for murder .
42023020	Pilate spoke to them again , desiring to release Jesus ,
42023021	but they shouted , saying , " Crucify ! Crucify him ! "
42023022	He said to them the third time , " Why ? What evil has this man done ? I have found no capital crime in him . I will therefore chastise him and release him . "
42023023	But they were urgent with loud voices , asking that he might be crucified . Their voices and the voices of the chief priests prevailed .
42023024	Pilate adjudged that what they asked for should be done .
42023025	He released him who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder , for whom they asked , but he delivered Jesus up to their will .
42023026	When they led him away , they grabbed one Simon of Cyrene , coming from the country , and laid on him the cross , to carry it after Jesus .
42023027	A great multitude of the people followed him , including women who also mourned and lamented him .
42023028	But Jesus , turning to them , said , " Daughters of Jerusalem , don't weep for me , but weep for yourselves and for your children .
42023029	For behold , the days are coming in which they will say , ' Blessed are the barren , the wombs that never bore , and the breasts that never nursed . '
42023030	Then will they begin to tell the mountains , ' Fall on us ! ' and to the hills , ' Cover us . '
42023031	For if they do these things in the green tree , what will be done in the dry ? "
42023032	There were also others , two criminals , led with him to be put to death .
42023033	When they came to the place that is called The Skull , they crucified him there with the criminals , one on the right and the other on the left .
42023034	Jesus said , " Father , forgive them , for they don't know what they are doing . " Dividing his garments among them , they cast lots .
42023035	The people stood watching . The rulers with them also scoffed at him , saying , " He saved others . Let him save himself , if this is the Christ of God , his chosen one ! "
42023036	The soldiers also mocked him , coming to him and offering him vinegar ,
42023037	and saying , " If you are the King of the Jews , save yourself ! "
42023038	An inscription was also written over him in letters of Greek , Latin , and Hebrew : " THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS . "
42023039	One of the criminals who was hanged insulted him , saying , " If you are the Christ , save yourself and us ! "
42023040	But the other answered , and rebuking him said , " Don't you even fear God , seeing you are in the same condemnation ?
42023041	And we indeed justly , for we receive the due reward for our deeds , but this man has done nothing wrong . "
42023042	He said to Jesus , " Lord , remember me when you come into your kingdom . "
42023043	He said to him , " Most assuredly I tell you , today you will be with me in Paradise . "
42023044	It was now about the sixth hour , and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour .
42023045	The sun was darkened , and the veil of the temple was torn in two .
42023046	Jesus , crying with a loud voice , said , " Father , into your hands I commit my spirit ! " Having said this , he breathed his last .
42023047	When the centurion saw what was done , he glorified God , saying , " Certainly this was a righteous man . "
42023048	All the multitudes that came together to see this , when they saw the things that were done , returned beating their breasts .
42023049	All his acquaintances , and the women who followed with him from Galilee , stood far away , watching these things .
42023050	Behold , a man named Joseph , who was a member of the council , a good and righteous man
42023051	( he had not consented to their counsel and deed ) , from Arimathaea , a city of the Jews , who was also waiting for the kingdom of God :
42023052	this man went to Pilate , and asked for Jesus ' body .
42023053	He took it down , and wrapped it in a linen cloth , and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone , where no man had ever yet lain .
42023054	It was the day of the Preparation , and the Sabbath was coming on .
42023055	The women , who had come with him out of Galilee , followed after , and saw the tomb , and how his body was laid .
42023056	They returned , and prepared spices and ointments . On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment .
42024001	But on the first day of the week , at early dawn , they and some others came to the tomb , bringing the spices which they had prepared .
42024002	They found the stone rolled away from the tomb .
42024003	They entered in , and didn't find the Lord Jesus ' body .
42024004	It happened , while they were greatly perplexed about this , behold , two men stood by them in dazzling clothing .
42024005	Becoming terrified , they bowed their faces down to the earth . They said to them , " Why do you seek the living among the dead ?
42024006	He isn't here , but is risen . Remember what he told you when he was still in Galilee ,
42024007	saying that the Son of Man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men , and be crucified , and the third day rise again ? "
42024008	They remembered his words ,
42024009	returned from the tomb , and told all these things to the eleven , and to all the rest .
42024010	Now they were Mary Magdalene , Joanna , and Mary the mother of James . The other women with them told these things to the apostles .
42024011	These words seemed to them to be nonsense , and they didn't believe them .
42024012	But Peter got up and ran to the tomb . Stooping and looking in , he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves , and he departed to his home , wondering what had happened .
42024013	Behold , two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus , which was sixty stadia from Jerusalem .
42024014	They talked with each other about all of these things which had happened .
42024015	It happened , while they talked and questioned together , that Jesus himself came near , and went with them .
42024016	But their eyes were kept from recognizing him .
42024017	He said to them , " What are you talking about as you walk , and are sad ? "
42024018	One of them , named Cleopas , answered him , " Are you the only one travelling in Jerusalem who doesn't know the things which have happened there in these days ? "
42024019	He said to them , " What things ? " They said to him , " The things concerning Jesus , the Nazarene , who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people ;
42024020	and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death , and crucified him .
42024021	But we hoped that it was he who would redeem Israel . Yes , and besides all this , it is now the third day since these things happened .
42024022	Also , certain women of our company amazed us , having been early at the tomb ;
42024023	and when they didn't find his body , they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels , who said that he was alive .
42024024	Some of us went to the tomb , and found it just like the women had said , but they didn't see him . "
42024025	He said to them , " Foolish men , and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken !
42024026	Didn't the Christ have to suffer these things , and to enter into his glory ? "
42024027	Beginning from Moses and from all the prophets , he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself .
42024028	They drew near to the village , where they were going , and he acted like he would go further .
42024029	They urged him , saying , " Stay with us , for it is almost evening , and the day is almost over . " He went in to stay with them .
42024030	It happened , when he had sat down at the table with them , he took the bread and gave thanks . Breaking it , he gave to them .
42024031	Their eyes were opened , and they recognized him , and he vanished out of their sight .
42024032	They said one to another , " Wasn't our heart burning within us , while he spoke to us along the way , and while he opened the scriptures to us ? "
42024033	They rose up that very hour , and returned to Jerusalem , and found the eleven gathered together , and those who were with them ,
42024034	saying , " The Lord is risen indeed , and has appeared to Simon ! "
42024035	They related the things that happened along the way , and how he was recognized by them in the breaking of the bread .
42024036	As they said these things , Jesus himself stood in the midst of them , and said to them , " Peace be to you . "
42024037	But they were terrified and filled with fear , and supposed that they saw a spirit .
42024038	He said to them , " Why are you troubled ? Why do questionings arise in your hearts ?
42024039	See my hands and my feet , that it is I myself . Touch me and see , for a spirit doesn't have flesh and bones , as you see that I have . "
42024040	When he had said this , he showed them his hands and his feet .
42024041	While they still didn't believe for joy , and wondered , he said to them , " Do you have anything here to eat ? "
42024042	They gave him a piece of a broiled fish and some honeycomb .
42024043	He took it , and ate in front of them .
42024044	He said to them , " This is what I told you , while I was still with you , that all things must be fulfilled , which are written in the law of Moses , the prophets , and the psalms , concerning me . "
42024045	Then he opened their minds , that they might understand the scriptures .
42024046	He said to them , " Thus it is written , and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day ,
42024047	and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations , beginning at Jerusalem .
42024048	You are witnesses of these things .
42024049	Behold , I send forth the promise of my Father on you . But wait in the city of Jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high . "
42024050	He led them out as far as to Bethany , and he lifted up his hands , and blessed them .
42024051	It happened , while he blessed them , that he withdrew from them , and was carried up into heaven .
42024052	They worshipped him , and returned to Jerusalem with great joy ,
42024053	and were continually in the temple , praising and blessing God . Amen .
43001001	In the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God .
43001002	The same was in the beginning with God .
43001003	All things were made through him . Without him was not anything made that has been made .
43001004	In him was life , and the life was the light of men .
43001005	The light shines in the darkness , and the darkness hasn't overcome it .
43001006	There came a man , sent from God , whose name was John .
43001007	The same came as a witness , that he might testify about the light , that all might believe through him .
43001008	He was not the light , but was sent that he might testify about the light .
43001009	The true light that enlightens everyone was coming into the world .
43001010	He was in the world , and the world was made through him , and the world didn't recognize him .
43001011	He came to his own , and those who were his own didn't receive him .
43001012	But as many as received him , to them he gave the right to become God's children , to those who believe in his name :
43001013	who were born , not of blood , nor of the will of the flesh , nor of the will of man , but of God .
43001014	The Word became flesh , and lived among us . We saw his glory , such glory as of the only Son of the Father , full of grace and truth .
43001015	John testified about him . He cried out , saying , " This was he of whom I said , ' He who comes after me has surpassed me , for he was before me . ' "
43001016	From his fullness we all received grace upon grace .
43001017	For the law was given through Moses . Grace and truth came through Jesus Christ .
43001018	No one has seen God at any time . The only conceived Son , who is in the bosom of the Father , he has declared him .
43001019	This is John's testimony , when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him , " Who are you ? "
43001020	He confessed , and didn't deny , but he confessed , " I am not the Christ . "
43001021	They asked him , " What then ? Are you Elijah ? " He said , " I am not . " " Are you the prophet ? " He answered , " No . "
43001022	They said therefore to him , " Who are you ? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us . What do you say about yourself ? "
43001023	He said , " I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness , ' Make straight the way of the Lord , ' as Isaiah the prophet said . "
43001024	The ones who had been sent were from the Pharisees .
43001025	They asked him , " Why then do you baptize , if you are not the Christ , nor Elijah , nor the Prophet ? "
43001026	John answered them , " I baptize in water , but among you stands one whom you don't know ,
43001027	he who comes after me , whose sandal strap I'm not worthy to untie . "
43001028	These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan , where John was baptizing .
43001029	On the next day , he saw Jesus coming to him , and said , " Behold , the Lamb of God , who takes away the sin of the world !
43001030	This is he of whom I said , ' After me comes a man who is preferred before me , for he was before me . '
43001031	I didn't know him , but for this reason I came baptizing in water : that he would be revealed to Israel . "
43001032	John testified , saying , " I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove out of heaven , and it remained on him .
43001033	I didn't recognize him , but he who sent me to baptize in water , he said to me , ' On whoever you will see the Spirit descending , and remaining on him , the same is he who baptizes in the Holy Spirit . '
43001034	I have seen , and have testified that this is the Son of God . "
43001035	Again , on the next day , John was standing with two of his disciples ,
43001036	and he looked at Jesus as he walked , and said , " Behold , the Lamb of God ! "
43001037	The two disciples heard him speak , and they followed Jesus .
43001038	Jesus turned , and saw them following , and said to them , " What are you looking for ? " They said to him , " Rabbi " ( which is to say , being interpreted , Teacher ) , " where are you staying ? "
43001039	He said to them , " Come , and see . " They came and saw where he was staying , and they stayed with him that day . It was about the tenth hour .
43001040	One of the two who heard John , and followed him , was Andrew , Simon Peter's brother .
43001041	He first found his own brother , Simon , and said to him , " We have found the Messiah ! " ( which is , being interpreted , Christ ) .
43001042	He brought him to Jesus . Jesus looked at him , and said , " You are Simon the son of Jonah . You shall be called Cephas " ( which is by interpretation , Peter ) .
43001043	On the next day , he was determined to go forth into Galilee , and he found Philip . Jesus said to him , " Follow me . "
43001044	Now Philip was from Bethsaida , of the city of Andrew and Peter .
43001045	Philip found Nathanael , and said to him , " We have found him , of whom Moses in the law , and the prophets , wrote : Jesus of Nazareth , the son of Joseph . "
43001046	Nathanael said to him , " Can any good thing come out of Nazareth ? " Philip said to him , " Come and see . "
43001047	Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him , and said about him , " Behold , an Israelite indeed , in whom is no deceit ! "
43001048	Nathanael says to him , " How do you know me ? " Jesus answered him , " Before Philip called you , when you were under the fig tree , I saw you . "
43001049	Nathanael answered him , " Rabbi , you are the Son of God ! You are King of Israel ! "
43001050	Jesus answered him , " Because I told you , ' I saw you underneath the fig tree , ' do you believe ? You will see greater things than these . "
43001051	He said to him , " Most assuredly , I tell you , hereafter you will see heaven opened , and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man . "
43002001	The third day , there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee . Jesus ' mother was there .
43002002	Jesus also was invited , with his disciples , to the marriage .
43002003	When the wine ran out , Jesus ' Mother said to him , " They have no wine . "
43002004	Jesus said to her , " Woman , what does that have to do with you and me ? My hour has not yet come . "
43002005	His mother said to the servants , " Whatever he says to you , do it . "
43002006	Now there were six water pots of stone set there after the Jews ' manner of purifying , containing two or three metretes apiece .
43002007	Jesus said to them , " Fill the water pots with water . " They filled them up to the brim .
43002008	He said to them , " Now draw some out , and take it to the ruler of the feast . " They took it .
43002009	When the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine , and didn't know where it came from ( but the servants who had drawn the water knew ) , the ruler of the feast called the bridegroom ,
43002010	and said to him , " Everyone serves the good wine first , and when the guests have drunk freely , then that which is worse . You have kept the good wine until now ! "
43002011	This beginning of his signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee , and revealed his glory . His disciples believed in him .
43002012	After this , he went down to Capernaum , he , and his mother , his brothers , and his disciples ; and there they stayed not many days .
43002013	The Passover of the Jews was at hand , and Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
43002014	He found in the temple those who sold oxen , sheep , and doves , and the changers of money sitting .
43002015	He made a whip of cords , and threw all out of the temple , both the sheep and the oxen ; and he poured out the changers ' money , and overthrew their tables .
43002016	To those who sold the doves , he said , " Take these things out of here ! Don't make my Father's house a marketplace ! "
43002017	His disciples remembered that it was written , " Zeal for your house will eat me up . "
43002018	The Jews therefore answered him , " What sign do you show to us , seeing that you do these things ? "
43002019	Jesus answered them , " Destroy this temple , and in three days I will raise it up . "
43002020	The Jews therefore said , " Forty-six years was this temple in building , and will you raise it up in three days ? "
43002021	But he spoke of the temple of his body .
43002022	When therefore he was raised from the dead , his disciples remembered that he said this , and they believed the scripture , and the word which Jesus had said .
43002023	Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover , during the feast , many believed in his name , observing his signs which he did .
43002024	But Jesus didn't trust himself to them , because he knew all people ,
43002025	and because he didn't need for anyone to testify concerning man ; for he himself knew what was in man .
43003001	Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus , a ruler of the Jews .
43003002	The same came to him by night , and said to him , " Rabbi , we know that you are a teacher come from God , for no one can do these signs that you do , unless God is with him . "
43003003	Jesus answered him , " Most assuredly , I tell you , unless one is born anew , he can't see the kingdom of God . "
43003004	Nicodemus said to him , " How can a man be born when he is old ? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb , and be born ? "
43003005	Jesus answered , " Most assuredly I tell you , unless one is born of water and the Spirit , he can't enter into the kingdom of God !
43003006	That which is born of the flesh is flesh . That which is born of the Spirit is spirit .
43003007	Don't marvel that I said to you , ' You must be born anew . '
43003008	The wind blows where it wants to , and you hear its sound , but don't know where it comes from and where it is going . So is everyone who is born of the Spirit . "
43003009	Nicodemus answered him , " How can these things be ? "
43003010	Jesus answered him , " Are you the teacher of Israel , and don't understand these things ?
43003011	Most assuredly I tell you , we speak that which we know , and testify of that which we have seen , and you don't receive our witness .
43003012	If I told you earthly things and you don't believe , how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things ?
43003013	No one has ascended into heaven , but he who descended out of heaven , the Son of Man , who is in heaven .
43003014	As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness , even so must the Son of Man be lifted up ,
43003015	that whoever believes in him should not perish , but have eternal life .
43003016	For God so loved the world , that he gave his one and only Son , that whoever believes in him should not perish , but have eternal life .
43003017	For God didn't send his Son into the world to judge the world , but that the world should be saved through him .
43003018	He who believes in him is not judged . He who doesn't believe has been judged already , because he has not believed in the name of the only born Son of God .
43003019	This is the judgment , that the light has come into the world , and men loved the darkness rather than the light ; for their works were evil .
43003020	For everyone who does evil hates the light , and doesn't come to the light , for fear that his works would be reproved .
43003021	But he who does the truth comes to the light , that his works may be revealed , that they have been done with God . "
43003022	After these things , Jesus came with his disciples into the land of Judea . He stayed there with them , and baptized .
43003023	John also was baptizing in Enon near Salim , because there was much water there . They came , and were baptized .
43003024	For John was not yet thrown into prison .
43003025	There arose therefore a questioning on the part of John's disciples with some Jews about purification .
43003026	They came to John , and said to him , " Rabbi , he who was with you beyond the Jordan , to whom you have testified , behold , the same baptizes , and all men come to him . "
43003027	John answered , " A man can receive nothing , unless it has been given him from heaven .
43003028	You yourselves testify about me , that I said , ' I am not the Christ , ' but , ' I have been sent before him . '
43003029	He who has the bride is the bridegroom ; but the friend of the bridegroom , who stands and hears him , rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice . This , my joy , therefore is made full .
43003030	He must increase , but I must decrease .
43003031	He who comes from above is above all . He who is from the Earth belongs to the Earth , and speaks of the Earth . He who comes from heaven is above all .
43003032	What he has seen and heard , of that he testifies ; and no one receives his witness .
43003033	He who has received his witness has set his seal to this , that God is true .
43003034	For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God ; for God gives the Spirit without measure .
43003035	The Father loves the Son , and has given all things into his hand .
43003036	He who believes in the Son has eternal life , but he who disobeys the Son won't see life , but the wrath of God remains on him . "
43004001	Therefore when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John
43004002	( although Jesus himself didn't baptize , but his disciples ) ,
43004003	he left Judea , and departed again into Galilee .
43004004	He needed to pass through Samaria .
43004005	So he came to a city of Samaria , called Sychar , near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son , Joseph .
43004006	Jacob's well was there . Jesus therefore , being tired from his journey , sat down by the well . It was about the sixth hour .
43004007	A woman of Samaria came to draw water . Jesus said to her , " Give me a drink . "
43004008	For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food .
43004009	The Samaritan woman therefore said to him , " How is it that you , being a Jew , ask for a drink from me , a Samaritan woman ? " ( For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans . )
43004010	Jesus answered her , " If you knew the gift of God , and who it is who says to you , ' Give me a drink , ' you would have asked him , and he would have given you living water . "
43004011	The woman said to him , " Sir , you have nothing to draw with , and the well is deep . From where then have you that living water ?
43004012	Are you greater than our father , Jacob , who gave us the well , and drank of it himself , as did his sons , and his cattle ? "
43004013	Jesus answered her , " Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again ,
43004014	but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst ; but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life . "
43004015	The woman said to him , " Sir , give me this water , so that I don't get thirsty , neither come all the way here to draw . "
43004016	Jesus said to her , " Go , call your husband , and come here . "
43004017	The woman answered , " I have no husband . " Jesus said to her , " You said well , ' I have no husband , '
43004018	for you have had five husbands ; and he whom you now have is not your husband . This you have said truly . "
43004019	The woman said to him , " Sir , I perceive that you are a prophet .
43004020	Our fathers worshipped in this mountain , and you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship . "
43004021	Jesus said to her , " Woman , believe me , the hour comes , when neither in this mountain , nor in Jerusalem , will you worship the Father .
43004022	You worship that which you don't know . We worship that which we know ; for salvation is from the Jews .
43004023	But the hour comes , and now is , when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth , for the Father seeks such to be his worshippers .
43004024	God is a Spirit , and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth . "
43004025	The woman said to him , " I know that Messiah comes , " ( he who is called Christ ) . " When he has come , he will declare to us all things . "
43004026	Jesus said to her , " I who speak to you am he . "
43004027	At this , his disciples came . They marveled that he was speaking with a woman ; yet no one said , " What are you looking for ? " or , " Why do you speak with her ? "
43004028	So the woman left her water pot , and went away into the city , and said to the people ,
43004029	" Come , see a man who told me everything that I did . Can this be the Christ ? "
43004030	They went out of the city , and were coming to him .
43004031	In the meanwhile , the disciples urged him , saying , " Rabbi , eat . "
43004032	But he said to them , " I have food to eat that you don't know about . "
43004033	The disciples therefore said one to another , " Has anyone brought him something to eat ? "
43004034	Jesus said to them , " My food is to do the will of him who sent me , and to accomplish his work .
43004035	Don't you say , ' There are yet four months until the harvest ? ' Behold , I tell you , lift up your eyes , and look at the fields , that they are white already to harvest .
43004036	He who reaps receives wages , and gathers fruit to eternal life ; that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together .
43004037	For in this the saying is true , ' One sows , and another reaps . '
43004038	I sent you to reap that for which you haven't labored . Others have labored , and you have entered into their labor . "
43004039	From that city many of the Samaritans believed in him because of the word of the woman , who testified , ' He told me everything that I did . "
43004040	So when the Samaritans came to him , they begged him to stay with them . He stayed there two days .
43004041	Many more believed because of his word .
43004042	They said to the woman , " Now we believe , not because of your speaking ; for we have heard for ourselves , and know that this is indeed the Christ , the Savior of the world . "
43004043	After the two days he went forth from there and went into Galilee .
43004044	For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country .
43004045	So when he came into Galilee , the Galilaeans received him , having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast , for they also went to the feast .
43004046	He came therefore again to Cana of Galilee , where he made the water into wine . There was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum .
43004047	When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee , he went to him , and begged him that he would come down and heal his son , for he was at the point of death .
43004048	Jesus therefore said to him , " Unless you see signs and wonders , you will in no way believe . "
43004049	The nobleman said to him , " Sir , come down before my child dies . "
43004050	Jesus said to him , " Go your way . Your son lives . " The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him , and he went his way .
43004051	As he was now going down , his servants met him and reported , saying " your child lives ! "
43004052	So he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better . They said therefore to him , " Yesterday at the seventh hour , the fever left him . "
43004053	So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said to him , " Your son lives . " He believed , as did his whole house .
43004054	This is again the second sign that Jesus did , having come out of Judea into Galilee .
43005001	After these things , there was a feast of the Jews , and Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
43005002	Now in Jerusalem by the sheep gate , there is a pool , which is called in Hebrew , " Bethesda , " having five porches .
43005003	In these lay a great multitude of those who were sick , blind , lame , or paralyzed , waiting for the moving of the water ;
43005004	for an angel of the Lord went down at certain times into the pool , and stirred up the water . Whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water was made whole of whatever disease he was afflicted with .
43005005	A certain man was there , who had been sick for thirty-eight years .
43005006	When Jesus saw him lying there , and knew that he had been sick for a long time , he asked him , " Do you want to be made well ? "
43005007	The sick man answered him , " Sir , I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up , but while I'm coming , another steps down before me . "
43005008	Jesus said to him , " Arise , take up your mat , and walk . "
43005009	Immediately , the man was made well , and took up his mat and walked . Now it was the Sabbath on that day .
43005010	So the Jews said to him who was cured , " It is the Sabbath . It is not lawful for you to carry your mat . "
43005011	He answered them , " He who made me well , the same said to me , ' Take up your mat , and walk . ' "
43005012	Then they asked him , " Who is the man who said to you , ' Take up your mat , and walk ' ? "
43005013	But he who was healed didn't know who it was , for Jesus had withdrawn , a crowd being in the place .
43005014	Afterward Jesus found him in the temple , and said to him , " Behold , you are made well . Sin no more , so that nothing worse happens to you . "
43005015	The man went away , and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well .
43005016	For this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus , and sought to kill him , because he did these things on the Sabbath .
43005017	But Jesus answered them , " My Father is still working , so I am working , too . "
43005018	For this cause therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him , because he not only broke the Sabbath , but also called God his own Father , making himself equal with God .
43005019	Jesus therefore answered them , " Most assuredly , I tell you , the Son can do nothing of himself , but what he sees the Father doing . For whatever things he does , these the Son also does likewise .
43005020	For the Father loves the Son , and shows him all things that he himself does . He will show him greater works than these , that you may marvel .
43005021	For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life , even so the Son also gives life to whom he desires .
43005022	For neither does the Father judge any man , but he has given all judgment to the Son ,
43005023	that all may honor the Son , even as they honor the Father . He who doesn't honor the Son doesn't honor the Father who sent him .
43005024	Most assuredly I tell you , he who hears my word , and believes him who sent me , has eternal life , and doesn't come into judgment , but has passed out of death into life .
43005025	Most assuredly , I tell you , the hour comes , and now is , when the dead will hear the Son of God's voice ; and those who hear will live .
43005026	For as the Father has life in himself , even so he gave to the Son also to have life in himself .
43005027	He also gave him authority to execute judgment , because he is a son of man .
43005028	Don't marvel at this , for the hour comes , in which all that are in the tombs will hear his voice ,
43005029	and will come forth ; those who have done good , to the resurrection of life ; and those who have done evil , to the resurrection of judgment .
43005030	I can of myself do nothing . As I hear , I judge , and my judgment is righteous ; because I don't seek my own will , but the will of my Father who sent me .
43005031	" If I testify about myself , my witness is not valid .
43005032	It is another who testifies about me . I know that the testimony which he testifies about me is true .
43005033	You have sent to John , and he has testified to the truth .
43005034	But the testimony which I receive is not from man . However , I say these things that you may be saved .
43005035	He was the lamp that burns and shines , and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light .
43005036	But the testimony which I have is greater than that of John , for the works which the Father has given me to accomplish , the very works that I do , testify about me , that the Father has sent me .
43005037	The Father himself , who sent me , has testified about me . You have neither heard his voice at any time , nor seen his form .
43005038	You don't have his word living in you ; for whom he sent , him you don't believe .
43005039	You search the scriptures , because you think that in them you have eternal life ; and these are they which testify about me .
43005040	Yet you will not come to me , that you may have life .
43005041	I don't receive glory from men .
43005042	But I know you , that you don't have God's love in yourselves .
43005043	I have come in my Father's name , and you don't receive me . If another comes in his own name , you will receive him .
43005044	How can you believe , who receive glory from one another , and you don't seek the glory that comes from the only God ?
43005045	" Don't think that I will accuse you to the Father . There is one who accuses you , even Moses , on whom you have set your hope .
43005046	For if you believed Moses , you would believe me ; for he wrote about me .
43005047	But if you don't believe his writings , how will you believe my words ? "
43006001	After these things , Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee , which is also called the Sea of Tiberias .
43006002	A great multitude followed him , because they saw the signs which he did on those who were sick .
43006003	Jesus went up into the mountain , and he sat there with his disciples .
43006004	Now the Passover , the feast of the Jews , was at hand .
43006005	Jesus therefore lifting up his eyes , and seeing that a great multitude was coming to him , said to Philip , " Where are we to buy bread , that these may eat ? "
43006006	This he said to test him , for he himself knew what he would do .
43006007	Philip answered him , " Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them , that everyone of them may receive a little . "
43006008	One of his disciples , Andrew , Simon Peter's brother , said to him ,
43006009	" There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish , but what are these among so many ? "
43006010	Jesus said , " Have the people sit down . " Now there was much grass in that place . So the men sat down , in number about five thousand .
43006011	Jesus took the loaves ; and having given thanks , he distributed to the disciples , and the disciples to those who were sitting down ; likewise also of the fish as much as they desired .
43006012	When they were filled , he said to his disciples , " Gather up the broken pieces which are left over , that nothing be lost . "
43006013	So they gathered them up , and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves , which were left over by those who had eaten .
43006014	When therefore the people saw the sign which Jesus did , they said , " This is truly the prophet who comes into the world . "
43006015	Jesus therefore , perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force , to make him king , withdrew again into the mountain by himself .
43006016	When evening came , his disciples went down to the sea ,
43006017	and they entered into the boat , and were going over the sea to Capernaum . It was now dark , and Jesus had not come to them .
43006018	The sea was rising by reason of a great wind that blew .
43006019	When therefore they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia , they saw Jesus walking on the sea , and drawing near to the boat ; and they were afraid .
43006020	But he said to them , " It is I . Don't be afraid . "
43006021	They were willing therefore to receive him into the boat . Immediately the boat was at the land where they were going .
43006022	On the next day , the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there , except the one which his disciples had entered , and that Jesus hadn't entered with his disciples into the boat , but his disciples went away alone .
43006023	However boats from Tiberias came near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks .
43006024	When the multitude therefore saw that Jesus wasn't there , neither his disciples , they themselves got into the boats , and came to Capernaum , seeking Jesus .
43006025	When they found him on the other side of the sea , they asked him , " Rabbi , when did you come here ? "
43006026	Jesus answered them , " Most assuredly I tell you , you seek me , not because you saw signs , but because you ate of the loaves , and were filled .
43006027	Don't work for the food which perishes , but for the food which remains to eternal life , which the Son of Man will give to you . For the Father , even God , has sealed him . "
43006028	They said therefore to him , " What must we do , that we may work the works of God ? "
43006029	Jesus answered them , " This is the work of God , that you believe in him whom he has sent . "
43006030	They said therefore to him , " What then do you do for a sign , that we may see , and believe you ? What work do you do ?
43006031	Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness . As it is written , ' He gave them bread out of the sky to eat . ' "
43006032	Jesus therefore said to them , " Most assuredly , I tell you , it wasn't Moses who gave you the bread out of heaven , but my Father gives you the true bread out of heaven .
43006033	For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven , and gives life to the world . "
43006034	They said therefore to him , " Lord , always give us this bread . "
43006035	Jesus said to them . " I am the bread of life . He who comes to me will not be hungry , and he who believes in me will never be thirsty .
43006036	But I told you that you have seen me , and yet don't believe .
43006037	All that which the Father gives me will come to me . Him who comes to me I will in no way throw out .
43006038	For I have come down from heaven , not to do my own will , but the will of him who sent me .
43006039	This is the will of my Father who sent me , that of all who he has given to me I should lose nothing , but should raise them up at the last day .
43006040	This is the will of the one who sent me , that everyone who sees the Son , and believes in him , should have eternal life ; and I will raise him up at the last day . "
43006041	The Jews therefore murmured concerning him , because he said , " I am the bread which came down out of heaven . "
43006042	They said , " Isn't this Jesus , the son of Joseph , whose father and mother we know ? How then does he say , ' I have come down out of heaven ? ' "
43006043	Therefore Jesus answered them , " Don't murmur among yourselves .
43006044	No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him , and I will raise him up in the last day .
43006045	It is written in the prophets , ' They will all be taught by God . ' Everyone who hears from the Father , and has learned , comes to me .
43006046	Not that any man has seen the Father , except he who is from God . He has seen the Father .
43006047	Most assuredly , I tell you , he who believes in me has eternal life .
43006048	I am the bread of life .
43006049	Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness , and they died .
43006050	This is the bread which comes down out of heaven , that a man may eat of it , and not die .
43006051	I am the living bread which came down out of heaven . If anyone eats of this bread , he will live forever . Yes , the bread which I will give is my flesh , for the life of the world . "
43006052	The Jews therefore contended with one another , saying , " How can this man give us his flesh to eat ? "
43006053	Jesus therefore said to them , " Most assuredly I tell you , unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood , you don't have life in yourselves .
43006054	He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life , and I will raise him up at the last day .
43006055	For my flesh is food indeed , and my blood is drink indeed .
43006056	He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me , and I in him .
43006057	As the living Father sent me , and I live because of the Father ; so he who feeds on me , he will also live because of me .
43006058	This is the bread which came down out of heaven - - not as our fathers ate the manna , and died . He who eats this bread will live forever . "
43006059	These things he said in the synagogue , as he taught in Capernaum .
43006060	Therefore many of his disciples , when they heard this , said , " This is a hard saying ! Who can hear it ? "
43006061	But Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this , said to them , " Does this cause you to stumble ?
43006062	What if you would see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before ?
43006063	It is the spirit who gives life . The flesh profits nothing . The words that I speak to you are spirit , and are life .
43006064	But there are some of you who don't believe . " For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who didn't believe , and who it was who would betray him .
43006065	He said , " For this cause have I said to you that no one can come to me , except it be given to him by my Father . "
43006066	At this , many of his disciples went back , and walked no more with him .
43006067	Jesus said therefore to the twelve , " You don't also want to go away , do you ? "
43006068	Simon Peter answered him , " Lord , to whom would we go ? You have the words of eternal life .
43006069	We have come to believe and know that you are the Christ , the Son of the living God . "
43006070	Jesus answered them , " Didn't I choose you , the twelve , and one of you is a devil ? "
43006071	Now he spoke of Judas , the son of Simon Iscariot , for it was he who would betray him , being one of the twelve .
43007001	After these things , Jesus walked in Galilee , for he would not walk in Judea , because the Jews sought to kill him .
43007002	Now the feast of the Jews , the Feast of Booths , was at hand .
43007003	His brothers therefore said to him , " Depart from here , and go into Judea , that your disciples also may see your works which you do .
43007004	For no man does anything in secret , and himself seeks to be known openly . If you do these things , reveal yourself to the world . "
43007005	For even his brothers didn't believe in him .
43007006	Jesus therefore said to them , " My time has not yet come , but your time is always ready .
43007007	The world can't hate you , but it hates me , because I testify about it , that its works are evil .
43007008	You go up to the feast . I am not yet going up to this feast , because my time is not yet fulfilled . "
43007009	Having said these things to them , he stayed in Galilee .
43007010	But when his brothers had gone up to the feast , then he also went up , not publicly , but as it were in secret .
43007011	The Jews therefore sought him at the feast , and said , " Where is he ? "
43007012	There was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him . Some said , " He is a good man . " Others said , " Not so , but he leads the multitude astray . "
43007013	Yet no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews .
43007014	But when it was now the midst of the feast , Jesus went up into the temple and taught .
43007015	The Jews therefore marveled , saying , " How does this man know letters , having never been educated ? "
43007016	Jesus therefore answered them , " My teaching is not mine , but his who sent me .
43007017	If anyone desires to do his will , he will know of the teaching , whether it is from God , or if I speak from myself .
43007018	He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory , but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him , the same is true , and no unrighteousness is in him .
43007019	Didn't Moses give you the law , and yet none of you keeps the law ? Why do you seek to kill me ? "
43007020	The multitude answered , " You have a demon ! Who seeks to kill you ? "
43007021	Jesus answered them , " I did one work , and you all marvel because of it .
43007022	Moses has given you circumcision ( not that it is of Moses , but of the fathers ) , and on the Sabbath you circumcise a boy .
43007023	If a boy receives circumcision on the Sabbath , that the law of Moses may not be broken , are you angry with me , because I made a man every bit whole on the Sabbath ?
43007024	Don't judge according to appearance , but judge righteous judgment . "
43007025	Some therefore of them of Jerusalem said , " Isn't this he whom they seek to kill ?
43007026	Behold , he speaks openly , and they say nothing to him . Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is truly the Christ ?
43007027	However we know where this man comes from , but when the Christ comes , no one will know where he comes from . "
43007028	Jesus therefore cried out in the temple , teaching and saying , " You both know me , and know where I am from . I have not come of myself , but he who sent me is true , whom you don't know .
43007029	I know him , because I am from him , and he sent me . "
43007030	They sought therefore to take him . No one laid a hand on him , because his hour was not yet come .
43007031	But of the multitude , many believed in him . They said , " When the Christ comes , will he do more signs than those which this man has done ? "
43007032	The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him , and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to take him .
43007033	Then Jesus said , " Yet a little while , am I with you , then I go to him who sent me .
43007034	You will seek me , and won't find me ; and where I am , you can't come . "
43007035	The Jews therefore said among themselves , " Where will this man go that we won't find him ? Will he go to the Dispersion among the Greeks , and teach the Greeks ?
43007036	What is this word that he said , ' You will seek me , and won't find me ; and where I am , you can't come ? ' "
43007037	Now on the last and greatest day of the feast , Jesus stood and cried out , " If anyone is thirsty , let him come to me and drink !
43007038	He who believes in me , as the scripture has said , from within him will flow rivers of living water . "
43007039	But he said this about the Spirit , which those believing in him were to receive . For the Holy Spirit was not yet given , because Jesus wasn't yet glorified .
43007040	Many of the multitude therefore , when they heard these words , said , " This is truly the prophet . "
43007041	Others said , " This is the Christ . " But some said , " What , does the Christ come out of Galilee ?
43007042	Hasn't the scripture said that the Christ comes of the seed of David , and from Bethlehem , the village where David was ? "
43007043	So there arose a division in the multitude because of him .
43007044	Some of them would have taken him , but no one laid hands on him .
43007045	The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees , and they said to them , " Why didn't you bring him ? "
43007046	The officers answered , " No man ever spoke like this man ! "
43007047	The Pharisees therefore answered them , " Are you also led astray ?
43007048	Has any of the rulers believed in him , or of the Pharisees ?
43007049	But this cursed multitude doesn't know the law . "
43007050	Nicodemus ( he who came to him by night , being one of them ) said to them ,
43007051	" Does our law judge a man , unless it first hears from him personally and knows what he does ? "
43007052	They answered him , " Are you also from Galilee ? Search , and see that no prophet has arisen out of Galilee . "
43007053	Everyone went to his own house ,
43008001	but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives .
43008002	At dawn , he came again into the temple , and all the people came to him . He sat down , and taught them .
43008003	The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman taken in adultery . Having set her in the midst ,
43008004	they told him , " Teacher , we found this woman in adultery , in the very act .
43008005	Now in our law , Moses commanded us to stone such . What then do you say about her ? "
43008006	They said this testing him , that they might have something to accuse him of . But Jesus stooped down , and wrote on the ground with his finger , as if he didn't hear .
43008007	But when they continued asking him , he lifted himself up , and said to them , " He who is without sin among you , let him throw the first stone at her . "
43008008	Again he stooped down , and with his finger wrote on the ground .
43008009	They , when they heard it , being convicted by their conscience , went out one by one , beginning from the oldest , even to the last . Jesus was left alone with the woman where she was , in the midst .
43008010	Jesus lifted himself up , and seeing no one but the woman , said to her , " Woman , where are they ? Did no one condemn you ? "
43008011	She said , " No one , Lord . " Jesus said , " Neither do I condemn you . Go your way . From now on , sin no more . "
43008012	Again , therefore , Jesus spoke to them , saying , " I am the light of the world . He who follows me will not walk in the darkness , but will have the light of life . "
43008013	The Pharisees therefore said to him , " You testify about yourself . Your witness is not valid . "
43008014	Jesus answered them , " Even if I testify about myself , my witness is true , for I know where I came from , and where I am going ; but you don't know where I came from , or where I am going .
43008015	You judge according to the flesh . I judge no one .
43008016	Even if I do judge , my judgment is true , for I am not alone , but I am with the Father who sent me .
43008017	It's also written in your law that the testimony of two men is valid .
43008018	I am he who testifies about myself , and the Father who sent me testifies about me . "
43008019	They said therefore to him , " Where is your Father ? " Jesus answered , " You know neither me , nor my Father . If you knew me , you would know my Father also . "
43008020	Jesus spoke these words in the treasury , as he taught in the temple . No one took him , because his hour had not yet come .
43008021	Jesus said therefore again to them , " I am going away , and you will seek me , and will die in your sins . Where I go , you can't come . "
43008022	The Jews therefore said , " Will he kill himself , that he says , ' Where I am going , you can't come ? ' "
43008023	He said to them , " You are from beneath . I am from above . You are of this world . I am not of this world .
43008024	I said therefore to you that you will die in your sins ; for unless you believe that I am he , you will die in your sins . "
43008025	They said therefore to him , " Who are you ? " Jesus said to them , " Just what I have been saying to you from the beginning .
43008026	I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you . However he who sent me is true ; and the things which I heard from him , these I say to the world . "
43008027	They didn't perceive that he spoke to them about the Father .
43008028	Jesus therefore said to them , " When you have lifted up the Son of Man , then will you know that I am he , and that I do nothing of myself , but as my Father taught me , I say these things .
43008029	He who sent me is with me . The Father hasn't left me alone , for I always do the things that are pleasing to him . "
43008030	As he spoke these things , many believed in him .
43008031	Jesus therefore said to those Jews who had believed him , " If you remain in my word , then you are truly my disciples .
43008032	You will know the truth , and the truth will make you free . "
43008033	They answered him , " We are Abraham's seed , and have never yet been in bondage to anyone . How do you say , ' You will be made free ? ' "
43008034	Jesus answered them , " Most assuredly I tell you , everyone who commits sin is the bondservant of sin .
43008035	A bondservant doesn't live in the house forever . A son remains forever .
43008036	If therefore the Son makes you free , you will be free indeed .
43008037	I know that you are Abraham's seed , yet you seek to kill me , because my word finds no place in you .
43008038	I say the things which I have seen with my Father ; and you also do the things which you have seen with your father . "
43008039	They answered him , " Our father is Abraham . " Jesus said to them , " If you were Abraham's children , you would do the works of Abraham .
43008040	But now you seek to kill me , a man who has told you the truth , which I heard from God . Abraham didn't do this .
43008041	You do the works of your father . " They said to him , " We were not born of sexual immorality . We have one Father , God . "
43008042	Therefore Jesus said to them , " If God were your Father , you would love me , for I came forth and have come from God . For neither have I come of myself , but he sent me .
43008043	Why don't you understand my speech ? Because you can't hear my word .
43008044	You are of your Father , the devil , and it is your desire to do the lusts of your father . He was a murderer from the beginning , and doesn't stand in the truth , because there is no truth in him . When he speaks a lie , he speaks of his own ; for he is a liar , and the father of it .
43008045	But because I tell the truth , you don't believe me .
43008046	Which of you convicts me of sin ? If I tell the truth , why do you not believe me ?
43008047	He who is of God hears the words of God . For this cause you don't hear , because you are not of God . "
43008048	Then the Jews answered him , " Don't we say well that you are a Samaritan , and have a demon ? "
43008049	Jesus answered , " I don't have a demon , but I honor my Father , and you dishonor me .
43008050	But I don't seek my own glory . There is one who seeks and judges .
43008051	Most assuredly , I tell you , if a person keeps my word , he will never see death . "
43008052	Then the Jews said to him , " Now we know that you have a demon . Abraham died , and the prophets ; and you say , ' If a man keeps my word , he will never taste of death . '
43008053	Are you greater than our father , Abraham , who died ? The prophets died . Who do you make yourself out to be ? "
43008054	Jesus answered , " If I glorify myself , my glory is nothing . It is my Father who glorifies me , of whom you say that he is our God .
43008055	You have not known him , but I know him . If I said , ' I don't know him , ' I would be like you , a liar . But I know him , and keep his word .
43008056	Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day . He saw it , and was glad . "
43008057	The Jews therefore said to him , " You are not yet fifty years old , and have you seen Abraham ? "
43008058	Jesus said to them , " Most assuredly , I tell you , before Abraham was born , I AM . "
43008059	They took up stones therefore to throw at him , but Jesus hid himself , and went out of the temple , going through the midst of them , and so passed by .
43009001	As he passed by , he saw a man blind from his birth .
43009002	His disciples asked him , " Rabbi , who sinned , this man or his parents , that he was born blind ? "
43009003	Jesus answered , " Neither did this man sin , nor his parents . But , that the works of God might be revealed in him ,
43009004	I must work the works of him who sent me , while it is day . The night is coming , when no one can work .
43009005	When I am in the world , I am the light of the world . "
43009006	When he had said this , he spat on the ground , made mud with the saliva , anointed the blind man's eyes with the mud ,
43009007	and said to him , " Go , wash in the pool of Siloam " ( which means " Sent " ) . So he went away , washed , and came seeing .
43009008	The neighbors therefore , and those who saw that he was blind , before , said , " Isn't this he who sat and begged ? "
43009009	Others said , " It is he . " Still others said , " He is like him . " He said , " I am he . "
43009010	They said therefore to him , " How were your eyes opened ? "
43009011	He answered , " A man called Jesus made mud , anointed my eyes , and said to me , " Go to the pool of Siloam , and wash . " So I went away and washed , and I received sight . "
43009012	Then they asked him , " Where is he ? " He said , " I don't know . "
43009013	They brought him who before was blind to the Pharisees .
43009014	It was a Sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes .
43009015	Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight . He said to them , " He put mud on my eyes , I washed , and I see . "
43009016	Some therefore of the Pharisees said , " This man is not from God , because he doesn't keep the Sabbath . " Others said , " How can a man who is a sinner do such signs ? " There was division among them .
43009017	Therefore they asked the blind man again , " What do you say about him , in that he opened your eyes ? " He said , " He is a prophet . "
43009018	The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him , that he had been blind , and had received his sight , until they called the parents of him who had received his sight ,
43009019	and asked them , " Is this your son , who you say was born blind ? How then does he now see ? "
43009020	His parents answered them , " We know that this is our son , and that he was born blind ;
43009021	but how he now sees , we don't know ; or who opened his eyes , we don't know . He is of age . Ask him . He will speak for himself . "
43009022	His parents said these things because they feared the Jews ; for the Jews had already agreed that if any man would confess him as Christ , he would be put out of the synagogue .
43009023	Therefore his parents said , " He is of age . Ask him . "
43009024	So they called the man who was blind a second time , and said to him , " Give glory to God . We know that this man is a sinner . "
43009025	He therefore answered , " I don't know if he is a sinner . One thing I know : that though I was blind , now I see . "
43009026	They said to him again , " What did he do to you ? How did he open your eyes ? "
43009027	He answered them , " I told you already , and you didn't listen . Why do you want to hear it again ? Do you also want to become his disciples ? "
43009028	They became abusive towards him and said , " You are his disciple , but we are disciples of Moses .
43009029	We know that God has spoken to Moses . But as for this man , we don't know where he comes from . "
43009030	The man answered them , " How amazing ! You don't know where he comes from , yet he opened my eyes .
43009031	We know that God doesn't listen to sinners , but if anyone is a worshipper of God , and does his will , he listens to him .
43009032	Since the world began it has never been heard of that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind .
43009033	If this man were not from God , he could do nothing . "
43009034	They answered him , " You were altogether born in sins , and do you teach us ? " They threw him out .
43009035	Jesus heard that they had thrown him out , and finding him , he said , " Do you believe in the Son of God ? "
43009036	He answered , " Who is he , Lord , that I may believe in him ? "
43009037	Jesus said to him , " You have both seen him , and it is he who speaks with you . "
43009038	He said , " Lord , I believe ! " and he worshipped him .
43009039	Jesus said , " I came into this world for judgment , that those who don't see may see ; and that those who see may become blind . "
43009040	Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things , and said to him , " Are we also blind ? "
43009041	Jesus said to them , " If you were blind , you would have no sin ; but now you say , ' We see . ' Therefore your sin remains .
43010001	" Most assuredly , I tell you , he who doesn't enter by the door into the sheep fold , but climbs up some other way , the same is a thief and a robber .
43010002	But he who enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep .
43010003	The gatekeeper opens the gate for him , and the sheep listen to his voice . He calls his own sheep by name , and leads them out .
43010004	Whenever he brings out his own sheep , he goes before them , and the sheep follow him , for they know his voice .
43010005	They will by no means follow a stranger , but will flee from him ; for they don't know the voice of strangers . "
43010006	Jesus spoke this parable to them , but they didn't understand what he was telling them .
43010007	Jesus therefore said to them again , " Most assuredly , I tell you , I am the sheep's door .
43010008	All who came before me are thieves and robbers , but the sheep didn't listen to them .
43010009	I am the door . If anyone enters in by me , he will be saved , and will go in and go out , and will find pasture .
43010010	The thief only comes to steal , kill , and destroy . I came that they may have life , and may have it abundantly .
43010011	I am the good shepherd . The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep .
43010012	He who is a hired hand , and not a shepherd , who doesn't own the sheep , sees the wolf coming , leaves the sheep , and flees . The wolf snatches the sheep , and scatters them .
43010013	The hired hand flees because he is a hired hand , and doesn't care for the sheep .
43010014	I am the good shepherd . I know my own , and I'm known by my own ;
43010015	even as the Father knows me , and I know the Father . I lay down my life for the sheep .
43010016	I have other sheep , which are not of this fold . I must bring them also , and they will hear my voice . They will become one flock with one shepherd .
43010017	Therefore the Father loves me , because I lay down my life , that I may take it again .
43010018	No one takes it away from me , but I lay it down by myself . I have power to lay it down , and I have power to take it again . I received this commandment from my Father . "
43010019	Therefore a division arose again among the Jews because of these words .
43010020	Many of them said , " He has a demon , and is mad ! Why do you listen to him ? "
43010021	Others said , " These are not the sayings of one possessed with a demon . Can a demon open the eyes of the blind ? "
43010022	It was the Feast of the Dedication at Jerusalem .
43010023	It was winter , and Jesus was walking in the temple , in Solomon's porch .
43010024	The Jews therefore came around him and said to him , " How long will you hold us in suspense ? If you are the Christ , tell us plainly . "
43010025	Jesus answered them , " I told you , and you don't believe . The works that I do in my Father's name , these testify about me .
43010026	But you don't believe , because you are not of my sheep , as I told you .
43010027	My sheep hear my voice , and I know them , and they follow me .
43010028	I give eternal life to them . They will never perish , and no one will snatch them out of my hand .
43010029	My Father , who has given them to me , is greater than all . No one is able to snatch them out of my Father's hand .
43010030	I and the Father are one . "
43010031	Therefore Jews took up stones again to stone him .
43010032	Jesus answered them , " I have shown you many good works from my Father . For which of those works do you stone me ? "
43010033	The Jews answered him , " We don't stone you for a good work , but for blasphemy : because you , being a man , make yourself God . "
43010034	Jesus answered them , " Isn't it written in your law , ' I said , you are gods ? '
43010035	If he called them gods , to whom the word of God came ( and the scripture can't be broken ) ,
43010036	Do you say of him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world , ' You blaspheme , ' because I said , ' I am the Son of God ? '
43010037	If I don't do the works of my Father , don't believe me .
43010038	But if I do them , though you don't believe me , believe the works ; that you may know and believe that the Father is in me , and I in the Father . "
43010039	They sought again to seize him , and he went forth out of their hand .
43010040	He went away again beyond the Jordan into the place where John was at the first baptizing , and there he stayed .
43010041	Many came to him . They said , " John indeed did no sign , but everything whatever that John said about this man is true . "
43010042	Many believed in him there .
43011001	Now a certain man was sick , Lazarus of Bethany , of the village of Mary and her sister , Martha .
43011002	It was that Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment , and wiped his feet with her hair , whose brother , Lazarus , was sick .
43011003	The sisters therefore sent to him , saying , " Lord , behold , he for whom you have great affection is sick . "
43011004	But when Jesus heard it , he said , " This sickness is not to death , but for the glory of God , that God's Son may be glorified by it . "
43011005	Now Jesus loved Martha , and her sister , and Lazarus .
43011006	When therefore he heard that he was sick , he stayed at that time two days in the place where he was .
43011007	Then after this he said to the disciples , " Let's go into Judea again . "
43011008	The disciples told him , " Rabbi , the Jews were just trying to stone you , and are you going there again ? "
43011009	Jesus answered , " Aren't there twelve hours of daylight ? If a man walks in the day , he doesn't stumble , because he sees the light of this world .
43011010	But if a man walks in the night , he stumbles , because the light isn't in him . "
43011011	He said these things , and after that , he said to them , " Our friend , Lazarus , has fallen asleep , but I am going so that I may awake him out of sleep . "
43011012	The disciples therefore said to him , " Lord , if he has fallen asleep , he will recover . "
43011013	Now Jesus had spoken of his death , but they thought that he spoke of taking rest in sleep .
43011014	So Jesus said to them plainly then , " Lazarus is dead .
43011015	I am glad for your sakes that I was not there , so that you may believe . Nevertheless , let's go to him . "
43011016	Thomas therefore , who is called Didymus , said to his fellow disciples , " Let's go also , that we may die with him . "
43011017	So when Jesus came , he found that he had been in the tomb four days already .
43011018	Now Bethany was near Jerusalem , about fifteen stadia away .
43011019	Many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary , to console them concerning their brother .
43011020	Therefore Martha , when she heard that Jesus was coming , went and met him , but Mary stayed in the house .
43011021	Therefore Martha said to Jesus , " Lord , if you would have been here , my brother wouldn't have died .
43011022	Even now I know that , whatever you ask of God , God will give you . "
43011023	Jesus said to her , " Your brother will rise again . "
43011024	Martha said to him , " I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day . "
43011025	Jesus said to her , " I am the resurrection and the life . He who believes in me , though he die , yet will he live .
43011026	Whoever lives and believes in me will never die . Do you believe this ? "
43011027	She said to him , " Yes , Lord . I have come to believe that you are the Christ , God's Son , he who comes into the world . "
43011028	When she had said this , she went away , and called Mary , her sister , secretly , saying , " The Teacher is here , and is calling you . "
43011029	She , when she heard this , arose quickly , and went to him .
43011030	Now Jesus had not yet come into the village , but was in the place where Martha met him .
43011031	Then the Jews who were with her in the house , and were consoling her , when they saw Mary , that she rose up quickly and went out , followed her , saying , " She is going to the tomb to weep there . "
43011032	Mary therefore , when she came to where Jesus was , and saw him , fell down at his feet , saying to him , " Lord , if you would have been here , my brother wouldn't have died . "
43011033	When Jesus therefore saw her weeping , and the Jews weeping who came with her , he groaned in the spirit , and was troubled ,
43011034	and said , " Where have you laid him ? " They told him , " Lord , come and see . "
43011035	Jesus wept .
43011036	The Jews therefore said , " See how much affection he had for him ! "
43011037	Some of them said , " Couldn't this man , who opened the eyes of him who was blind , have also caused that this man wouldn't die ? "
43011038	Jesus therefore , again groaning in himself , came to the tomb . Now it was a cave , and a stone lay against it .
43011039	Jesus said , " Take away the stone . " Martha , the sister of him who was dead , said to him , " Lord , by this time there is a stench , for he has been dead four days . "
43011040	Jesus said to her , " Didn't I tell you that if you believed , you would see God's glory ? "
43011041	So they took away the stone from the place where the dead man was lying . Jesus lifted up his eyes , and said , " Father , I thank you that you listened to me .
43011042	I know that you always listen to me , but because of the multitude that stands around I said this , that they may believe that you sent me . "
43011043	When he had said this , he cried with a loud voice , " Lazarus , come out ! "
43011044	He who was dead came out , bound hand and foot with wrappings , and his face was wrapped around with a cloth . Jesus said to them , " Free him , and let him go . "
43011045	Therefore many of the Jews , who came to Mary and saw that which Jesus did , believed in him .
43011046	But some of them went away to the Pharisees , and told them the things which Jesus had done .
43011047	The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council , and said , " What are we doing ? For this man does many signs .
43011048	If we leave him alone like this , everyone will believe in him , and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation . "
43011049	But a certain one of them , Caiaphas , being high priest that year , said to them , " You know nothing at all ,
43011050	nor do you take account that it is advantageous for us that one man should die for the people , and that the whole nation not perish . "
43011051	Now he didn't say this of himself , but being high priest that year , he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation ,
43011052	and not for the nation only , but that he might also gather together into one the children of God who are scattered abroad .
43011053	So from that day forth they took counsel that they might put him to death .
43011054	Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews , but departed from there into the country near the wilderness , into a city called Ephraim . He stayed there with his disciples .
43011055	Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand . Many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the Passover , to purify themselves .
43011056	Then they sought for Jesus and spoke one with another , as they stood in the temple , " What do you think ? Isn't he coming to the feast ? "
43011057	Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had commanded that if anyone knew where he was , he should report it , that they might seize him .
43012001	Therefore six days before the Passover , Jesus came to Bethany , where Lazarus was , who had been dead , whom he raised from the dead .
43012002	So they made him a supper there . Martha served , but Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with him .
43012003	Mary , therefore , took a pound of ointment of pure nard , very precious , and anointed the feet of Jesus , and wiped his feet with her hair . The house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment .
43012004	Then Judas Iscariot , Simon's son , one of his disciples , who would betray him , said ,
43012005	" Why wasn't this ointment sold for three hundred denarii , and given to the poor ? "
43012006	Now he said this , not because he cared for the poor , but because he was a thief , and having the money box , used to steal what was put into it .
43012007	But Jesus said , " Leave her alone . She has kept this for the day of my burial .
43012008	For you always have the poor with you , but you don't always have me . "
43012009	A large crowd therefore of the Jews learned that he was there , and they came , not for Jesus ' sake only , but that they might see Lazarus also , whom he had raised from the dead .
43012010	But the chief priests conspired to also put Lazarus to death ,
43012011	because on account of him many of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus .
43012012	On the next day a great multitude had come to the feast . When they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem ,
43012013	they took the branches of the palm trees , and went out to meet him , and cried out , " Hosanna ! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord , the King of Israel ! "
43012014	Jesus , having found a young donkey , sat on it . As it is written ,
43012015	" Don't be afraid , daughter of Zion . Behold , your King comes , sitting on a donkey's colt . "
43012016	His disciples didn't understand these things at first , but when Jesus was glorified , then they remembered that these things were written about him , and that they had done these things to him .
43012017	The multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb , and raised him from the dead , was testifying .
43012018	For this cause also the multitude went and met him , because they heard that he had done this sign .
43012019	The Pharisees therefore said among themselves , " See how you accomplish nothing . Behold , the world has gone after him . "
43012020	Now there were certain Greeks among those that went up to worship at the feast .
43012021	These , therefore , came to Philip , who was from Bethsaida of Galilee , and asked him , saying , " Sir , we want to see Jesus . "
43012022	Philip came and told Andrew , and in turn , Andrew came with Philip , and they told Jesus .
43012023	Jesus answered them , " The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified .
43012024	Most assuredly I tell you , unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies , it remains by itself alone . But if it dies , it bears much fruit .
43012025	He who loves his life will lose it . He who hates his life in this world will keep it to eternal life .
43012026	If anyone serves me , let him follow me . Where I am , there will my servant also be . If anyone serves me , the Father will honor him .
43012027	" Now my soul is troubled . What will I say ? ' Father , save me from this time ? ' But for this cause I came to this time .
43012028	Father , glorify your name ! " Then there came a voice out of the sky , saying , " I have both glorified it , and will glorify it again . "
43012029	The multitude therefore , who stood by and heard it , said that it had thundered . Others said , " An angel has spoken to him . "
43012030	Jesus answered , " This voice hasn't come for my sake , but for your sakes .
43012031	Now is the judgment of this world . Now the prince of this world will be cast out .
43012032	I , if I am lifted up from the earth , will draw all men to myself . "
43012033	But he said this , signifying by what kind of death he should die .
43012034	The multitude answered him , " We have heard out of the law that the Christ remains forever . How do you say , ' The Son of Man must be lifted up ? ' Who is this Son of Man ? "
43012035	Jesus therefore said to them , " Yet a little while the light is with you . Walk while you have the light , that darkness doesn't overtake you . He who walks in the darkness doesn't know where he is going .
43012036	While you have the light , believe in the light , that you may become sons of light . " Jesus said these things , and he departed and hid himself from them .
43012037	But though he had done so many signs before them , yet they didn't believe in him ,
43012038	that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled , which he spoke , " Lord , who has believed our report ? To whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed ? "
43012039	For this cause they couldn't believe , for Isaiah said again ,
43012040	" He has blinded their eyes and he hardened their heart , Lest they should see with their eyes , And perceive with their heart , And would turn , And I would heal them . "
43012041	Isaiah said these things when he saw his glory , and he spoke of him .
43012042	Nevertheless even of the rulers many believed in him , but because of the Pharisees they didn't confess it , so that they wouldn't be put out of the synagogue ,
43012043	for they loved men's approval more than God's approval .
43012044	Jesus cried out and said , " Whoever believes in me , believes not in me , but in him who sent me .
43012045	He who sees me sees him who sent me .
43012046	I have come as a light into the world , that whoever believes in me may not remain in the darkness .
43012047	If anyone listens to my sayings , and doesn't believe , I don't judge him . For I came not to judge the world , but to save the world .
43012048	He who rejects me , and doesn't receive my sayings , has one who judges him . The word that I spoke , the same will judge him in the last day .
43012049	For I spoke not from myself , but the Father who sent me , he gave me a commandment , what I should say , and what I should speak .
43012050	I know that his commandment is eternal life . The things therefore which I speak , even as the Father has said to me , so I speak . "
43013001	Now before the feast of the Passover , Jesus knowing that his time had come that he would depart out of this world to his Father , having loved his own who were in the world , he loved them to the end .
43013002	After supper , the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot , Simon's son , to betray him ,
43013003	Jesus , knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands , and that he came forth from God , and was going to God ,
43013004	arose from supper , and laid aside his outer garments . He took a towel , and wrapped a towel around his waist .
43013005	Then he poured water into the basin , and began to wash the disciples ' feet , and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him .
43013006	Then he came to Simon Peter . He said to him , " Lord , do you wash my feet ? "
43013007	Jesus answered him , " You don't know what I am doing now , but you will understand later . "
43013008	Peter said to him , " You will never wash my feet ! " Jesus answered him , " If I don't wash you , you have no part with me . "
43013009	Simon Peter said to him , " Lord , not my feet only , but also my hands and my head ! "
43013010	Jesus said to him , " Someone who has bathed only needs to have their feet washed , but is completely clean . You are clean , but not all of you . "
43013011	For he knew him who would betray him , therefore he said , " You are not all clean . "
43013012	So when he had washed their feet , put his outer garment back on , and sat down again , he said to them , " Do you know what I have done to you ?
43013013	You call me , ' Teacher ' and ' Lord . ' You say so correctly , for so I am .
43013014	If I then , the Lord and the Teacher , have washed your feet , you also ought to wash one another's feet .
43013015	For I have given you an example , that you also should do as I have done to you .
43013016	Most assuredly I tell you , a servant is not greater than his lord , neither one who is sent greater than he who sent him .
43013017	If you know these things , blessed are you if you do them .
43013018	I speak not of you all . I know whom I have chosen . But that the scripture may be fulfilled , ' He who eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me . '
43013019	From now on , I tell you before it happens , that when it happens , you may believe that I AM .
43013020	Most assuredly I tell you , he who receives whoever I send , receives me ; and he who receives me , receives him who sent me . "
43013021	When Jesus had said this , he was troubled in the spirit , and testified , " Most assuredly I tell you that one of you will betray me . "
43013022	The disciples looked at one another , perplexed about whom he spoke .
43013023	One of his disciples , whom Jesus loved , was at the table , leaning against Jesus ' breast .
43013024	Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him , and said to him , " Tell us who it is of whom he speaks . "
43013025	He , leaning back , as he was , on Jesus ' breast , asked him , " Lord , who is it ? "
43013026	Jesus therefore answered , " It is he who I will give this morsel to when I have dipped it . " So when he had dipped the morsel , he gave it to Judas , the son of Simon Iscariot .
43013027	After the morsel , then Satan entered into him . Jesus therefore said to him , " What you do , do quickly . "
43013028	Now no man at the table knew why he said this to him .
43013029	For some thought , because Judas had the money box , that Jesus said to him , " Buy what things we need for the feast , " or that he should give something to the poor .
43013030	Therefore , having received that morsel , he went out immediately . It was night .
43013031	When he had gone out , Jesus said , " Now the Son of Man is glorified , and God is glorified in him .
43013032	If God is glorified in him , God will also glorify him in himself , and he will glorify him immediately .
43013033	Little children , yet a little while I am with you . You will seek me , and as I said to the Jews , ' Where I am going , you can't come , ' so now I tell you .
43013034	A new commandment I give to you , that you love one another , just like I have loved you ; that you also love one another .
43013035	By this everyone will know that you are my disciples , if you have love for one another . "
43013036	Simon Peter said to him , " Lord , where are you going ? " Jesus answered , " Where I am going , you can't follow now , but you will follow afterwards . "
43013037	Peter said to him , " Lord , why can't I follow you even now ? I will lay down my life for you . "
43013038	Jesus answered him , " Will you lay down your life for me ? Most assuredly I tell you , the rooster won't crow until you have denied me three times .
43014001	" Don't let your heart be troubled . Believe in God . Believe also in me .
43014002	In my Father's house are many mansions . If it weren't so , I would have told you . I am going to prepare a place for you .
43014003	If I go and prepare a place for you , I will come again , and will receive you to myself ; that where I am , you may be there also .
43014004	Where I go , you know , and you know the way . "
43014005	Thomas says to him , " Lord , we don't know where you are going . How can we know the way ? "
43014006	Jesus said to him , " I am the way , the truth , and the life . No one comes to the Father , but by me .
43014007	If you had known me , you would have known my Father also . From now on , you know him , and have seen him . "
43014008	Philip said to him , " Lord , show us the Father , and that will be enough for us . "
43014009	Jesus said to him , " Have I been with you such a long time , and do you not know me , Philip ? He who has seen me has seen the Father . How do you say , ' Show us the Father ? '
43014010	Don't you believe that I am in the Father , and the Father in me ? The words that I tell you , I speak not from myself ; but the Father living in me does his works .
43014011	Believe me that I am in the Father , and the Father in me ; or else believe me for the very works ' sake .
43014012	Most assuredly I tell you , he who believes in me , the works that I do , he will do also ; and greater works than these will he do ; because I am going to my Father .
43014013	Whatever you will ask in my name , that will I do , that the Father may be glorified in the Son .
43014014	If you will ask anything in my name , that will I do .
43014015	If you love me , keep my commandments .
43014016	I will pray to the Father , and he will give you another Counselor , that he may be with you forever ,
43014017	- - the Spirit of truth , whom the world can't receive ; for it doesn't see him , neither knows him . You know him , for he lives with you , and will be in you .
43014018	I will not leave you orphans . I will come to you .
43014019	Yet a little while , and the world will see me no more ; but you will see me . Because I live , you will live also .
43014020	In that day you will know that I am in my Father , and you in me , and I in you .
43014021	Someone who has my commandments , and keeps them , that person is one who loves me . One who loves me will be loved by my Father , and I will love him , and will reveal myself to him . "
43014022	Judas ( not Iscariot ) said to him , " Lord , what will happen that you will reveal yourself to us , and not to the world ? "
43014023	Jesus answered him , " If a man loves me , he will keep my word . My Father will love him , and we will come to him , and make our home with him .
43014024	He who doesn't love me doesn't keep my words . The word which you hear isn't mine , but the Father's who sent me .
43014025	I have said these things to you , while still living with you .
43014026	But the Counselor , the Holy Spirit , whom the Father will send in my name , he will teach you all things , and bring to your memory all that I said to you .
43014027	Peace I leave with you . My peace I give to you ; not as the world gives , give I to you . Don't let your heart be troubled , neither let it be fearful .
43014028	You heard how I told you , ' I go away , and I come to you . ' If you loved me , you would have rejoiced , because I said ' I am going to my Father ; ' for the Father is greater than I .
43014029	Now I have told you before it happens so that , when it happens , you may believe .
43014030	I will no more speak much with you , for the prince of the world comes , and he has nothing in me .
43014031	But that the world may know that I love the Father , and as the Father commanded me , even so I do . Arise , let us go from here .
43015001	" I am the true vine , and my Father is the farmer .
43015002	Every branch in me that doesn't bear fruit , he takes away . Every branch that bears fruit , he prunes , that it may bear more fruit .
43015003	You are already pruned clean because of the word which I have spoken to you .
43015004	Remain in me , and I in you . As the branch can't bear fruit by itself , unless it remains in the vine , so neither can you , unless you remain in me .
43015005	I am the vine . You are the branches . He who remains in me , and I in him , the same bears much fruit , for apart from me you can do nothing .
43015006	If a man doesn't remain in me , he is thrown out as a branch , and is withered ; and they gather them , throw them into the fire , and they are burned .
43015007	If you remain in me , and my words remain in you , you will ask whatever you desire , and it will be done to you .
43015008	In this is my Father glorified , that you bear much fruit ; and so you will be my disciples .
43015009	Even as the Father has loved me , I also have loved you . Remain in my love .
43015010	If you keep my commandments , you will remain in my love ; even as I have kept my Father's commandments , and remain in his love .
43015011	I have spoken these things to you , that my joy may be in you , and that your joy may be made full .
43015012	This is my commandment , that you love one another , even as I have loved you .
43015013	Greater love has no one than this , that a man lay down his life for his friends .
43015014	You are my friends , if you do whatever I command you .
43015015	No longer do I call you servants , for the servant doesn't know what his lord does . But I have called you friends , for everything that I heard from my Father , I have made known to you .
43015016	You didn't choose me , but I chose you , and appointed you , that you should go and bear fruit , and that your fruit should remain ; that whatever you will ask of the Father in my name , he may give it to you .
43015017	I command these things to you , that you may love one another .
43015018	If the world hates you , you know that it has hated me before it hated you .
43015019	If you were of the world , the world would love its own . But because you are not of the world , since I chose you out of the world , therefore the world hates you .
43015020	Remember the word that I said to you : ' A servant is not greater than his lord . ' If they persecuted me , they will also persecute you . If they kept my word , they will keep yours also .
43015021	But all these things will they do to you for my name's sake , because they don't know him who sent me .
43015022	If I had not come and spoken to them , they would not have had sin ; but now they have no excuse for their sin .
43015023	He who hates me , hates my Father also .
43015024	If I hadn't done among them the works which none other did , they wouldn't have had sin . But now have they seen and also hated both me and my Father .
43015025	But that the word may be fulfilled that is written in their law , ' They hated me without a cause . '
43015026	When the Counselor has come , whom I will send to you from the Father , the Spirit of truth , who proceeds from the Father , he will testify about me .
43015027	You will also testify , because you have been with me from the beginning .
43016001	" These things have I spoken to you , so that you wouldn't be caused to stumble .
43016002	They will put you out of the synagogues . Yes , the time comes that whoever kills you will think that he offers service to God .
43016003	They will do these things because they have not known the Father , nor me .
43016004	But I have told you these things , so that when the time comes , you may remember that I told you about them . I didn't tell you these things from the beginning , because I was with you .
43016005	But now I am going to him who sent me , and none of you asks me , ' Where are you going ? '
43016006	But because I have told you these things , sorrow has filled your heart .
43016007	Nevertheless I tell you the truth : It is to your advantage that I go away , for if I don't go away , the Counselor won't come to you . But if I go , I will send him to you .
43016008	When he has come , he will convict the world in respect to sin , and righteousness , and judgment ;
43016009	of sin , because they don't believe in me ;
43016010	of righteousness , because I am going to my Father , and you see me no more ;
43016011	of judgment , because the prince of this world has been judged .
43016012	I have yet many things to tell you , but you can't bear them now .
43016013	However when he , the Spirit of truth , has come , he will guide you into all the truth , for he will not speak from himself ; but whatever things he hears , he will speak . He will declare to you the things that are to come .
43016014	He will glorify me , for he will take from what is mine , and will declare it to you .
43016015	All things whatever the Father has are mine ; therefore I said that he takes of mine , and will declare it to you .
43016016	A little while , and you will not see me . Again a little while , and you will see me . "
43016017	Some of his disciples therefore said to one another , " What is this that he says to us , ' A little while , and you won't see me , and again a little while , and you will see me ; ' and , ' Because I go to the Father ? ' "
43016018	They said therefore , " What is this that he says , ' A little while ? ' We don't know what he is saying . "
43016019	Therefore Jesus perceived that they wanted to ask him , and he said to them , " Do you inquire among yourselves concerning this , that I said , ' A little while , and you won't see me , and again a little while , and you will see me ? '
43016020	Most assuredly I tell you , that you will weep and lament , but the world will rejoice . You will be sorrowful , but your sorrow will be turned into joy .
43016021	A woman , when she is in travail , has sorrow , because her time has come . But when she has delivered the child , she doesn't remember the anguish any more , for the joy that a child is born into the world .
43016022	You therefore now have sorrow , but I will see you again , and your heart will rejoice , and no one will take your joy away from you .
43016023	In that day you will ask me no question . Most assuredly I tell you , whatever you may ask of the Father , he will give it to you in my name .
43016024	Until now , you have asked nothing in my name . Ask , and you will receive , that your joy may be made full .
43016025	I have spoken these things to you in figures of speech . But the time comes when I will no more speak to you in figures of speech , but will tell you plainly about the Father .
43016026	In that day you will ask in my name ; and I don't say to you , that I will pray to the Father for you ,
43016027	for the Father himself loves you , because you have loved me , and have believed that I came forth from God .
43016028	I came out from the Father , and have come into the world . Again , I leave the world , and go to the Father . "
43016029	His disciples said to him , " Behold , now you speak plainly , and speak no figures of speech .
43016030	Now we know that you know all things , and don't need for anyone to question you . By this we believe that you came forth from God . "
43016031	Jesus answered them , " Do you now believe ?
43016032	Behold , the time comes , yes , has now come , that you will be scattered , everyone to his own place , and will leave me alone . Yet I am not alone , because the Father is with me .
43016033	I have told you these things , that in me you may have peace . In the world you have oppression ; but cheer up ! I have overcome the world . "
43017001	Jesus said these things , and lifting up his eyes to heaven , he said , " Father , the time has come . Glorify your Son , that your Son may also glorify you ;
43017002	even as you gave him authority over all flesh , that to all whom you have given him , he will give eternal life .
43017003	This is eternal life , that they should know you , the only true God , and him whom you sent , Jesus Christ .
43017004	I glorified you on the earth . I have accomplished the work which you have given me to do .
43017005	Now , Father , glorify me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world existed .
43017006	I revealed your name to the people whom you have given me out of the world . They were yours , and you have given them to me . They have kept your word .
43017007	Now they know that all things whatever you have given me are from you ,
43017008	for the words which you have given me I have given to them , and they received them , and knew for sure that I came forth from you , and they believed that you sent me .
43017009	I pray for them . I don't pray for the world , but for those whom you have given me , for they are yours .
43017010	All things that are mine are yours , and yours are mine , and I am glorified in them .
43017011	I am no more in the world , and these are in the world , and I am coming to you . Holy Father , keep them through your name which you have given me , that they may be one , even as we are .
43017012	While I was with them in the world , I kept them in your name . Those whom you have given me I have kept . None of them is lost , except the son of perdition , that the Scripture might be fulfilled .
43017013	But now I come to you , and I say these things in the world , that they may have my joy made full in themselves .
43017014	I have given them your word . The world hated them , because they are not of the world , even as I am not of the world .
43017015	I pray not that you would take them from the world , but that you would keep them from the evil one .
43017016	They are not of the world even as I am not of the world .
43017017	Sanctify them in your truth . Your word is truth .
43017018	As you sent me into the world , even so I sent them into the world .
43017019	For their sakes I sanctify myself , that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth .
43017020	Neither for these only do I pray , but for those also who believe in me through their word ,
43017021	that they may all be one ; even as you , Father , are in me , and I in you , that they also may be one in us ; that the world may believe that you sent me .
43017022	The glory which you have given me , I have given to them ; that they may be one , even as we are one ;
43017023	I in them , and you in me , that they may be perfected into one ; that the world may know that you sent me , and loved them , even as you loved me .
43017024	Father , I desire that they also whom you have given me be with me where I am , that they may see my glory , which you have given me , for you loved me before the foundation of the world .
43017025	Righteous Father , the world didn't know you , but I knew you ; and these knew that you sent me .
43017026	I made known to them your name , and will make it known ; that the love with which you loved me may be in them , and I in them . "
43018001	When Jesus had spoken these words , he went forth with his disciples over the brook Kidron , where was a garden , into which he entered , himself and his disciples .
43018002	Now Judas , who betrayed him , also knew the place , for Jesus often resorted there with his disciples .
43018003	Judas then , having taken a detachment of soldiers and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees , came there with lanterns , torches , and weapons .
43018004	Jesus therefore , knowing all the things that were coming on him , went forth , and said to them , " Who are you looking for ? "
43018005	They answered him , " Jesus of Nazareth . " Jesus said to them , " I AM . " Judas also , who betrayed him , was standing with them .
43018006	When therefore he said to them , " I AM , " they went backward , and fell to the ground .
43018007	Again therefore he asked them , " Who are you looking for ? " They said , " Jesus of Nazareth . "
43018008	Jesus answered , " I told you that I AM . If therefore you seek me , let these go their way , "
43018009	that the word might be fulfilled which he spoke , " Of those whom you have given me , I have lost none . "
43018010	Simon Peter therefore , having a sword , drew it , and struck the high priest's servant , and cut off his right ear . The servant's name was Malchus .
43018011	Jesus therefore said to Peter , " Put up the sword into its sheath . The cup which the Father has given me , shall I not drink it ? "
43018012	So the detachment , the commanding officer , and the officers of the Jews , seized Jesus and bound him ,
43018013	and led him to Annas first , for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas , who was high priest that year .
43018014	Now it was Caiaphas who gave counsel to the Jews , that it was expedient that one man should die for the people .
43018015	Simon Peter followed Jesus , as did another disciple . Now that disciple was known to the high priest , and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest ;
43018016	but Peter was standing at the door outside . So the other disciple , who was known to the high priest , went out and spoke to her who kept the door , and brought in Peter .
43018017	Then the maid who kept the door said to Peter , " Are you also one of this man's disciples ? " He said , " I am not . "
43018018	Now the servants and the officers were standing there , having made a fire of coals , for it was cold . They were warming themselves . Peter was with them , standing and warming himself .
43018019	The high priest therefore asked Jesus of his disciples , and of his teaching .
43018020	Jesus answered him , " I spoke openly to the world . I always taught in synagogues , and in the temple , where the Jews always meet . I said nothing in secret .
43018021	Why do you ask me ? Ask those who have heard me what I said to them . Behold , these know the things which I said . "
43018022	When he had said this , one of the officers standing by slapped Jesus with his hand , saying , " Do you answer the high priest like that ? "
43018023	Jesus answered him , " If I have spoken evil , testify of the evil ; but if well , why do you beat me ? "
43018024	Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas , the high priest .
43018025	Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself . They said therefore to him , " Are you also one of his disciples ? " He denied it , and said , " I am not . "
43018026	One of the servants of the high priest , being a relative of him whose ear Peter cut off , said , " Didn't I see you in the garden with him ? "
43018027	Peter therefore denied again , and immediately the rooster crowed .
43018028	They led Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium . It was early , and they themselves didn't enter into the Praetorium , that they might not be defiled , but might eat the Passover .
43018029	Pilate therefore went out to them , and said , " What accusation do you bring against this man ? "
43018030	They answered him , " If this man weren't an evildoer , we wouldn't have delivered him up to you . "
43018031	Pilate therefore said to them , " Take him yourselves , and judge him according to your law . " Therefore the Jews said to him , " It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death , "
43018032	that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled , which he spoke , signifying by what kind of death he should die .
43018033	Pilate therefore entered again into the Praetorium , called Jesus , and said to him , " Are you the King of the Jews ? "
43018034	Jesus answered him , " Do you say this of yourself , or did others tell it to you concerning me ? "
43018035	Pilate answered , " Am I a Jew ? Your own nation and the chief priests delivered you to me . What have you done ? "
43018036	Jesus answered , " My kingdom is not of this world . If my kingdom were of this world , then my servants would fight , that I wouldn't be delivered to the Jews . But now my kingdom is not from here . "
43018037	Pilate therefore said to him , " Are you a king then ? " Jesus answered , " You say that I am a king . To this end have I been born , and to this end I have come into the world , that I should testify to the truth . Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice . "
43018038	Pilate said to him , " What is truth ? " When he had said this , he went out again to the Jews , and said to them , " I find no basis for a charge against him .
43018039	But you have a custom , that I should release to you one at the Passover . Therefore do you desire that I release to you the King of the Jews ? "
43018040	Then they all cried out again , saying , " Not this man , but Barabbas ! " Now Barabbas was a robber .
43019001	Then Pilate therefore took Jesus , and flogged him .
43019002	The soldiers twisted thorns into a crown , and put it on his head , and dressed him in a purple garment .
43019003	They said , " Hail , King of the Jews ! " and they struck him with their hands .
43019004	Then Pilate went out again , and said to them , " Behold , I bring him out to you , that you may know that I find no basis for a charge against him . "
43019005	Jesus therefore came out , wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment . Pilate said to them , " Behold , the man ! "
43019006	When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him , they cried out , saying , " Crucify ! Crucify ! " Pilate said to them , " Take him yourselves , and crucify him , for I find no basis for a charge against him . "
43019007	The Jews answered him , " We have a law , and by our law he ought to die , because he made himself the Son of God . "
43019008	When therefore Pilate heard this saying , he was more afraid .
43019009	He entered into the Praetorium again , and said to Jesus , " Where are you from ? " But Jesus gave him no answer .
43019010	Pilate therefore said to him , " Aren't you speaking to me ? Don't you know that I have power to release you , and have power to crucify you ? "
43019011	Jesus answered , " You would have no power at all against me , unless it were given to you from above . Therefore he who delivered me to you has greater sin . "
43019012	At this , Pilate sought to release him , but the Jews cried out , saying , " If you release this man , you aren't Caesar's friend ! Everyone who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar ! "
43019013	When Pilate therefore heard these words , he brought Jesus out , and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called " The Pavement , " but in Hebrew , " Gabbatha . "
43019014	Now it was the Preparation of the Passover , at about the sixth hour . He said to the Jews , " Behold , your King ! "
43019015	They cried out , " Away with him ! Away with him ! Crucify him ! " Pilate said to them , " Shall I crucify your King ? " The chief priests answered , " We have no king but Caesar ! "
43019016	Then therefore he delivered him to them to be crucified . So they took Jesus and led him away .
43019017	He went out , bearing his cross , to the place called " The place of a skull , " which is called in Hebrew , " Golgotha , "
43019018	where they crucified him , and with him two others , on either side one , and Jesus in the middle .
43019019	Pilate wrote a title also , and put it on the cross . There was written , " JESUS OF NAZARETH , THE KING OF THE JEWS . "
43019020	Therefore many of the Jews read this title , for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city ; and it was written in Hebrew , in Latin , and in Greek .
43019021	The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate , " Don't write , ' The King of the Jews , ' but that , ' he said , I am King of the Jews . ' "
43019022	Pilate answered , " What I have written , I have written . "
43019023	Then the soldiers , when they had crucified Jesus , took his garments and made four parts , to every soldier a part ; and also the coat . Now the coat was without seam , woven from the top throughout .
43019024	Then they said to one another , " Let's not tear it , but cast lots for it , whose it will be , " that the scripture might be fulfilled , which says , " They parted my garments among them , For my cloak they cast lots . " Therefore the soldiers did these things .
43019025	But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother , and his mother's sister , Mary the wife of Clopas , and Mary Magdalene .
43019026	Therefore when Jesus saw his mother , and the disciple whom he loved standing there , he said to his mother , " Woman , behold your son ! "
43019027	Then he said to the disciple , " Behold , your mother ! " From that hour , the disciple took her to his own home .
43019028	After this , Jesus , seeing that all things were now finished , that the scripture might be fulfilled , said , " I am thirsty . "
43019029	Now a vessel full of vinegar was set there ; so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop , and brought it to his mouth .
43019030	When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar , he said , " It is finished . " He bowed his head , and gave up his spirit .
43019031	Therefore the Jews , because it was the Preparation , so that the bodies wouldn't remain on the cross on the Sabbath ( for that Sabbath was a special one ) , asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken , and that they might be taken away .
43019032	Therefore the soldiers came , and broke the legs of the first , and of the other who was crucified with him ;
43019033	but when they came to Jesus , and saw that he was already dead , they didn't break his legs .
43019034	However one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear , and immediately blood and water came out .
43019035	He who has seen has testified , and his testimony is true . He knows that he tells the truth , that you also may believe .
43019036	For these things happened , that the scripture might be fulfilled , " A bone of him will not be broken . "
43019037	Again another scripture says , " They will look on him whom they pierced . "
43019038	After these things , Joseph of Arimathaea , being a disciple of Jesus , but secretly for fear of the Jews , asked of Pilate that he might take away Jesus ' body . Pilate gave him permission . He came therefore , and took away his body .
43019039	Nicodemus also came , he who at first came to Jesus by night , bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes , about a hundred Roman pounds .
43019040	So they took Jesus ' body , and bound it in linen cloths with the spices , as the custom of the Jews is to bury .
43019041	Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden . In the garden a new tomb in which no man had ever yet been laid .
43019042	Then because of the Jews ' Preparation ( for the tomb was near at hand ) they laid Jesus there .
43020001	Now on the first day of the week , Mary Magdalene came early , while it was yet dark , to the tomb , and saw the stone taken away from the tomb .
43020002	She ran therefore , and came to Simon Peter , and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved , and said to them , " They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb , and we don't know where they have laid him ! "
43020003	Peter therefore went forth , and the other disciple , and they went toward the tomb .
43020004	They both ran together . The other disciple outran Peter , and came to the tomb first .
43020005	Stooping and looking in , he saw the linen cloths lying , yet he didn't enter in .
43020006	Then Simon Peter came , following him , and entered into the tomb . He saw the linen cloths lying ,
43020007	and the cloth that was on his head , not lying with the linen cloths , but rolled up in a place by itself .
43020008	Then the other disciple also entered in therefore , who came first to the tomb , and he saw , and believed .
43020009	For as yet they didn't know the scripture , that he must rise from the dead .
43020010	So the disciples went away again to their own homes .
43020011	But Mary was standing outside at the tomb weeping . So , as she wept , she stooped and looked into the tomb ,
43020012	and she saw two angels in white sitting , one at the head , and one at the feet , where the body of Jesus had lain .
43020013	They told her , " Woman , why are you weeping ? " She said to them , " Because they have taken away my Lord , and I don't know where they have laid him . "
43020014	When she had said this , she turned herself back , and saw Jesus standing , and didn't know that it was Jesus .
43020015	Jesus said to her , " Woman , why are you weeping ? Who are you looking for ? " She , supposing him to be the gardener , said to him , " Sir , if you have carried him away , tell me where you have laid him , and I will take him away . "
43020016	Jesus said to her , " Mary . " She turned herself , and said to him , " Rhabbouni ! " which is to say , " Teacher ! "
43020017	Jesus said to her , " Don't touch me , for I haven't yet ascended to my Father ; but go to my brothers , and tell them , ' I am ascending to my Father and your Father , and my God and your God . ' "
43020018	Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord , and that he had said these things to her .
43020019	When therefore it was evening , on that day , the first day of the week , and when the doors were locked where the disciples were assembled , for fear of the Jews , Jesus came and stood in the midst , and said to them , " Peace be to you . "
43020020	When he had said this , he showed to them his hands and his side . The disciples therefore were glad when they saw the Lord .
43020021	Jesus therefore said to them again , " Peace be to you . As the Father has sent me , even so I send you . "
43020022	When he had said this , he breathed on them , and said to them , " Receive the Holy Spirit !
43020023	Whoever's sins you forgive , they are forgiven to them . Whoever's sins you retain , they are retained . "
43020024	But Thomas , one of the twelve , called Didymus , wasn't with them when Jesus came .
43020025	The other disciples therefore said to him , " We have seen the Lord ! " But he said to them , " Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails , and put my hand into his side , I will not believe . "
43020026	After eight days again his disciples were within , and Thomas with them . Jesus came , the doors being locked , and stood in the midst , and said , " Peace be to you . "
43020027	Then he said to Thomas , " Reach here your finger , and see my hands . Reach here your hand , and put it into my side . Don't be faithless , but believing . "
43020028	Thomas answered him , " My Lord and my God ! "
43020029	Jesus said to him , " Because you have seen me , you have believed . Blessed are those who have not seen , and have believed . "
43020030	Therefore Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples , which are not written in this book ;
43020031	but these are written , that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ , the Son of God , and that believing you may have life in his name .
43021001	After these things , Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias . He revealed himself this way .
43021002	Simon Peter , Thomas called Didymus , Nathanael of Cana in Galilee , and the sons of Zebedee , and two others of his disciples were together .
43021003	Simon Peter said to them , " I'm going fishing . " They told him , " We are also coming with you . " They immediately went forth , and entered into the boat . That night , they caught nothing .
43021004	But when day was now breaking , Jesus stood on the beach , yet the disciples didn't know that it was Jesus .
43021005	Jesus therefore said to them , " Children , have you anything to eat ? " They answered him , " No . "
43021006	He said to them , " Cast the net on the right side of the boat , and you will find some . " They cast therefore , and now they were not able to draw it in for the multitude of fish .
43021007	That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved said to Peter , " It's the Lord ! " So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord , he wrapped his coat around him ( for he was naked ) , and threw himself into the sea .
43021008	But the other disciples came in the little boat ( for they were not far from the land , but about two hundred cubits away ) , dragging the net full of fish .
43021009	So when they got out on the land , they saw a fire of coals there , and fish laid on it , and bread .
43021010	Jesus said to them , " Bring some of the fish which you have just caught . "
43021011	Simon Peter went up , and drew the net to land , full of great fish , one hundred fifty-three ; and even though there were so many , the net wasn't torn .
43021012	Jesus said to them , " Come and eat breakfast . " None of the disciples dared inquire of him , " Who are you ? " knowing that it was the Lord .
43021013	Then Jesus came and took the bread , gave it to them , and the fish likewise .
43021014	This is now the third time that Jesus was revealed to his disciples , after he had risen from the dead .
43021015	So when they had eaten their breakfast , Jesus said to Simon Peter , " Simon , son of Jonah , do you love me more than these ? " He said to him , " Yes , Lord ; you know that I have affection for you . " He said to him , " Feed my lambs . "
43021016	He said to him again a second time , " Simon , son of Jonah , do you love me ? " He said to him , " Yes , Lord ; you know that I have affection for you . " He said to him , " Tend my sheep . "
43021017	He says to him the third time , " Simon , son of Jonah , do you have affection for me ? " Peter was grieved because he asked him the third time , " Do you have affection for me ? " He said to him , " Lord , you know everything . You know that I have affection for you . " Jesus said to him , " Feed my sheep .
43021018	Most assuredly I tell you , when you were young , you dressed yourself , and walked where you wanted to . But when you are old , you will stretch out your hands , and another will dress you , and carry you where you don't want to go . "
43021019	Now he said this , signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God . When he had said this , he said to him , " Follow me . "
43021020	Then Peter , turning around , saw a disciple following . This was the disciple whom Jesus sincerely loved , the one who had also leaned on Jesus ' breast at the supper and asked , " Lord , who is going to betray You ? "
43021021	Peter seeing him , said to Jesus , " Lord , and what will this man do ? "
43021022	Jesus said to him , " If I desire that he stay until I come , what is that to you ? You follow me . "
43021023	This saying therefore went forth among the brothers , that that disciple wouldn't die . Yet Jesus didn't say to him that he wouldn't die , but , " If I desire that he stay until I come , what is that to you ? "
43021024	This is the disciple who testifies about these things , and wrote these things . We know that his witness is true .
43021025	There are also many other things which Jesus did , which if they would all be written , I suppose that even the world itself wouldn't contain the books that would be written .
44001001	The first book I wrote , Theophilus , concerned all that Jesus began both to do and to teach ,
44001002	until the day in which he was received up , after he had given commandment through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen .
44001003	To these he also showed himself alive after his suffering by many proofs , appearing to them over a period of forty days , and spoke about God's kingdom .
44001004	Being assembled together with them , he charged them , " Don't depart from Jerusalem , but wait for the promise of the Father , which you heard from me .
44001005	For John indeed baptized with water , but you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from now . "
44001006	Therefore , when they had come together , they asked him , " Lord , are you now restoring the kingdom to Israel ? "
44001007	He said to them , " It isn't for you to know times or seasons which the Father has set within His own authority .
44001008	But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come on you . You will be witnesses to me in Jerusalem , in all Judea and Samaria , and to the uttermost parts of the earth . "
44001009	When he had said these things , as they were looking , he was taken up , and a cloud received him out of their sight .
44001010	While they were looking steadfastly into the sky as he went , behold , two men stood by them in white clothing ,
44001011	who also said , " You men of Galilee , why do you stand looking into the sky ? This Jesus , who was received up from you into the sky will come back in the same way as you saw him going into the sky . "
44001012	Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called Olivet , which is near Jerusalem , a Sabbath day's journey away .
44001013	When they had come in , they went up into the upper chamber , where they were staying ; that is Peter , John , James , Andrew , Philip , Thomas , Bartholomew , Matthew , James the son of Alphaeus , Simon the Zealot , and Judas the son of James .
44001014	All these with one accord continued steadfastly in prayer and supplication , with the women , and Mary , the mother of Jesus , and with his brothers .
44001015	In these days , Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples ( and there was a multitude of persons gathered together , about one hundred twenty ) , and said ,
44001016	" Brothers , it was necessary that this Scripture should be fulfilled , which the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas , who was guide to those who took Jesus .
44001017	For he was numbered with us , and received his portion in this ministry .
44001018	Now this man obtained a field with the reward for his wickedness , and falling headlong , his body burst open , and all his intestines gushed out .
44001019	It became known to everyone who lived in Jerusalem that in their language that field was called ' Akeldama , ' that is , ' The field of blood . '
44001020	For it is written in the book of Psalms , ' Let his habitation be made desolate , Let no one dwell therein , ' and , ' Let another take his office . '
44001021	Of the men therefore who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and went out among us ,
44001022	beginning from the baptism of John , to the day that he was received up from us , of these must one become a witness with us of his resurrection . "
44001023	They put forward two , Joseph called Barsabbas , who was surnamed Justus , and Matthias .
44001024	They prayed , and said , " You , Lord , who know the hearts of all men , show which one of these two you have chosen
44001025	to take part in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas fell away , that he might go to his own place . "
44001026	They drew lots for them , and the lot fell on Matthias , and he was numbered with the eleven apostles .
44002001	Now when the day of Pentecost had come , they were all with one accord in one place .
44002002	Suddenly there came from the sky a sound like the rushing of a mighty wind , and it filled all the house where they were sitting .
44002003	Tongues like fire appeared and were distributed to them , and it sat on each one of them .
44002004	They were all filled with the Holy Spirit , and began to speak with other languages , as the Spirit gave them the ability to speak .
44002005	Now there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews , devout men , from every nation under the sky .
44002006	When this sound was heard , the multitude came together , and were bewildered , because everyone heard them speaking in his own language .
44002007	They were all amazed and marveled , saying to one another , " Behold , aren't all these who speak Galileans ?
44002008	How do we hear , everyone in our own native language ?
44002009	Parthians , Medes , Elamites , and people from Mesopotamia , Judea , Cappadocia , Pontus , Asia ,
44002010	Phrygia , Pamphylia , Egypt , the parts of Libya around Cyrene , visitors from Rome , both Jews and proselytes ,
44002011	Cretans and Arabians : we hear them speaking in our languages the mighty works of God ! "
44002012	They were all amazed , and were perplexed , saying one to another , " What does this mean ? "
44002013	Others , mocking , said , " They are filled with new wine . "
44002014	But Peter , standing up with the eleven , lifted up his voice , and spoke out to them , " You men of Judea , and all you who dwell at Jerusalem , let this be known to you , and listen to my words .
44002015	For these aren't drunken , as you suppose , seeing it is only the third hour of the day .
44002016	But this is what has been spoken through the prophet Joel :
44002017	' It will be in the last days , says God , I will pour forth of my Spirit on all flesh . Your sons and your daughters will prophesy . Your young men will see visions . Your old men will dream dreams .
44002018	Yes , and on my servants and on my handmaidens in those days , I will pour out my Spirit , and they will prophesy .
44002019	I will show wonders in the the sky above , And signs on the earth beneath ; Blood , and fire , and billows of smoke .
44002020	The sun will be turned into darkness , And the moon into blood , Before the great and glorious day of the Lord comes .
44002021	It will be , that whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved . '
44002022	" You men of Israel , hear these words . Jesus of Nazareth , a man approved by God to you by mighty works and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you , even as you yourselves know ,
44002023	him , being delivered up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God , you have taken by the hand of lawless men , crucified and killed ;
44002024	whom God raised up , having freed him from the agony of death , because it was not possible that he should be held by it .
44002025	For David says concerning him , ' I saw the Lord always before my face , For he is on my right hand , that I should not be moved .
44002026	Therefore my heart was glad , and my tongue rejoiced . Moreover my flesh also will dwell in hope ;
44002027	Because you will not leave my soul in Hades , Neither will you allow your Holy One to see decay .
44002028	You made known to me the ways of life . You will make me full of gladness with your presence . '
44002029	" Brothers , I may tell you freely of the patriarch David , that he both died and was buried , and his tomb is with us to this day .
44002030	Therefore , being a prophet , and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his body , according to the flesh , he would raise up the Christ to sit on his throne ,
44002031	he foreseeing this spoke about the resurrection of the Christ , that neither was his soul left in Hades , nor did his flesh see decay .
44002032	This Jesus God raised up , whereof we all are witnesses .
44002033	Being therefore exalted by the right hand of God , and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit , he has poured forth this , which you now see and hear .
44002034	For David didn't ascend into the heavens , but he says himself , ' The Lord said to my Lord , " Sit by my right hand ,
44002035	Until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet . " '
44002036	" Let all the house of Israel therefore know assuredly that God has made him both Lord and Christ , this Jesus whom you crucified . "
44002037	Now when they heard this , they were cut to the heart , and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles , " Brothers , what will we do ? "
44002038	Peter said to them , " Repent , and be baptized , everyone of you , in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins , and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit .
44002039	For to you is the promise , and to your children , and to all who are far off , even as many as the Lord our God will call to himself . "
44002040	With many other words he testified , and exhorted them , saying , " Save yourselves from this crooked generation ! "
44002041	Then those who gladly received his word were baptized . There were added that day about three thousand souls .
44002042	They continued steadfastly in the apostles ' teaching and fellowship , in the breaking of bread , and prayer .
44002043	Fear came on every soul , and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles .
44002044	All who believed were together , and had all things common .
44002045	They sold their possessions and goods , and distributed them to all , according as anyone had need .
44002046	Day by day , continuing steadfastly with one accord in the temple , and breaking bread at home , they took their food with gladness and singleness of heart ,
44002047	praising God , and having favor with all the people . The Lord added to the assembly day by day those who were being saved .
44003001	Peter and John were going up into the temple at the hour of prayer , the ninth hour .
44003002	A certain man who was lame from his mother's womb was being carried , whom they laid daily at the door of the temple which is called Beautiful , to ask alms of those who entered into the temple .
44003003	Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple , he asked to receive alms .
44003004	Peter , fastening his eyes on him , with John , said , " Look at us . "
44003005	He listened to them , expecting to receive something from them .
44003006	But Peter said , " Silver and gold have I none , but what I have , that I give you . In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth , rise and walk ! "
44003007	He took him by the right hand , and raised him up . Immediately his feet and his ankle bones received strength .
44003008	Leaping up , he stood , and began to walk . He entered with them into the temple , walking , leaping , and praising God .
44003009	All the people saw him walking and praising God .
44003010	They recognized him , that it was he who sat begging for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple . They were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened to him .
44003011	As the lame man who was healed held Peter and John , all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon's , greatly wondering .
44003012	When Peter saw it , he answered to the people , " You men of Israel , why do you marvel at this man ? Why do you fasten your eyes on us , as though by our own power or godliness we had made him walk ?
44003013	The God of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , the God of our fathers , has glorified his Servant Jesus , whom you delivered up , and denied before the face of Pilate , when he had determined to release him .
44003014	But you denied the Holy and Righteous One , and asked for a murderer to be granted to you ,
44003015	and killed the Prince of life , whom God raised from the dead , whereof we are witnesses .
44003016	By faith in his name has his name made this man strong , whom you see and know . Yes , the faith which is through him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all .
44003017	" Now , brothers , I know that you did this in ignorance , as did also your rulers .
44003018	But the things which God announced by the mouth of all his prophets , that Christ should suffer , he thus fulfilled .
44003019	Repent therefore , and turn again , that your sins may be blotted out , that so there may come times of refreshing from the presence of the Lord ,
44003020	and that he may send Christ Jesus , who was ordained for you before ,
44003021	whom the heaven must receive until the times of restoration of all things , whereof God spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets that have been from ancient times .
44003022	For Moses indeed said to the fathers , ' The Lord God will raise up a prophet to you from among your brothers , like me . You will listen to him in all things whatever he says to you .
44003023	It will be , that every soul that will not listen to that prophet will be utterly destroyed from among the people . '
44003024	Yes , and all the prophets from Samuel and those who followed after , as many as have spoken , they also told of these days .
44003025	You are the sons of the prophets , and of the covenant which God made with our fathers , saying to Abraham , ' In your seed will all the families of the earth be blessed . '
44003026	God , having raised up his servant , Jesus , sent him to you first , to bless you , in turning away everyone of you from your wickedness . "
44004001	As they spoke to the people , the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came to them ,
44004002	being upset because they taught the people and proclaimed in Jesus the resurrection from the dead .
44004003	They laid hands on them , and put them in custody until the next day , for it was now evening .
44004004	But many of those who heard the word believed , and the number of the men came to be about five thousand .
44004005	It happened in the morning , that their rulers , elders , and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem .
44004006	Annas the high priest was there , with Caiaphas , John , Alexander , and as many as were relatives of the high priest .
44004007	When they had stood them in the midst , they inquired , " By what power , or in what name , have you done this ? "
44004008	Then Peter , filled with the Holy Spirit , said to them , " You rulers of the people , and elders of Israel ,
44004009	if we are examined today concerning a good deed done to a crippled man , by what means this man has been healed ,
44004010	be it known to you all , and to all the people of Israel , that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth , whom you crucified , whom God raised from the dead , in him does this man stand here before you whole .
44004011	He is ' the stone which was regarded as worthless by you , the builders , which was made the head of the corner . '
44004012	There is salvation in none other , for neither is there any other name under heaven , that is given among men , in which we must be saved ! "
44004013	Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John , and had perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men , they marveled . They recognized that they had been with Jesus .
44004014	Seeing the man who was healed standing with them , they could say nothing against it .
44004015	But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council , they conferred among themselves ,
44004016	saying , " What will we do to these men ? Because indeed a notable miracle has been done through them , as can be plainly seen by all who dwell in Jerusalem , and we can't deny it .
44004017	But so that this spreads no further among the people , let's threaten them , that from now on they don't speak to anyone in this name . "
44004018	They called them , and charged them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus .
44004019	But Peter and John answered them , " Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God , judge for yourselves ,
44004020	for we can't help telling the things which we saw and heard . "
44004021	They , when they had further threatened them , let them go , finding no way to punish them , because of the people ; for everyone glorified God for that which was done .
44004022	For the man was more than forty years old , on whom this miracle of healing was performed .
44004023	Being let go , they came to their own company , and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them .
44004024	They , when they heard it , lifted up their voice to God with one accord , and said , " O Lord , you are God , who made the heaven , the earth , the sea , and all that is in them ;
44004025	who by the mouth of your servant , David , said , ' Why do the nations rage , And the peoples plot a vain thing ?
44004026	The kings of the earth take a stand , And the rulers take council together , Against the Lord , and against his Christ . '
44004027	For truly , in this city against your holy servant , Jesus , whom you anointed , both Herod and Pontius Pilate , with the Gentiles and the people of Israel , were gathered together
44004028	to do whatever your hand and your council foreordained to happen .
44004029	Now , Lord , look at their threats , and grant to your servants to speak your word with all boldness ,
44004030	while you stretch forth your hand to heal ; and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of your holy Servant Jesus . "
44004031	When they had prayed , the place was shaken where they were gathered together . They were all filled with the Holy Spirit , and they spoke the word of God with boldness .
44004032	The multitude of those who believed were of one heart and soul . Not one of them claimed that anything of the things which he possessed was his own , but they had all things common .
44004033	With great power , the apostles gave their testimony of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus . Great grace was on them all .
44004034	For neither was there among them any who lacked , for as many as were owners of lands or houses sold them , and brought the prices of the things that were sold ,
44004035	and laid them at the apostles ' feet , and distribution was made to each , according as anyone had need .
44004036	Joses , who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas ( which is , being interpreted , Son of Exhortation ) , a Levite , a man of Cyprus by race ,
44004037	having a field , sold it , and brought the money and laid it at the apostles ' feet .
44005001	But a certain man named Ananias , with Sapphira , his wife , sold a possession ,
44005002	and kept back part of the price , his wife also being aware of it , and brought a certain part , and laid it at the apostles ' feet .
44005003	But Peter said , " Ananias , why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit , and to keep back part of the price of the land ?
44005004	While you kept it , didn't it remain your own ? After it was sold , wasn't it in your power ? How is it that you have conceived this thing in your heart ? You haven't lied to men , but to God . "
44005005	Ananias , hearing these words , fell down and died . Great fear came on all who heard these things .
44005006	The young men arose and wrapped him up , and they carried him out and buried him .
44005007	About three hours later , his wife , not knowing what was had happened , came in .
44005008	Peter answered her , " Tell me whether you sold the land for so much . " She said , " Yes , for so much . "
44005009	But Peter asked her , " How is it that you have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord ? Behold , the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door , and they will carry you out . "
44005010	She fell down immediately at his feet , and died . The young men came in and found her dead , and they carried her out and buried her by her husband .
44005011	Great fear came on the whole assembly , and on all who heard these things .
44005012	By the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders were done among the people . They were all with one accord in Solomon's porch .
44005013	None of the rest dared to join them , however the people honored them .
44005014	More believers were added to the Lord , multitudes of both men and women .
44005015	They even carried out the sick into the streets , and laid them on cots and mattresses , so that as Peter came by , at the least his shadow might overshadow some of them .
44005016	Multitudes also came together from the cities around Jerusalem , bringing sick people , and those who were tormented by unclean spirits : and they were all healed .
44005017	But the high priest rose up , and all those who were with him ( which is the sect of the Sadducees ) , and they were filled with jealousy ,
44005018	and laid hands on the apostles , and put them in public custody .
44005019	But an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors by night , and brought them out , and said ,
44005020	" Go stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life . "
44005021	When they heard this , they entered into the temple about daybreak , and taught . But the high priest came , and those who were with him , and called the council together , and all the senate of the children of Israel , and sent to the prison to have them brought .
44005022	But the officers who came didn't find them in the prison . They returned and reported ,
44005023	" We found the prison shut and locked , and the guards standing before the doors , but when we had opened it up , we found no one inside . "
44005024	Now when the high priest , the captain of the temple , and the chief priests heard these words , they were very perplexed about them and what might become of this .
44005025	One came and told them , " Behold , the men whom you put in prison are in the temple , standing and teaching the people . "
44005026	Then the captain went with the officers , and brought them without violence , for they were afraid that the people might stone them .
44005027	When they had brought them , they set them before the council . The high priest questioned them ,
44005028	saying , " Didn't we strictly charge you not to teach in this name ? Behold , you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching , and intend to bring this man's blood on us . "
44005029	But Peter and the apostles answered , " We must obey God rather than men .
44005030	The God of our fathers raised up Jesus , whom you killed , hanging him on a tree .
44005031	God exalted him with his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior , to give repentance to Israel , and remission of sins .
44005032	We are His witnesses of these things ; and so also is the Holy Spirit , whom God has given to those who obey him . "
44005033	But they , when they heard this , were cut to the heart , and determined to kill them .
44005034	But one stood up in the council , a Pharisee named Gamaliel , a teacher of the law , honored by all the people , and commanded to take the apostles out a little while .
44005035	He said to them , " You men of Israel , be careful concerning these men , what you are about to do .
44005036	For before these days Theudas rose up , making himself out to be somebody ; to whom a number of men , about four hundred , joined themselves : who was slain ; and all , as many as obeyed him , were dispersed , and came to nothing .
44005037	After this man , Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the enrollment , and drew away some people after him . He also perished , and all , as many as obeyed him , were scattered abroad .
44005038	Now I tell you , refrain from these men , and leave them alone . For if this counsel or this work is of men , it will be overthrown .
44005039	But if it is of God , you will not be able to overthrow it , and you would be found even to be fighting against God . "
44005040	They agreed with him . When they had called the apostles to them , they beat them and charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus , and let them go .
44005041	They therefore departed from the presence of the council , rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for Jesus ' name .
44005042	Every day , in the temple and at home , they never stopped teaching and preaching Jesus , the Christ .
44006001	Now in those days , when the number of the disciples was multiplying , there arose a grumbling of the Grecian Jews against the Hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily service .
44006002	The twelve called the multitude of the disciples to them and said , " It is not appropriate for us to forsake the word of God and serve tables .
44006003	Therefore select from among you , brothers , seven men of good report , full of the Holy Spirit and of wisdom , whom we may appoint over this business .
44006004	But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word . "
44006005	These words pleased the whole multitude . They chose Stephen , a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit , Philip , Prochorus , Nicanor , Timon , Parmenas , and Nicolaus , a proselyte of Antioch ;
44006006	whom they set before the apostles . When they had prayed , they laid their hands on them .
44006007	The word of God increased and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly . A great company of the priests were obedient to the faith .
44006008	Stephen , full of faith and power , performed great wonders and signs among the people .
44006009	But some of those who were of the synagogue called " The Libertines , " and of the Cyrenians , of the Alexandrians , and of those of Cilicia and Asia arose , disputing with Stephen .
44006010	They weren't able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke .
44006011	Then they secretly induced men who said , " We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God . "
44006012	They stirred up the people , the elders , and the scribes , and came on him and seized him , and brought him in to the council ,
44006013	and set up false witnesses who said , " This man never stops speaking blasphemous words against this holy place and the law .
44006014	For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place , and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us . "
44006015	All who sat in the council , fastening their eyes on him , saw his face like it was the face of an angel .
44007001	The high priest said , " Are these things so ? "
44007002	He said , " Brothers and fathers , listen . The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham , when he was in Mesopotamia , before he lived in Haran ,
44007003	and said to him , ' Get out of your land , and from your relatives , and come into a land which I will show you . '
44007004	Then he came out of the land of the Chaldaeans , and lived in Haran . From there , when his father was dead , God moved him into this land , where you are now living .
44007005	He gave him no inheritance in it , no , not so much as to set his foot on . He promised that he would give it to him in possession , and to his seed after him , when he still had no child .
44007006	God spoke thus , that his seed would live as aliens in a strange land , and that they would be enslaved and mistreated for four hundred years .
44007007	' I will judge the nation to which they will be in bondage , ' said God , ' and after that will they come out , and serve me in this place . '
44007008	He gave him the covenant of circumcision . So Abraham became the father of Isaac , and circumcised him the eighth day . Isaac became the father of Jacob , and Jacob became the father of the twelve patriarchs .
44007009	" The patriarchs , moved with jealousy against Joseph , sold him into Egypt . God was with him ,
44007010	and delivered him out of all his afflictions , and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh , king of Egypt . He made him governor over Egypt and all his house .
44007011	Now a famine came over all the land of Egypt and Canaan , and great affliction . Our fathers found no food .
44007012	But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt , he sent forth our fathers the first time .
44007013	On the second time Joseph was made known to his brothers , and Joseph's race was revealed to Pharaoh .
44007014	Joseph sent , and called Jacob , his father , to him , and all his relatives , seventy-five souls .
44007015	Jacob went down into Egypt , and he died , himself and our fathers ,
44007016	and they were brought back to Shechem , and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in silver from the sons of Hamor of Shechem .
44007017	" But as the time of the promise came close which God swore to Abraham , the people grew and multiplied in Egypt ,
44007018	until there arose a different king , who didn't know Joseph .
44007019	The same dealt slyly with our race , and mistreated our fathers , that they should throw out their babies , so that they wouldn't stay alive .
44007020	At that time Moses was born , and was exceedingly handsome . He was nourished three months in his father's house .
44007021	When he was thrown out , Pharaoh's daughter took him up , and reared him as her own son .
44007022	Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians . He was mighty in his words and works .
44007023	But when he was forty years old , it came into his heart to visit his brothers , the children of Israel .
44007024	Seeing one of them suffer wrong , he defended him , and avenged him who was oppressed , striking the Egyptian .
44007025	He supposed that his brothers understood that God , by his hand , was giving them deliverance ; but they didn't understand .
44007026	The day following , he appeared to them as they fought , and urged them to be at peace again , saying , ' Sirs , you are brothers . Why do you wrong one to another ? '
44007027	But he who did his neighbor wrong pushed him away , saying , ' Who made you a ruler and a judge over us ?
44007028	Do you want to kill me , as you killed the Egyptian yesterday ? '
44007029	Moses fled at this saying , and became an alien in the land of Midian , where he became the father of two sons .
44007030	" When forty years were fulfilled , an angel of the Lord appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai , in a flame of fire in a bush .
44007031	When Moses saw it , he wondered at the sight . As he came close to see , a voice of the Lord came to him ,
44007032	' I am the God of your fathers , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . ' Moses trembled , and dared not look .
44007033	The Lord said to him , ' Take your sandals off of your feet , for the place where you stand is holy ground .
44007034	I have surely seen the affliction of my people that is in Egypt , and have heard their groaning . I have come down to deliver them . Now come , I will send you into Egypt . '
44007035	" This Moses , whom they refused , saying , ' Who made you a ruler and a judge ? ' - - God has sent him as both a ruler and a deliverer with the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush .
44007036	This man led them forth , having worked wonders and signs in Egypt , in the Red Sea , and in the wilderness forty years .
44007037	This is that Moses , who said to the children of Israel , ' The Lord God will raise up a prophet to you from among your brothers , like me . '
44007038	This is he who was in the assembly in the wilderness with the angel that spoke to him in the Mount Sinai , and with our fathers , who received living oracles to give to us ,
44007039	to whom our fathers wouldn't be obedient , but rejected him , and turned back in their hearts to Egypt ,
44007040	saying to Aaron , ' Make us gods that will go before us , for as for this Moses , who led us forth out of the land of Egypt , we don't know what has become of him . '
44007041	They made a calf in those days , and brought a sacrifice to the idol , and rejoiced in the works of their hands .
44007042	But God turned , and gave them up to serve the host of the sky , as it is written in the book of the prophets , ' Did you offer to me slain animals and sacrifices Forty years in the wilderness , O house of Israel ?
44007043	You took up the tent of Moloch , The star of your god Rephan , The figures which you made to worship . I will carry you away beyond Babylon . '
44007044	" Our fathers had the tent of the testimony in the wilderness , even as he who spoke to Moses appointed , that he should make it according to the pattern that he had seen .
44007045	Which also our fathers , in their turn , brought in with Joshua when they entered into the possession of the nations , whom God drove out before the face of our fathers , to the days of David ,
44007046	who found favor in the sight of God , and asked to find a habitation for the God of Jacob .
44007047	But Solomon built him a house .
44007048	However , the Most High doesn't dwell in temples made with hands , as the prophet says ,
44007049	' heaven is my throne , And the earth the footstool of my feet . What kind of house will you build me ? ' says the Lord ; ' Or what is the place of my rest ?
44007050	Didn't my hand make all these things ? '
44007051	" You stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears , you always resist the Holy Spirit ! As your fathers did , so you do .
44007052	Which of the prophets didn't your fathers persecute ? They killed those who foretold the coming of the Righteous One , of whom you have now become betrayers and murderers .
44007053	You received the law as it was ordained by angels , and didn't keep it ! "
44007054	Now when they heard these things , they were cut to the heart , and they gnashed at him with their teeth .
44007055	But he , being full of the Holy Spirit , looked up steadfastly into heaven , and saw the glory of God , and Jesus standing on the right hand of God ,
44007056	and said , " Behold , I see the heavens opened , and the Son of Man standing on the right hand of God ! "
44007057	But they cried out with a loud voice , and stopped their ears , and rushed at him with one accord .
44007058	They threw him out of the city , and stoned him . The witnesses placed their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul .
44007059	They stoned Stephen , as he called on the Lord , saying , " Lord Jesus , receive my Spirit ! "
44007060	He kneeled down , and cried with a loud voice , " Lord , don't hold this sin against them ! " When he had said this , he fell asleep .
44008001	Saul was consenting to his death . A great persecution arose against the assembly which was in Jerusalem in that day . They were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria , except for the apostles .
44008002	Devout men buried Stephen , and lamented greatly over him .
44008003	But Saul ravaged the assembly , entering into every house , and dragged both men and women off to prison .
44008004	Therefore those who were scattered abroad went around preaching the word .
44008005	Philip went down to the city of Samaria , and proclaimed to them the Christ .
44008006	The multitudes listened with one accord to the things that were spoken by Philip , when they heard and saw the signs which he did .
44008007	For unclean spirits came out of many of those who had them . They came out , crying with a loud voice . Many who had been paralyzed and lame were healed .
44008008	There was great joy in that city .
44008009	But there was a certain man , Simon by name , who had used sorcery in the city before , and amazed the people of Samaria , making himself out to be some great one ,
44008010	to whom they all listened , from the least to the greatest , saying , " This man is that great power of God . "
44008011	They listened to him , because for a long time he had amazed them with his sorceries .
44008012	But when they believed Philip preaching good news concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ , they were baptized , both men and women .
44008013	Simon himself also believed . Being baptized , he continued with Philip . Seeing signs and great miracles done , he was amazed .
44008014	Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God , they sent Peter and John to them ,
44008015	who , when they had come down , prayed for them , that they might receive the Holy Spirit ;
44008016	for as yet he had fallen on none of them . They had only been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus .
44008017	Then they laid their hands on them , and they received the Holy Spirit .
44008018	Now when Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles ' hands , he offered them money ,
44008019	saying , " Give me also this power , that whoever I lay my hands on may receive the Holy Spirit . "
44008020	But Peter said to him , " May your silver perish with you , because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money !
44008021	You have neither part nor lot in this matter , for your heart isn't right before God .
44008022	Repent therefore of this , your wickedness , and ask God if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you .
44008023	For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bondage of iniquity . "
44008024	Simon answered , " Pray for me to the Lord , that none of the things which you have spoken come on me . "
44008025	They therefore , when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord , returned to Jerusalem , and preached the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans .
44008026	But an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip , saying , " Arise , and go toward the south to the way that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza . This is a desert . "
44008027	He arose and went . Behold , there was a man of Ethiopia , a eunuch of great authority under Candace , queen of the Ethiopians , who was over all her treasure , who had come to Jerusalem to worship .
44008028	He was returning and sitting in his chariot , and was reading the prophet Isaiah .
44008029	The Spirit said to Philip , " Go near , and join yourself to this chariot . "
44008030	Philip ran to him , and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet , and said , " Do you understand you what you are reading ? "
44008031	He said , " How can I , unless someone explains it to me ? " He begged Philip to come up and sit with him .
44008032	Now the passage of the Scripture which he was reading was this , " He was led as a sheep to the slaughter . As a lamb before his shearer is silent , So he doesn't open his mouth .
44008033	In his humiliation , his judgment was taken away . Who will declare His generations ? For his life is taken from the earth . "
44008034	The eunuch answered Philip , " Please tell who the prophet is talking about : about himself , or about some other ? "
44008035	Philip opened his mouth , and beginning from this Scripture , preached to him Jesus .
44008036	As they went on the way , they came to some water , and the eunuch said , " Behold , here is water . What is keeping me from being baptized ? "
44008037	dummy verses inserted by amos
44008038	He commanded the chariot to stand still , and they both went down into the water , both Philip and the eunuch , and he baptized him .
44008039	When they came up out of the water , the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away , and the eunuch didn't see him any more , for he went on his way rejoicing .
44008040	But Philip was found at Azotus . Passing through , he preached the gospel to all the cities , until he came to Caesarea .
44009001	But Saul , still breathing threats and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord , went to the high priest ,
44009002	and asked for letters from him to the synagogues of Damascus , that if he found any who were of the Way , whether men or women , he might bring them bound to Jerusalem .
44009003	As he traveled , it happened that he got close to Damascus , and suddenly a light from the sky shone around him .
44009004	He fell on the earth , and heard a voice saying to him , " Saul , Saul , why do you persecute me ? "
44009005	He said , " Who are you , Lord ? " The Lord said , " I am Jesus , whom you are persecuting .
44009006	But rise up , and enter into the city , and you will be told what you must do . "
44009007	The men who traveled with him stood speechless , hearing the voice , but seeing no one .
44009008	Saul arose from the ground , and when his eyes were opened , he saw no one . They led him by the hand , and brought him into Damascus .
44009009	He was without sight for three days , and neither ate nor drank .
44009010	Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus named Ananias . The Lord said to him in a vision , " Ananias ! " He said , " Behold , it's me , Lord . "
44009011	The Lord said to him , " Arise , and go to the street which is called Straight , and inquire in the house of Judas for one named Saul , a man of Tarsus . For behold , he is praying ,
44009012	and in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias coming in , and laying his hands on him , that he might receive his sight . "
44009013	But Ananias answered , " Lord , I have heard from many about this man , how much evil he did to your saints at Jerusalem .
44009014	Here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on your name . "
44009015	But the Lord said to him , " Go your way , for he is my chosen vessel to bear my name before the nations and kings , and the children of Israel .
44009016	For I will show him how many things he must suffer for my name's sake . "
44009017	Ananias departed , and entered into the house . Laying his hands on him , he said , " Brother Saul , the Lord , who appeared to you in the way which you came , has sent me , that you may receive your sight , and be filled with the Holy Spirit . "
44009018	Immediately there fell from his eyes as it were scales , and he received his sight . He arose and was baptized .
44009019	He took food and was strengthened . Saul stayed several days with the disciples who were at Damascus .
44009020	Immediately in the synagogues he proclaimed the Christ , that he is the Son of God .
44009021	All who heard him were amazed , and said , " Isn't this he who in Jerusalem made havoc of those who called on this name ? And he had come here intending to bring them bound before the chief priests ! "
44009022	But Saul increased more in strength , and confounded the Jews who lived at Damascus , proving that this is the Christ .
44009023	When many days were fulfilled , the Jews conspired together to kill him ,
44009024	but their plot became known to Saul . They watched the gates both day and night that they might kill him ,
44009025	but his disciples took him by night , and let him down through the wall , lowering him in a basket .
44009026	When Saul had come to Jerusalem , he tried to join himself to the disciples . They were all afraid of him , not believing that he was a disciple .
44009027	But Barnabas took him , and brought him to the apostles , and declared to them how he had seen the Lord in the way , and that he had spoken to him , and how at Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of Jesus .
44009028	He was with them going in and going out at Jerusalem ,
44009029	preaching boldly in the name of the Lord . He spoke and disputed against the Grecian Jews , but they were seeking to kill him .
44009030	When the brothers knew it , they brought him down to Caesarea , and sent him out to Tarsus .
44009031	So the assemblies throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace , and were built up . They were multiplied , walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit .
44009032	It happened , as Peter went throughout all those parts , he came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda .
44009033	There he found a certain man named Aeneas , who had been bedridden for eight years , because he was paralyzed .
44009034	Peter said to him , " Aeneas , Jesus Christ heals you . Get up and make your bed ! " Immediately he arose .
44009035	All who lived at Lydda and in Sharon saw him , and they turned to the Lord .
44009036	Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha , which when translated , means Dorcas . This woman was full of good works and acts of mercy which she did .
44009037	It happened in those days that she fell sick , and died . When they had washed her , they laid her in an upper chamber .
44009038	As Lydda was near Joppa , the disciples , hearing that Peter was there , sent two men to him , imploring him not to delay in coming to them .
44009039	Peter got up and went with them . When he had come , they brought him into the upper chamber . All the widows stood by him weeping , and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made while she was with them .
44009040	Peter put them all out , and kneeled down and prayed . Turning to the body , he said , " Tabitha , get up ! " She opened her eyes , and when she saw Peter , she sat up .
44009041	He gave her his hand , and raised her up . Calling the saints and widows , he presented her alive .
44009042	It became known throughout all Joppa , and many believed in the Lord .
44009043	It happened , that he stayed many days in Joppa with one Simon , a tanner .
44010001	Now there was a certain man in Caesarea , Cornelius by name , a centurion of what was called the Italian Regiment ,
44010002	a devout man , and one who feared God with all his house , who gave alms generously to the people , and always prayed to God .
44010003	At about the ninth hour of the day , he clearly saw in a vision an angel of God coming to him , and saying to him , " Cornelius ! "
44010004	He , fastening his eyes on him , and being frightened , said , " What is it , Lord ? " He said to him , " Your prayers and your alms have gone up for a memorial before God .
44010005	Now send men to Joppa , and get one Simon , who is surnamed Peter .
44010006	He lodges with one Simon a tanner , whose house is by the seaside . "
44010007	When the angel who spoke to him had departed , Cornelius called two of his household servants , and a devout soldier of those who waited on him continually .
44010008	Having explained everything to them , he sent them to Joppa .
44010009	Now on the next day , as they were on their journey , and got close to the city , Peter went up on the housetop to pray , at about noon .
44010010	He became hungry , and desired to eat , but while they were preparing , he fell into a trance .
44010011	He saw heaven opened , and a certain container descending to him , like a great sheet , let down by four corners on the earth ,
44010012	in which were all kinds of four-footed animals of the earth , wild animals , reptiles , and birds of the sky .
44010013	A voice came to him , " Rise , Peter , kill and eat ! "
44010014	But Peter said , " Not so , Lord ; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean . "
44010015	A voice came to him again the second time , " What God has cleansed , you must not make unholy . "
44010016	This was done three times , and immediately the vessel was received up into heaven .
44010017	Now while Peter was very perplexed in himself what the vision which he had seen might mean , behold , the men who were sent by Cornelius , having made inquiry for Simon's house , stood before the gate ,
44010018	and called and asked whether Simon , who was surnamed Peter , was lodging there .
44010019	While Peter thought about the vision , the Spirit said to him , " Behold , three men seek you .
44010020	But arise , get down , and go with them , doubting nothing ; for I have sent them . "
44010021	Peter went down to the men , and said , " Behold , I am he whom you seek . Why have you come ? "
44010022	They said , " Cornelius a centurion , a righteous man and one who fears God , and well spoken of by all the nation of the Jews , was directed by a holy angel to invite you to his house , and to listen to what you say .
44010023	So he called them in and lodged them . On the next day Peter arose and went out with them , and some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him .
44010024	On the next day they entered into Caesarea . Cornelius was waiting for them , having called together his relatives and his near friends .
44010025	When it happened that Peter entered , Cornelius met him , and fell down at his feet , and worshipped him .
44010026	But Peter raised him up , saying , " Stand up ! I myself am also a man . "
44010027	As he talked with him , he went in , and found many come together .
44010028	He said to them , " You yourselves know how it is an unlawful thing for a man who is a Jew to join himself or come to one of another nation , but God has shown me that I shouldn't call any man unholy or unclean .
44010029	Therefore also I came without complaint when I was sent for . I ask therefore , why did you send for me ? "
44010030	Cornelius said , " Four days ago , I was fasting until this hour , and at the ninth hour , I prayed in my house , and behold , a man stood before me in bright clothing ,
44010031	and said , ' Cornelius , your prayer is heard , and your alms are remembered in the sight of God .
44010032	Send therefore to Joppa , and call to you Simon , who is surnamed Peter . He lodges in the house of Simon a tanner , by the seaside . When he comes , he will speak to you . '
44010033	Therefore I sent to you at once , and it was good of you to come . Now therefore we are all here present in the sight of God to hear all things that have been commanded you by God . "
44010034	Peter opened his mouth and said , " Truly I perceive that God doesn't show favoritism ,
44010035	but in every nation he who fears him , and works righteousness , is acceptable to him .
44010036	The word which he sent to the children of Israel , preaching good news of peace by Jesus Christ ( he is Lord of all ) :
44010037	that spoken word you yourselves know , which was proclaimed throughout all Judea , beginning from Galilee , after the baptism which John preached ;
44010038	even Jesus of Nazareth , how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power , who went about doing good , and healing all who were oppressed by the devil ; for God was with him .
44010039	We are witnesses of all things which he did both in the country of the Jews , and in Jerusalem ; whom they also killed , hanging him on a tree .
44010040	God raised him up the third day , and gave him to be revealed ,
44010041	not to all the people , but to witnesses who were chosen before by God , to us , who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead .
44010042	He charged us to preach to the people , and to testify that this is he who is appointed by God as the Judge of the living and the dead .
44010043	All the prophets testify about him , that through his name everyone who believes in him will receive remission of sins . "
44010044	While Peter was still speaking these words , the Holy Spirit fell on all those who heard the word .
44010045	They of the circumcision who believed were amazed , as many as came with Peter , because the gift of the Holy Spirit was also poured out on the Gentiles .
44010046	For they heard them speak with other languages , and magnify God . Then Peter answered ,
44010047	" Can any man forbid the water , that these who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we should not be baptized , ? "
44010048	He commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ . Then they asked him to stay some days .
44011001	Now the apostles and the brothers who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God .
44011002	When Peter had come up to Jerusalem , those who were of the circumcision contended with him ,
44011003	saying , " You went in to uncircumcised men , and ate with them ! "
44011004	But Peter began , and explained to them in order , saying ,
44011005	" I was in the city of Joppa praying , and in a trance I saw a vision : a certain container descending , like it was a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners . It came as far as me ,
44011006	on which , when I had looked intently , I considered , and saw the four-footed animals of the earth , wild animals , creeping things , and birds of the sky .
44011007	I also heard a voice saying to me , ' Rise , Peter , kill and eat ! '
44011008	But I said , ' Not so , Lord , for nothing unholy or unclean has ever entered into my mouth . '
44011009	But a voice answered me the second time out of heaven , ' What God has cleansed , don't you make unholy . '
44011010	This was done three times , and all were drawn up again into heaven .
44011011	Behold , immediately three men stood before the house where I was , having been sent from Caesarea to me .
44011012	The Spirit told me to go with them , without discriminating . These six brothers also accompanied me , and we entered into the man's house .
44011013	He told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house , and saying to him , ' Send to Joppa , and get Simon , whose surname is Peter ,
44011014	who will speak to you words whereby you will be saved , you and all your house . '
44011015	As I began to speak , the Holy Spirit fell on them , even as on us at the beginning .
44011016	I remembered the word of the Lord , how he said , ' John indeed baptized with water , but you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit . '
44011017	If then God gave to them the same gift as us , when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ , who was I , that I could withstand God ? "
44011018	When they heard these things , they held their peace , and glorified God , saying , " Then God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance to life ! "
44011019	They therefore who were scattered abroad by the oppression that arose about Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia , Cyprus , and Antioch , speaking the word to no one except only to Jews .
44011020	But there were some of them , men of Cyprus and Cyrene , who , when they had come to Antioch , spoke to the Greeks , preaching the Lord Jesus .
44011021	The hand of the Lord was with them , and a great number believed and turned to the Lord .
44011022	The report concerning them came to the ears of the assembly which was in Jerusalem . They sent forth Barnabas to go as far as Antioch ,
44011023	who , when he had come , and had seen the grace of God , was glad . He exhorted them all , that with purpose of heart they would remain near to the Lord .
44011024	For he was a good man , and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith , and many people were added to the Lord .
44011025	Barnabas went forth to Tarsus to look for Saul .
44011026	When he had found him , he brought him to Antioch . It happened , that even for a whole year they were gathered together with the assembly , and taught many people . The disciples were first called Christians in Antioch .
44011027	Now in these days , prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch .
44011028	One of them named Agabus stood up , and indicated by the Spirit that there should be a great famine over all the world , which also happened in the days of Claudius .
44011029	The disciples , as anyone had plenty , each determined to send relief to the brothers who lived in Judea ;
44011030	which they also did , sending it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul .
44012001	Now about that time , Herod the king put forth his hands to oppress some of the assembly .
44012002	He killed James , the brother of John , with the sword .
44012003	When he saw that it pleased the Jews , he proceeded to seize Peter also . This was during the days of unleavened bread .
44012004	When he had captured him , he put him in prison , and delivered him to four squads of four soldiers each to guard him , intending to bring him out to the people after the Passover .
44012005	Peter therefore was kept in the prison , but constant prayer was made by the assembly to God for him .
44012006	The same night when Herod was about to bring him out , Peter was sleeping between two soldiers , bound with two chains . Guards in front of the door kept the prison .
44012007	Behold , an angel of the Lord stood by him , and a light shone in the cell . He struck Peter on the side , and woke him up , saying , " Stand up quickly ! " His chains fell off from his hands .
44012008	The angel said to him , " Put on your clothes , and tie on your sandals . " He did so . He said to him , " Wrap your cloak around you , and follow me . "
44012009	He went out , and followed him . He didn't know that what was done by the angel was real , but thought he saw a vision .
44012010	When they were past the first and the second guard , they came to the iron gate that leads into the city , which opened to them by itself . They went out , and passed on through one street , and immediately the angel departed from him .
44012011	When Peter had come to himself , he said , " Now I truly know that the Lord has sent forth his angel and delivered me out of the hand of Herod , and from everything the Jewish people were expecting . "
44012012	Thinking about that , he came to the house of Mary , the mother of John whose surname was Mark , where many were gathered together and were praying .
44012013	When Peter knocked at the door of the gate , a maid named Rhoda came to answer .
44012014	When she recognized Peter's voice , she didn't open the gate for joy , but ran in , and reported that Peter stood before the gate .
44012015	They said to her , " You are crazy ! " But she insisted that it was so . They said , " It is his angel . "
44012016	But Peter continued knocking . When they had opened , they saw him , and were amazed .
44012017	But he , beckoning to them with his hand to be silent , declared to them how the Lord had brought him forth out of the prison . He said , " Tell these things to James , and to the brothers . " He departed , and went to another place .
44012018	Now as soon as it was day , there was no small stir among the soldiers about what had become of Peter .
44012019	When Herod had sought for him , and didn't find him , he examined the guards , and commanded that they should be put to death . He went down from Judea to Caesarea , and stayed there .
44012020	Now Herod was highly displeased with those of Tyre and Sidon . They came with one accord to him , and , having made Blastus , the king's chamberlain , their friend , they asked for peace , because their country depended on the king's country for food .
44012021	On an appointed day , Herod dressed himself in royal clothing , sat on the throne , and gave a speech to them .
44012022	The people shouted , " The voice of a god , and not of a man ! "
44012023	Immediately an angel of the Lord struck him , because he didn't give God the glory , and he was eaten by worms , and he died .
44012024	But the word of God grew and multiplied .
44012025	Barnabas and Saul returned to Jerusalem , when they had fulfilled their service , also taking with them John whose surname was Mark .
44013001	Now in the assembly that was at Antioch there were some prophets and teachers : Barnabas , Simeon who was called Niger , Lucius of Cyrene , Manaen the foster-brother of Herod the tetrarch , and Saul .
44013002	As they served the Lord and fasted , the Holy Spirit said , " Separate Barnabas and Saul for me , for the work to which I have called them . "
44013003	Then , when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them , they sent them away .
44013004	So , being sent forth by the Holy Spirit , they went down to Seleucia . From there they sailed to Cyprus .
44013005	When they were at Salamis , they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews . They had also John as their attendant .
44013006	When they had gone through the island to Paphos , they found a certain sorcerer , a false prophet , a Jew , whose name was Bar-Jesus ,
44013007	who was with the proconsul , Sergius Paulus , a man of understanding . The same called Barnabas and Saul to him , and sought to hear the word of God .
44013008	But Elymas the sorcerer ( for so is his name by interpretation ) withstood them , seeking to turn aside the proconsul from the faith .
44013009	But Saul , who is also called Paul , filled with the Holy Spirit , fastened his eyes on him ,
44013010	and said , " Full of all deceit and all cunning , you son of the devil , you enemy of all righteousness , will you not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord ?
44013011	Now , behold , the hand of the Lord is on you , and you will be blind , not seeing the sun for a season ! " Immediately there fell on him a mist and darkness . He went around seeking someone to lead him by the hand .
44013012	Then the proconsul , when he saw what was done , believed , being astonished at the teaching of the Lord .
44013013	Now Paul and his company set sail from Paphos , and came to Perga in Pamphylia . John departed from them and returned to Jerusalem .
44013014	But they , passing through from Perga , came to Antioch of Pisidia . They went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day , and sat down .
44013015	After the reading of the law and the prophets , the rulers of the synagogue sent to them , saying , " Brothers , if you have any word of exhortation for the people , speak . "
44013016	Paul stood up , and beckoning with his hand said , " Men of Israel , and you who fear God , listen .
44013017	The God of this people Israel chose our fathers , and exalted the people when they stayed as aliens in the land of Egypt , and with an uplifted arm , he led them forth out of it .
44013018	For about the time of forty years he put up with them in the wilderness .
44013019	When he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan , he gave them their land for an inheritance , for about four hundred and fifty years .
44013020	After these things he gave them judges until Samuel , the prophet .
44013021	Afterward they asked for a king , and God gave to them Saul , the son of Kish , a man of the tribe of Benjamin , for forty years .
44013022	When he had removed him , he raised up David to be their king , to whom he also testified , ' I have found David , the son of Jesse , a man after my heart , who will do all my will . '
44013023	From this man's seed , God has brought salvation to Israel according to his promise ,
44013024	before his coming , when John had first preached the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel .
44013025	As John was fulfilling his course , he said , ' What do you suppose that I am ? I am not he . But behold , there comes one after me the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie . '
44013026	Brothers , children of the stock of Abraham , and those among you who fear God , the word of this salvation is sent forth to you .
44013027	For those who dwell in Jerusalem , and their rulers , because they didn't know him , nor the voices of the prophets which are read every Sabbath , fulfilled them by condemning him .
44013028	Though they found no cause of death , they still asked Pilate to have him killed .
44013029	When they had fulfilled all things that were written about him , they took him down from the tree , and laid him in a tomb .
44013030	But God raised him from the dead ,
44013031	and he was seen for many days by those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem , who are his witnesses to the people .
44013032	We bring you good news of the promise made to the fathers ,
44013033	that God has fulfilled the same to us , their children , in that he raised up Jesus . As it is also written in the second psalm , ' You are my Son . Today I have become your father . '
44013034	" Concerning that he raised him up from the dead , now no more to return to corruption , he has spoken thus : ' I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David . '
44013035	Therefore he says also in another psalm , ' You will not allow your Holy One to see decay . '
44013036	For David , after he had in his own generation served the counsel of God , fell asleep , and was laid with his fathers , and saw decay .
44013037	But he whom God raised up saw no decay .
44013038	Be it known to you therefore , brothers , that through this man is proclaimed to you remission of sins ,
44013039	and by him everyone who believes is justified from all things , from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses .
44013040	Beware therefore , lest that come on you which is spoken in the prophets :
44013041	' Behold , you scoffers , and wonder , and perish ; For I work a work in your days , A work which you will in no way believe , if one declares it to you . ' "
44013042	So when the Jews went out of the synagogue , the Gentiles begged that these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath .
44013043	Now when the synagogue broke up , many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas ; who , speaking to them , urged them to continue in the grace of God .
44013044	The next Sabbath almost the whole city was gathered together to hear the word of God .
44013045	But when the Jews saw the multitudes , they were filled with jealousy , and contradicted the things which were spoken by Paul , and blasphemed .
44013046	Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly , and said , " It was necessary that God's word should be spoken to you first . Since indeed you thrust it from you , and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life , behold , we turn to the Gentiles .
44013047	For so has the Lord commanded us , saying , ' I have set you as a light of the Gentiles , That you should be for salvation to the uttermost parts of the earth . ' "
44013048	As the Gentiles heard this , they were glad , and glorified the word of God . As many as were appointed to eternal life believed .
44013049	The Lord's word was spread abroad throughout all the region .
44013050	But the Jews urged on the devout women of honorable estate , and the chief men of the city , and stirred up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas , and threw them out of their borders .
44013051	But they shook off the dust of their feet against them , and came to Iconium .
44013052	The disciples were filled with joy with the Holy Spirit .
44014001	It happened in Iconium that they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews , and so spoke that a great multitude both of Jews and of Greeks believed .
44014002	But the disobedient Jews stirred up and embittered the souls of the Gentiles against the brothers .
44014003	Therefore they stayed there a long time , speaking boldly in the Lord , who testified to the word of his grace , granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands .
44014004	But the multitude of the city was divided . Part sided with the Jews , and part with the apostles .
44014005	When some of both the Gentiles and the Jews , with their rulers , made a violent attempt to insult them and to stone them ,
44014006	they became aware of it , and fled to the cities of Lycaonia , Lystra , Derbe , and the surrounding region .
44014007	There they preached the gospel .
44014008	At Lystra a certain man sat , impotent in his feet , a cripple from his mother's womb , who never had walked .
44014009	He was listening to Paul speaking , who , fastening eyes on him , and seeing that he had faith to be made whole ,
44014010	said with a loud voice , " Stand upright on your feet ! " He leaped up and walked .
44014011	When the multitude saw what Paul had done , they lifted up their voice , saying in the language of Lycaonia , " The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men ! "
44014012	They called Barnabas " Jupiter , " and Paul " Mercury , " because he was the chief speaker .
44014013	The priest of Jupiter , whose temple was in front of their city , brought oxen and garlands to the gates , and would have made a sacrifice with the multitudes .
44014014	But when the apostles , Barnabas and Paul , heard of it , they tore their clothes , and sprang into the multitude , crying out ,
44014015	" Men , why are you doing these things ? We also are men of like passions with you , and bring you good news , that you should turn from these vain things to the living God , who made the sky and the earth and the sea , and all that is in them ;
44014016	who in the generations gone by allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways .
44014017	Yet he didn't leave himself without witness , in that he did good and gave you rains from the sky and fruitful seasons , filling our hearts with food and gladness . "
44014018	Even saying these things , they hardly stopped the multitudes from making a sacrifice to them .
44014019	But some Jews from Antioch and Iconium came there , and having persuaded the multitudes , they stoned Paul , and dragged him out of the city , supposing that he was dead .
44014020	But as the disciples stood around him , he rose up , and entered into the city . On the next day he went out with Barnabas to Derbe .
44014021	When they had preached the gospel to that city , and had made many disciples , they returned to Lystra , Iconium , and Antioch ,
44014022	confirming the souls of the disciples , exhorting them to continue in the faith , and that through many afflictions we must enter into the kingdom of God .
44014023	When they had appointed elders for them in every assembly , and had prayed with fasting , they commended them to the Lord , on whom they had believed .
44014024	They passed through Pisidia , and came to Pamphylia .
44014025	When they had spoken the word in Perga , they went down to Attalia .
44014026	From there they sailed to Antioch , from where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled .
44014027	When they had arrived , and had gathered the assembly together , they reported all the things that God had done with them , and that he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles .
44014028	They stayed there with the disciples for a long time .
44015001	Some men came down from Judea and taught the brothers , " Unless you are circumcised after the custom of Moses , you can't be saved . "
44015002	Therefore when Paul and Barnabas had no small discord and discussion with them , they appointed Paul and Barnabas , and some others of them , to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question .
44015003	They , being sent on their way by the assembly , passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria , declaring the conversion of the Gentiles . They caused great joy to all the brothers .
44015004	When they had come to Jerusalem , they were received by the assembly and the apostles and the elders , and they reported all things that God had done with them .
44015005	But some of the sect of the Pharisees who believed rose up , saying , " It is necessary to circumcise them , and to charge them to keep the law of Moses . "
44015006	The apostles and the elders were gathered together to see about this matter .
44015007	When there had been much discussion , Peter rose up and said to them , " Brothers , you know that a good while ago God made choice among you , that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel , and believe .
44015008	God , who knows the heart , testified about them , giving them the Holy Spirit , just like he did to us .
44015009	He made no distinction between us and them , cleansing their hearts by faith .
44015010	Now therefore why do you tempt God , that you should put a yoke on the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear ?
44015011	But we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus , just as they are . "
44015012	All the multitude kept silence , and they listened to Barnabas and Paul reporting what signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them .
44015013	After they were silent , James answered , " Brothers , listen to me .
44015014	Simeon has reported how God first visited the Gentiles , to take out of them a people for his name .
44015015	This agrees with the words of the prophets . As it is written ,
44015016	' After these things I will return . I will again build the tent of David , which has fallen . I will again build its ruins . I will set it up :
44015017	That the rest of men may seek after the Lord ; All the Gentiles who are called by my name , Says the Lord , who does all these things .
44015018	All his works are known to God from eternity . '
44015019	" Therefore my judgment is that we don't trouble those from among the Gentiles who turn to God ,
44015020	but that we write to them that they abstain from the pollution of idols , from sexual immorality , from what is strangled , and from blood .
44015021	For Moses from generations of old has in every city those who preach him , being read in the synagogues every Sabbath . "
44015022	Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders , with the whole assembly , to choose men out of their company , and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas : Judas called Barsabbas , and Silas , chief men among the brothers .
44015023	They wrote these things by their hand : " The apostles , the elders , and the brothers , to the brothers who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia : greetings .
44015024	Because we have heard that some who went out from us have troubled you with words , unsettling your souls , saying , ' You must be circumcised and keep the law , ' to whom we gave no commandment ;
44015025	it seemed good to us , having come to one accord , to choose out men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul ,
44015026	men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ .
44015027	We have sent therefore Judas and Silas , who themselves will also tell you the same things by word of mouth .
44015028	For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit , and to us , to lay no greater burden on you than these necessary things :
44015029	that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols , from blood , from things strangled , and from sexual immorality , from which if you keep yourselves , it will be well with you . Farewell . "
44015030	So , when they were sent off , they came to Antioch . Having gathered the multitude together , they delivered the letter .
44015031	When they had read it , they rejoiced for the consolation .
44015032	Judas and Silas , also being prophets themselves , encouraged the brothers with many words , and strengthened them .
44015033	After they had spent some time there , they were sent back with greetings from the brothers to the apostles .

44015035	But Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch , teaching and preaching the word of the Lord , with many others also .
44015036	After some days Paul said to Barnabas , " Let's return now and visit our brothers in every city in which we proclaimed the word of the Lord , to see how they are doing . "
44015037	Barnabas planned to take John with them also , who was called Mark .
44015038	But Paul didn't think that it was a good idea to take with them someone who withdrew from them from Pamphylia , and didn't go with them to do the work .
44015039	Then there arose a sharp contention , so that they separated from each other . Barnabas took Mark with him , and sailed away to Cyprus ,
44015040	but Paul chose Silas , and went out , being commended by the brothers to the grace of God .
44015041	He went through Syria and Cilicia , strengthening the assemblies .
44016001	He came to Derbe and Lystra : and behold , a certain disciple was there , named Timothy , the son of a Jewess who believed ; but his father was a Greek .
44016002	The brothers who were at Lystra and Iconium gave a good testimony about him .
44016003	Paul wanted to have him go forth with him , and he took and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those parts ; for they all knew that his father was a Greek .
44016004	As they went on their way through the cities , they delivered the decrees to them to keep which had been ordained by the apostles and elders who were at Jerusalem .
44016005	So the assemblies were strengthened in the faith , and increased in number daily .
44016006	When they had gone through the region of Phrygia and Galatia , they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia .
44016007	When they had come opposite Mysia , they tried to go into Bithynia , but the Spirit didn't allow them .
44016008	Passing by Mysia , they came down to Troas .
44016009	A vision appeared to Paul in the night . There was a man of Macedonia standing , begging him , and saying , " Come over into Macedonia and help us . "
44016010	When he had seen the vision , immediately we sought to go forth into Macedonia , concluding that the Lord had called us to preach the gospel to them .
44016011	Setting sail therefore from Troas , we made a straight course to Samothrace , and the day following to Neapolis ;
44016012	and from there to Philippi , which is a city of Macedonia , the first of the district , a Roman colony . We were staying some days in this city .
44016013	On the Sabbath day we went forth outside of the city by a riverside , where we supposed there was a place of prayer , and we sat down , and spoke to the women who had come together .
44016014	A certain woman named Lydia , a seller of purple , of the city of Thyatira , one who worshipped God , heard us ; whose heart the Lord opened to listen to the things which were spoken by Paul .
44016015	When she and her household were baptized , she begged us , saying , " If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord , come into my house , and stay . " She urged us .
44016016	It happened , as we were going to prayer , that a certain girl having a spirit of divination met us , who brought her masters much gain by fortune telling .
44016017	The same , following after Paul and us , cried out , " These men are servants of the Most High God , who proclaim to us the way of salvation ! "
44016018	This she did for many days . But Paul , becoming distressed , turned and said to the spirit , " I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her ! " It came out that very hour .
44016019	But when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone , they laid hold on Paul and Silas , and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers .
44016020	When they had brought them to the magistrates , they said , " These men , being Jews , are agitating our city ,
44016021	and set forth customs which it is not lawful for us to accept or to observe , being Romans . "
44016022	The multitude rose up together against them , and the magistrates tore their clothes off of them , and commanded them to be beaten with rods .
44016023	When they had laid many stripes on them , they threw them into prison , charging the jailer to keep them safely ,
44016024	who , having received such a charge , threw them into the inner prison , and secured their feet in the stocks .
44016025	But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God , and the prisoners were listening to them .
44016026	Suddenly there was a great earthquake , so that the foundations of the prison were shaken ; and immediately all the doors were opened , and everyone's bonds were loosened .
44016027	The jailer , being roused out of sleep and seeing the prison doors open , drew his sword and was about to kill himself , supposing that the prisoners had escaped .
44016028	But Paul cried with a loud voice , saying , " Don't harm yourself , for we are all here ! "
44016029	He called for lights and sprang in , and , fell down trembling before Paul and Silas ,
44016030	and brought them out and said , " Sirs , what must I do to be saved ? "
44016031	They said , " Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ , and you will be saved , you and your house . "
44016032	They spoke the word of the Lord to him , and to all who were in his house .
44016033	He took them the same hour of the night , and washed their stripes , and was immediately baptized , he and all his household .
44016034	He brought them up into his house , and set food before them , and rejoiced greatly , with all his house , having believed in God .
44016035	But when it was day , the magistrates sent the sergeants , saying , " Let those men go . "
44016036	The jailer reported these words to Paul , saying , " The magistrates have sent to let you go ; now therefore come out , and go in peace . "
44016037	But Paul said to them , " They have beaten us publicly , without a trial , men who are Romans , and have cast us into prison ! Do they now release us secretly ? No , most assuredly , but let them come themselves and bring us out ! "
44016038	The sergeants reported these words to the magistrates , and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans ,
44016039	and they came and begged them . When they had brought them out , they asked them to depart from the city .
44016040	They went out of the prison , and entered into Lydia's house . When they had seen the brothers , they comforted them , and departed .
44017001	Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia , they came to Thessalonica , where there was a synagogue of the Jews .
44017002	Paul , as was his custom , went in to them , and for three Sabbath days reasoned with them from the Scriptures ,
44017003	explaining and demonstrating that the Christ had to suffer , and to rise again from the dead , and saying , " This Jesus , whom I proclaim to you , is the Christ . "
44017004	Some of them were persuaded , and joined Paul and Silas , of the devout Greeks a great multitude , and not a few of the chief women .
44017005	But the disobedient Jews gathered some wicked men from the marketplace , and gathering a crowd , set the city in an uproar . Assaulting the house of Jason , they sought to bring them forth to the people .
44017006	When they didn't find them , they dragged Jason and certain brothers before the rulers of the city , crying , " These who have turned the world upside down have come here also ,
44017007	whom Jason has received . These all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar , saying that there is another king , Jesus ! "
44017008	The multitude and the rulers of the city were troubled when they heard these things .
44017009	When they had taken security from Jason and the rest , they let them go .
44017010	The brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Beroea . When they arrived , they went into the Jewish synagogue .
44017011	Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica , in that they received the word with all readiness of the mind , examining the Scriptures daily , whether these things were so .
44017012	Many of them therefore believed ; also of the Greek women of honorable estate , and not a few men .
44017013	But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul at Beroea also , they came there likewise , agitating the multitudes .
44017014	Then the brothers immediately sent forth Paul to go as far as to the sea , and Silas and Timothy still stayed there .
44017015	But those who escorted Paul brought him as far as Athens . Receiving a commandment to Silas and Timothy that they should come to him with all speed , they departed .
44017016	Now while Paul waited for them at Athens , his spirit was provoked within him as he saw the city full of idols .
44017017	So he reasoned in the synagogue with Jews and the devout persons , and in the marketplace every day with those who met him .
44017018	Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also encountered him . Some said , " What does this babbler want to say ? " Others said , " He seems to be advocating foreign demons , " because he preached Jesus and the resurrection .
44017019	They took hold of him , and brought him to the Areopagus , saying , " May we know what this new teaching is , which is spoken by you ?
44017020	For you bring certain strange things to our ears . We want to know therefore what these things mean . "
44017021	Now all the Athenians and the strangers living there spent their time in nothing else , but either to tell or to hear some new thing .
44017022	Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus , and said , " You men of Athens , I perceive that you are very religious in all things .
44017023	For as I passed along , and observed the objects of your worship , I found also an altar with this inscription : ' TO AN UNKNOWN GOD . ' What therefore you worship in ignorance , this I announce to you .
44017024	The God who made the world and all things in it , he , being Lord of heaven and earth , dwells not in temples made with hands ,
44017025	neither is he served by men's hands , as though he needed anything , seeing he himself gives to all life and breath , and all things .
44017026	He made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the surface of the earth , having determined appointed seasons , and the bounds of their habitation ,
44017027	that they should seek the Lord , if perhaps they might reach out for him and find him , though he is not far from each one of us .
44017028	' For in him we live , and move , and have our being . ' As some of your own poets have said , ' For we are also his offspring . '
44017029	Being then the offspring of God , we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold , or silver , or stone , engraved by art and device of man .
44017030	The times of ignorance therefore God overlooked . But now he commands that all men everywhere should repent ,
44017031	because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he has ordained ; whereof he has given assurance to all men , in that he has raised him from the dead . "
44017032	Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead , some mocked ; but others said , " We want to hear you yet again concerning this . "
44017033	Thus Paul went out from among them .
44017034	But certain men joined with him , and believed , among whom also was Dionysius the Areopagite , and a woman named Damaris , and others with them .
44018001	After these things Paul departed from Athens , and came to Corinth .
44018002	He found a certain Jew named Aquila , a man of Pontus by race , who had recently come from Italy , with his wife Priscilla , because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome . He came to them ,
44018003	and because he practiced the same trade , he lived with them and worked , for by trade they were tent makers .
44018004	He reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath , and persuaded Jews and Greeks .
44018005	But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia , Paul was compelled by the Spirit , testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ .
44018006	When they opposed him and blasphemed , he shook out his clothing and said to them , " Your blood be on your own heads ! I am clean . From now on , I will go to the Gentiles ! "
44018007	He departed there , and went into the house of a certain man named Justus , one who worshipped God , whose house was next door to the synagogue .
44018008	Crispus , the ruler of the synagogue , believed in the Lord with all his house . Many of the Corinthians , hearing , believed and were baptized .
44018009	The Lord said to Paul in the night by a vision , " Don't be afraid , but speak and don't be silent ;
44018010	for I am with you , and no one will attack you to harm you , for I have many people in this city . "
44018011	He lived there a year and six months , teaching the word of God among them .
44018012	But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia , the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him before the judgment seat ,
44018013	saying , " This man persuades men to worship God contrary to the law . "
44018014	But when Paul was about to open his mouth , Gallio said to the Jews , " If indeed it were a matter of wrong or of wicked crime , Jews , it would be reasonable that I should bear with you ;
44018015	but if they are questions about words and names and your own law , look to it yourselves . For I don't want to be a judge of these matters . "
44018016	He drove them from the judgment seat .
44018017	Then all the Greeks laid hold on Sosthenes , the ruler of the synagogue , and beat him before the judgment seat . Gallio didn't care about any of these things .
44018018	Paul , having stayed after this yet many days , took his leave of the brothers , and sailed from there for Syria , and Priscilla and Aquila with him . He shaved his head in Cenchreae , for he had a vow .
44018019	He came to Ephesus , and he left them there ; but he himself entered into the synagogue , and reasoned with the Jews .
44018020	When they asked him to stay a longer time , he declined ;
44018021	but taking his leave of them , and saying , " I must by all means keep this coming feast in Jerusalem , but I will return again to you if God wills , " he set sail from Ephesus .
44018022	When he had landed at Caesarea , he went up and greeted the assembly , and went down to Antioch .
44018023	Having spent some time there , he departed , and went through the region of Galatia , and Phrygia , in order , establishing all the disciples .
44018024	Now a certain Jew named Apollos , an Alexandrian by race , an eloquent man , came to Ephesus . He was mighty in the scriptures .
44018025	This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord ; and being fervent in spirit , he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus , although he knew only the baptism of John .
44018026	He began to speak boldly in the synagogue . But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him , they took him aside , and explained to him the way of God more accurately .
44018027	When he had determined to pass over into Achaia , the brothers encouraged him , and wrote to the disciples to receive him . When he had come , he helped them much , who had believed through grace ;
44018028	for he powerfully refuted the Jews , publicly showing by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ .
44019001	It happened that , while Apollos was at Corinth , Paul , having passed through the upper country , came to Ephesus , and found certain disciples .
44019002	He said to them , " Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed ? " They said to him , " No , we did not so much as hear whether there is a Holy Spirit . "
44019003	He said , " Into what then were you baptized ? " They said , " Into John's baptism . "
44019004	Paul said , " John indeed baptized with the baptism of repentance , saying to the people that they should believe in the one who would come after him , that is , on Jesus . "
44019005	When they heard this , they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus .
44019006	When Paul had laid his hands on them , the Holy Spirit came on them , and they spoke with other languages , and prophesied .
44019007	They were about twelve men in all .
44019008	He entered into the synagogue , and spoke boldly for a period of three months , reasoning and persuading about the things concerning the kingdom of God .
44019009	But when some were hardened and disobedient , speaking evil of the Way before the multitude , he departed from them , and separated the disciples , reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus .
44019010	This continued for the space of two years , so that all those who lived in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus , both Jews and Greeks .
44019011	God worked special miracles by the hands of Paul ,
44019012	insomuch that handkerchiefs or aprons were carried away from his body to the sick , and the evil spirits went out .
44019013	But some of the itinerant Jews , exorcists , took on themselves to name over those who had the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus , saying , " We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches . "
44019014	There were seven sons of one Sceva , a Jewish chief priest , who did this .
44019015	The evil spirit answered , " Jesus I know , and Paul I know , but who are you ? "
44019016	The man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them , and overpowered them , and prevailed against them , so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded .
44019017	This became known to all , both Jews and Greeks , who lived at Ephesus . Fear fell on them all , and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified .
44019018	Many also of those who had believed came , confessing , and declaring their deeds .
44019019	Not a few of those who practiced magical arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all . They counted the price of them , and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver .
44019020	So the word of the Lord was growing and becoming mighty .
44019021	Now after these things had ended , Paul determined in the spirit , when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia , to go to Jerusalem , saying , " After I have been there , I must also see Rome . "
44019022	Having sent into Macedonia two of those who ministered to him , Timothy and Erastus , he himself stayed in Asia for a while .
44019023	About that time there arose no small stir concerning the Way .
44019024	For a certain man named Demetrius , a silversmith , who made silver shrines of Artemis , brought no little business to the craftsmen ,
44019025	whom he gathered together , with the workmen of like occupation , and said , " Sirs , you know that by this business we have our wealth .
44019026	You see and hear , that not at Ephesus alone , but almost throughout all Asia , this Paul has persuaded and turned away many people , saying that they are no gods , that are made with hands .
44019027	Not only is there danger that this our trade come into disrepute , but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be counted as nothing , and her majesty destroyed , whom all Asia and the world worships . "
44019028	When they heard this they were filled with wrath , and cried out , saying , " Great is Artemis of the Ephesians ! "
44019029	The whole city was filled with confusion , and they rushed with one accord into the theater , having seized Gaius and Aristarchus , men of Macedonia , Paul's companions in travel .
44019030	When Paul wanted to enter in to the people , the disciples didn't allow him .
44019031	Certain also of the Asiarchs , being his friends , sent to him and begged him not to venture into the theater .
44019032	Some therefore cried one thing , and some another , for the assembly was in confusion . Most of them didn't know why they had come together .
44019033	They brought Alexander out of the multitude , the Jews putting him forward . Alexander beckoned with his hand , and would have made a defense to the people .
44019034	But when they perceived that he was a Jew , all with one voice for a time of about two hours cried out , " Great is Artemis of the Ephesians ! "
44019035	When the town clerk had quieted the multitude , he said , " You men of Ephesus , what man is there who doesn't know that the city of the Ephesians is temple-keeper of the great goddess Artemis , and of the image which fell down from Zeus ?
44019036	Seeing then that these things can't be denied , you ought to be quiet , and to do nothing rash .
44019037	For you have brought these men here , who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of your goddess .
44019038	If therefore Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him , have a matter against anyone , the courts are open , and there are proconsuls . Let them press charges against one another .
44019039	But if you seek anything about other matters , it will be settled in the regular assembly .
44019040	For indeed we are in danger of being accused concerning this day's riot , there being no cause . Concerning it , we wouldn't be able to give an account of this commotion . "
44019041	When he had thus spoken , he dismissed the assembly .
44020001	After the uproar had ceased , Paul sent for the disciples , took leave of them , and departed to go into Macedonia .
44020002	When he had gone through those parts , and had encouraged them with many words , he came into Greece .
44020003	When he had spent three months there , and a plot was made against him by Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria , he determined to return through Macedonia .
44020004	These accompanied him as far as Asia : Sopater of Beroea ; Aristarchus and Secundus of the Thessalonians ; Gaius of Derbe ; Timothy ; and Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia .
44020005	But these had gone ahead , and were waiting for us at Troas .
44020006	We sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread , and came to them at Troas in five days , where we stayed seven days .
44020007	On the first day of the week , when the disciples were gathered together to break bread , Paul talked with them , intending to depart on the next day , and continued his speech until midnight .
44020008	There were many lights in the upper chamber where we were gathered together .
44020009	A certain young man named Eutychus sat in the window , weighed down with deep sleep . As Paul spoke still longer , being weighed down by his sleep , he fell down from the third story , and was taken up dead .
44020010	Paul went down , and fell on him , and embracing him said , " Don't be troubled , for his life is in him . "
44020011	When he had gone up , and had broken bread , and eaten , and had talked with them a long while , even until break of day , he departed .
44020012	They brought the boy alive , and were not a little comforted .
44020013	But we who went ahead to the ship set sail for Assos , there intending to take in Paul , for he had so arranged , intending himself to go by land .
44020014	When he met us at Assos , we took him in , and came to Mitylene .
44020015	Sailing from there , we came the following day opposite Chios . The next day we touched at Samos and stayed at Trogyllium , and the day after we came to Miletus .
44020016	For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus , that he might not have to spend time in Asia ; for he was hastening , if it were possible for him , to be at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost .
44020017	From Miletus he sent to Ephesus , and called to himself the elders of the assembly .
44020018	When they had come to him , he said to them , " You yourselves know , from the first day that I set foot in Asia , how I was with you all the time ,
44020019	serving the Lord with all humility , with many tears , and with trials which happened to me by the plots of the Jews ;
44020020	how I didn't shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable , teaching you publicly and from house to house ,
44020021	testifying both to Jews and to Greeks repentance toward God , and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ .
44020022	Now , behold , I go bound by the Spirit to Jerusalem , not knowing what will happen to me there ;
44020023	except that the Holy Spirit testifies in every city , saying that bonds and afflictions wait for me .
44020024	But these things don't count ; nor do I hold my life dear to myself , so that I may finish my race with joy , and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus , to fully testify to the gospel of the grace of God .
44020025	Now , behold , I know that you all , among whom I went about preaching the kingdom of God , will see my face no more .
44020026	Therefore I testify to you this day that I am clean from the blood of all men ,
44020027	for I didn't shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God .
44020028	Take heed , therefore , to yourselves , and to all the flock , in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers , to shepherd the assembly of the Lord and God which he purchased with his own blood .
44020029	For I know that after my departure , vicious wolves will enter in among you , not sparing the flock .
44020030	Men will arise from among your own selves , speaking perverse things , to draw away the disciples after them .
44020031	Therefore watch , remembering that for a period of three years I didn't cease to admonish everyone night and day with tears .
44020032	Now , brothers , I entrust you to God , and to the word of his grace , which is able to build up , and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified .
44020033	I coveted no one's silver , or gold , or clothing .
44020034	You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my necessities , and to those who were with me .
44020035	In all things I gave you an example , that so laboring you ought to help the weak , and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus , that he himself said , ' It is more blessed to give than to receive . ' "
44020036	When he had spoken these things , he kneeled down and prayed with them all .
44020037	They all wept a lot , and fell on Paul's neck and kissed him ,
44020038	sorrowing most of all because of the word which he had spoken , that they should see his face no more . They brought him on his way to the ship .
44021001	When it happened that we had parted from them and had set sail , we came with a straight course to Cos , and the next day to Rhodes , and from there to Patara .
44021002	Having found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia , we went aboard , and set sail .
44021003	When we had come in sight of Cyprus , leaving it on the left hand , we sailed to Syria , and landed at Tyre , for there the ship was to unload her cargo .
44021004	Having found disciples , we stayed there seven days . These said to Paul through the Spirit , that he should not go up to Jerusalem .
44021005	When it happened that we had accomplished the days , we departed and went on our journey . They all , with wives and children , brought us on our way until we were out of the city . Kneeling down on the beach , we prayed .
44021006	After saying goodbye to each other , we went on board the ship , and they returned home again .
44021007	When we had finished the voyage from Tyre , we arrived at Ptolemais . We greeted the brothers , and stayed with them one day .
44021008	On the next day , we , who were Paul's companions , departed , and came to Caesarea . We entered into the house of Philip the evangelist , who was one of the seven , and stayed with him .
44021009	Now this man had four virgin daughters , who prophesied .
44021010	As we stayed there some days , a certain prophet , named Agabus , came down from Judea .
44021011	Coming to us , and taking Paul's belt , he bound his own feet and hands , and said , " Thus says the Holy Spirit : ' So will the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man who owns this belt , and will deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles . ' "
44021012	When we heard these things , both we and they of that place begged him not to go up to Jerusalem .
44021013	Then Paul answered , " What are you doing , weeping and breaking my heart ? For I am ready not only to be bound , but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus . "
44021014	When he would not be persuaded , we ceased , saying , " The Lord's will be done . "
44021015	After these days we took up our baggage and went up to Jerusalem .
44021016	Some of the disciples from Caesarea also went with us , bringing one Mnason of Cyprus , an early disciple , with whom we would stay .
44021017	When we had come to Jerusalem , the brothers received us gladly .
44021018	The day following , Paul went in with us to James ; and all the elders were present .
44021019	When he had greeted them , he reported one by one the things which God had worked among the Gentiles through his ministry .
44021020	They , when they heard it , glorified God . They said to him , " You see , brother , how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed , and they are all zealous for the law .
44021021	They have been informed about you , that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses , telling them not to circumcise their children neither to walk after the customs .
44021022	What then ? The assembly must certainly meet , for they will hear that you have come .
44021023	Therefore do what we tell you . We have four men who have a vow on them .
44021024	Take them , and purify yourself with them , and pay their expenses for them , that they may shave their heads . Then all will know that there is no truth in the things that they have been informed about you , but that you yourself also walk keeping the law .
44021025	But concerning the Gentiles who believe , we have written our decision that they should observe no such thing , except that they should keep themselves from food offered to idols , from blood , from strangled things , and from sexual immorality . "
44021026	Then Paul took the men , and the next day , purified himself and went with them into the temple , declaring the fulfillment of the days of purification , until the offering was offered for every one of them .
44021027	When the seven days were almost completed , the Jews from Asia , when they saw him in the temple , stirred up all the multitude and laid hands on him ,
44021028	crying out , " Men of Israel , help ! This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against the people , and the law , and this place . Moreover , he also brought Greeks into the temple , and has defiled this holy place ! "
44021029	For they had seen Trophimus , the Ephesian , with him in the city , and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple .
44021030	All the city was moved , and the people ran together . They seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple . Immediately the doors were shut .
44021031	As they were trying to kill him , news came up to the commanding officer of the regiment that all Jerusalem was in an uproar .
44021032	Immediately he took soldiers and centurions , and ran down to them . They , when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers , stopped beating Paul .
44021033	Then the commanding officer came near , arrested him , commanded him to be bound with two chains , and inquired who he was and what he had done .
44021034	Some shouted one thing , some another , among the crowd . When he couldn't find out the truth because of the noise , he commanded him to be brought into the barracks .
44021035	When he came to the stairs , it happened that he was carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd ;
44021036	for the multitude of the people followed after , crying out , " Away with him ! "
44021037	As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks , he asked the commanding officer , " May I say something to you ? " He said , " Do you know Greek ?
44021038	Aren't you then the Egyptian , who before these days stirred up to sedition and led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the Assassins ? "
44021039	But Paul said , " I am a Jew , from Tarsus in Cilicia , a citizen of no insignificant city . I beg you , allow me to speak to the people . "
44021040	When he had given him permission , Paul , standing on the stairs , beckoned with his hand to the people . When there was a great silence , he spoke to them in the Hebrew language , saying ,
44022001	" Brothers and fathers , listen to the defense which I now make to you . "
44022002	When they heard that he spoke to them in the Hebrew language , they were even more quiet . He said ,
44022003	" I am indeed a Jew , born in Tarsus of Cilicia , but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel , instructed according to the strict manner of the law of our fathers , being zealous for God , even as you all are this day .
44022004	I persecuted this Way to the death , binding and delivering into prisons both men and women .
44022005	As also the high priest and all the council of the elders testify , from whom also I received letters to the brothers , and journeyed to Damascus to bring them also who were there to Jerusalem in bonds to be punished .
44022006	It happened that , as I made my journey , and came close to Damascus , about noon , suddenly there shone from the sky a great light around me .
44022007	I fell to the ground , and heard a voice saying to me , ' Saul , Saul , why do you persecute me ? '
44022008	I answered , ' Who are you , Lord ? ' He said to me , ' I am Jesus of Nazareth , whom you persecute . '
44022009	Those who were with me indeed saw the light and were afraid , but they didn't understand the voice of him who spoke to me .
44022010	I said , ' What will I do , Lord ? ' The Lord said to me , ' Arise , and go into Damascus . There you will be told about all things which are appointed for you to do . '
44022011	When I couldn't see for the glory of that light , being led by the hand of those who were with me , I came into Damascus .
44022012	One Ananias , a devout man according to the law , well reported of by all the Jews who lived there ,
44022013	came to me , and standing by me said to me , ' Brother Saul , receive your sight ! ' In that very hour I looked up at him .
44022014	He said , ' The God of our fathers has appointed you to know his will , and to see the Righteous One , and to hear a voice from his mouth .
44022015	For you will be a witness for him to all men of what you have seen and heard .
44022016	Now why do you wait ? Arise , be baptized , and wash away your sins , calling on the name of the Lord . '
44022017	It happened that , when I had returned to Jerusalem , and while I prayed in the temple , I fell into a trance ,
44022018	and saw him saying to me , ' Hurry and get out of Jerusalem quickly , because they will not receive testimony concerning me from you . '
44022019	I said , ' Lord , they themselves know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue those who believed in you .
44022020	When the blood of Stephen , your witness , was shed , I also was standing by , and consenting to his death , and guarding the cloaks of those who killed him . '
44022021	He said to me , ' Depart , for I will send you forth far from here to the Gentiles . ' "
44022022	They listened to him until he said that , then they lifted up their voice , and said , " Rid the earth of this fellow , for he isn't fit to live ! "
44022023	As they cried out , and threw off their cloaks , and threw dust into the air ,
44022024	the commanding officer commanded him to be brought into the barracks , ordering him to be examined by scourging , that he might know for what crime they shouted against him like that .
44022025	When they had tied him up with thongs , Paul asked the centurion who stood by , " Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman , and not found guilty ? "
44022026	When the centurion heard it , he went to the commanding officer and told him , " Watch what you are about to do , for this man is a Roman ! "
44022027	The commanding officer came and asked him , " Tell me , are you a Roman ? " He said , " Yes . "
44022028	The commanding officer answered , " I bought my citizenship for a great price . " Paul said , " But I was born a Roman . "
44022029	Immediately those who were about to examine him departed from him , and the commanding officer also was afraid when he realized that he was a Roman , because he had bound him .
44022030	But on the next day , desiring to know the truth about why he was accused by the Jews , he freed him from the bonds , and commanded the chief priests and all the council to come together , and brought Paul down and set him before them .
44023001	Paul , looking steadfastly at the council , said , " Brothers , I have lived before God in all good conscience until this day . "
44023002	The high priest , Ananias , commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth .
44023003	Then said Paul to him , " God will strike you , you whitewashed wall ! Do you sit to judge me according to the law , and command me to be struck contrary to the law ? "
44023004	Those who stood by said , " Do you malign God's high priest ? "
44023005	Paul said , " I didn't know , brothers , that he was high priest . For it is written , ' You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people . ' "
44023006	But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees , he cried out in the council , " Men and brothers , I am a Pharisee , a son of Pharisees . Concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead I am being judged ! "
44023007	When he had said this , there arose an argument between the Pharisees and Sadducees , and the assembly was divided .
44023008	For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection , neither angel , nor spirit ; but the Pharisees confess all of these .
44023009	A great clamor arose , and some of the scribes of the Pharisees part stood up , and contended , saying , " We find no evil in this man . But if a spirit or angel has spoken to him , let's not fight against God ! "
44023010	When a great argument arose , the commanding officer , fearing that Paul would be torn in pieces by them , commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them , and bring him into the barracks .
44023011	The following night , the Lord stood by him , and said , " Cheer up , Paul , for as you have testified about me at Jerusalem , so you must testify also at Rome . "
44023012	When it was day , some of the Jews banded together , and bound themselves under a curse , saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul .
44023013	There were more than forty people who had made this conspiracy .
44023014	They came to the chief priests and the elders , and said , " We have bound ourselves under a great curse , to taste nothing until we have killed Paul .
44023015	Now therefore , you with the council inform the commanding officer that he should bring him down to you tomorrow , as though you were going to judge his case more exactly . We are ready to kill him before he comes near . "
44023016	But Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait , and he came and entered into the barracks and told Paul .
44023017	Paul summoned one of the centurions , and said , " Bring this young man to the commanding officer , for he has something to tell him . "
44023018	So he took him , and brought him to the commanding officer , and said , " Paul , the prisoner , called me to himself , and asked me to bring this young man to you , who has something to tell you . "
44023019	The commanding officer took him by the hand , and going aside , asked him privately , " What is it that you have to tell me ? "
44023020	He said , " The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring down Paul tomorrow to the council , as though intending to inquire somewhat more accurately concerning him .
44023021	Therefore don't yield to them , for more than forty men lie in wait for him , who have bound themselves under a curse neither to eat nor to drink until they have killed him . Now they are ready , looking for the promise from you . "
44023022	So the commanding officer let the young man go , charging him , " Tell no one that you have told these things to me . "
44023023	He called to himself two of the centurions , and said , " Prepare two hundred soldiers to go as far as Caesarea , with seventy horsemen , and two hundred men armed with spears , at the third hour of the night . "
44023024	He asked them to provide animals , that they might set Paul on one , and bring him safely to Felix , the governor .
44023025	He wrote a letter like this :
44023026	" Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor Felix : Greetings .
44023027	" This man was seized by the Jews , and was about to be killed by them , when I came on them with the soldiers and rescued him , having learned that he was a Roman .
44023028	Desiring to know the cause why they accused him , I brought him down to their council .
44023029	I found him to be accused about questions of their law , but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds .
44023030	When I was told that the Jews lay in wait for the man , I sent him to you immediately , charging his accusers also to bring their accusations against him before you . Farewell . "
44023031	So the soldiers , carrying out their orders , took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris .
44023032	But on the next day they left the horsemen to go with him , and returned to the barracks .
44023033	They , when they came to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor , presented Paul also before him .
44023034	When the governor had read it , he asked what province he was from . When he understood that he was from Cilicia , he said ,
44023035	" I will hear you fully when your accusers also arrive . " He commanded that he be kept in Herod's palace .
44024001	After five days , the high priest , Ananias , came down with certain elders and an orator , one Tertullus . They informed the governor against Paul .
44024002	When he was called , Tertullus began to accuse him , saying , " Seeing that by you we enjoy much peace , and that excellent measures are coming to this nation ,
44024003	we accept it in all ways and in all places , most excellent Felix , with all thankfulness .
44024004	But , that I don't delay you , I entreat you to bear with us and hear a few words .
44024005	For we have found this man a pestilent fellow , and an instigator of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world , and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes .
44024006	He even tried to profane the temple . We arrested him .
44024007	empty verses content detected by amos
44024008	By examining him yourself you may ascertain all these things of which we accuse him . "
44024009	The Jews also joined in the attack , affirming that these things were so .
44024010	When the governor had beckoned to him to speak , Paul answered , " Because I know that you have been a judge of this nation for many years , I cheerfully make my defense ,
44024011	seeing that you can recognize that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem .
44024012	In the temple they didn't find me disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd , either in the synagogues , or in the city .
44024013	Nor can they prove to you the things whereof they now accuse me .
44024014	But this I confess to you , that after the Way , which they call a sect , so I serve the God of our fathers , believing all things which are according to the law , and which are written in the prophets ;
44024015	having hope toward God , which these also themselves look for , that there will be a resurrection of the dead , both of the just and unjust .
44024016	Herein I also practice always having a conscience void of offense toward God and men .
44024017	Now after some years , I came to bring alms to my nation , and offerings ;
44024018	amid which they found me purified in the temple , with no crowd , nor yet with tumult . But certain Jews from Asia - -
44024019	who ought to have been here before you , and to make accusation , if they had anything against me .
44024020	Or else let these men themselves say what injustice they found in me when I stood before the council ,
44024021	unless it is for this one thing that I cried standing among them , ' Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am being judged before you today ! ' "
44024022	But Felix , having more exact knowledge concerning the Way , deferred them , saying , " When Lysias , the commanding officer , comes down , I will decide your case . "
44024023	He ordered the centurion that Paul should be kept in custody , and should have some privileges , and not to forbid any of his friends to serve him or to visit him .
44024024	But after some days , Felix came with Drusilla , his wife , who was a Jewess , and sent for Paul , and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus .
44024025	As he reasoned about righteousness , self-control , and the judgment to come , Felix was terrified , and answered , " Go your way for this time , and when it is convenient for me , I will call you to me . "
44024026	He hoped that way that money would be given to him by Paul , that he might release him . Therefore also he sent for him more often , and talked with him .
44024027	But when two years were fulfilled , Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus , and desiring to gain favor with the Jews , Felix left Paul in bonds .
44025001	Festus therefore , having come into the province , after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea .
44025002	Then the high priest and the principal men of the Jews informed him against Paul , and they begged him ,
44025003	asking a favor against him , that he would send for him to Jerusalem ; plotting to kill him on the way .
44025004	However Festus answered that Paul was kept in custody at Caesarea , and that he himself was about to depart shortly .
44025005	" Let them therefore , " said he , " that are in power among you go down with me , and if there is anything wrong in the man , let them accuse him . "
44025006	When he had stayed among them more than ten days , he went down to Caesarea , and on the next day he sat on the judgment seat , and commanded Paul to be brought .
44025007	When he had come , the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him , bringing against him many and grievous charges which they could not prove ,
44025008	while he said in his defense , " Neither against the law of the Jews , nor against the temple , nor against Caesar , have I sinned at all . "
44025009	But Festus , desiring to gain favor with the Jews , answered Paul and said , " Will you go up to Jerusalem , and there be judged of these things before me ? "
44025010	But Paul said , " I am standing before Caesar's judgment seat , where I ought to be tried . I have done no wrong to the Jews , as you also know very well .
44025011	For if I have done wrong , and have committed anything worthy of death , I don't refuse to die ; but if none of those things is true that these accuse me of , no one can give me up to them . I appeal to Caesar ! "
44025012	Then Festus , when he had conferred with the council , answered , " You have appealed to Caesar . To Caesar you will go . "
44025013	Now when some days had passed , Agrippa , the King , and Bernice arrived at Caesarea , and greeted Festus .
44025014	As they stayed there many days , Festus laid Paul's case before the King , saying , " There is a certain man left a prisoner by Felix ;
44025015	about whom , when I was at Jerusalem , the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me , asking for a sentence against him .
44025016	To whom I answered that it is not the custom of the Romans to give up any man to destruction , before the accused have met the accusers face to face , and have had opportunity to make his defense concerning the matter laid against him .
44025017	When therefore they were come together here , I didn't delay , but on the next day sat on the judgment seat , and commanded the man to be brought .
44025018	Concerning whom , when the accusers stood up , they brought no charge of such things as I supposed ;
44025019	but had certain questions against him of their own religion , and of one Jesus , who was dead , whom Paul affirmed to be alive .
44025020	I , being perplexed how to inquire concerning these things , asked whether he would go to Jerusalem and there be judged of these matters .
44025021	But when Paul had appealed to be kept for the decision of the emperor , I commanded him to be kept until I should send him to Caesar . "
44025022	Agrippa said to Festus , " I also would like to hear the man myself . " " Tomorrow , " he said , " you will hear him . "
44025023	So on the next day , when Agrippa and Bernice had come with great pomp , and they had entered into the place of hearing with the commanding officers and principal men of the city , at the command of Festus , Paul was brought in .
44025024	Festus said , " King Agrippa , and all men who are here present with us , you see this man , about whom all the multitude of the Jews petitioned me , both at Jerusalem and here , crying that he ought not to live any longer .
44025025	But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death , and as he himself appealed to the emperor I determined to send him .
44025026	Of whom I have no certain thing to write to my lord . Therefore I have brought him forth before you , and especially before you , king Agrippa , that , after examination , I may have something to write .
44025027	For it seems to me unreasonable , in sending a prisoner , not to also specify the charges against him . "
44026001	Agrippa said to Paul , " You may speak for yourself . " Then Paul stretched out his hand , and made his defense .
44026002	" I think myself happy , King Agrippa , that I am to make my defense before you this day concerning all the things whereof I am accused by the Jews ,
44026003	especially because you are expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews . Therefore I beg you to hear me patiently .
44026004	" Indeed , all the Jews know my way of life from my youth up , which was from the beginning among my own nation and at Jerusalem ;
44026005	having known me from the first , if they are willing to testify , that after the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee .
44026006	Now I stand here to be judged for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers ,
44026007	which our twelve tribes , earnestly serving night and day , hope to attain . Concerning this hope I am accused by the Jews , King Agrippa !
44026008	Why is it judged incredible with you , if God does raise the dead ?
44026009	" I most assuredly thought with myself that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth .
44026010	This I also did in Jerusalem . I both shut up many of the saints in prisons , having received authority from the chief priests , and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them .
44026011	Punishing them often in all the synagogues , I tried to make them blaspheme . Being exceedingly enraged against them , I persecuted them even to foreign cities .
44026012	" Whereupon as I journeyed to Damascus with the authority and commission from the chief priests ,
44026013	at noon , O King , I saw on the way a light from the sky , brighter than the sun , shining around me and those who traveled with me .
44026014	When we had all fallen to the earth , I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language , ' Saul , Saul , why do you persecute me ? It is hard for you to kick against the goad . '
44026015	I said , ' Who are you , Lord ? ' He said , ' I am Jesus , whom you persecute .
44026016	But arise , and stand on your feet , for to this end have I appeared to you , to appoint you a servant and a witness both of the things which you have seen , and of the things which I will reveal to you ;
44026017	delivering you from the people , and from the Gentiles , to whom I send you ,
44026018	to open their eyes , that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God , that they may receive remission of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in me . '
44026019	" Therefore , King Agrippa , I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision ,
44026020	but declared first to them of Damascus , at Jerusalem , and throughout all the country of Judea , and also to the Gentiles , that they should repent and turn to God , doing works worthy of repentance .
44026021	For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple , and tried to kill me .
44026022	Having therefore obtained the help that is from God , I stand to this day testifying both to small and great , saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses did say should come ,
44026023	how the Christ must suffer , and how he first by the resurrection of the dead should proclaim light both to these people and to the Gentiles . "
44026024	As he thus made his defense , Festus said with a loud voice , " Paul , you are crazy ! Your great learning is driving you insane ! "
44026025	But he said , " I am not crazy , most excellent Festus , but speak forth words of truth and soberness .
44026026	For the king knows of these things , to whom also I speak freely . For I am persuaded that none of these things is hidden from him , for this has not been done in a corner .
44026027	King Agrippa , do you believe the prophets ? I know that you believe . "
44026028	Agrippa said to Paul , " With a little persuasion are you trying to make me a Christian ? "
44026029	Paul said , " I pray to God , that whether with little or with much , not only you , but also all that hear me this day , might become such as I am , except for these bonds . "
44026030	The king rose up , and the governor , and Bernice , and those who sat with them .
44026031	When they had withdrawn , they spoke one to another , saying , " This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds . "
44026032	Agrippa said to Festus , " This man might have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar . "
44027001	When it was determined that we should sail for Italy , they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion named Julius , of the Augustan band .
44027002	Embarking in a ship of Adramyttium , which was about to sail to places on the coast of Asia , we put to sea , Aristarchus , a Macedonian of Thessalonica , being with us .
44027003	The next day , we touched at Sidon . Julius treated Paul kindly , and gave him permission to go to his friends and refresh himself .
44027004	Putting to sea from there , we sailed under the lee of Cyprus , because the winds were contrary .
44027005	When we had sailed across the sea which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia , we came to Myra , a city of Lycia .
44027006	There the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy , and he put us on board .
44027007	When we had sailed slowly many days , and had come with difficulty opposite Cnidus , the wind not allowing us further , we sailed under the lee of Crete , opposite Salmone .
44027008	With difficulty sailing along it we came to a certain place called Fair Havens , near the city of Lasea .
44027009	When much time was spent , and the voyage was now dangerous , because the Fast had now already gone by , Paul admonished them ,
44027010	and said to them , " Sirs , I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss , not only of the cargo and the ship , but also of our lives . "
44027011	But the centurion gave more heed to the master and to the owner of the ship than to those things which were spoken by Paul .
44027012	Because the haven was not suitable to winter in , the majority advised to put to sea from there , if by any means they could reach Phoenix , and winter there , which is a port of Crete , looking northeast and southeast .
44027013	When the south wind blew softly , supposing that they had obtained their purpose , they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete , close to shore .
44027014	But after no long time there beat down from it a tempestuous wind , which is called Euroclydon .
44027015	When the ship was caught , and couldn't face the wind , we gave way to it , and were driven along .
44027016	Running under the lee of a small island called Clauda , we were able , with difficulty , to secure the boat .
44027017	When they had hoisted it up , they used cables to help reinforce the ship . Fearing that they would run aground on the Syrtis sand bars , they lowered the sea anchor , and so were driven .
44027018	As we labored exceedingly with the storm , the next day they began to throw things overboard .
44027019	On the third day , they threw out the ship's tackle with their own hands .
44027020	When neither sun nor stars shone on us for many days , and no small tempest pressed on us , all hope that we should be saved was now taken away .
44027021	When they had been long without food , Paul stood up in the midst of them , and said , " Sirs , you should have listened to me , and not have set sail from Crete , and have gotten this injury and loss .
44027022	Now I exhort you to cheer up , for there will be no loss of life among you , but only of the ship .
44027023	For there stood by me this night an angel , belonging to the God whose I am and whom I serve ,
44027024	saying , ' Don't be afraid , Paul . You must stand before Caesar . Behold , God has granted you all those who sail with you . '
44027025	Therefore , sirs , cheer up ! For I believe God , that it will be just as it has been spoken to me .
44027026	But we must run aground on a certain island . "
44027027	But when the fourteenth night was come , as we were driven back and forth in the Adriatic Sea , about midnight the sailors surmised that they were drawing near to some land .
44027028	They took soundings , and found twenty fathoms . After a little while , they took soundings again , and found fifteen fathoms .
44027029	Fearing that we would run aground on rocky ground , they let go four anchors from the stern , and wished for daylight .
44027030	As the sailors were trying to flee out of the ship , and had lowered the boat into the sea , pretending that they would lay out anchors from the bow ,
44027031	Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers , " Unless these stay in the ship , you can't be saved . "
44027032	Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat , and let her fall off .
44027033	While the day was coming on , Paul begged them all to take some food , saying , " This day is the fourteenth day that you wait and continue fasting , having taken nothing .
44027034	Therefore I beg you to take some food , for this is for your safety ; for there will not a hair perish from the head of any of you . "
44027035	When he had said this , and had taken bread , he gave thanks to God in the presence of all , and he broke it , and began to eat .
44027036	Then were they all of good cheer , and they also took food .
44027037	We were in all in the ship two hundred seventy-six souls .
44027038	When they had eaten enough , they lightened the ship , throwing out the wheat into the sea .
44027039	When it was day , they didn't recognize the land , but they noticed a certain bay with a beach , and they decided to try to drive the ship onto it .
44027040	Casting off the anchors , they left them in the sea , at the same time untying the rudder ropes . Hoisting up the foresail to the wind , they made for the beach .
44027041	But coming to a place where two seas met , they ran the vessel aground . The bow struck and remained immovable , but the stern began to break up by the violence of the waves .
44027042	The soldiers ' counsel was to kill the prisoners , so that none of them would swim out and escape .
44027043	But the centurion , desiring to save Paul , stopped them from their purpose , and commanded that those who could swim should throw themselves overboard first to go to the land ;
44027044	and the rest , some on planks , and some on other things from the ship . So it happened that they all escaped safely to the land .
44028001	When we had escaped , then we knew that the island was called Malta .
44028002	The natives showed us no common kindness ; for they kindled a fire , and received us all , because of the present rain , and because of the cold .
44028003	But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire , a viper came out because of the heat , and fastened on his hand .
44028004	When the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand , they said one to another , " No doubt this man is a murderer , whom , though he has escaped from the sea , yet Justice has not allowed to live . "
44028005	However he shook off the creature into the fire , and wasn't harmed .
44028006	But they expected that he would have swollen , or fallen down dead suddenly , but when they were long in expectation and saw nothing bad happen to him , they changed their minds , and said that he was a god .
44028007	Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island , named Publius , who received us , and courteously entertained us three days .
44028008	It was so , that the father of Publius lay sick of fever and dysentery . Paul entered in to him , prayed , and laying his hands on him , healed him .
44028009	Then when this was done , the rest also that had diseases in the island came , and were cured .
44028010	They also honored us with many honors , and when we sailed , they put on board the things that we needed .
44028011	After three months , we set sail in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island , whose sign was " The Twin Brothers . "
44028012	Touching at Syracuse , we stayed there three days .
44028013	From there we circled around and arrived at Rhegium . After one day , a south wind sprang up , and on the second day we came to Puteoli ,
44028014	where we found brothers , and were entreated to stay with them seven days . So we came to Rome .
44028015	From there the brothers , when they heard of us , came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three Taverns ; whom when Paul saw , he thanked God , and took courage .
44028016	When we entered into Rome , the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard , but Paul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier who guarded him .
44028017	It happened , that after three days Paul called together those who were the leaders of the Jews . When they had come together , he said to them , " I , brothers , though I had done nothing against the people , or the customs of our fathers , still was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans ,
44028018	who , when they had examined me , desired to set me free , because there was no cause of death in me .
44028019	But when the Jews spoke against it , I was constrained to appeal to Caesar , not that I had anything about which to accuse my nation .
44028020	For this cause therefore did I ask you to see and to speak with me . For because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain . "
44028021	They said to him , " We neither received letters from Judea concerning you , nor did any of the brothers come here and report or speak any evil of you .
44028022	But we desire to hear of you what you think . For , as concerning this sect , it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against . "
44028023	When they had appointed him a day , they came to him into his lodging in great number . He explained to them , testifying about the kingdom of God , and persuading them concerning Jesus , both from the law of Moses and from the prophets , from morning until evening .
44028024	Some believed the things which were spoken , and some disbelieved .
44028025	When they didn't agree among themselves , they departed after Paul had spoken one word , " The Holy Spirit spoke well through Isaiah , the prophet , to our fathers ,
44028026	saying , ' Go to this people , and say , In hearing , you will hear , and will in no way understand . In seeing , you will see , and will in no way perceive .
44028027	For this people's heart has grown callous . Their ears are dull of hearing . Their eyes they have closed . Lest they should see with their eyes , Hear with their ears , Understand with their heart , Would turn again , And I would heal them . '
44028028	" Be it known therefore to you , that the salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles . They will also hear . "
44028029	When he had said these words , the Jews departed , having a great dispute among themselves .
44028030	Paul stayed two whole years in his own rented house , and received all who went in to him ,
44028031	preaching the kingdom of God , and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness , without hinderance .
45001001	Paul , a servant of Jesus Christ , called to be an apostle , set apart for the gospel of God ,
45001002	which he promised before through his prophets in the holy scriptures ,
45001003	concerning his Son , who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh ,
45001004	who was declared to be the Son of God with power , according to the spirit of holiness , by the resurrection from the dead , Jesus Christ our Lord ,
45001005	through whom we received grace and apostleship , to obedience of faith among all the nations , for his name's sake .
45001006	Among whom you are also called to be Jesus Christ's .
45001007	To all who are in Rome , beloved of God , called to be saints : Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
45001008	First , I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you , that your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world .
45001009	For God is my witness , whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of his Son , how unceasingly I make mention of you always in my prayers ,
45001010	requesting , if by any means now at length I may be prospered by the will of God to come to you .
45001011	For I long to see you , that I may impart to you some spiritual gift , to the end you may be established ;
45001012	that is , that I with you may be comforted in you , each of us by the other's faith , both yours and mine .
45001013	Now I don't desire to have you unaware , brothers , that often I planned to come to you , and was hindered so far , that I might have some fruit in you also , even as in the rest of the Gentiles .
45001014	I am debtor both to Greeks and to foreigners , both to the wise and to the foolish .
45001015	So , as much as in me is , I am ready to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome .
45001016	For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ , for it is the power of God to salvation to everyone who believes ; to the Jew first , and also to the Greek .
45001017	For therein is revealed a righteousness of God from faith to faith . As it is written , " But the righteous shall live by faith . "
45001018	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men , who hinder the truth in unrighteousness ,
45001019	because that which is known by God is revealed in them , for God revealed it to them .
45001020	For the invisible things of him since the creation of the world are clearly seen , being perceived through the things that are made , even his everlasting power and divinity ; that they may be without excuse .
45001021	Because , knowing God , they didn't glorify him as God , neither gave thanks , but became vain in their reasoning , and their senseless heart was darkened .
45001022	Professing themselves to be wise , they became fools ,
45001023	and traded the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of an image of corruptible man , and of birds , and four-footed animals , and creeping things .
45001024	Therefore God also gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to uncleanness , that their bodies should be dishonored among themselves ,
45001025	who exchanged the truth of God for a lie , and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator , who is blessed forever . Amen .
45001026	For this reason , God gave them up to vile passions . For their women changed the natural function into that which is against nature .
45001027	Likewise also the men , leaving the natural function of the woman , burned in their lust toward one another , men doing what is inappropriate with men , and receiving in themselves the due penalty of their error .
45001028	Even as they refused to have God in their knowledge , God gave them up to a reprobate mind , to do those things which are not fitting ;
45001029	being filled with all unrighteousness , sexual immorality , wickedness , covetousness , maliciousness ; full of envy , murder , strife , deceit , evil habits , secret slanderers ,
45001030	backbiters , hateful to God , insolent , haughty , boastful , inventors of evil things , disobedient to parents ,
45001031	without understanding , covenant-breakers , without natural affection , unforgiving , unmerciful ;
45001032	who , knowing the ordinance of God , that those who practice such things are worthy of death , not only do the same , but also consent with those who practice them .
45002001	Therefore you are without excuse , man , whoever you are who judge . For in that which you judge another , you condemn yourself . For you who judge practice the same things .
45002002	We know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who practice such things .
45002003	Do you know this , O man who judges those who practice such things , and do the same , that you will escape the judgment of God ?
45002004	Or do you despise the riches of his goodness , forbearance , and patience , not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance ?
45002005	But according to your hardness and impenitent heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God ;
45002006	who " will render to every man according to his works : "
45002007	to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and incorruptibility , eternal life ;
45002008	but to those who are self-seeking , and don't obey the truth , but obey unrighteousness , will be wrath and indignation ,
45002009	oppression and anguish , on every soul of man who works evil , on the Jew first , and also on the Greek .
45002010	But glory and honor and peace to every man who works good , to the Jew first , and also to the Greek .
45002011	For there is no partiality with God .
45002012	For as many as have sinned without law will also perish without the law . As many as have sinned under the law will be judged by the law .
45002013	For it isn't the hearers of the law who are righteous before God , but the doers of the law will be justified
45002014	( for when Gentiles who don't have the law do by nature the things of the law , these , not having the law , are a law to themselves ,
45002015	in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts , their conscience testifying with them , and their thoughts among themselves accusing or else excusing them )
45002016	in the day when God will judge the secrets of men , according to my gospel , by Jesus Christ .
45002017	Indeed you bear the name of a Jew , and rest on the law , and glory in God ,
45002018	and know his will , and approve the things that are excellent , being instructed out of the law ,
45002019	and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind , a light to those who are in darkness ,
45002020	a corrector of the foolish , a teacher of babies , having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth .
45002021	You therefore who teach another , don't you teach yourself ? You who preach that a man shouldn't steal , do you steal ?
45002022	You who say a man shouldn't commit adultery , do you commit adultery ? You who abhor idols , do you rob temples ?
45002023	You who glory in the law , through your disobedience of the law do you dishonor God ?
45002024	For " the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you , " just as it is written .
45002025	For circumcision indeed profits , if you be a doer of the law , but if you be a transgressor of the law , your circumcision has become uncircumcision .
45002026	If therefore the uncircumcised keep the ordinances of the law , won't his uncircumcision be accounted as circumcision ?
45002027	Won't the uncircumcision which is by nature , if it fulfills the law , judge you , who with the letter and circumcision are a transgressor of the law ?
45002028	For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly , neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh ;
45002029	but he is a Jew who is one inwardly , and circumcision is that of the heart , in the spirit not in the letter ; whose praise is not from men , but from God .
45003001	Then what advantage does the Jew have ? Or what is the profit of circumcision ?
45003002	Much in every way ! Because first of all , that they were entrusted with the oracles of God .
45003003	For what if some were without faith ? Will their lack of faith make of no effect the faithfulness of God ?
45003004	Certainly not ! Yes , let God be found true , but every man a liar . As it is written , " That you might be justified in your words , And might prevail when you come into judgment . "
45003005	But if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness of God , what will we say ? Is God unrighteous who inflicts wrath ? I speak like men do .
45003006	Certainly not ! For then how will God judge the world ?
45003007	For if the truth of God through my lie abounded to his glory , why am I also still judged as a sinner ?
45003008	Why not ( as we are slanderously reported , and as some affirm that we say ) , " Let us do evil , that good may come ? " Those who say so are justly condemned .
45003009	What then ? Are we better than they ? No , in no way . For we previously charged both Jews and Greeks , that they are all under sin .
45003010	As it is written , " There is no one righteous . No , not one .
45003011	There is no one who understands . There is no one who seeks after God .
45003012	They have all turned aside . They have together become unprofitable . There is no one who does good , no , not , so much as one . "
45003013	" Their throat is an open tomb . With their tongues they have used deceit . " " The poison of vipers is under their lips ; "
45003014	" Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness . "
45003015	" Their feet are swift to shed blood .
45003016	Destruction and misery are in their ways .
45003017	The way of peace , they haven't known . "
45003018	" There is no fear of God before their eyes . "
45003019	Now we know that whatever things the law says , it speaks to those who are under the law , that every mouth may be closed , and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God .
45003020	Because by the works of the law , no flesh will be justified in his sight . For through the law comes the knowledge of sin .
45003021	But now apart from the law , a righteousness of God has been revealed , being testified by the law and the prophets ;
45003022	even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ to all and on all those who believe . For there is no distinction ,
45003023	for all have sinned , and fall short of the glory of God ;
45003024	being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus ;
45003025	whom God set forth to be an atoning sacrifice , through faith , in his blood , to show his righteousness because of the passing over of the sins done before , in the forbearance of God ;
45003026	for the showing of his righteousness at this present time ; that he might himself be just , and the justifier of him who has faith in Jesus .
45003027	Where then is the boasting ? It is excluded . By what manner of law ? Of works ? No , but by a law of faith .
45003028	We maintain therefore that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law .
45003029	Or is God the God of Jews only ? Isn't he the God of Gentiles also ? Yes , of Gentiles also ,
45003030	if it is so that God is one . He will justify the circumcised by faith , and the uncircumcised through faith .
45003031	Do we then make the law of no effect through faith ? Certainly not ! No , we establish the law .
45004001	What then will we say that Abraham , our forefather , has found according to the flesh ?
45004002	For if Abraham was justified by works , he has something to boast about , but not toward God .
45004003	For what does the scripture say ? " Abraham believed God , and it was accounted to him for righteousness . "
45004004	Now to him who works , the reward is not accounted as of grace , but as of debt .
45004005	But to him who doesn't work , but believes in him who justifies the ungodly , his faith is accounted for righteousness .
45004006	Even as David also pronounces blessing on the man to whom God counts righteousness apart from works ,
45004007	" Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven , Whose sins are covered .
45004008	Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not charge with sin . "
45004009	Is this blessing then pronounced on the circumcised , or on the uncircumcised also ? For we say that faith was accounted to Abraham for righteousness .
45004010	How then was it counted ? When he was in circumcision , or in uncircumcision ? Not in circumcision , but in uncircumcision .
45004011	He received the sign of circumcision , a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while he was in uncircumcision , that he might be the father of all those who believe , though they be in uncircumcision , that righteousness might also be accounted to them .
45004012	The father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision , but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father , Abraham , which he had in uncircumcision .
45004013	For not through the law was the promise to Abraham or to his seed that he should be heir of the world , but through the righteousness of faith .
45004014	For if those who are of the law are heirs , faith is made void , and the promise is made of no effect .
45004015	For the law works wrath , for where there is no law , neither is there disobedience .
45004016	For this cause it is of faith , that it may be according to grace , to the end that the promise may be sure to all the seed , not to that only which is of the law , but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham , who is the father of us all .
45004017	As it is written , " I have made you a father of many nations . " This is before him whom he believed , God , who gives life to the dead , and calls the things that are not , as though they were .
45004018	Who in hope believed against hope , to the end that he might become a father of many nations , according to that which had been spoken , " So will your seed be . "
45004019	Without being weakened in faith , he didn't consider his own body , already having been worn out , ( he being about a hundred years old ) , and the deadness of Sarah's womb .
45004020	Yet , looking to the promise of God , he wavered not through unbelief , but grew strong through faith , giving glory to God ,
45004021	and being fully assured that what he had promised , he was able also to perform .
45004022	Therefore also it was " reckoned to him for righteousness . "
45004023	Now it was not written that it was accounted to him for his sake alone ,
45004024	but for our sake also , to whom it will be accounted , who believe in him who raised Jesus , our Lord , from the dead ,
45004025	who was delivered up for our trespasses , and was raised for our justification .
45005001	Being therefore justified by faith , we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ ;
45005002	through whom we also have our access by faith into this grace in which we stand . We rejoice in hope of the glory of God .
45005003	Not only so , but we also rejoice in our sufferings , knowing that suffering works perseverance ;
45005004	and perseverance , proven character ; and proven character , hope :
45005005	and hope doesn't disappoint us , because God's love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit which was given to us .
45005006	For while we were yet weak , at the right time Christ died for the ungodly .
45005007	For one will hardly die for a righteous man . For perhaps for a righteous person someone would even dare to die .
45005008	But God commends his own love toward us , in that while we were yet sinners , Christ died for us .
45005009	Much more then , being now justified by his blood , we will be saved from God's wrath through him .
45005010	For if , while we were enemies , we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son , much more , being reconciled , we will be saved by his life .
45005011	Not only so , but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ , through whom we have now received the reconciliation .
45005012	Therefore , as sin entered into the world through one man , and death through sin ; and so death passed to all men , because all sinned .
45005013	For until the law , sin was in the world ; but sin is not charged when there is no law .
45005014	Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses , even over those whose sins weren't like Adam's disobedience , who is a foreshadowing of him who was to come .
45005015	But the free gift isn't like the trespass . For if by the trespass of the one the many died , much more did the grace of God , and the gift by the grace of the one man , Jesus Christ , abound to the many .
45005016	The gift is not as through one who sinned : for the judgment came by one to condemnation , but the free gift came of many trespasses to justification .
45005017	For if by the trespass of the one , death reigned through the one ; so much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one , Jesus Christ .
45005018	So then as through one trespass , all men were condemned ; even so through one act of righteousness , all men were justified to life .
45005019	For as through the one man's disobedience many were made sinners , even so through the obedience of the one will many be made righteous .
45005020	The law came in besides , that the trespass might abound ; but where sin abounded , grace did abound more exceedingly ;
45005021	that as sin reigned in death , even so might grace reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord .
45006001	What will we say then ? Will we continue in sin , that grace may abound ?
45006002	Certainly not ! We who died to sin , how could we live in it any longer ?
45006003	Or don't you know that all we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death ?
45006004	We were buried therefore with him through baptism to death , that just like Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father , so we also might walk in newness of life .
45006005	For if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death , we will also be part of his resurrection ;
45006006	knowing this , that our old man was crucified with him , that the body of sin might be done away with , so that we would no longer be in bondage to sin .
45006007	For he who has died has been freed from sin .
45006008	But if we died with Christ , we believe that we will also live with him ;
45006009	knowing that Christ , being raised from the dead , dies no more . Death no more has dominion over him !
45006010	For the death that he died , he died to sin once ; but the life that he lives , he lives to God .
45006011	Thus also consider yourselves also to be dead to sin , but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord .
45006012	Therefore don't let sin reign in your mortal body , that you should obey it in its lusts .
45006013	Neither present your members to sin as instruments of unrighteousness , but present yourselves to God , as alive from the dead , and your members as instruments of righteousness to God .
45006014	For sin will not have dominion over you . For you are not under law , but under grace .
45006015	What then ? Will we sin , because we are not under law , but under grace ? Certainly not !
45006016	Don't you know that to whom you present yourselves as servants to obedience , his servants you are whom you obey ; whether of sin to death , or of obedience to righteousness ?
45006017	But thanks be to God , that , whereas you were servants of sin , you became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching whereunto you were delivered .
45006018	Being made free from sin , you became servants of righteousness .
45006019	I speak in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh , for as you presented your members as servants to uncleanness and to wickedness upon wickedness , even so now present your members as servants to righteousness for sanctification .
45006020	For when you were servants of sin , you were free in regard to righteousness .
45006021	What fruit then did you have at that time in the things of which you are now ashamed ? For the end of those things is death .
45006022	But now , being made free from sin , and having become servants of God , you have your fruit of sanctification , and the result of eternal life .
45006023	For the wages of sin is death , but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord .
45007001	Or don't you know , brothers ( for I speak to men who know the law ) , that the law has dominion over a man for as long as he lives ?
45007002	For the woman that has a husband is bound by law to the husband while he lives , but if the husband dies , she is discharged from the law of the husband .
45007003	So then if , while the husband lives , she is joined to another man , she would be called an adulteress . But if the husband dies , she is free from the law , so that she is no adulteress , though she is joined to another man .
45007004	Therefore , my brothers , you also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ , that you would be joined to another , to him who was raised from the dead , that we might bring forth fruit to God .
45007005	For when we were in the flesh , the sinful passions which were through the law , worked in our members to bring forth fruit to death .
45007006	But now we have been discharged from the law , having died to that in which we were held ; so that we serve in newness of the spirit , and not in oldness of the letter .
45007007	What will we say then ? Is the law sin ? Certainly not ! However , I wouldn't have known sin , except through the law . For I wouldn't have known coveting , unless the law had said , " You shall not covet . "
45007008	But sin , finding occasion through the commandment , produced in me all kinds of coveting . For apart from the law , sin is dead .
45007009	I was alive apart from the law once , but when the commandment came , sin revived , and I died .
45007010	The commandment , which was to life , this I found to be to death ;
45007011	for sin , finding occasion through the commandment , deceived me , and through it killed me .
45007012	So that the law is holy , and the commandment holy , and righteous , and good .
45007013	Did then that which is good become death to me ? Certainly not ! But sin , that it might be shown to be sin , by working death to me through that which is good ; that through the commandment sin might become exceeding sinful .
45007014	For we know that the law is spiritual , but I am fleshly , sold under sin .
45007015	For I don't know what I am doing . For I don't practice what I desire to do ; but what I hate , that I do .
45007016	But if what I don't desire , that I do , I consent to the law that it is good .
45007017	So now it is no more I that do it , but sin which dwells in me .
45007018	For I know that in me , that is , in my flesh , dwells no good thing . For desire is present with me , but I don't find it doing that which is good .
45007019	For the good which I desire , I don't do ; but the evil which I don't desire , that I practice .
45007020	But if what I don't desire , that I do , it is no more I that do it , but sin which dwells in me .
45007021	I find then the law , that , to me , while I desire to do good , evil is present .
45007022	For I delight in God's law after the inward man ,
45007023	but I see a different law in my members , warring against the law of my mind , and bringing me into captivity under the law of sin which is in my members .
45007024	What a wretched man I am ! Who will deliver me out of the body of this death ?
45007025	I thank God through Jesus Christ , our Lord . So then I of myself with the mind , indeed serve the law of God , but with the flesh the law of sin .
45008001	There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus , who don't walk according to the flesh , but according to the Spirit .
45008002	For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus made me free from the law of sin and of death .
45008003	For what the law couldn't do , in that it was weak through the flesh , God , sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin , condemned sin in the flesh ;
45008004	that the ordinance of the law might be fulfilled in us , who walk not after the flesh , but after the Spirit .
45008005	For those who are after the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh , but those who are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit .
45008006	For the mind of the flesh is death , but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace ;
45008007	because the mind of the flesh is hostile towards God ; for it is not subject to God's law , neither indeed can it be .
45008008	Those who are in the flesh can't please God .
45008009	But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit , if it is so that the Spirit of God dwells in you . But if any man doesn't have the Spirit of Christ , he is not his .
45008010	If Christ is in you , the body is dead because of sin , but the spirit is alive because of righteousness .
45008011	But if the Spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you , he who raised up Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you .
45008012	So then , brothers , we are debtors , not to the flesh , to live after the flesh .
45008013	For if you live after the flesh , you must die ; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body , you will live .
45008014	For as many as are led by the Spirit of God , these are children of God .
45008015	For you didn't receive the spirit of bondage again to fear , but you received the spirit of adoption , whereby we cry , " Abba ! Father ! "
45008016	The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God ;
45008017	and if children , then heirs ; heirs of God , and joint-heirs with Christ ; if indeed we suffer with him , that we may also be glorified with him .
45008018	For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which will be revealed toward us .
45008019	For the creation waits with eager expectation for the sons of God to be revealed .
45008020	For the creation was subjected to vanity , not of its own will , but by reason of him who subjected it , in hope
45008021	that the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of decay into the liberty of the glory of the children of God .
45008022	For we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now .
45008023	Not only so , but ourselves also , who have the first fruits of the Spirit , even we ourselves groan within ourselves , waiting for adoption , the redemption of our body .
45008024	For we were saved in hope , but hope that is seen is not hope . For who hopes for that which he sees ?
45008025	But if we hope for that which we don't see , we wait for it with patience .
45008026	In the same way , the Spirit also helps our weaknesses , for we don't know how to pray as we ought . But the Spirit himself makes intercession for us with groanings which can't be uttered .
45008027	He who searches the hearts knows what is on the Spirit's mind , because he makes intercession for the saints according to God .
45008028	We know that all things work together for good for those who love God , to those who are called according to his purpose .
45008029	For whom he foreknew , he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son , that he might be the firstborn among many brothers .
45008030	Whom he foreordained , them he also called . Whom he called , them he also justified . Whom he justified , them he also glorified .
45008031	What then will we say about these things ? If God is for us , who can be against us ?
45008032	He who didn't spare his own Son , but delivered him up for us all , how would he not also with him freely give us all things ?
45008033	Who could bring a charge against God's elect ? It is God who justifies .
45008034	Who is he who condemns ? It is Christ who died , yes rather , who was raised from the dead , who is at the right hand of God , who also makes intercession for us .
45008035	Who shall separate us from the love of Christ ? Could oppression , or anguish , or persecution , or famine , or nakedness , or peril , or sword ?
45008036	Even as it is written , " For your sake we are killed all day long . We were accounted as sheep for the slaughter . "
45008037	No , in all these things , we are more than conquerors through him who loved us .
45008038	For I am persuaded , that neither death , nor life , nor angels , nor principalities , nor things present , nor things to come , nor powers ,
45008039	nor height , nor depth , nor any other creature , will be able to separate us from the love of God , which is in Christ Jesus our Lord .
45009001	I tell the truth in Christ . I am not lying , my conscience testifying with me in the Holy Spirit ,
45009002	that I have great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart .
45009003	For I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ for my brothers ' sake , my relatives according to the flesh ,
45009004	who are Israelites ; whose is the adoption , the glory , the covenants , the giving of the law , the service , and the promises ;
45009005	whose are the fathers , and of whom is Christ as concerning the flesh , who is over all , God , blessed forever . Amen .
45009006	But it is not as though the word of God has come to nothing . For they are not all Israel , that are of Israel .
45009007	Neither , because they are Abraham's seed , are they all children . But , " In Isaac will your seed be called . "
45009008	That is , it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God , but the children of the promise are counted as a seed .
45009009	For this is a word of promise , " At the appointed time I will come , and Sarah will have a son . "
45009010	Not only so , but Rebecca also conceived by one , by our father Isaac .
45009011	For being not yet born , neither having done anything good or bad , that the purpose of God according to election might stand , not of works , but of him who calls ,
45009012	it was said to her , " The elder will serve the younger . "
45009013	Even as it is written , " Jacob I loved , but Esau I hated . "
45009014	What will we say then ? Is there unrighteousness with God ? Certainly not !
45009015	For he said to Moses , " I will have mercy on whom I have mercy , and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion . "
45009016	So then it is not of him who wills , nor of him who runs , but of God who has mercy .
45009017	For the scripture says to Pharaoh , " For this very purpose I caused you to be raised up , that I might show in you my power , and that my name might be published abroad in all the earth . "
45009018	So then , he has mercy on whom he desires , and he hardens whom he desires .
45009019	You will say then to me , " Why does he still find fault ? For who withstands his will ? "
45009020	But no , man , who are you who replies against God ? Will the thing formed ask him who formed it , " Why did you make me like this ? "
45009021	Or hasn't the potter a right over the clay , from the same lump to make one part a vessel for honor , and another for dishonor ?
45009022	What if God , willing to show his wrath , and to make his power known , endured with much patience vessels of wrath made for destruction ,
45009023	and that he might make known the riches of his glory on vessels of mercy , which he prepared beforehand for glory ,
45009024	us , whom he also called , not from the Jews only , but also from the Gentiles ?
45009025	As he says also in Hosea , " I will call them ' my people , ' which were not my people ; And her ' beloved , ' who was not beloved . "
45009026	" It will be that in the place where it was said to them , ' You are not my people , ' There will they be called ' sons of the living God . ' "
45009027	Isaiah cries concerning Israel , " If the number of the children of Israel are as the sand of the sea , It is the remnant who will be saved ;
45009028	For He will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness , Because the LORD will make a short work upon the earth . "
45009029	As Isaiah has said before , " Unless the Lord of Hosts had left us a seed , We would have become like Sodom , And would have been made like Gomorrah . "
45009030	What will we say then ? That the Gentiles , who didn't follow after righteousness , attained to righteousness , even the righteousness which is of faith ;
45009031	but Israel , following after a law of righteousness , didn't arrive at the law of righteousness .
45009032	Why ? Because they didn't seek it by faith , but as it were by works of the law . They stumbled over the stumbling stone ;
45009033	even as it is written , " Behold , I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense . And no one who believes in him will be put to shame . "
45010001	Brothers , my heart's desire and my prayer to God is for Israel , that they may be saved .
45010002	For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God , but not according to knowledge .
45010003	For being ignorant of God's righteousness , and seeking to establish their own righteousness , they didn't subject themselves to the righteousness of God .
45010004	For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes .
45010005	For Moses writes about the righteousness of the law , " The one who does them will live by them . "
45010006	But the righteousness which is of faith says this , " Don't say in your heart , ' Who will ascend into heaven ? ' ( that is , to bring Christ down ) ;
45010007	or , ' Who will descend into the abyss ? ' ( that is , to bring Christ up from the dead . ) "
45010008	But what does it say ? " The word is near you , in your mouth , and in your heart ; " that is , the word of faith , which we preach :
45010009	that if you will confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus , and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead , you will be saved .
45010010	For with the heart , one believes unto righteousness ; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation .
45010011	For the scripture says , " Whoever believes in him will not be put to shame . "
45010012	For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek ; for the same Lord is Lord of all , and is rich to all who call on him .
45010013	For , " Whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved . "
45010014	How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed ? How will they believe in him whom they have not heard ? How will they hear without a preacher ?
45010015	And how will they preach unless they are sent ? As it is written : " How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the gospel of peace , Who bring glad tidings of good things ! "
45010016	But they didn't all listen to the glad news . For Isaiah says , " Lord , who has believed our report ? "
45010017	So faith comes by hearing , and hearing by the word of God .
45010018	But I say , didn't they hear ? Yes , most assuredly , " Their sound went out into all the earth , Their words to the ends of the world . "
45010019	But I ask , didn't Israel know ? First Moses says , " I will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no nation , With a nation void of understanding I will make you angry . "
45010020	Isaiah is very bold , and says , " I was found by those who didn't seek me . I was revealed to those who didn't ask for me . "
45010021	But as to Israel he says , " All day long I stretched out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people .
45011001	I ask then , Did God reject his people ? Certainly not ! For I also am an Israelite , a descendant of Abraham , of the tribe of Benjamin .
45011002	God didn't reject his people , which he foreknew . Or don't you know what the scripture says about Elijah ? How he pleads with God against Israel :
45011003	" Lord , they have killed your prophets , they have broken down your altars ; and I am left alone , and they seek my life . "
45011004	But how does God answer him ? " I have reserved for myself seven thousand men , who have not bowed the knee to Baal . "
45011005	Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace .
45011006	And if by grace , then it is no longer of works ; otherwise grace is no longer grace . But if it is of works , it is no longer grace ; otherwise work is no longer work .
45011007	What then ? That which Israel seeks for , that he didn't obtain , but the election obtained it , and the rest were hardened .
45011008	According as it is written , " God gave them a spirit of stupor , eyes that they should not see , and ears that they should not hear , to this very day . "
45011009	David says , " Let their table be made a snare , and a trap , A stumbling block , and a retribution to them .
45011010	Let their eyes be darkened , that they may not see . Bow down their back always . "
45011011	I ask then , did they stumble that they might fall ? Certainly not ! But by their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles , to provoke them to jealousy .
45011012	Now if their fall is the riches of the world , and their loss the riches of the Gentiles ; how much more their fullness ?
45011013	For I speak to you who are Gentiles . Since then as I am an apostle to Gentiles , I glorify my ministry ;
45011014	if by any means I may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh , and may save some of them .
45011015	For if the rejection of them [ is ] the reconciling of the world , what would the receiving of them be , but life from the dead ?
45011016	If the first fruit is holy , so is the lump . If the root is holy , so are the branches .
45011017	But if some of the branches were broken off , and you , being a wild olive , were grafted in among them , and became partaker with them of the root of the richness of the olive tree ;
45011018	don't boast over the branches . But if you boast , it is not you who bear the root , but the root you .
45011019	You will say then , " Branches were broken off , that I might be grafted in . "
45011020	True ; by their unbelief they were broken off , and you stand by your faith . Don't be conceited , but fear ;
45011021	for if God didn't spare the natural branches , neither will he spare you .
45011022	See then the goodness and severity of God . Toward those who fell , severity ; but toward you , goodness , if you continue in his goodness ; otherwise you also will be cut off .
45011023	They also , if they don't continue in their unbelief , will be grafted in , for God is able to graft them in again .
45011024	For if you were cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree , and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree , how much more will these , which are the natural branches , be grafted into their own olive tree ?
45011025	For I don't desire , brothers , to have you ignorant of this mystery , so that you won't be wise in your own conceits , that a hardening in part has happened to Israel , until the fullness of the Gentiles have come in ,
45011026	and so all Israel will be saved . Even as it is written , " There will come out of Zion the Deliverer , And he will turn away ungodliness from Jacob .
45011027	This is my covenant to them , When I will take away their sins . "
45011028	Concerning the gospel , they are enemies for your sake . But concerning the election , they are beloved for the fathers ' sake .
45011029	For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable .
45011030	For as you in time past were disobedient to God , but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience ,
45011031	even so these also have now been disobedient , that by the mercy shown to you they may also obtain mercy .
45011032	For God has shut up all to disobedience , that he might have mercy on all .
45011033	Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God ! How unsearchable are his judgments , and his ways past tracing out !
45011034	" For who has known the mind of the Lord ? Or who has been his counselor ? "
45011035	" Or who has first given to him , And it will be repaid to him again ? "
45011036	For of him , and through him , and to him , are all things . To him be the glory for ever ! Amen .
45012001	Therefore I beg you , brothers , by the mercies of God , to present your bodies a living sacrifice , holy , acceptable to God , which is your spiritual service .
45012002	Don't be fashioned according to this world , but be transformed by the renewing of your mind , so that you may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God .
45012003	For I say , through the grace that was given me , to every man who is among you , not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think ; but to think reasonably , as God has apportioned to each person a measure of faith .
45012004	For even as we have many members in one body , and all the members don't have the same function ,
45012005	so we , who are many , are one body in Christ , and individually members one of another .
45012006	Having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us , if prophecy , let us prophesy according to the proportion of our faith ;
45012007	or service , let us give ourselves to service ; or he who teaches , to his teaching ;
45012008	or he who exhorts , to his exhorting : he who gives , let him do it with liberality ; he who rules , with diligence ; he who shows mercy , with cheerfulness .
45012009	Let love be without hypocrisy . Abhor that which is evil . Cling to that which is good .
45012010	In love of the brothers be tenderly affectionate one to another ; in honor preferring one another ;
45012011	not lagging in diligence ; fervent in spirit ; serving the Lord ;
45012012	rejoicing in hope ; enduring in oppression ; continuing steadfastly in prayer ;
45012013	contributing to the needs of the saints ; given to hospitality .
45012014	Bless those who persecute you ; bless , and don't curse .
45012015	Rejoice with those who rejoice . Weep with those who weep .
45012016	Be of the same mind one toward another . Don't set your mind on high things , but associate with the humble . Don't be wise in your own conceits .
45012017	Repay no one evil for evil . Respect what is honorable in the sight of all men .
45012018	If it is possible , as much as it is up to you , be at peace with all men .
45012019	Don't seek revenge yourselves , beloved , but give place to God's wrath . For it is written , " Vengeance belongs to me ; I will repay , says the Lord . "
45012020	Therefore " If your enemy is hungry , feed him . If he is thirsty , give him a drink . For in doing so , you will heap coals of fire on his head . "
45012021	Don't be overcome by evil , but overcome evil with good .
45013001	Let every soul be in subjection to the higher authorities , for there is no authority except from God , and those who be are ordained by God .
45013002	Therefore he who resists the authority , withstands the ordinance of God ; and those who withstand will receive to themselves judgment .
45013003	For rulers are not a terror to the good work , but to the evil . Do you desire to have no fear of the authority ? Do that which is good , and you will have praise from the same ,
45013004	for he is a servant of God to you for good . But if you do that which is evil , be afraid , for he doesn't bear the sword in vain ; for he is a minister of God , an avenger for wrath to him who does evil .
45013005	Therefore you need to be in subjection , not only because of the wrath , but also for conscience ' sake .
45013006	For this reason you also pay taxes , for they are ministers of God's service , attending continually on this very thing .
45013007	Give therefore to everyone what you owe : taxes to whom taxes are due ; customs to whom customs ; respect to whom respect ; honor to whom honor .
45013008	Owe no one anything , except to love one another ; for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law .
45013009	For the commandments , " You shall not commit adultery , " " You shall not murder , " " You shall not steal , " " You shall not give false testimony , " " You shall not covet , " and whatever other commandments there are , are all summed up in this saying , namely , " You shall love your neighbor as yourself . "
45013010	Love doesn't harm his neighbor . Love therefore is the fulfillment of the law .
45013011	This , knowing the time , that it is already time for you to awake out of sleep , for salvation is now nearer to us than when we first believed .
45013012	The night is far gone , and the day is near . Let's therefore throw off the works of darkness , and let's put on the armor of light .
45013013	Let us walk properly , as in the day ; not in reveling and drunkenness , not in sexual promiscuity and lustful acts , and not in strife and jealousy .
45013014	But put on the Lord Jesus Christ , and make no provision for the flesh , for its lusts .
45014001	But receive him who is weak in faith , not for judging thoughts .
45014002	One man has faith to eat all things , but he who is weak eats herbs .
45014003	Don't let him who eats despise him who doesn't eat . Don't let him who doesn't eat judge him who eats , for God has received him .
45014004	Who are you who judge the servant of another ? To his own lord he stands or falls . Yes , he will be made to stand , for God has power to make him stand .
45014005	One man esteems one day above another . Another esteems every day alike . Let each man be fully assured in his own mind .
45014006	He who observes the day , observes it to the Lord ; and he who does not observe the day , to the Lord he does not observe it . He who eats , eats to the Lord , for he gives God thanks . He who doesn't eat , to the Lord he doesn't eat , and gives God thanks .
45014007	For none of us lives to himself , and none dies to himself .
45014008	For if we live , we live to the Lord . Or if we die , we die to the Lord . If therefore we live or die , we are the Lord's .
45014009	For to this end Christ died , rose , and lived again , that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living .
45014010	But you , why do you judge your brother ? Or you again , why do you despise your brother ? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of Christ .
45014011	For it is written , " ' As I live , ' says the Lord , ' to me every knee will bow . Every tongue will confess to God . ' "
45014012	So then each one of us will give account of himself to God .
45014013	Therefore Let's not judge one another any more , but judge this rather , that no man put a stumbling block in his brother's way , or an occasion of falling .
45014014	I know , and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus , that nothing is unclean of itself ; except that to him who considers anything to be unclean , to him it is unclean .
45014015	Yet if because of food your brother is grieved , you walk no longer in love . Don't destroy with your food him for whom Christ died .
45014016	Then don't let your good be slandered ,
45014017	for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking , but righteousness , peace , and joy in the Holy Spirit .
45014018	For he who serves Christ in these things is acceptable to God and approved by men .
45014019	So then , let us follow after things which make for peace , and things whereby we may build one another up .
45014020	Don't overthrow God's work for food's sake . All things indeed are clean , however it is evil for that man who creates a stumbling block by eating .
45014021	It is good not to eat meat , drink wine nor do anything by which your brother stumbles , is offended , or is made weak .
45014022	Do you have faith ? Have it to yourself before God . Happy is he who doesn't judge himself in that which he approves .
45014023	But he who doubts is condemned if he eats , because it isn't of faith ; and whatever is not of faith is sin .
45014024	Now to him who is able to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ , according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept in silence through eternal times ,
45014025	but now is revealed , and by the scriptures of the prophets , according to the commandment of the eternal God , is made known to all the nations to obedience of faith ;
45014026	to the only wise God , through Jesus Christ , to whom be the glory forever ! Amen .
45015001	Now we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of the weak , and not to please ourselves .
45015002	Let each one of us please his neighbor for that which is good , to be building him up .
45015003	For Christ also didn't please himself . But , as it is written , " The reproaches of those who reproached you fell on me . "
45015004	For whatever things were written before were written for our learning , that through patience and through comfort of the scriptures we might have hope .
45015005	Now the God of patience and of comfort grant you to be of the same mind one with another according to Christ Jesus ,
45015006	that with one accord you may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
45015007	Therefore receive one another , even as Christ also received you , to the glory of God .
45015008	Now I say that Christ has been made a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God , that he might confirm the promises given to the fathers ,
45015009	and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy . As it is written , " Therefore will I give praise to you among the Gentiles , And sing to your name . "
45015010	Again he says , " Rejoice , you Gentiles , with his people . "
45015011	Again , " Praise the Lord , all you Gentiles ! Let all the peoples praise him . "
45015012	Again , Isaiah says , " There will be the root of Jesse , He who arises to rule over the Gentiles ; On him will the Gentiles hope . "
45015013	Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing , that you may abound in hope , in the power of the Holy Spirit .
45015014	I myself am also persuaded about you , my brothers , that you yourselves are full of goodness , filled with all knowledge , able also to admonish others .
45015015	But I write the more boldly to you in some measure , as putting you again in memory , because of the grace that was given to me by God ,
45015016	that I should be a servant of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles , serving the gospel of God , that the offering up of the Gentiles might be made acceptable , being sanctified by the Holy Spirit .
45015017	I have therefore my boasting in Christ Jesus in things pertaining to God .
45015018	For I will not dare to speak of any things except those which Christ worked through me , for the obedience of the Gentiles , by word and deed ,
45015019	in the power of signs and wonders , in the power of God's Spirit ; so that from Jerusalem , and around as far as to Illyricum , I have fully preached the gospel of Christ ;
45015020	yes , making it my aim so to preach the gospel , not where Christ was already named , that I might not build on another man's foundation .
45015021	But , as it is written , " They will see , to whom no news of him came . They who haven't heard will understand . "
45015022	Therefore also I was hindered these many times from coming to you ,
45015023	but now , no longer having any place in these regions , and having these many years a longing to come to you ,
45015024	whenever I journey to Spain , I will come to you . For I hope to see you on my journey , and to be helped on my way there by you , if first I may enjoy your company for a while .
45015025	But now , I say , I am going to Jerusalem , serving the saints .
45015026	For it has been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints who are at Jerusalem .
45015027	Yes , it has been their good pleasure , and they are their debtors . For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things , they owe it to them also to serve them in fleshly things .
45015028	When therefore I have accomplished this , and have sealed to them this fruit , I will go on by you to Spain .
45015029	I know that , when I come to you , I will come in the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ .
45015030	Now I beg you , brothers , by our Lord Jesus Christ , and by the love of the Spirit , that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me ,
45015031	that I may be delivered from those who are disobedient in Judea , and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints ;
45015032	that I may come to you in joy through the will of God , and together with you , find rest .
45015033	Now the God of peace be with you all . Amen .
45016001	I commend to you Phoebe , our sister , who is a servant of the assembly that is at Cenchreae ,
45016002	that you receive her in the Lord , in a way worthy of the saints , and that you assist her in whatever matter she may need from you , for she herself also has been a helper of many , and of my own self .
45016003	Greet Prisca and Aquila , my fellow workers in Christ Jesus ,
45016004	who for my life , laid down their own necks ; to whom not only I give thanks , but also all the assemblies of the Gentiles .
45016005	Greet the assembly that is in their house . Greet Epaenetus , my beloved , who is the first-fruits of Achaia to Christ .
45016006	Greet Mary , who labored much for us .
45016007	Greet Andronicus and Junias , my relatives and my fellow prisoners , who are notable among the apostles , who also have been in Christ before me .
45016008	Greet Amplias , my beloved in the Lord .
45016009	Greet Urbanus , our fellow worker in Christ , and Stachys , my beloved .
45016010	Greet Apelles , the approved in Christ . Greet those who are of the household of Aristobulus .
45016011	Greet Herodion , my kinsman . Greet them of the household of Narcissus , who are in the Lord .
45016012	Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa , who labor in the Lord . Greet Persis , the beloved , who labored much in the Lord .
45016013	Greet Rufus , the chosen in the Lord , and his mother and mine .
45016014	Greet Asyncritus , Phlegon , Hermes , Patrobas , Hermas , and the brothers who are with them .
45016015	Greet Philologus and Julia , Nereus and his sister , and Olympas , and all the saints who are with them .
45016016	Greet one another with a holy kiss . The assemblies of Christ greet you .
45016017	Now I beg you , brothers , mark those who are causing the divisions and occasions of stumbling , contrary to the doctrine which you learned , and turn away from them .
45016018	For those who are such don't serve our Lord , Jesus Christ , but their own belly ; and by their smooth and flattering speech , they deceive the hearts of the innocent .
45016019	For your obedience has reached all . I rejoice therefore over you . But I desire to have you wise to that which is good , but innocent to that which is evil .
45016020	Now the God of peace will crush Satan under your feet swiftly . The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you .
45016021	Timothy , my fellow worker , greets you , as do Lucius , Jason , and Sosipater , my relatives .
45016022	I , Tertius , who write the letter , greet you in the Lord .
45016023	Gaius , my host and host of the whole assembly , greets you . Erastus , the treasurer of the city , greets you , as does Quartus , the brother .
45016024	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all ! Amen .
46001001	Paul , called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God , and our brother Sosthenes ,
46001002	to the assembly of God which is at Corinth ; those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus , called to be saints , with all who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place , both theirs and ours :
46001003	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
46001004	I always thank my God concerning you , for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus ;
46001005	that in everything you were enriched in him , in all speech and all knowledge ;
46001006	even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you :
46001007	so that you come behind in no gift ; waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ ;
46001008	who will also confirm you until the end , blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ .
46001009	God is faithful , through whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son , Jesus Christ , our Lord .
46001010	Now I beg you , brothers , through the name of our Lord , Jesus Christ , that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you , but that you be perfected together in the same mind and in the same judgment .
46001011	For it has been reported to me concerning you , my brothers , by those who are from Chloe's household , that there are contentions among you .
46001012	Now I mean this , that each one of you says , " I follow Paul , " " I follow Apollos , " " I follow Cephas , " and , " I follow Christ . "
46001013	Is Christ divided ? Was Paul crucified for you ? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul ?
46001014	I thank God that I baptized none of you , except Crispus and Gaius ,
46001015	so that no one should say that I had baptized you into my own name .
46001016	( I also baptized the household of Stephanas ; besides them , I don't know whether I baptized any other . )
46001017	For Christ sent me not to baptize , but to preach the gospel - - not in wisdom of words , so that the cross of Christ wouldn't be made void .
46001018	For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are dying , but to us who are saved it is the power of God .
46001019	For it is written , " I will destroy the wisdom of the wise , I will bring the discernment of the discerning to nothing . "
46001020	Where is the wise ? Where is the scribe ? Where is the lawyer of this world ? Hasn't God made foolish the wisdom of this world ?
46001021	For seeing that in the wisdom of God , the world through its wisdom didn't know God , it was God's good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save those who believe .
46001022	For Jews ask for signs , Greeks seek after wisdom ,
46001023	but we preach Christ crucified ; a stumbling block to Jews , and foolishness to Greeks ,
46001024	but to those who are called , both Jews and Greeks , Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God .
46001025	Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men , and the weakness of God is stronger than men .
46001026	For you see your calling , brothers , that not many are wise according to the flesh , not many mighty , and not many noble ;
46001027	but God chose the foolish things of the world that he might put to shame those who are wise . God chose the weak things of the world , that he might put to shame the things that are strong ;
46001028	and God chose the lowly things of the world , and the things that are despised , and the things that are not , that he might bring to nothing the things that are :
46001029	that no flesh should boast before God .
46001030	But of him , you are in Christ Jesus , who was made to us wisdom from God , and righteousness and sanctification , and redemption :
46001031	that , according as it is written , " He who boasts , let him boast in the Lord . "
46002001	When I came to you , brothers , I didn't come with excellence of speech or of wisdom , proclaiming to you the testimony of God .
46002002	For I determined not to know anything among you , except Jesus Christ , and him crucified .
46002003	I was with you in weakness , in fear , and in much trembling .
46002004	My speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of human wisdom , but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power ,
46002005	that your faith wouldn't stand in the wisdom of men , but in the power of God .
46002006	We speak wisdom , however , among those who are full grown ; yet a wisdom not of this world , nor of the rulers of this world , who are coming to nothing .
46002007	But we speak God's wisdom in a mystery , the wisdom that has been hidden , which God foreordained before the worlds to our glory ,
46002008	which none of the rulers of this world has known . For had they known it , they wouldn't have crucified the Lord of glory .
46002009	But as it is written , " Things which eye didn't see , and ear didn't hear , Which didn't enter into the heart of man , Whatever things God prepared for those who love him . "
46002010	But to us , God revealed them through the Spirit . For the Spirit searches all things , yes , the deep things of God .
46002011	For who among men knows the things of a man , except the spirit of the man , which is in him ? Even so , no one knows the things of God , except God's Spirit .
46002012	But we received , not the spirit of the world , but the Spirit which is from God , that we might know the things that were freely given to us by God .
46002013	Which things also we speak , not in words which man's wisdom teaches , but which the Holy Spirit teaches , comparing spiritual things with spiritual things .
46002014	Now the natural man doesn't receive the things of the God's Spirit , for they are foolishness to him , and he can't know them , because they are spiritually discerned .
46002015	But he who is spiritual discerns all things , and he himself is judged by no one .
46002016	" For who has known the mind of the Lord , that he should instruct him ? " But we have Christ's mind .
46003001	Brothers , I couldn't speak to you as to spiritual , but as to fleshly , as to babes in Christ .
46003002	I fed you with milk , not with meat ; for you weren't yet ready . Indeed , not even now are you ready ,
46003003	for you are still fleshly . For insofar as there is jealousy , strife , and factions among you , aren't you fleshly , and don't you walk in the ways of men ?
46003004	For when one says , " I follow Paul , " and another , " I follow Apollos , " aren't you fleshly ?
46003005	Who then is Apollos , and who is Paul , but servants through whom you believed ; and each as the Lord gave to him ?
46003006	I planted . Apollos watered . But God gave the increase .
46003007	So then neither he who plants is anything , nor he who waters , but God who gives the increase .
46003008	Now he who plants and he who waters are the same , but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor .
46003009	For we are God's fellow workers . You are God's farming , God's building .
46003010	According to the grace of God which was given to me , as a wise master builder I laid a foundation , and another builds on it . But let each man be careful how he builds on it .
46003011	For no one can lay any other foundation than that which has been laid , which is Jesus Christ .
46003012	But if anyone builds on the foundation with gold , silver , costly stones , wood , hay , or stubble ;
46003013	each man's work will be revealed . For the Day will declare it , because it is revealed in fire ; and the fire itself will test what sort of work each man's work is .
46003014	If any man's work remains which he built on it , he will receive a reward .
46003015	If any man's work is burned , he will suffer loss , but he himself will be saved , but as through fire .
46003016	Don't you know that you are a temple of God , and that God's Spirit lives in you ?
46003017	If anyone destroys the temple of God , God will destroy him ; for God's temple is holy , which you are .
46003018	Let no one deceive himself . If anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this world , let him become a fool , that he may become wise .
46003019	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God . For it is written , " He has taken the wise in their craftiness . "
46003020	And again , " The Lord knows the reasoning of the wise , that it is worthless . "
46003021	Therefore let no one boast in men . For all things are yours ,
46003022	whether Paul , or Apollos , or Cephas , or the world , or life , or death , or things present , or things to come . All are yours ,
46003023	and you are Christ's , and Christ is God's .
46004001	So let a man think of us as Christ's servants , and stewards of God's mysteries .
46004002	Here , moreover , it is required of stewards , that they be found faithful .
46004003	But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you , or by man's judgment . Yes , I don't judge my own self .
46004004	For I know nothing against myself . Yet I am not justified by this , but he who judges me is the Lord .
46004005	Therefore judge nothing before the time , until the Lord comes , who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness , and reveal the counsels of the hearts . Then each man will get his praise from God .
46004006	Now these things , brothers , I have in a figure transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes , that in us you might learn not to think beyond the things which are written , that none of you be puffed up against one another .
46004007	For who makes you different ? And what do you have that you didn't receive ? But if you did receive it , why do you boast as if you had not received it ?
46004008	You are already filled . You have already become rich . You have come to reign without us . Yes , and I wish that you did reign , that we also might reign with you .
46004009	For , I think that God has displayed us , the apostles , last of all , like men sentenced to death . For we are made a spectacle to the world , both to angels and men .
46004010	We are fools for Christ's sake , but you are wise in Christ . We are weak , but you are strong . You have honor , but we have dishonor .
46004011	Even to this present hour we hunger , thirst , are naked , are beaten , and have no certain dwelling place .
46004012	We toil , working with our own hands . Being reviled , we bless . Being persecuted , we endure .
46004013	Being defamed , we entreat . We are made as the filth of the world , the dirt wiped off by all , even until now .
46004014	I don't write these things to shame you , but to admonish you as my beloved children .
46004015	For though you have ten thousand tutors in Christ , yet not many fathers . For in Christ Jesus , I became your father through the gospel .
46004016	I beg you therefore , be imitators of me .
46004017	Because of this I have sent Timothy to you , who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord , who will remind you of my ways which are in Christ , even as I teach everywhere in every assembly .
46004018	Now some are puffed up , as though I were not coming to you .
46004019	But I will come to you shortly , if the Lord is willing . And I will know , not the word of those who are puffed up , but the power .
46004020	For the kingdom of God is not in word , but in power .
46004021	What do you want ? Will I come to you with a rod , or in love and a spirit of gentleness ?
46005001	It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you , and such sexual immorality as is not even named among the Gentiles , that one has his father's wife .
46005002	You are puffed up , and didn't rather mourn , that he who had done this deed might be removed from among you .
46005003	For I most assuredly , as being absent in body but present in spirit , have already , as though I were present , judged him who has done this thing .
46005004	In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , you being gathered together , and my spirit , with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
46005005	are to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh , that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus .
46005006	Your boasting is not good . Don't you know that a little yeast leavens the whole lump ?
46005007	Purge out the old yeast , that you may be a new lump , even as you are unleavened . For indeed Christ , our Passover , has been sacrificed in our place .
46005008	Therefore let us keep the feast , not with old yeast , neither with the yeast of malice and wickedness , but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth .
46005009	I wrote to you in my letter to have no company with sexual sinners ;
46005010	yet not at all meaning with the sexual sinners of this world , or with the covetous and extortioners , or with idolaters ; for then you would have to leave the world .
46005011	But as it is , I wrote to you not to keep company , if any man who is named a brother is a sexual sinner , or covetous , or an idolater , or a slanderer , or a drunkard , or an extortioner . Don't even eat with such a person .
46005012	For what have I to do with also judging those who are outside ? Don't you judge those who are within ?
46005013	But those who are outside , God judges . " Put away the wicked man from among yourselves . "
46006001	Dare any of you , having a matter against his neighbor , go to law before the unrighteous , and not before the saints ?
46006002	Don't you know that the saints will judge the world ? And if the world is judged by you , are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters ?
46006003	Don't you know that we will judge angels ? How much more , things that pertain to this life ?
46006004	If then , you have to judge things pertaining to this life , do you set them to judge who are of no account in the assembly ?
46006005	I say this to move you to shame . What , can't there be one wise man among you who will be able to decide between his brothers ;
46006006	but brother goes to law with brother , and that before unbelievers ?
46006007	Therefore it is already altogether a defect in you , that you have lawsuits one with another . Why not rather be wronged ? Why not rather be defrauded ?
46006008	No , but you yourselves do wrong , and defraud , and that against your brothers .
46006009	Or don't you know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God ? Don't be deceived . Neither the sexually immoral , nor idolaters , nor adulterers , nor male prostitutes , nor homosexuals ,
46006010	nor thieves , nor covetous , nor drunkards , nor slanderers , nor extortioners , will inherit the kingdom of God .
46006011	Such were some of you , but you were washed . But you were sanctified . But you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus , and in the Spirit of our God .
46006012	" All things are lawful for me , " but not all things are expedient . " All things are lawful for me , " but I will not be brought under the power of anything .
46006013	" Foods for the belly , and the belly for foods , " but God will bring to nothing both it and them . But the body is not for sexual immorality , but for the Lord ; and the Lord for the body .
46006014	Now God raised up the Lord , and will also raise us up by his power .
46006015	Don't you know that your bodies are members of Christ ? Will I then take away the members of Christ , and make them members of a prostitute ? Certainly not !
46006016	Or don't you know that he who is joined to a prostitute is one body ? For , " The two , " says he , " will become one flesh . "
46006017	But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit .
46006018	Flee sexual immorality . " Every sin that a man does is outside the body , " but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body .
46006019	Or don't you know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you , which you have from God ? You are not your own ,
46006020	for you were bought with a price . Therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit , which are God's .
46007001	Now concerning the things about which you wrote to me . It is good for a man not to touch a woman .
46007002	But , because of sexual sins , let each man have his own wife , and let each woman have her own husband .
46007003	Let the husband render to the wife her due , and likewise also the wife to the husband .
46007004	The wife doesn't have authority over her own body , but the husband . Likewise also the husband doesn't have power over his own body , but the wife .
46007005	Don't defraud one another , unless it is by consent for a season , that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer , and may be together again , that Satan doesn't tempt you because of your lack of self-control .
46007006	But this I say by way of concession , not of commandment .
46007007	Yet I wish that all men were like me . However each man has his own gift from God , one of this kind , and another of that kind .
46007008	But I say to the unmarried and to widows , it is good for them if they remain even as I am .
46007009	But if they don't have self-control , let them marry . For it's better to marry than to burn .
46007010	But to the married I command - - not I , but the Lord - - that the wife not leave her husband
46007011	( but if she departs , let her remain unmarried , or else be reconciled to her husband ) , and that the husband not leave his wife .
46007012	But to the rest I - - not the Lord - - say , if any brother has an unbelieving wife , and she is content to live with him , let him not leave her .
46007013	The woman who has an unbelieving husband , and he is content to live with her , let her not leave her husband .
46007014	For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife , and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the husband . Otherwise your children would be unclean , but now are they holy .
46007015	Yet if the unbeliever departs , let there be separation . The brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases , but God has called us in peace .
46007016	For how do you know , wife , whether you will save your husband ? Or how do you know , husband , whether you will save your wife ?
46007017	Only , as the Lord has distributed to each man , as God has called each , so let him walk . So I command in all the assemblies .
46007018	Was anyone called being circumcised ? Let him not become uncircumcised . Has any been called in uncircumcision ? Let him not be circumcised .
46007019	Circumcision is nothing , and uncircumcision is nothing , but the keeping of the commandments of God .
46007020	Let each man stay in that calling in which he was called .
46007021	Were you called being a bondservant ? Don't let that bother you , but if you get an opportunity to become free , use it .
46007022	For he who was called in the Lord being a bondservant is the Lord's free man . Likewise he who was called being free is Christ's bondservant .
46007023	You were bought with a price . Don't become bondservants of men .
46007024	Brothers , let each man , in whatever condition he was called , stay in that condition with God .
46007025	Now concerning virgins , I have no commandment from the Lord , but I give my judgment as one who has obtained mercy from the Lord to be trustworthy .
46007026	I think that it is good therefore , because of the distress that is on us , that it is good for a man to be as he is .
46007027	Are you bound to a wife ? Don't seek to be freed . Are you free from a wife ? Don't seek a wife .
46007028	But if you marry , you have not sinned . If a virgin marries , she has not sinned . Yet such will have oppression in the flesh , and I want to spare you .
46007029	But I say this , brothers : the time is short , that from now on , both those who have wives may be as though they had none ;
46007030	and those who weep , as though they didn't weep ; and those who rejoice , as though they didn't rejoice ; and those who buy , as though they didn't possess ;
46007031	and those who use the world , as not using it to the fullest . For the mode of this world passes away .
46007032	But I desire to have you to be free from cares . He who is unmarried is concerned for the things of the Lord , how he may please the Lord ;
46007033	but he who is married is concerned about the things of the world , how he may please his wife .
46007034	There is also a difference between a wife and a virgin . The unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord , that she may be holy both in body and in spirit . But she who is married cares about the things of the world - - how she may please her husband .
46007035	This I say for your own profit ; not that I may throw a snare on you , but for that which is appropriate , and that you may attend to the Lord without distraction .
46007036	But if any man thinks that he is behaving inappropriately toward his virgin , if she is past the flower of her age , and if need so requires , let him do what he desires . He doesn't sin . Let them marry .
46007037	But he who stands steadfast in his heart , having no necessity , but has power over his own heart , to keep his own virgin , will do well .
46007038	So then both he who gives his own virgin in marriage does well , and he who doesn't give her in marriage will do better .
46007039	A wife is bound by law for so long time as her husband lives ; but if the husband is dead , she is free to be married to whoever she desires , only in the Lord .
46007040	But she is happier if she stays as she is , in my judgment , and I think that I also have God's Spirit .
46008001	Now concerning things sacrificed to idols : We know that we all have knowledge . Knowledge puffs up , but love builds up .
46008002	But if anyone thinks that he knows anything , he doesn't yet know as he ought to know .
46008003	But if anyone loves God , the same is known by him .
46008004	Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols , we know that no idol is anything in the world , and that there is no other God but one .
46008005	For though there are things that are called " gods , " whether in the heavens or on earth ; as there are many " gods " and many " lords ; "
46008006	yet to us there is one God , the Father , of whom are all things , and we to him ; and one Lord , Jesus Christ , through whom are all things , and we through him .
46008007	However , that knowledge isn't in all men . But some , being used until now to the idol , eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol , and their conscience , being weak , is defiled .
46008008	But food will not commend us to God . For neither , if we don't eat , are we the worse ; nor , if we eat , are we the better .
46008009	But be careful that by any means this liberty of yours doesn't become a stumbling block to the weak .
46008010	For if a man sees you who have knowledge sitting in an idol's temple , won't his conscience , if he is weak , be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols ?
46008011	And through your knowledge , he who is weak perishes , the brother for whose sake Christ died .
46008012	Thus , sinning against the brothers , and wounding their conscience when it is weak , you sin against Christ .
46008013	Therefore , if food causes my brother to stumble , I will eat no meat forevermore , that I don't cause my brother to stumble .
46009001	Am I not free ? Am I not an apostle ? Haven't I seen Jesus Christ , our Lord ? Aren't you my work in the Lord ?
46009002	If to others I am not an apostle , yet at least I am to you ; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord .
46009003	My defense to those who examine me is this .
46009004	Have we no right to eat and to drink ?
46009005	Have we no right to take along a wife who is a believer , even as the rest of the apostles , and the brothers of the Lord , and Cephas ?
46009006	Or have only Barnabas and I no right to not work ?
46009007	What soldier ever serves at his own expense ? Who plants a vineyard , and doesn't eat of its fruit ? Or who feeds a flock , and doesn't drink from the flock's milk ?
46009008	Do I speak these things according to the ways of men ? Or doesn't the law also say the same thing ?
46009009	For it is written in the law of Moses , " You shall not muzzle the ox when he treads out the corn . " Is it for the oxen that God cares ,
46009010	or does he say it assuredly for our sake ? Yes , for our sake it was written , because he who plows ought to plow in hope , and he who threshes in hope should partake of his hope .
46009011	If we sowed to you spiritual things , is it a great thing if we reap your fleshly things ?
46009012	If others partake of this right over you , don't we yet more ? Nevertheless we did not use this right , but we bear all things , that we may cause no hindrance to the gospel of Christ .
46009013	Don't you know that those who serve around sacred things eat from the things of the temple , and those who wait on the altar have their portion with the altar ?
46009014	Even so did the Lord ordain that those who proclaim the gospel should live from the gospel .
46009015	But I have used none of these things , and I don't write these things that it may be done so in my case ; for I would rather die , than that anyone should make my boasting void .
46009016	For if I preach the gospel , I have nothing to boast about ; for necessity is laid on me ; but woe is to me , if I don't preach the gospel .
46009017	For if I do this of my own will , I have a reward . But if not of my own will , I have a stewardship entrusted to me .
46009018	What then is my reward ? That , when I preach the gospel , I may present the gospel of Christ without charge , so as not to abuse my authority in the gospel .
46009019	For though I was free from all , I brought myself under bondage to all , that I might gain the more .
46009020	To the Jews I became as a Jew , that I might gain Jews ; to those who are under the law , as under the law , that I might gain those who are under the law ;
46009021	to those who are without law , as without law ( not being without law toward God , but under law toward Christ ) , that I might win those who are without law .
46009022	To the weak I became as weak , that I might gain the weak . I have become all things to all men , that I may by all means save some .
46009023	Now I do this for the gospel's sake , that I may be a joint partaker of it .
46009024	Don't you know that those who run in a race all run , but one receives the prize ? Run like that , that you may win .
46009025	Every man who strives in the games exercises self-control in all things . Now they do it to receive a corruptible crown , but we an incorruptible .
46009026	I therefore run like that , as not uncertainly . I fight like that , as not beating the air ,
46009027	but I beat my body and bring it into submission , for fear that by any means , that after I have preached to others , I myself should be rejected .
46010001	Now I would not have you ignorant , brothers , that our fathers were all under the cloud , and all passed through the sea ;
46010002	and were all baptized to Moses in the cloud and in the sea ;
46010003	and all ate the same spiritual food ;
46010004	and all drank the same spiritual drink . For they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them , and the rock was Christ .
46010005	However with most of them , God was not well pleased , for they were overthrown in the wilderness .
46010006	Now these things were our examples , to the intent we should not lust after evil things , as they also lusted .
46010007	Neither be idolaters , as some of them were . As it is written , " The people sat down to eat and drink , and rose up to play . "
46010008	Neither let us commit sexual immorality , as some of them committed , and in one day twenty-three thousand fell .
46010009	Neither let us test the Lord , as some of them tested , and perished by the serpents .
46010010	Neither grumble , as some of them also grumbled , and perished by the destroyer .
46010011	Now all these things happened to them by way of example , and they were written for our admonition , on whom the ends of the ages have come .
46010012	Therefore let him who thinks he stands be careful that he doesn't fall .
46010013	No temptation has taken you but such as man can bear . God is faithful , who will not allow you to be tempted above what you are able , but will with the temptation make also the way of escape , that you may be able to endure it .
46010014	Therefore , my beloved , flee from idolatry .
46010015	I speak as to wise men . Judge what I say .
46010016	The cup of blessing which we bless , isn't it a communion of the blood of Christ ? The bread which we break , isn't it a communion of the body of Christ ?
46010017	Seeing that we , who are many , are one bread , one body ; for we all partake of the one bread .
46010018	Consider Israel after the flesh . Don't those who eat the sacrifices have communion with the altar ?
46010019	What am I saying then ? That a thing sacrificed to idols is anything , or that an idol is anything ?
46010020	But I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice , they sacrifice to demons , and not to God , and I don't desire that you would have communion with demons .
46010021	You can't both drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons . You can't both partake of the table of the Lord , and of the table of demons .
46010022	Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy ? Are we stronger than he ?
46010023	" All things are lawful for me , " but not all things are expedient . " All things are lawful for me , " but not all things build up .
46010024	Let no one seek his own , but each one his neighbor's good .
46010025	Whatever is sold in the butcher shop , eat , asking no question for the sake of conscience ,
46010026	for " the earth is the Lord's , and its fullness . "
46010027	But if one of those who don't believe invites you to a meal , and you are inclined to go , eat whatever is set before you , asking no questions for the sake of conscience .
46010028	But if anyone says to you , " This was offered to idols , " don't eat it for the sake of the one who told you , and for the sake of conscience . For " the earth is the Lord's , and all its fullness . "
46010029	Conscience , I say , not your own , but the other's conscience . For why is my liberty judged by another conscience ?
46010030	If I partake with thankfulness , why am I denounced for that for which I give thanks ?
46010031	Whether therefore you eat , or drink , or whatever you do , do all to the glory of God .
46010032	Give no occasions for stumbling , either to Jews , or to Greeks , or to the assembly of God ;
46010033	even as I also please all men in all things , not seeking my own profit , but the profit of the many , that they may be saved .
46011001	Be imitators of me , even as I also am of Christ .
46011002	Now I praise you , brothers , that you remember me in all things , and hold firm the traditions , even as I delivered them to you .
46011003	But I would have you know , that the head of every man is Christ , and the head of the woman is the man , and the head of Christ is God .
46011004	Every man praying or prophesying , having his head covered , dishonors his head .
46011005	But every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonors her head . For it is one and the same thing as if she were shaved .
46011006	For if a woman is not covered , let her also be shorn . But if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaved , let her be covered .
46011007	For a man indeed ought not to have his head covered , because he is the image and glory of God , but the woman is the glory of the man .
46011008	For man is not from woman , but woman from man ;
46011009	for neither was man created for the woman , but woman for the man .
46011010	For this cause the woman ought to have authority on her head , because of the angels .
46011011	Nevertheless , neither is the woman independent of the man , nor the man independent of the woman , in the Lord .
46011012	For as the woman is from the man , so is the man also by the woman ; but all things are from God .
46011013	Judge for yourselves . Is it appropriate that a woman pray to God unveiled ?
46011014	Doesn't even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair , it is a dishonor to him ?
46011015	But if a woman has long hair , it is a glory to her , for her hair is given to her for a covering .
46011016	But if any man seems to be contentious , we have no such custom , neither do God's assemblies .
46011017	But in giving you this command , I don't praise you , that you come together not for the better but for the worse .
46011018	For first of all , when you come together in the assembly , I hear that divisions exist among you , and I partly believe it .
46011019	For there must be also factions among you , that those who are approved may be revealed among you .
46011020	When therefore you assemble yourselves together , it is not possible to eat the Lord's supper .
46011021	For in your eating each one takes his own supper before others . One is hungry , and another is drunken .
46011022	What , don't you have houses to eat and to drink in ? Or do you despise God's assembly , and put them to shame who don't have ? What will I tell you ? Will I praise you ? In this I don't praise you .
46011023	For I received from the Lord that which also I delivered to you , that the Lord Jesus on the night in which he was betrayed took bread .
46011024	When he had given thanks , he broke it , and said , " Take , eat . This is my body , which is broken for you . Do this in memory of me . "
46011025	In the same way he also took the cup , after supper , saying , " This cup is the new covenant in my blood . Do this , as often as you drink , in memory of me . "
46011026	For as often as you eat this bread , and drink this cup , you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes .
46011027	Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks the Lord's cup in an unworthy manner , will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord .
46011028	But let a man examine himself , and so let him eat of the bread , and drink of the cup .
46011029	For he who eats and drinks in an unworthy manner eats and drinks judgment to himself , if he doesn't discern the Lord's body .
46011030	For this cause many among you are weak and sickly , and not a few sleep .
46011031	For if we discerned ourselves , we wouldn't be judged .
46011032	But when we are judged , we are punished by the Lord , that we may not be condemned with the world .
46011033	Therefore , my brothers , when you come together to eat , wait one for another .
46011034	But if anyone is hungry , let him eat at home , that your coming together may not be to judgment . The rest I will set in order whenever I come .
46012001	Now concerning spiritual gifts , brothers , I don't want you to be ignorant .
46012002	You know that when you were Gentiles , you were led away to those mute idols , however you might be led .
46012003	Therefore I make known to you that no man speaking by God's Spirit says , " Jesus is accursed . " No one can say , " Jesus is Lord , " but by the Holy Spirit .
46012004	Now there are various kinds of gifts , but the same Spirit .
46012005	There are various kinds of service , and the same Lord .
46012006	There are various kinds of workings , but the same God , who works all things in all .
46012007	But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the profit of all .
46012008	For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom , and to another the word of knowledge , according to the same Spirit ;
46012009	to another faith , by the same Spirit ; and to another gifts of healings , by the same Spirit ;
46012010	and to another workings of miracles ; and to another prophecy ; and to another discerning of spirits ; to another different kinds of languages ; and to another the interpretation of languages .
46012011	But the one and the same Spirit works all of these , distributing to each one separately as he desires .
46012012	For as the body is one , and has many members , and all the members of the body , being many , are one body ; so also is Christ .
46012013	For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body , whether Jews or Greeks , whether bond or free ; and were all made to drink into one Spirit .
46012014	For the body is not one member , but many .
46012015	If the foot would say , " Because I'm not the hand , I'm not part of the body , " it is not therefore not part of the body .
46012016	If the ear would say , " Because I'm not the eye , I'm not part of the body , " it's not therefore not part of the body .
46012017	If the whole body were an eye , where would the hearing be ? If the whole were hearing , where would the smelling be ?
46012018	But now God has set the members , each one of them , in the body , just as he desired .
46012019	If they were all one member , where would the body be ?
46012020	But now they are many members , but one body .
46012021	The eye can't tell the hand , " I have no need for you , " or again the head to the feet , " I have no need for you . "
46012022	No , much rather , those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary .
46012023	Those parts of the body which we think to be less honorable , on those we bestow more abundant honor ; and our unpresentable parts have more abundant propriety ;
46012024	whereas our presentable parts have no such need . But God composed the body together , giving more abundant honor to the inferior part ,
46012025	that there should be no division in the body , but that the members should have the same care for one another .
46012026	When one member suffers , all the members suffer with it . Or when one member is honored , all the members rejoice with it .
46012027	Now you are the body of Christ , and members individually .
46012028	God has set some in the assembly , first apostles , secondly prophets , thirdly teachers , then miracle workers , then gifts of healings , helps , governments , and various kinds of languages .
46012029	Are all apostles ? Are all prophets ? Are all teachers ? Are all miracle workers ?
46012030	Do all have gifts of healings ? Do all speak with various languages ? Do all interpret ?
46012031	But desire earnestly the best gifts . Moreover , I show a most excellent way to you .
46013001	If I speak with the languages of men and of angels , but don't have love , I have become sounding brass , or a clanging cymbal .
46013002	If I have the gift of prophecy , and know all mysteries and all knowledge ; and if I have all faith , so as to remove mountains , but don't have love , I am nothing .
46013003	If I bestow all my goods to feed the poor , and if I give my body to be burned , but don't have love , it profits me nothing .
46013004	Love is patient and is kind ; love doesn't envy . Love doesn't brag , is not proud ,
46013005	doesn't behave itself inappropriately , doesn't seek its own way , is not provoked , takes no account of evil ;
46013006	doesn't rejoice in unrighteousness , but rejoices with the truth ;
46013007	bears all things , believes all things , hopes all things , endures all things .
46013008	Love never fails . But where there are prophecies , they will be done away with . Where there are various languages , they will cease . Where there is knowledge , it will be done away with .
46013009	For we know in part , and we prophesy in part ;
46013010	but when that which is complete has come , then that which is partial will be done away with .
46013011	When I was a child , I spoke as a child , I felt as a child , I thought as a child . Now that I have become a man , I have put away childish things .
46013012	For now we see in a mirror , dimly , but then face to face . Now I know in part , but then I will know fully , even as I was also fully known .
46013013	But now remain faith , hope , and love : these three . The greatest of these is love .
46014001	Follow after love , and earnestly desire spiritual gifts , but especially that you may prophesy .
46014002	For he who speaks in another language speaks not to men , but to God ; for no one understands ; but in the spirit he speaks mysteries .
46014003	But he who prophesies speaks to men for their edification , exhortation , and consolation .
46014004	He who speaks in another language edifies himself , but he who prophesies edifies the assembly .
46014005	Now I desire to have you all speak with other languages , but rather that you would prophesy . For he is greater who prophesies than he who speaks with other languages , unless he interprets , that the assembly may be built up .
46014006	But now , brothers , if I come to you speaking with other languages , what would I profit you , unless I speak to you either by way of revelation , or of knowledge , or of prophesying , or of teaching ?
46014007	Even things without life , giving a voice , whether pipe or harp , if they didn't give a distinction in the sounds , how would it be known what is piped or harped ?
46014008	For if the trumpet gave an uncertain voice , who would prepare himself for war ?
46014009	So also you , unless you uttered by the tongue words easy to understand , how would it be known what is spoken ? For you would be speaking into the air .
46014010	There are , it may be , so many kinds of voices in the world , and none of them is without meaning .
46014011	If then I don't know the meaning of the voice , I would be to him who speaks a foreigner , and he who speaks will be a foreigner to me .
46014012	So also you , since you are zealous for spiritual gifts , seek that you may abound to the building up of the assembly .
46014013	Therefore let him who speaks in another language pray that he may interpret .
46014014	For if I pray in another language , my spirit prays , but my understanding is unfruitful .
46014015	What is it then ? I will pray with the spirit , and I will pray with the understanding also . I will sing with the spirit , and I will sing with the understanding also .
46014016	Else if you bless with the spirit , how will he who fills the place of the unlearned say the " Amen " at your giving of thanks , seeing he doesn't know what you say ?
46014017	For you most assuredly give thanks well , but the other person is not built up .
46014018	I thank my God , I speak with other languages more than you all .
46014019	However in the assembly I would rather speak five words with my understanding , that I might instruct others also , than ten thousand words in another language .
46014020	Brothers , don't be children in mind , yet in malice be babies , but in mind be men .
46014021	In the law it is written , " By men of strange languages and by the lips of strangers I will speak to this people . Not even thus will they hear me , says the Lord . "
46014022	Therefore other languages are for a sign , not to those who believe , but to the unbelieving ; but prophesying is for a sign , not to the unbelieving , but to those who believe .
46014023	If therefore the whole assembly is assembled together and all speak with other languages , and unlearned or unbelieving people come in , won't they say that you are crazy ?
46014024	But if all prophesy , and someone unbelieving or unlearned comes in , he is reproved by all , and he is judged by all .
46014025	And thus the secrets of his heart are revealed . So he will fall down on his face and worship God , declaring that God is among you indeed .
46014026	What is it then , brothers ? When you come together , each one of you has a psalm , has a teaching , has a revelation , has another language , has an interpretation . Let all things be done to build each other up .
46014027	If any man speaks in another language , let it be two , or at the most three , and in turn ; and let one interpret .
46014028	But if there is no interpreter , let him keep silence in the assembly , and let him speak to himself , and to God .
46014029	Let the prophets speak , two or three , and let the others discern .
46014030	But if a revelation is made to another sitting by , let the first keep silence .
46014031	For you all can prophesy one by one , that all may learn , and all may be exhorted .
46014032	The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets ,
46014033	for God is not a God of confusion , but of peace . As in all the assemblies of the saints ,
46014034	let your women keep silence in the assemblies , for it is not permitted for them to speak ; but let them be in subjection , as the Law also says .
46014035	If they desire to learn anything , let them ask their own husbands at home , for it is shameful for a woman to chatter in the assembly .
46014036	What ? Was it from you that the word of God went forth ? Or did it come to you alone ?
46014037	If any man thinks himself to be a prophet , or spiritual , let him recognize the things which I write to you , that they are the commandment of the Lord .
46014038	But if anyone is ignorant , let him be ignorant .
46014039	Therefore , brothers , desire earnestly to prophesy , and don't forbid speaking with other languages .
46014040	Let all things be done decently and in order .
46015001	Now I declare to you , brothers , the gospel which I preached to you , which also you received , in which you also stand ,
46015002	by which also you are saved , if you hold firmly the word which I preached to you - - unless you believed in vain .
46015003	For I delivered to you first of all that which also I received : that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures ,
46015004	that he was buried , that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures ,
46015005	and that he appeared to Cephas , then to the twelve .
46015006	Then he appeared to over five hundred brothers at once , most of whom remain until now , but some have also fallen asleep .
46015007	Then he appeared to James , then to all the apostles ,
46015008	and last of all , as to the child born at the wrong time , he appeared to me also .
46015009	For I am the least of the apostles , who is not worthy to be called an apostle , because I persecuted the assembly of God .
46015010	But by the grace of God I am what I am . His grace which was bestowed on me was not found vain , but I worked more than all of them ; yet not I , but the grace of God which was with me .
46015011	Whether then it is I or they , so we preach , and so you believed .
46015012	Now if Christ is preached , that he has been raised from the dead , how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead ?
46015013	But if there is no resurrection of the dead , neither has Christ been raised .
46015014	If Christ has not been raised , then our preaching is in vain , and your faith also is in vain .
46015015	Yes , we are found false witnesses of God , because we testified about God that he raised up Christ , whom he didn't raise up , if it is so that the dead are not raised .
46015016	For if the dead aren't raised , neither has Christ been raised .
46015017	If Christ has not been raised , your faith is vain ; you are still in your sins .
46015018	Then they also who are fallen asleep in Christ have perished .
46015019	If we have only hoped in Christ in this life , we are of all men most pitiable .
46015020	But now Christ has been raised from the dead . He became the first fruits of those who are asleep .
46015021	For since death came by man , the resurrection of the dead also came by man .
46015022	For as in Adam all die , so also in Christ all will be made alive .
46015023	But each in his own order : Christ the first fruits , then those who are Christ's , at his coming .
46015024	Then the end comes , when he will deliver up the kingdom to God , even the Father ; when he will have abolished all rule and all authority and power .
46015025	For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet .
46015026	The last enemy that will be abolished is death .
46015027	For , " He put all things in subjection under his feet . " But when he says , " All things are put in subjection , " it is evident that he is excepted who subjected all things to him .
46015028	When all things have been subjected to him , then the Son will also himself be subjected to him who subjected all things to him , that God may be all in all .
46015029	Or else what will they do who are baptized for the dead ? If the dead aren't raised at all , why then are they baptized for the dead ?
46015030	Why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour ?
46015031	I die daily , by your boasting which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord .
46015032	If I fought with animals at Ephesus like men , what does it profit me ? If the dead are not raised , then " let us eat and drink , for tomorrow we die . "
46015033	Don't be deceived ! " Evil companionships corrupt good morals . "
46015034	Wake up righteously , and don't sin , for some have no knowledge of God . I say this to your shame .
46015035	But some one will say , " How are the dead raised ? " and , " With what kind of body do they come ? "
46015036	You foolish one , that which you yourself sow is not made alive unless it dies .
46015037	That which you sow , you don't sow the body that will be , but a bare grain , maybe of wheat , or of some other kind .
46015038	But God gives it a body even as it pleased him , and to each seed a body of its own .
46015039	All flesh is not the same flesh , but there is one flesh of men , another flesh of animals , another of fish , and another of birds .
46015040	There are also celestial bodies , and terrestrial bodies ; but the glory of the celestial differs from that of the terrestrial .
46015041	There is one glory of the sun , another glory of the moon , and another glory of the stars ; for one star differs from another star in glory .
46015042	So also is the resurrection of the dead . It is sown in corruption ; it is raised in incorruption .
46015043	It is sown in dishonor ; it is raised in glory . It is sown in weakness ; it is raised in power .
46015044	It is sown a natural body ; it is raised a spiritual body . If there is a natural body , there is also a spiritual body .
46015045	So also it is written , " The first man , Adam , became a living soul . " The last Adam became a life-giving spirit .
46015046	However that which is spiritual isn't first , but that which is natural , then that which is spiritual .
46015047	The first man is of the earth , made of dust . The second man is the Lord from heaven .
46015048	As is the one made of dust , such are those who are also made of dust ; and as is the heavenly , such are they also that are heavenly .
46015049	As we have borne the image of those made of dust , let's also bear the image of the heavenly .
46015050	Now I say this , brothers , that flesh and blood can't inherit the kingdom of God ; neither does corruption inherit incorruption .
46015051	Behold , I tell you a mystery . We will not all sleep , but we will all be changed ,
46015052	in a moment , in the twinkling of an eye , at the last trumpet . For the trumpet will sound , and the dead will be raised incorruptible , and we will be changed .
46015053	For this corruptible must put on incorruption , and this mortal must put on immortality .
46015054	But when this corruptible will have put on incorruption , and this mortal will have put on immortality , then what is written will happen : " Death is swallowed up in victory . "
46015055	" Death , where is your sting ? Hades , where is your victory ? "
46015056	The sting of death is sin , and the power of sin is the law .
46015057	But thanks be to God , who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ .
46015058	Therefore , my beloved brothers , be steadfast , immovable , always abounding in the Lord's work , because you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord .
46016001	Now concerning the collection for the saints , as I commanded the assemblies of Galatia , you do likewise .
46016002	On the first day of the week , let each one of you save , as he may prosper , that no collections be made when I come .
46016003	When I arrive , I will send whoever you approve with letters to carry your gracious gift to Jerusalem .
46016004	If it is appropriate for me to go also , they will go with me .
46016005	But I will come to you when I have passed through Macedonia , for I am passing through Macedonia .
46016006	But with you it may be that I will stay , or even winter , that you may send me on my journey wherever I go .
46016007	For I do not wish to see you now in passing , but I hope to stay a while with you , if the Lord permits .
46016008	But I will stay at Ephesus until Pentecost ,
46016009	for a great and effective door has opened to me , and there are many adversaries .
46016010	Now if Timothy comes , see that he is with you without fear , for he does the work of the Lord , as I also do .
46016011	Therefore let no one despise him . But set him forward on his journey in peace , that he may come to me ; for I expect him with the brothers .
46016012	But concerning Apollos , the brother , I begged him much to come to you with the brothers ; and it was not all his desire to come now ; but he will come when he has an opportunity .
46016013	Watch ! Stand firm in the faith ! Be men ! Be strong !
46016014	Let all that you do be done in love .
46016015	Now I beg you , brothers ( you know the house of Stephanas , that it is the first fruits of Achaia , and that they have set themselves to minister to the saints ) ,
46016016	that you also be in subjection to such , and to everyone who helps in the work and labors .
46016017	I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas , Fortunatus , and Achaicus ; for that which was lacking on your part , they supplied .
46016018	For they refreshed my spirit and yours . Therefore acknowledge those who are like that .
46016019	The assemblies of Asia greet you . Aquila and Priscilla greet you much in the Lord , together with the assembly that is in their house .
46016020	All the brothers greet you . Greet one another with a holy kiss .
46016021	This greeting is by me , Paul , with my own hand .
46016022	If any man doesn't love the Lord Jesus Christ , let him be accursed . Come , Lord !
46016023	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you .
46016024	My love to all of you in Christ Jesus . Amen .
47001001	Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God , and Timothy our brother , to the assembly of God which is at Corinth , with all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia :
47001002	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
47001003	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of mercies and God of all comfort ;
47001004	who comforts us in all our affliction , that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction , through the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God .
47001005	For as the sufferings of Christ abound to us , even so our comfort also abounds through Christ .
47001006	But if we are afflicted , it is for your comfort and salvation . If we are comforted , it is for your comfort , which works in the patient enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer .
47001007	Our hope for you is steadfast , knowing that , since you are partakers of the sufferings , so also are you of the comfort .
47001008	For we don't desire to have you uninformed , brothers , concerning our affliction which happened to us in Asia , that we were weighed down exceedingly , beyond our power , so much that we despaired even of life .
47001009	Yes , we ourselves have had the sentence of death within ourselves , that we should not trust in ourselves , but in God who raises the dead ,
47001010	who delivered us out of so great a death , and does deliver ; on whom we have set our hope that he will also still deliver us ;
47001011	you also helping together on our behalf by your supplication ; that , for the gift bestowed on us by means of many , thanks may be given by many persons on your behalf .
47001012	For our boasting is this : the testimony of our conscience , that in holiness and sincerity of God , not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God we behaved ourselves in the world , and more abundantly toward you .
47001013	For we write no other things to you , than what you read or even acknowledge , and I hope you will acknowledge to the end ;
47001014	as also you acknowledged us in part , that we are your boasting , even as you also are ours , in the day of our Lord Jesus .
47001015	In this confidence , I was determined to come first to you , that you might have a second benefit ;
47001016	and by you to pass into Macedonia , and again from Macedonia to come to you , and to be sent forward by you on my journey to Judea .
47001017	When I therefore was thus determined , did I show fickleness ? Or the things that I purpose , do I purpose according to the flesh , that with me there should be the " Yes , yes " and the " No , no ? "
47001018	But as God is faithful , our word toward you was not " Yes and no . "
47001019	For the Son of God , Jesus Christ , who was preached among you by us , by me , Silvanus , and Timothy , was not " Yes and no , " but in him is " Yes . "
47001020	For however many are the promises of God , in him is the " Yes . " Therefore also through him is the " Amen , " to the glory of God through us .
47001021	Now he who establishes us with you in Christ , and anointed us , is God ;
47001022	who also sealed us , and gave us the down payment of the Spirit in our hearts .
47001023	But I call God for a witness to my soul , that I didn't come to Corinth to spare you .
47001024	Not that we have lordship over your faith , but are fellow workers with you for your joy . For you stand firm in faith .
47002001	But I determined this for myself , that I would not come to you again in sorrow .
47002002	For if I make you sorry , then who will make me glad but he who is made sorry by me ?
47002003	And I wrote this very thing to you , so that , when I came , I wouldn't have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice ; having confidence in you all , that my joy is of you all .
47002004	For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears , not that you should be made sorry , but that you might know the love that I have so abundantly for you .
47002005	But if any has caused sorrow , he has caused sorrow , not to me , but in part ( that I not press too heavily ) to you all .
47002006	Sufficient to such a one is this punishment which was inflicted by the many ;
47002007	so that on the contrary you should rather forgive him and comfort him , lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his excessive sorrow .
47002008	Therefore I beg you to confirm your love toward him .
47002009	For to this end I also wrote , that I might know the proof of you , whether you are obedient in all things .
47002010	Now I also forgive whomever you forgive anything . For if indeed I have forgiven anything , I have forgiven that one for your sakes in the presence of Christ ,
47002011	that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan ; for we are not ignorant of his schemes .
47002012	Now when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ , and when a door was opened to me in the Lord ,
47002013	I had no relief for my spirit , because I didn't find Titus , my brother , but taking my leave of them , I went forth into Macedonia .
47002014	But thanks be to God , who always leads us in triumph in Christ , and reveals through us the sweet aroma of his knowledge in every place .
47002015	For we are a sweet aroma of Christ to God , in those who are saved , and in those who perish ;
47002016	to the one a stench from death to death ; to the other a sweet aroma from life to life . Who is sufficient for these things ?
47002017	For we are not as so many , peddling the word of God . But as of sincerity , but as of God , in the sight of God , we speak in Christ .
47003001	Are we beginning again to commend ourselves ? Or do we need , as do some , letters of commendation to you or from you ?
47003002	You are our letter , written in our hearts , known and read by all men ;
47003003	being revealed that you are a letter of Christ , ministered by us , written not with ink , but with the Spirit of the living God ; not in tablets of stone , but in tablets that are hearts of flesh .
47003004	Such confidence we have through Christ toward God ;
47003005	not that we are sufficient of ourselves , to account anything as from ourselves ; but our sufficiency is from God ;
47003006	who also made us sufficient as servants of a new covenant ; not of the letter , but of the spirit . For the letter kills , but the spirit gives life .
47003007	But if the service of death , written engraved on stones , came with glory , so that the children of Israel could not look steadfastly on the face of Moses for the glory of his face ; which was passing away :
47003008	won't rather service of the spirit be rather with more glory ?
47003009	For if the service of condemnation has glory , much rather does the service of righteousness exceed in glory .
47003010	For most assuredly that which has been made glorious has not been made glorious in this respect , by reason of the glory that surpasses .
47003011	For if that which passes away was with glory , much more that which remains is in glory .
47003012	Having therefore such a hope , we use great boldness of speech ,
47003013	and not as Moses , who put a veil on his face , that the children of Israel wouldn't look steadfastly on the end of that which was passing away .
47003014	But their minds were hardened , for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remains , because in Christ in passes away .
47003015	But to this day , when Moses is read , a veil lies on their heart .
47003016	But whenever one turns to the Lord , the veil is taken away .
47003017	Now the Lord is the Spirita and where the Spirit of the Lord is , there is liberty .
47003018	But we all , with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord , are transformed into the same image from glory to glory , even as from the Lord , the Spirit .
47004001	Therefore seeing we have this ministry , even as we obtained mercy , we don't faint .
47004002	But we have renounced the hidden things of shame , not walking in craftiness , nor handling the word of God deceitfully ; but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God .
47004003	Even if our gospel is veiled , it is veiled in those who perish ;
47004004	in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving , that the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ , who is the image of God , should not dawn on them .
47004005	For we don't preach ourselves , but Christ Jesus as Lord , and ourselves as your servants for Jesus ' sake .
47004006	Seeing it is God who said , " Light will shine out of darkness , " who shined in our hearts , to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ .
47004007	But we have this treasure in earthen vessels , that the exceeding greatness of the power may be of God , and not from ourselves .
47004008	We are pressed on every side , yet not crushed ; perplexed , yet not to despair ;
47004009	pursued , yet not forsaken ; struck down , yet not destroyed ;
47004010	always carrying in the body the putting to death of the Lord Jesus , that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body .
47004011	For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus ' sake , that the life also of Jesus may be revealed in our mortal flesh .
47004012	So then death works in us , but life in you .
47004013	But having the same spirit of faith , according to that which is written , " I believed , and therefore I spoke . " We also believe , and therefore also we speak ;
47004014	knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus , and will present us with you .
47004015	For all things are for your sakes , that the grace , being multiplied through the many , may cause the thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God .
47004016	Therefore we don't faint , but though our outward man is decaying , yet our inward man is renewed day by day .
47004017	For our light affliction , which is for the moment , works for us more and more exceedingly an eternal weight of glory ;
47004018	while we don't look at the things which are seen , but at the things which are not seen . For the things which are seen are temporal , but the things which are not seen are eternal .
47005001	For we know that if the earthly house of our tent is dissolved , we have a building from God , a house not made with hands , eternal , in the heavens .
47005002	For most assuredly in this we groan , longing to be clothed with our habitation which is from heaven ;
47005003	if so be that being clothed we will not be found naked .
47005004	For indeed we who are in this tent do groan , being burdened ; not that we desire to be unclothed , but that we desire to be clothed , that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life .
47005005	Now he who made us for this very thing is God , who also gave to us the down payment of the Spirit .
47005006	Being therefore always of good courage , and knowing that , while we are at home in the body , we are absent from the Lord ;
47005007	for we walk by faith , not by sight .
47005008	We are of good courage , I say , and are willing rather to be absent from the body , and to be at home with the Lord .
47005009	Therefore also we make it our aim , whether at home or absent , to be well pleasing to him .
47005010	For we must all be revealed before the judgment seat of Christ ; that each one may receive the things in the body , according to what he has done , whether good or bad .
47005011	Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord , we persuade men , but we are revealed to God ; and I hope that we are revealed also in your consciences .
47005012	For we are not commending ourselves to you again , but speak as giving you occasion of boasting on our behalf , that you may have something to answer those who boast in appearance , and not in heart .
47005013	For if we are beside ourselves , it is for God . Or if we are of sober mind , it is for you .
47005014	For the love of Christ constrains us ; because we judge thus , that one died for all , therefore all died .
47005015	He died for all , that those who live should no longer live to themselves , but to him who for their sakes died and rose again .
47005016	Therefore we know no one after the flesh from now on . Even though we have known Christ after the flesh , yet now we know him so no more .
47005017	Therefore if anyone is in Christ , he is a new creation . The old things have passed away . Behold , they have become new .
47005018	But all things are of God , who reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ , and gave to us the ministry of reconciliation ;
47005019	namely , that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself , not reckoning to them their trespasses , and having committed to us the word of reconciliation .
47005020	We are therefore ambassadors on behalf of Christ , as though God were entreating by us . We beg you on behalf of Christ , be reconciled to God .
47005021	For him who knew no sin he made to be sin on our behalf ; so that in him we might become the righteousness of God .
47006001	Working together , we entreat also that you not receive the grace of God in vain ,
47006002	for he says , " At an acceptable time I listened to you , In a day of salvation I helped you . " Behold , now is the acceptable time . Behold , now is the day of salvation .
47006003	We give no occasion of stumbling in anything , that our service may not be blamed ,
47006004	but in everything commending ourselves , as servants of God , in great endurance , in afflictions , in hardships , in distresses ,
47006005	in beatings , in imprisonments , in riots , in labors , in watchings , in fastings ;
47006006	in pureness , in knowledge , in patience , in kindness , in the Holy Spirit , in sincere love ,
47006007	in the word of truth , in the power of God ; by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left ,
47006008	by glory and dishonor , by evil report and good report ; as deceivers , and yet true ;
47006009	as unknown , and yet well known ; as dying , and behold , we live ; as punished , and not killed ;
47006010	as sorrowful , yet always rejoicing ; as poor , yet making many rich ; as having nothing , and yet possessing all things .
47006011	Our mouth is open to you , Corinthians . Our heart is enlarged .
47006012	You are not restricted by us , but you are restricted by your own affections .
47006013	Now in return , I speak as to my children , you also be enlarged .
47006014	Don't be unequally yoked with unbelievers , for what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity ? Or what communion has light with darkness ?
47006015	What agreement has Christ with Belial ? Or what portion has a believer with an unbeliever ?
47006016	What agreement has a temple of God with idols ? For you are a temple of the living God . Even as God said , " I will dwell in them , and walk in them ; and I will be their God , and they will be my people . "
47006017	Therefore , " ' Come out from among them , And be separate , ' says the Lord , ' Touch no unclean thing . I will receive you .
47006018	I will be to you a Father . You will be to me sons and daughters , ' says the Lord Almighty . "
47007001	Having therefore these promises , beloved , let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit , perfecting holiness in the fear of God .
47007002	Open your hearts to us . We wronged no one . We corrupted no one . We took advantage of no one .
47007003	I say this not to condemn you , for I have said before , that you are in our hearts to die together and live together .
47007004	Great is my boldness of speech toward you . Great is my boasting on your behalf . I am filled with comfort . I overflow with joy in all our affliction .
47007005	For even when we had come into Macedonia , our flesh had no relief , but we were afflicted on every side . Fightings were outside . Fear was inside .
47007006	Nevertheless , he who comforts the lowly , God , comforted us by the coming of Titus ;
47007007	and not by his coming only , but also by the comfort with which he was comforted in you , while he told us your longing , your mourning , and your zeal for me ; so that I rejoiced still more .
47007008	For though I made you sorry with my letter , I do not regret it , though I did regret it . For I see that my letter made you sorry , though just for a while .
47007009	I now rejoice , not that you were made sorry , but that you were made sorry to repentance . For you were made sorry in a Godly way , that you might suffer loss by us in nothing .
47007010	For Godly sorrow works repentance to salvation , which brings no regret . But the sorrow of the world works death .
47007011	For behold , this same thing , that you were made sorry in a godly way , what earnest care it worked in you . Yes , what defense , indignation , fear , longing , zeal , and vengeance ! In everything you demonstrated yourselves to be pure in the matter .
47007012	So although I wrote to you , I wrote not for his cause that did the wrong , nor for his cause that suffered the wrong , but that your earnest care for us might be revealed in you in the sight of God .
47007013	Therefore we have been comforted . In our comfort we rejoiced the more exceedingly for the joy of Titus , because his spirit has been refreshed by you all .
47007014	For if in anything I have boasted to him on your behalf , I was not put to shame . But as we spoke all things to you in truth , so our glorying also which I made before Titus was found to be truth .
47007015	His affection is more abundantly toward you , while he remembers all of your obedience , how with fear and trembling you received him .
47007016	I rejoice that in everything I am of good courage concerning you .
47008001	Moreover , brothers , we make known to you the grace of God which has been given in the assemblies of Macedonia ;
47008002	how that in much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality .
47008003	For according to their power , I testify , yes and beyond their power , they gave of their own accord ,
47008004	begging us with much entreaty in regard to this grace and the fellowship in the service to the saints .
47008005	This was not as we had hoped , but first they gave their own selves to the Lord , and to us through the will of God .
47008006	Insomuch that we exhorted Titus , that as he made a beginning before , so he would also complete in you this grace .
47008007	But as you abound in everything , in faith , utterance , knowledge , all earnestness , and in your love to us , see that you also abound in this grace .
47008008	I speak not by way of commandment , but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity also of your love .
47008009	For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , that , though he was rich , yet for your sakes he became poor , that you through his poverty might become rich .
47008010	I give a judgment in this : for this is expedient for you , who were the first to start a year ago , not only to do , but also to be willing .
47008011	But now complete the doing also , that as there was the readiness to be willing , so there may be the completion also out of your ability .
47008012	For if the readiness is there , it is acceptable according to what you have , not according to what you don't have .
47008013	For this is not that others may be eased and you distressed ,
47008014	but for equality . Your abundance at this present time supplies their lack , that their abundance also may become a supply for your lack ; that there may be equality .
47008015	As it is written , " He who gathered much had nothing left over , and he who gathered little had no lack . "
47008016	But thanks be to God , who puts the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus .
47008017	For he indeed accepted our exhortation , but being himself very earnest , he went forth to you of his own accord .
47008018	We have sent together with him the brother whose praise in the gospel is known through all the assemblies .
47008019	Not only so , but who was also appointed by the assemblies to travel with us in this grace , which is served by us to the glory of the Lord himself , and to show our readiness .
47008020	We are avoiding this , that any man should blame us in concerning this bounty which is served by us .
47008021	Having regard for honorable things , not only in the sight of the Lord , but also in the sight of men .
47008022	We have sent with them our brother , whom we have many times proved earnest in many things , but now much more earnest , by reason of the great confidence which he has in you .
47008023	As for Titus , he is my partner and fellow worker toward you . As for our brothers , they are the messengers of the assemblies , the glory of Christ .
47008024	Therefore show the proof of your love to them in front of the assemblies , and of our boasting on your behalf .
47009001	It is indeed unnecessary for me to write to you concerning the service to the saints ,
47009002	for I know your readiness , of which I boast on your behalf to them of Macedonia , that Achaia has been prepared for a year past . Your zeal has stirred up very many of them .
47009003	But I have sent the brothers , that our glorying on your behalf may not be made void in this respect , that , even as I said , you may be prepared ,
47009004	so that I won't by any means , if there come with me any of Macedonia and find you unprepared , we ( to say nothing of you ) should be put to shame in this confident boasting .
47009005	I thought it necessary therefore to entreat the brothers that they would go before to you , and arrange ahead of time the generous gift that you promised before , that the same might be ready as a matter of generosity , and not of greediness .
47009006	Remember this : he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly . He who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully .
47009007	Let each man give according as he has determined in his heart ; not grudgingly , or under compulsion ; for God loves a cheerful giver .
47009008	God is able to make all grace abound to you , that you , always having all sufficiency in everything , may abound to every good work .
47009009	As it is written , " He has scattered abroad , he has given to the poor . His righteousness remains forever . "
47009010	Now may he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food , supply and multiply your seed for sowing , and increase the fruits of your righteousness ;
47009011	you being enriched in everything to all liberality , which works through us thanksgiving to God .
47009012	For this service of giving that you perform not only makes up for lack among the saints , but abounds also through many givings of thanks to God ;
47009013	seeing that through the proof given by this service , they glorify God for the obedience of your confession to the gospel of Christ , and for the liberality of your contribution to them and to all ;
47009014	while they themselves also , with supplication on your behalf , yearn for you by reason of the exceeding grace of God in you .
47009015	Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift !
47010001	Now I Paul , myself , entreat you by the humility and gentleness of Christ ; I who in your presence am lowly among you , but being absent am of good courage toward you .
47010002	Yes , I beg you , that I may not , when present , show courage with the confidence with which I count to be bold against some , who count of us as if we walked according to the flesh .
47010003	For though we walk in the flesh , we don't wage war according to the flesh ;
47010004	for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh , but mighty before God to the throwing down of strongholds ,
47010005	throwing down imaginations and every high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of God , and bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ ;
47010006	and being in readiness to avenge all disobedience , when your obedience will be made full .
47010007	Do you look at things only as they appear in front of your face ? If anyone trusts in himself that he is Christ's , let him consider this again with himself , that , even as he is Christ's , so also we are Christ's .
47010008	For though I should boast somewhat abundantly concerning our authority , ( which the Lord gave for building you up , and not for casting you down ) I will not be put to shame ,
47010009	that I may not seem as if I desire to terrify you by my letters .
47010010	For , " His letters , " they say , " are weighty and strong , but his bodily presence is weak , and his speech is despised .
47010011	Let such a person consider this , that what we are in word by letters when we are absent , such are we also in deed when we are present .
47010012	For we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves . But they themselves , measuring themselves by themselves , and comparing themselves with themselves , are without understanding .
47010013	But we will not boast beyond proper limits , but within the boundaries with which God appointed to us , which reach even to you .
47010014	For we don't stretch ourselves too much , as though we didn't reach to you . For we came even as far as to you in the gospel of Christ ,
47010015	not boasting beyond proper limits in other men's labors , but having hope that as your faith grows , we will be magnified in you according to our boundaries to abundance ,
47010016	so as to preach the gospel even to the parts beyond you , not to boast in what someone else has already done .
47010017	But " he who boasts , let him boast in the Lord . "
47010018	For it isn't he who commends himself who is approved , but whom the Lord commends .
47011001	I wish that you would bear with me in a little foolishness , but indeed you do bear with me .
47011002	For I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy . For I married you to one husband , that I might present you as a pure virgin to Christ .
47011003	But I am afraid that by any means , as the serpent deceived Eve in his craftiness , your minds might be corrupted from the simplicity that is toward Christ .
47011004	For if he who comes preaches another Jesus , whom we did not preach , or if you receive a different spirit , which you did not receive , or a different gospel , which you did not accept , you put up with that well enough .
47011005	For I reckon that I am not at all behind the very best apostles .
47011006	But though I am unskilled in speech , yet I am not unskilled in knowledge . No , in every way we have been revealed to you in all things .
47011007	Or did I commit a sin in humbling myself that you might be exalted , because I preached to you God's gospel for nothing ?
47011008	I robbed other assemblies , taking wages from them that I might serve you .
47011009	When I was present with you and was in need , I wasn't a burden on anyone , for the brothers , when they came from Macedonia , supplied the measure of my need . In everything I kept myself from being burdensome to you , and I will continue to do so .
47011010	As the truth of Christ is in me , no one will stop me from this boasting in the regions of Achaia .
47011011	Why ? Because I don't love you ? God knows .
47011012	But what I do , that I will do , that I may cut off occasion from them that desire an occasion , that in which they boast , they may be found even as we .
47011013	For such men are false apostles , deceitful workers , masquerading as Christ's apostles .
47011014	No wonder , for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light .
47011015	It is no great thing therefore if his ministers also masquerade as servants of righteousness , whose end will be according to their works .
47011016	I say again , let no one think me foolish . But if so , yet receive me as foolish , that I also may boast a little .
47011017	That which I speak , I don't speak after the Lord , but as in foolishness , in this confidence of boasting .
47011018	Seeing that many boast after the flesh , I will also boast .
47011019	For you bear with the foolish gladly , being wise .
47011020	For you bear with a man , if he brings you into bondage , if he devours you , if he takes you captive , if he exalts himself , if he strikes you on the face .
47011021	I speak by way of disparagement , as though we had been weak . Yet however any is bold ( I speak in foolishness ) , I am bold also .
47011022	Are they Hebrews ? So am I . Are they Israelites ? So am I . Are they the seed of Abraham ? So am I .
47011023	Are they servants of Christ ? ( I speak as one beside himself ) I am more so ; in labors more abundantly , in prisons more abundantly , in stripes above measure , in deaths often .
47011024	Five times from the Jews I received forty stripes minus one .
47011025	Three times I was beaten with rods . Once I was stoned . Three times I suffered shipwreck . I have been a night and a day in the deep .
47011026	I have been in travels often , perils of rivers , perils of robbers , perils from my countrymen , perils from the Gentiles , perils in the city , perils in the wilderness , perils in the sea , perils among false brothers ;
47011027	labor and travail , in watchings often , in hunger and thirst , in fastings often , and in cold and nakedness .
47011028	Besides those things that are outside , there is that which presses on me daily , anxiety for all the assemblies .
47011029	Who is weak , and I am not weak ? Who is caused to stumble , and I don't burn ?
47011030	If I must boast , I will boast of the things that concern my weakness .
47011031	The God and Father of the Lord Jesus , he who is blessed forevermore , knows that I don't lie .
47011032	In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king guarded the city of the Damascenes in order to take me .
47011033	Through a window I was let down in a basket by the wall , and escaped his hands .
47012001	It is doubtless not profitable for me to boast . I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord .
47012002	I know a man in Christ , fourteen years ago ( whether in the body , I don't know , or whether out of the body , I don't know ; God knows ) , such a one caught up into the third heaven .
47012003	I know such a man ( whether in the body , or apart from the body , I don't know ; God knows ) ,
47012004	how he was caught up into Paradise , and heard unspeakable words , which it is not lawful for a man to utter .
47012005	On behalf of such a one I will boast , but on my own behalf I will not boast , except in my weaknesses .
47012006	For if I would desire to boast , I will not be foolish ; for I will speak the truth . But I forbear , so that no man may account of me above that which he sees in me , or hears from me .
47012007	By reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations , that I should not be exalted excessively , there was given to me a thorn in the flesh , a messenger of Satan to buffet me , that I should not be exalted excessively .
47012008	Concerning this thing , I begged the Lord three times that it might depart from me .
47012009	He has said to me , " My grace is sufficient for you , for my power is made perfect in weakness . " Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my weaknesses , that the power of Christ may rest on me .
47012010	Therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses , in injuries , in necessities , in persecutions , in distresses , for Christ's sake . For when I am weak , then am I strong .
47012011	I have become foolish . You compelled me , for I ought to have been commended by you , for in nothing was I behind the very best apostles , though I am nothing .
47012012	Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all patience , by signs and wonders and mighty works .
47012013	For what is there in which you were made inferior to the rest of the assemblies , unless it is that I myself was not a burden to you ? Forgive me this wrong .
47012014	Behold , this is the third time I am ready to come to you , and I will not be a burden to you ; for I seek not your possessions , but you . For the children ought not to save up for the parents , but the parents for the children .
47012015	I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls . If I love you more abundantly , am I loved the less ?
47012016	But be it so , I did not myself burden you . But , being crafty , I caught you with deception .
47012017	Did I take advantage of you by anyone of them whom I have sent to you ?
47012018	I exhorted Titus , and I sent the brother with him . Did Titus take any advantage of you ? Didn't we walk in the same spirit ? Didn't we walk in the same steps ?
47012019	Again , do you think that we are excusing ourselves to you ? In the sight of God we speak in Christ . But all things , beloved , are for your edifying .
47012020	For I am afraid that by any means , when I come , I might find you not the way I want to , and that I might be found by you as you don't desire ; that by any means there would be strife , jealousy , outbursts of anger , factions , slander , whisperings , proud thoughts , riots ;
47012021	that again when I come my God would humble me before you , and I would mourn for many of those who have sinned before now , and not repented of the uncleanness and sexual immorality and lustfulness which they committed .
47013001	This is the third time I am coming to you . " At the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word established . "
47013002	I have said beforehand , and I do say beforehand , as when I was present the second time , so now , being absent , I write to those who have sinned before now , and to all the rest , that , if I come again , I will not spare ;
47013003	seeing that you seek a proof of Christ that speaks in me ; who toward you is not weak , but is powerful in you .
47013004	For he was crucified through weakness , yet he lives through the power of God . For we also are weak in him , but we will live with him through the power of God toward you .
47013005	Test your own selves , whether you are in the faith . Test your own selves . Or don't you know as to your own selves , that Jesus Christ is in you ? Unless indeed you are reprobate .
47013006	But I hope that you will know that we aren't reprobate .
47013007	Now I pray to God that you do no evil ; not that we may appear approved , but that you may do that which is honorable , though we are as reprobate .
47013008	For we can do nothing against the truth , but for the truth .
47013009	For we rejoice when we are weak and you are strong . This we also pray for , even your perfecting .
47013010	For this cause I write these things while absent , that I may not deal sharply when present , according to the authority which the Lord gave me for building up , and not for tearing down .
47013011	Finally , brothers , rejoice . Be perfected , be comforted , be of the same mind , live in peace , and the God of love and peace will be with you .
47013012	Greet one another with a holy kiss .
47013013	All the saints greet you .
47013014	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ , the love of God , and the communion of the Holy Spirit , be with you all .
48001001	Paul , an apostle ( not from men , neither through man , but through Jesus Christ , and God the Father , who raised him from the dead ) ,
48001002	and all the brothers who are with me , to the assemblies of Galatia :
48001003	Grace to you and peace from God the Father , and our Lord Jesus Christ ,
48001004	who gave himself for our sins , that he might deliver us out of this present evil age , according to the will of our God and Father - -
48001005	to whom be the glory forever and ever . Amen .
48001006	I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ to a different gospel ;
48001007	and there isn't another gospel . Only there are some who trouble you , and want to pervert the gospel of Christ .
48001008	But even though we , or an angel from heaven , should preach to you any gospel other than that which we preached to you , let him be cursed .
48001009	As we have said before , so I now say again : if any man preaches to you any gospel other than that which you received , let him be cursed .
48001010	For am I now seeking the favor of men , or of God ? Or am I striving to please men ? For if I were still pleasing men , I wouldn't be a servant of Christ .
48001011	But I make known to you , brothers , concerning the gospel which was preached by me , that it is not according to man .
48001012	For neither did I receive it from man , nor was I taught it , but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ .
48001013	For you have heard of my way of living in time past in the Jews ' religion , how that beyond measure I persecuted the assembly of God , and ravaged it .
48001014	I advanced in the Jews ' religion beyond many of my own age among my countrymen , being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers .
48001015	But when it was the good pleasure of God , who separated me from my mother's womb , and called me through his grace ,
48001016	to reveal his Son in me , that I might preach him among the Gentiles , I didn't immediately confer with flesh and blood ,
48001017	nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me , but I went away into Arabia . Then I returned to Damascus .
48001018	Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter , and stayed with him fifteen days .
48001019	But of the other apostles I saw no one , except James , the Lord's brother .
48001020	Now about the things which I write to you , behold , before God , I'm not lying .
48001021	Then I came to the regions of Syria and Cilicia .
48001022	I was still unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea which were in Christ ,
48001023	but they only heard : " He who once persecuted us now preaches the faith that he once tried to destroy . "
48001024	They glorified God in me .
48002001	Then after a period of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas , taking Titus also with me .
48002002	I went up by revelation , and I laid before them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles , but privately before those who were respected , for fear that I might be running , or had run , in vain .
48002003	But not even Titus , who was with me , being a Greek , was compelled to be circumcised .
48002004	This was because of the false brothers secretly brought in , who stole in to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus , that they might bring us into bondage ;
48002005	to whom we gave no place in the way of subjection , not for an hour , that the truth of the gospel might continue with you .
48002006	But from those who were reputed to be important ( whatever they were , it makes no difference to me ; God doesn't show partiality to man ) - - they , I say , who were respected imparted nothing to me ,
48002007	but to the contrary , when they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel for the uncircumcision , even as Peter with the gospel for the circumcision
48002008	( for he who appointed Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision appointed me also to the Gentiles ) ;
48002009	and when they perceived the grace that was given to me , James and Cephas and John , they who were reputed to be pillars , gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship , that we should go to the Gentiles , and they to the circumcision .
48002010	They only asked us to remember the poor - - which very thing I was also zealous to do .
48002011	But when Peter came to Antioch , I resisted him to the face , because he stood condemned .
48002012	For before some people came from James , he ate with the Gentiles . But when they came , he drew back and separated himself , fearing those who were of the circumcision .
48002013	The rest of the Jews joined him in his hypocrisy ; so much that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy .
48002014	But when I saw that they didn't walk uprightly according to the truth of the gospel , I said to Cephas before them all , " If you , being a Jew , live as the Gentiles do , and not as the Jews do , why do you compel the Gentiles to live as the Jews do ?
48002015	" We , being Jews by nature , and not Gentile sinners ,
48002016	yet knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but through the faith of Jesus Christ , even we believed in Christ Jesus , that we might be justified by faith in Christ , and not by the works of the law , because no flesh will be justified by the works of the law .
48002017	But if , while we sought to be justified in Christ , we ourselves also were found sinners , is Christ a servant of sin ? God forbid !
48002018	For if I build up again those things which I destroyed , I prove myself a law-breaker .
48002019	For I , through the law , died to the law , that I might live to God .
48002020	I have been crucified with Christ , and it is no longer I that live , but Christ living in me . That life which I now live in the flesh , I live by faith in the Son of God , who loved me , and gave himself up for me .
48002021	I don't make void the grace of God . For if righteousness is through the law , then Christ died for nothing ! "
48003001	Foolish Galatians , who has bewitched you not to obey the truth , before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly set forth among you as crucified ?
48003002	I just want to learn this from you . Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law , or by hearing of faith ?
48003003	Are you so foolish ? Having begun in the Spirit , are you now completed in the flesh ?
48003004	Did you suffer so many things in vain , if it is indeed in vain ?
48003005	He therefore that supplies the Spirit to you , and works miracles among you , does he do it by the works of the law , or by hearing of faith ?
48003006	Even as Abraham " believed God , and it was counted to him for righteousness . "
48003007	Know therefore that those who are of faith , the same are sons of Abraham .
48003008	The scripture , foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith , preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham , saying , " In you will all the nations be blessed . "
48003009	So then , those who are of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham .
48003010	For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse . For it is written , " Cursed is everyone who doesn't continue in all things that are written in the book of the law , to do them . "
48003011	Now that no man is justified by the law before God is evident , for , " The righteous will live by faith . "
48003012	The law is not of faith , but , " He that does them will live in them . "
48003013	Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law , having become a curse for us . For it is written , " Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree , "
48003014	that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Christ Jesus ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith .
48003015	Brothers , I speak like men . Though it is only a man's covenant , yet when it has been confirmed , no one makes it void , or adds to it .
48003016	Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed . He doesn't say , " To seeds , " as of many , but as of one , " To your seed , " which is Christ .
48003017	Now I say this . A covenant confirmed beforehand by God in Christ , the law , which came four hundred and thirty years after , does not annul , so as to make the promise of no effect .
48003018	For if the inheritance is of the law , it is no more of promise ; but God has granted it to Abraham by promise .
48003019	What then is the law ? It was added because of transgressions , until the seed should come to whom the promise has been made . It was ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator .
48003020	Now a mediator is not between one , but God is one .
48003021	Is the law then against the promises of God ? Certainly not ! For if there had been a law given which could make alive , most assuredly righteousness would have been of the law .
48003022	But the scriptures shut up all things under sin , that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe .
48003023	But before faith came , we were kept in custody under the law , shut up to the faith which should afterwards be revealed .
48003024	So that the law has become our tutor to bring us to Christ , that we might be justified by faith .
48003025	But now that faith is come , we are no longer under a tutor .
48003026	For you are all sons of God , through faith in Christ Jesus .
48003027	For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ .
48003028	There is neither Jew nor Greek , there is neither slave nor free man , there is neither male nor female ; for you are all one in Christ Jesus .
48003029	If you are Christ's , then you are Abraham's seed , heirs according to promise .
48004001	But I say that so long as the heir is a child , he is no different from a bondservant , though he is lord of all ;
48004002	but is under guardians and stewards until the day appointed by the father .
48004003	So we also , when we were children , were held in bondage under the elements of the world .
48004004	But when the fullness of the time came , God sent forth his Son , born to a woman , born under the law ,
48004005	that he might redeem those who were under the law , that we might receive the adoption of sons .
48004006	Because you are sons , God sent forth the Spirit of his Son into our hearts , crying , " Abba ! Father ! "
48004007	So you are no longer a bondservant , but a son ; and if a son , then an heir of God through Christ .
48004008	However at that time , not knowing God , you were in bondage to those who by nature are no gods .
48004009	But now that you have come to know God , or rather to be known by God , why do you turn back again to the weak and miserable elements , to which you desire to be in bondage all over again ?
48004010	You observe days , months , seasons , and years .
48004011	I am afraid for you , that I might have wasted my labor for you .
48004012	I beg you , brothers , become as I am , for I also have become as you are . You did me no wrong ,
48004013	but you know that because of weakness of the flesh I preached the gospel to you the first time .
48004014	That which was a temptation to you in my flesh , you didn't despise nor reject ; but you received me as an angel of God , even as Christ Jesus .
48004015	What has become of the blessing you enjoyed ? For I testify to you that , if possible , you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me .
48004016	So then , have I become your enemy by telling you the truth ?
48004017	They zealously seek you in no good way . No , they desire to alienate you , that you may seek them .
48004018	But it is always good to be zealous in a good cause , and not only when I am present with you .
48004019	My little children , of whom I am again in travail until Christ is formed in you - -
48004020	but I could wish to be present with you now , and to change my tone , for I am perplexed about you .
48004021	Tell me , you that desire to be under the law , don't you listen to the law ?
48004022	For it is written that Abraham had two sons , one by the handmaid , and one by the free woman .
48004023	However , the son by the handmaid was born according to the flesh , but the son by the free woman was born through promise .
48004024	These things contain an allegory , for these are two covenants . One is from Mount Sinai , bearing children to bondage , which is Hagar .
48004025	Now this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia , and answers to the Jerusalem that exists now , for she is in bondage with her children .
48004026	But the Jerusalem that is above is free , which is our mother .
48004027	For it is written , " Rejoice , you barren who don't bear . Break forth and shout , you that don't travail . For more are the children of the desolate than of her who has the husband . "
48004028	Now we , brothers , as Isaac was , are children of promise .
48004029	But as then , he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit , so also it is now .
48004030	However what does the scripture say ? " Throw out the handmaid and her son , for the son of the handmaid will not inherit with the son of the free woman . "
48004031	Therefore , brothers , we are not children of a handmaid , but of the free woman .
48005001	Stand firm therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free , and don't be entangled again with a yoke of bondage .
48005002	Behold , I , Paul , tell you that if you receive circumcision , Christ will profit you nothing .
48005003	Yes , I testify again to every man who receives circumcision , that he is a debtor to do the whole law .
48005004	You are alienated from Christ , you desire to be justified by the law . You have fallen away from grace .
48005005	For we , through the Spirit , by faith wait for the hope of righteousness .
48005006	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision amounts to anything , nor uncircumcision , but faith working through love .
48005007	You were running well ! Who interfered with you that you should not obey the truth ?
48005008	This persuasion is not from him who calls you .
48005009	A little yeast grows through the whole lump .
48005010	I have confidence toward you in the Lord that you will think no other way . But he who troubles you will bear his judgment , whoever he is .
48005011	But I , brothers , if I still preach circumcision , why am I still persecuted ? Then the stumbling-block of the cross has been removed .
48005012	I wish that those who disturb you would cut themselves off .
48005013	For you , brothers , were called for freedom . Only don't use your freedom for gain to the flesh , but through love be servants to one another .
48005014	For the whole law is fulfilled in one word , in this : " You shall love your neighbor as yourself . "
48005015	But if you bite and devour one another , be careful that you don't consume one another .
48005016	But I say , walk by the Spirit , and you won't fulfill the lust of the flesh .
48005017	For the flesh lusts against the Spirit , and the Spirit against the flesh ; for these are contrary the one to the other , that you may not do the things that you desire .
48005018	But if you are led by the Spirit , you are not under the law .
48005019	Now the works of the flesh are obvious , which are : adultery , sexual immorality , uncleanness , lustfulness ,
48005020	idolatry , sorcery , hatred , strife , jealousies , outbursts of anger , rivalries , divisions , heresies ,
48005021	envyings , murders , drunkenness , orgies , and things like these ; of which I forewarn you , even as I did forewarn you , that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God .
48005022	But the fruit of the Spirit is love , joy , peace , patience , kindness , goodness , faithfulness ,
48005023	gentleness , and self-control . Against such things there is no law .
48005024	Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts .
48005025	If we live by the Spirit , let's also walk by the Spirit .
48005026	Let's not become conceited , provoking one another , and envying one another .
48006001	Brothers , even if a man is caught in some fault , you who are spiritual must restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness ; looking to yourself so that you also aren't tempted .
48006002	Bear one another's burdens , and so fulfill the law of Christ .
48006003	For if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing , he deceives himself .
48006004	But let each man test his own work , and then he will take pride in himself and not in his neighbor .
48006005	For each man will bear his own burden .
48006006	But let him who is taught in the word share all good things with him who teaches .
48006007	Don't be deceived . God is not mocked , for whatever a man sows , that will he also reap .
48006008	For he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption . But he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life .
48006009	Let us not be weary in doing good , for we will reap in due season , if we don't give up .
48006010	So then , as we have opportunity , let us work that which is good toward all men , and especially toward those who are of the household of the faith .
48006011	See with what large letters I write to you with my own hand .
48006012	As many as desire to look good in the flesh , they compel you to be circumcised ; only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ .
48006013	For even they who receive circumcision don't keep the law themselves , but they desire to have you circumcised , that they may boast in your flesh .
48006014	But far be it from me to boast , except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ , through which the world has been crucified to me , and I to the world .
48006015	For neither is circumcision anything , nor uncircumcision , but a new creation .
48006016	As many as will walk by this rule , peace and mercy be on them , and on God's Israel .
48006017	From now on , let no one cause me any trouble , for I bear the marks of Jesus branded on my body .
48006018	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit , brothers . Amen .
49001001	Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God , to the saints who are at Ephesus , and the faithful in Christ Jesus :
49001002	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord , Jesus Christ .
49001003	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord , Jesus Christ , who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ ;
49001004	even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world , that we would be holy and without blemish before him in love ;
49001005	having predestined us for adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to himself , according to the good pleasure of his desire ,
49001006	to the praise of the glory of his grace , which he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved ,
49001007	in whom we have our redemption through his blood , the forgiveness of our trespasses , according to the riches of his grace ,
49001008	which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence ,
49001009	making known to us the mystery of his will , according to his good pleasure which he purposed in him
49001010	to an administration of the fullness of the times , to sum up all things in Christ , the things in the heavens , and the things on the earth , in him ;
49001011	in whom also we were made a heritage , having been foreordained according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his will ;
49001012	to the end that we should be to the praise of his glory , we who had before hoped in Christ :
49001013	in whom you also , having heard the word of the truth , the gospel of your salvation , - - in whom , having also believed , you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise ,
49001014	who is a pledge of our inheritance , to the redemption of God's own possession , to the praise of his glory .
49001015	For this cause I also , having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you , and the love which you have toward all the saints ,
49001016	don't cease to give thanks for you , making mention in my prayers ,
49001017	that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of glory , may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him ;
49001018	having the eyes of your hearts enlightened , that you may know what is the hope of his calling , what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints ,
49001019	and what is the exceeding greatness of his power toward us who believe , according to that working of the strength of his might
49001020	which he worked in Christ , when he raised him from the dead , and made him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly places ,
49001021	far above all rule , and authority , and power , and dominion , and every name that is named , not only in this world , but also in that which is to come .
49001022	He put all things in subjection under his feet , and gave him to be head over all things to the assembly ,
49001023	which is his body , the fullness of him who fills all in all .
49002001	You were made alive when you were dead through your trespasses and sins ,
49002002	in which you once walked according to the course of this world , according to the prince of the powers of the air , of the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience ;
49002003	among whom we also all once lived in the lust of our flesh , doing the desires of the flesh and of the mind , and were by nature children of wrath , even as the rest .
49002004	But God , being rich in mercy , for his great love with which he loved us ,
49002005	even when we were dead through our trespasses , made us alive together with Christ ( by grace have you been saved ) ,
49002006	and raised us up with him , and made us to sit with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus ,
49002007	that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus ;
49002008	for by grace you have been saved through faith , and that not of yourselves ; it is the gift of God ,
49002009	not of works , that no one would boast .
49002010	For we are his workmanship , created in Christ Jesus for good works , which God prepared before that we would walk in them .
49002011	Therefore remember that once you , the Gentiles in the flesh , who are called " uncircumcision " by that which is called " circumcision , " ( in the flesh , made by hands ) ;
49002012	that you were at that time separate from Christ , alienated from the commonwealth of Israel , and strangers from the covenants of the promise , having no hope and without God in the world .
49002013	But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off are made near in the blood of Christ .
49002014	For he is our peace , who made both one , and broke down the middle wall of partition ,
49002015	having abolished in the flesh the hostility , the law of commandments contained in ordinances , that he might create in himself one new man of the two , making peace ;
49002016	and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross , having killed the hostility thereby .
49002017	He came and preached peace to you who were far off , and peace to those who were near .
49002018	For through him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father .
49002019	So then you are no longer strangers and sojourners , but you are fellow citizens with the saints , and of the household of God ,
49002020	being built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets , Christ Jesus himself being the chief cornerstone ;
49002021	in whom the whole building , fitted together , grows into a holy temple in the Lord ;
49002022	in whom you also are built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit .
49003001	For this cause I , Paul , am the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles ,
49003002	if it is so that you have heard of the administration of that grace of God which was given me toward you ;
49003003	how that by revelation the mystery was made known to me , as I wrote before in few words ,
49003004	whereby , when you read , you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ ;
49003005	which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men , as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit ;
49003006	that the Gentiles are fellow heirs , and fellow members of the body , and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel ,
49003007	whereof I was made a servant , according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power .
49003008	To me , the very least of all saints , was this grace given , to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ ,
49003009	and to make all men see what is the administration of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God , who created all things through Jesus Christ ;
49003010	to the intent that now through the assembly the manifold wisdom of God might be made known to the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places ,
49003011	according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus , our Lord ;
49003012	in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through our faith in him .
49003013	Therefore I ask that you may not lose heart at my troubles for you , which are your glory .
49003014	For this cause , I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord , Jesus Christ ,
49003015	from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named ,
49003016	that he would grant you , according to the riches of his glory , that you may be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inward man ;
49003017	that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith ; to the end that you , being rooted and grounded in love ,
49003018	may be strengthened to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth ,
49003019	and to know Christ's love which surpasses knowledge , that you may be filled to all the fullness of God .
49003020	Now to him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think , according to the power that works in us ,
49003021	to him be the glory in the assembly and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever . Amen .
49004001	I therefore , the prisoner in the Lord , beg you to walk worthily of the calling with which you were called ,
49004002	with all lowliness and humility , with longsuffering , bearing with one another in love ;
49004003	being eager to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace .
49004004	There is one body , and one Spirit , even as you also were called in one hope of your calling ;
49004005	one Lord , one faith , one baptism ,
49004006	one God and Father of all , who is over all , and through all , and in us all .
49004007	But to each one of us was the grace given according to the measure of the gift of Christ .
49004008	Therefore he says , " When he ascended on high , he led captivity captive , and gave gifts to men . "
49004009	Now this , " He ascended , " what is it but that he also first descended into the lower parts of the earth ?
49004010	He who descended is the same also who ascended far above all the heavens , that he might fill all things .
49004011	He gave some to be apostles ; and some , prophets ; and some , evangelists ; and some , shepherds and teachers ;
49004012	for the perfecting of the saints , to the work of serving , to the building up of the body of Christ ;
49004013	until we all attain to the unity of the faith , and of the knowledge of the Son of God , to a full grown man , to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ ;
49004014	that we may no longer be children , tossed back and forth and carried about with every wind of doctrine , by the trickery of men , in craftiness , after the wiles of error ;
49004015	but speaking truth in love , we may grow up in all things into him , who is the head , Christ ;
49004016	from whom all the body , being fitted and knit together through that which every joint supplies , according to the working in measure of each individual part , makes the body increase to the building up of itself in love .
49004017	This I say therefore , and testify in the Lord , that you no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles also walk , in the vanity of their mind ,
49004018	being darkened in their understanding , alienated from the life of God , because of the ignorance that is in them , because of the hardening of their hearts ;
49004019	who having become callous gave themselves up to lust , to work all uncleanness with greediness .
49004020	But you did not learn Christ that way ;
49004021	if indeed you heard him , and were taught in him , even as truth is in Jesus :
49004022	that you put away , as concerning your former way of life , the old man , that grows corrupt after the lusts of deceit ;
49004023	and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind ,
49004024	and put on the new man , that like God has been created in righteousness and holiness of truth .
49004025	Therefore , putting away falsehood , speak truth each one with his neighbor . For we are members one of another .
49004026	" Be angry , and don't sin . " Don't let the sun go down on your wrath ,
49004027	neither give place to the devil .
49004028	Let him who stole steal no more ; but rather let him labor , working with his hands the thing that is good , that he may have something to give to him who has need .
49004029	Let no corrupt speech proceed out of your mouth , but such as is good for building up as the need may be , that it may give grace to those who hear .
49004030	Don't grieve the Holy Spirit of God , in whom you were sealed to the day of redemption .
49004031	Let all bitterness , wrath , anger , outcry , and slander , be put away from you , with all malice .
49004032	Be kind to one another , tenderhearted , forgiving each other , just as God also in Christ forgave you .
49005001	Be therefore imitators of God , as beloved children .
49005002	Walk in love , even as Christ also loved you , and gave himself up for us , an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling fragrance .
49005003	But sexual immorality , and all uncleanness , or covetousness , let it not even be mentioned among you , as becomes saints ;
49005004	nor filthiness , nor foolish talking , or jesting , which are not appropriate ; but rather giving of thanks .
49005005	Know this for sure , that no sexually immoral person , nor unclean person , nor covetous man , who is an idolater , has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God .
49005006	Let no man deceive you with empty words . For because of these things , the wrath of God comes on the sons of disobedience .
49005007	Don't be therefore partakers with them .
49005008	For you were once darkness , but are now light in the Lord . Walk as children of light ,
49005009	for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth ,
49005010	proving what is well-pleasing to the Lord .
49005011	Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness , but rather even reprove them .
49005012	For the things which are done by them in secret , it is a shame even to speak of .
49005013	But all things , when they are reproved , are revealed by the light , for everything that is revealed is light .
49005014	Therefore he says , " Awake , you who sleep , and arise from the dead , and Christ will shine on you . "
49005015	Therefore watch carefully how you walk , not as unwise , but as wise ;
49005016	redeeming the time , because the days are evil .
49005017	Therefore don't be foolish , but understand what the will of the Lord is .
49005018	Don't be drunken with wine , in which is an abandoned life , but be filled with the Spirit ,
49005019	speaking to one another in psalms , hymns , and spiritual songs ; singing , and singing praises in your heart to the Lord ;
49005020	giving thanks always for all things in the name of our Lord , Jesus Christ , to God , even the Father ;
49005021	subjecting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ .
49005022	Wives , be subject to your own husbands , as to the Lord .
49005023	For the husband is the head of the wife , and Christ also is the head of the assembly , being himself the savior of the body .
49005024	But as the assembly is subject to Christ , so let the wives also be to their husbands in everything .
49005025	Husbands , love your wives , even as Christ also loved the assembly , and gave himself up for it ;
49005026	that he might sanctify it , having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word ,
49005027	that he might present the assembly to himself gloriously , not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing ; but that it should be holy and without blemish .
49005028	Even so ought husbands also to love their own wives as their own bodies . He who loves his own wife loves himself .
49005029	For no man ever hated his own flesh ; but nourishes and cherishes it , even as Christ also the assembly ;
49005030	because we are members of his body , of his flesh and bones .
49005031	" For this cause a man will leave his father and mother , and will be joined to his wife . The two will become one flesh . "
49005032	This mystery is great , but I speak in regard of Christ and of the assembly .
49005033	Nevertheless each of you must also love his own wife even as himself ; and let the wife see that she respects her husband .
49006001	Children , obey your parents in the Lord , for this is right .
49006002	" Honor your father and mother , " which is the first commandment with a promise :
49006003	" that it may be well with you , and you may live long on the earth . "
49006004	You fathers , don't provoke your children to wrath , but nurture them in the discipline and instruction of the Lord .
49006005	Servants , be obedient to those who according to the flesh are your masters , with fear and trembling , in singleness of your heart , as to Christ ;
49006006	not in the way of service only when eyes are on you , as men-pleasers ; but as servants of Christ , doing the will of God from the heart ;
49006007	with good will doing service , as to the Lord , and not to men ;
49006008	knowing that whatever good thing each one does , he will receive the same again from the Lord , whether he is bound or free .
49006009	You masters , do the same things to them , and give up threatening , knowing that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven , and there is no partiality with him .
49006010	Finally , be strong in the Lord , and in the strength of his might .
49006011	Put on the whole armor of God , that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil .
49006012	For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood , but against the principalities , against the powers , against the world's rulers of the darkness of this age , and against the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places .
49006013	Therefore , put on the whole armor of God , that you may be able to withstand in the evil day , and , having done all , to stand .
49006014	Stand therefore , having the utility belt of truth buckled around your waist , and having put on the breastplate of righteousness ,
49006015	and having fitted your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace ;
49006016	above all , taking up the shield of faith , with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil one .
49006017	Take the helmet of salvation , and the sword of the Spirit , which is the word of God ;
49006018	with all prayer and requests , praying at all times in the Spirit , and being watchful to this end in all perseverance and requests for all the saints :
49006019	On my behalf , that utterance may be given to me in opening my mouth , to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel ,
49006020	for which I am an ambassador in chains ; that in it I may speak boldly , as I ought to speak .
49006021	But that you also may know my affairs , how I am doing , Tychicus , the beloved brother and faithful servant in the Lord , will make known to you all things ;
49006022	whom I have sent to you for this very purpose , that you may know our state , and that he may comfort your hearts .
49006023	Peace be to the brothers , and love with faith , from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
49006024	Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with incorruptible love .
50001001	Paul and Timothy , servants of Christ Jesus ; To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi , with the overseers and deacons :
50001002	Grace to you , and peace from God , our Father , and the Lord , Jesus Christ .
50001003	I thank my God whenever I remember you ,
50001004	always in every request of mine on behalf of you all making my requests with joy ,
50001005	for your fellowship in furtherance of the gospel from the first day until now ;
50001006	being confident of this very thing , that he who began a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ .
50001007	It is even right for me to think this way on behalf of all of you , because I have you in my heart , inasmuch as , both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel , you all are partakers with me of grace .
50001008	For God is my witness , how I long after all of you in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus .
50001009	This I pray , that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment ;
50001010	so that you may approve the things that are excellent ; that you may be sincere and without offense to the day of Christ ;
50001011	being filled with the fruits of righteousness , which are through Jesus Christ , to the glory and praise of God .
50001012	Now I desire to have you know , brothers , that the things which happened to me have turned out rather to the progress of the gospel ;
50001013	so that my bonds became revealed in Christ throughout the whole praetorian guard , and to all the rest ;
50001014	and that most of the brothers in the Lord , being confident through my bonds , are more abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear .
50001015	Some indeed preach Christ even out of envy and strife , and some also out of good will .
50001016	The former preach Christ from selfish ambition , not sincerely , thinking that they add affliction to my chains ;
50001017	but the latter out of love , knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel .
50001018	What does it matter ? Only that in every way , whether in pretense or in truth , Christ is proclaimed . I rejoice in this , yes , and will rejoice .
50001019	For I know that this will turn out to my salvation , through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ ,
50001020	according to my earnest expectation and hope , that I will in no way be put to shame , but with all boldness , as always , now also Christ will be magnified in my body , whether by life , or by death .
50001021	For to me to live is Christ , and to die is gain .
50001022	But if to live in the flesh , this will bring fruit from my work ; then I don't make known what I will choose .
50001023	But I am in a dilemma between the two , having the desire to depart and be with Christ , for that is very far better .
50001024	Yet , to remain in the flesh is more needful for your sake .
50001025	Having this confidence , I know that I will remain , yes , and remain with you all , for your progress and joy in the faith ,
50001026	that your rejoicing may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with you again .
50001027	Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ , that , whether I come and see you or am absent , I may hear of your state , that you stand firm in one spirit , with one soul striving for the faith of the gospel ;
50001028	and in nothing frightened by the adversaries , which is for them a proof of destruction , but to you of salvation , and that from God .
50001029	Because it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ , not only to believe in him , but also to suffer on his behalf ,
50001030	having the same conflict which you saw in me , and now hear is in me .
50002001	If there is therefore any exhortation in Christ , if any consolation of love , if any fellowship of the Spirit , if any tender mercies and compassion ,
50002002	make my joy full , that you be of the same mind , having the same love , being of one accord , of one mind ;
50002003	doing nothing through rivalry or through conceit , but in humility , each counting others better than himself ;
50002004	each of you not just looking to his own things , but each of you also to the things of others .
50002005	Have this in your mind , which was also in Christ Jesus ,
50002006	who , existing in the form of God , didn't consider it robbery to be equal with God ,
50002007	but emptied himself , taking the form of a servant , being made in the likeness of men .
50002008	Being found in human form , he humbled himself , becoming obedient to death , yes , the death of the cross .
50002009	Therefore God also highly exalted him , and gave to him the name which is above every name ;
50002010	that at the name of Jesus every knee would bow , of those in heaven , those on earth , and those under the earth ,
50002011	and that every tongue would confess that Jesus Christ is Lord , to the glory of God , the Father .
50002012	So then , my beloved , even as you have always obeyed , not only in my presence , but now much more in my absence , work out your own salvation with fear and trembling .
50002013	For it is God who works in you both to will and to work , for his good pleasure .
50002014	Do all things without murmurings and disputes ,
50002015	that you may become blameless and harmless , children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation , among whom you are seen as lights in the world ,
50002016	holding up the word of life ; that I may have something to boast in the day of Christ , that I didn't run in vain nor labor in vain .
50002017	Yes , and if I am poured out on the sacrifice and service of your faith , I rejoice , and rejoice with you all .
50002018	In the same way , you also rejoice , and rejoice with me .
50002019	But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon , that I also may be cheered up when I know how you are doing .
50002020	For I have no one else like-minded , who will truly care about you .
50002021	For they all seek their own , not the things of Jesus Christ .
50002022	But you know the proof of him , that , as a child serves a father , so he served with me in furtherance of the gospel .
50002023	Therefore I hope to send him at once , as soon as I see how it will go with me .
50002024	But I trust in the Lord that I myself also will come shortly .
50002025	But I counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus , my brother , fellow worker , fellow soldier , and your messenger and minister to my need ;
50002026	since he longed for you all , and was very troubled , because you had heard that he was sick .
50002027	For indeed he was sick , nearly to death , but God had mercy on him ; and not on him only , but on me also , that I might not have sorrow on sorrow .
50002028	I have sent him therefore the more diligently , that , when you see him again , you may rejoice , and that I may be the less sorrowful .
50002029	Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy , and hold such in honor ,
50002030	because for the work of Christ he came near to death , risking his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me .
50003001	Finally , my brothers , rejoice in the Lord . To write the same things to you , to me indeed is not tiresome , but for you it is safe .
50003002	Beware of the dogs , beware of the evil workers , beware of the false circumcision .
50003003	For we are the circumcision , who worship God in the Spirit , and rejoice in Christ Jesus , and have no confidence in the flesh ;
50003004	though I myself might have confidence even in the flesh . If any other man thinks that he has confidence in the flesh , I yet more :
50003005	circumcised the eighth day , of the stock of Israel , of the tribe of Benjamin , a Hebrew of Hebrews ; concerning the law , a Pharisee ;
50003006	concerning zeal , persecuting the assembly ; concerning the righteousness which is in the law , found blameless .
50003007	However , what things were gain to me , these have I counted loss for Christ .
50003008	Yes most assuredly , and I count all things to be loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus , my Lord , for whom I suffered the loss of all things , and count them nothing but refuse , that I may gain Christ
50003009	and be found in him , not having a righteousness of my own , that which is of the law , but that which is through faith in Christ , the righteousness which is from God by faith ;
50003010	that I may know him , and the power of his resurrection , and the fellowship of his sufferings , becoming conformed to his death ;
50003011	if by any means I may attain to the resurrection from the dead .
50003012	Not that I have already obtained , or am already made perfect ; but I press on , if it is so that I may take hold of that for which also I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus .
50003013	Brothers , I don't regard myself as yet having laid hold , but one thing I do . Forgetting the things which are behind , and stretching forward to the things which are before ,
50003014	I press on toward the goal to the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus .
50003015	Let us therefore , as many as are perfect , think this way . If in anything you think otherwise , this God will also reveal that to you .
50003016	Nevertheless , to the extent that we have already attained , let us walk by the same rule . Let us be of the same mind .
50003017	Brothers , be imitators together of me , and note those who walk this way , even as you have us for an example .
50003018	For many walk , of whom I told you often , and now tell you even weeping , as the enemies of the cross of Christ ,
50003019	whose end is destruction , whose god is the belly , and whose glory is in their shame , who think about earthly things .
50003020	For our citizenship is in heaven , from where we also wait for a Savior , the Lord , Jesus Christ ;
50003021	who will change the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of his glory , according to the working whereby he is able even to subject all things to himself .
50004001	Therefore , my brothers , beloved and longed for , my joy and crown , so stand firm in the Lord , my beloved .
50004002	I exhort Euodia , and I exhort Syntyche , to think the same way in the Lord .
50004003	Yes , I beg you also , true yoke-fellow , help these women , for they labored with me in the gospel , with Clement also , and the rest of my fellow workers , whose names are in the book of life .
50004004	Rejoice in the Lord always . Again I will say , Rejoice !
50004005	Let your mildness be known to all men . The Lord is at hand .
50004006	In nothing be anxious , but in everything , by prayer and petition with thanksgiving , let your requests be made known to God .
50004007	The peace of God , which passes all understanding , will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus .
50004008	Finally , brothers , whatever things are true , whatever things are honorable , whatever things are just , whatever things are pure , whatever things are lovely , whatever things are of good report ; if there is any virtue , and if there is any praise , think about these things .
50004009	The things which you learned , received , heard , and saw in me : do these things , and the God of peace will be with you .
50004010	But I rejoice in the Lord greatly , that now at length you have revived your thought for me ; in which you did indeed take thought , but you lacked opportunity .
50004011	Not that I speak in respect to lack , for I have learned in whatever state I am , to be content in it .
50004012	I know how to be humbled , and I know also how to abound . In everything and in all things have I learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry , both to abound and to be in need .
50004013	I can do all things through Christ , who strengthens me .
50004014	However you did well that you had fellowship with my affliction .
50004015	You yourselves also know , you Philippians , that in the beginning of the gospel , when I departed from Macedonia , no assembly had fellowship with me in the matter of giving and receiving but you only .
50004016	For even in Thessalonica you sent once and again to my need .
50004017	Not that I seek for the gift , but I seek for the fruit that increases to your account .
50004018	But I have all things , and abound . I am filled , having received from Epaphroditus the things that came from you , a sweet-smelling fragrance , an acceptable and well-pleasing sacrifice to God .
50004019	My God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus .
50004020	Now to our God and Father be the glory forever and ever . Amen .
50004021	Greet every saint in Christ Jesus . The brothers who are with me greet you .
50004022	All the saints greet you , especially those who are of Caesar's household .
50004023	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you all .
51001001	Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God , and Timothy our brother ,
51001002	To the saints and faithful brothers in Christ [ who are ] at Colossae : Grace to you and peace from God , our Father , and the Lord , Jesus Christ .
51001003	We give thanks to God , the Father of our Lord , Jesus Christ , praying always for you ,
51001004	having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus , and of the love which you have toward all the saints ,
51001005	because of the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens , whereof you heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel ,
51001006	which has come to you ; even as it is also in all the world bearing fruit and increasing , as it does in you also , since the day you heard and knew the grace of God in truth ;
51001007	even as you learned of Epaphras our beloved fellow-servant , who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf ,
51001008	who also declared to us your love in the Spirit .
51001009	For this cause , we also , since the day we heard this , haven't ceased to pray and make requests for you , that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding ,
51001010	to walk worthily of the Lord , to please him in all respects , bearing fruit in every good work , and increasing in the knowledge of God ;
51001011	strengthened with all power , according to the might of his glory , to all patience and perseverance with joy ;
51001012	giving thanks to the Father , who made us fit to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light ;
51001013	who delivered us out of the power of darkness , and translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his love ;
51001014	in whom we have our redemption through his blood , the forgiveness of our sins ;
51001015	who is the image of the invisible God , the firstborn of all creation .
51001016	For in him were all things created , in the heavens and on the earth , things visible and things invisible , whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers ; all things have been created through him , and to him .
51001017	He is before all things , and in him all things are held together .
51001018	He is the head of the body , the assembly , who is the beginning , the firstborn from the dead ; that in all things he might have the preeminence .
51001019	For all the fullness was pleased to dwell in him ;
51001020	and through him to reconcile all things to himself , having made peace through the blood of his cross . Through him , I say , whether things on the earth , or things in the heavens .
51001021	You , being in past times alienated and enemies in your mind in your evil works ,
51001022	yet now he has reconciled in the body of his flesh through death , to present you holy and without blemish and blameless before him ,
51001023	if it is so that you continue in the faith , grounded and steadfast , and not moved away from the hope of the gospel which you heard , which was preached in all creation under heaven ; of which I , Paul , was made a servant .
51001024	Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake , and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake , which is the assembly ;
51001025	of which I was made a servant , according to the stewardship of God which was given me toward you , to fulfill the word of God ,
51001026	the mystery which has been hidden for ages and generations . But now it has been revealed to his saints ,
51001027	to whom God was pleased to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles , who is Christ in you , the hope of glory ;
51001028	whom we proclaim , admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom , that we may present every man perfect in Christ ;
51001029	for which I also labor , striving according to his working , which works in me mightily .
51002001	For I desire to have you know how greatly I strive for you , and for them at Laodicea , and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh ;
51002002	that their hearts may be comforted , they being knit together in love , and to all riches of the full assurance of understanding , that they may know the mystery of God , both of the Father and of Christ ,
51002003	in whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden .
51002004	This I say that no one may delude you with persuasiveness of speech .
51002005	For though I am absent in the flesh , yet am I with you in the spirit , rejoicing and seeing your order , and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ .
51002006	As therefore you received Christ Jesus , the Lord , walk in him ,
51002007	rooted and built up in him , and established in your faith , even as you were taught , abounding in it in thanksgiving .
51002008	Be careful that you don't let anyone rob you through his philosophy and vain deceit , after the tradition of men , after the elements of the world , and not after Christ .
51002009	For in him all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily ,
51002010	and in him you are made full , who is the head of all principality and power ;
51002011	in whom you were also circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands , in the putting off of the body of the sins of the flesh , in the circumcision of Christ ;
51002012	having been buried with him in baptism , in which you were also raised with him through faith in the working of God , who raised him from the dead .
51002013	You were dead through your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh . He made you alive together with him , having forgiven us all our trespasses ;
51002014	having blotted out the bond written in ordinances that was against us , which was contrary to us : and he has taken it out that way , nailing it to the cross ;
51002015	having stripped the principalities and the powers , he made a show of them openly , triumphing over them in it .
51002016	Let no man therefore judge you in eating , or in drinking , or with respect to a feast day or a new moon or a Sabbath day ,
51002017	which are a shadow of the things to come ; but the body is Christ's .
51002018	Let no man rob you of your prize by a voluntary humility and worshipping of the angels , dwelling in the things which he has not seen , vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind ,
51002019	and not holding firmly to the Head , from whom all the body , being supplied and knit together through the joints and ligaments , grows with God's growth .
51002020	If you died with Christ from the elements of the world , why , as though living in the world , do you subject yourselves to ordinances ,
51002021	" Don't handle , nor taste , nor touch "
51002022	( all which things are to perish with the using ) , after the precepts and doctrines of men ?
51002023	Which things indeed appear like wisdom in self-imposed worship , and humility , and severity to the body ; but aren't of any value against the indulgence of the flesh .
51003001	If then you were raised together with Christ , seek the things that are above , where Christ is , seated on the right hand of God .
51003002	Set your mind on the things that are above , not on the things that are on the earth .
51003003	For you died , and your life is hidden with Christ in God .
51003004	When Christ , our life , is revealed , then you will also be revealed with him in glory .
51003005	Put to death therefore your members which are on the earth : sexual immorality , uncleanness , passion , evil desire , and covetousness , which is idolatry ;
51003006	for which things ' sake the wrath of God comes on the sons of disobedience .
51003007	You also once walked in those , when you lived in these things ;
51003008	but now you also put them all away : anger , wrath , malice , slander , and shameful speaking out of your mouth .
51003009	Don't lie to one another , seeing that you have put off the old man with his doings ,
51003010	and have put on the new man , that is being renewed in knowledge after the image of his Creator ,
51003011	where there can't be Greek and Jew , circumcision and uncircumcision , barbarian , Scythian , bondservant , freeman ; but Christ is all , and in all .
51003012	Put on therefore , as God's elect , holy and beloved , a heart of compassion , kindness , lowliness , humility , and perseverance ;
51003013	bearing with one another , and forgiving each other , if any man has a complaint against any ; even as the Lord forgave you , so also do .
51003014	Above all these things , walk in love , which is the bond of perfection .
51003015	Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts , to which also you were called in one body . Be thankful .
51003016	Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly ; in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms , hymns , and spiritual songs , singing with grace in your hearts to God .
51003017	Whatever you do , in word or in deed , do all in the name of the Lord Jesus , giving thanks to God , the Father , through him .
51003018	Wives , be in subjection to your husbands , as is fitting in the Lord .
51003019	Husbands , love your wives , and don't be bitter against them .
51003020	Children , obey your parents in all things , for this pleases the Lord .
51003021	Fathers , don't provoke your children , so that they won't be discouraged .
51003022	Servants , obey in all things those who are your masters according to the flesh , not just when they are looking , as men-pleasers , but in singleness of heart , fearing the Lord .
51003023	Whatever you do , work heartily , as for the Lord , and not for men ,
51003024	knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance ; for you serve the Lord , Christ .
51003025	For he who does wrong will receive again for the wrong that he has done , and there is no partiality .
51004001	Masters , give to your servants that which is just and equal , knowing that you also have a Master in heaven .
51004002	Continue steadfastly in prayer , watching therein with thanksgiving ;
51004003	praying together for us also , that God may open to us a door for the word , to speak the mystery of Christ , for which I am also in bonds ;
51004004	that I may reveal it as I ought to speak .
51004005	Walk in wisdom toward those who are outside , redeeming the time .
51004006	Let your speech always be with grace , seasoned with salt , that you may know how you ought to answer each one .
51004007	All my affairs will be made known to you by Tychicus , the beloved brother , faithful servant , and fellow bondservant in the Lord .
51004008	I am sending him to you for this very purpose , that he may know your circumstances and comfort your hearts ,
51004009	together with Onesimus , the faithful and beloved brother , who is one of you . They will make known to you all things that are going on here .
51004010	Aristarchus , my fellow prisoner greets you , and Mark , the cousin of Barnabas ( concerning whom you received commandments , " if he comes to you , receive him " ) ,
51004011	and Jesus who is called Justus , who are of the circumcision . These are my only fellow workers to the kingdom of God , men who have been a comfort to me .
51004012	Epaphras , who is one of you , a servant of Christ Jesus , salutes you , always striving for you in his prayers , that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God .
51004013	For I testify about him , that he has great zeal for you , and for those in Laodicea , and for those in Hierapolis .
51004014	Luke , the beloved physician , and Demas greet you .
51004015	Greet the brothers who are in Laodicea , and Nymphas , and the assembly that is in his house .
51004016	When this letter has been read among you , cause it to be read also in the assembly of the Laodiceans ; and that you also read the letter from Laodicea .
51004017	Tell Archippus , " Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord , that you fulfill it . "
51004018	The salutation of me , Paul , with my own hand . Remember my bonds . Grace be with you .
52001001	Paul , Silvanus , and Timothy , To the assembly of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ : Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
52001002	We always give thanks to God for all of you , mentioning you in our prayers ,
52001003	remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ , before our God and Father .
52001004	We know , brothers loved by God , that you are chosen ,
52001005	and that our gospel came to you not in word only , but also in power , and in the Holy Spirit , and with much assurance . You know what kind of men we showed ourselves to be among you for your sake .
52001006	You became imitators of us , and of the Lord , having received the word in much affliction , with joy of the Holy Spirit ,
52001007	so that you became an example to all who believe in Macedonia and in Achaia .
52001008	For from you has sounded forth the word of the Lord , not only in Macedonia and Achaia , but in every place your faith toward God has gone forth ; so that we need not to say anything .
52001009	For they themselves report concerning us what kind of a reception we had from you ; and how you turned to God from idols , to serve a living and true God ,
52001010	and to wait for his Son from heaven , whom he raised from the dead - - Jesus , who delivers us from the wrath to come .
52002001	For you yourselves know , brothers , our visit to you hasn't been found vain ,
52002002	but having suffered before and been shamefully treated , as you know , at Philippi , we grew bold in our God to tell you the gospel of God in much conflict .
52002003	For our exhortation is not of error , nor of uncleanness , nor in deception .
52002004	But even as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel , so we speak ; not as pleasing men , but God , who tests our hearts .
52002005	For neither were we at any time found using words of flattery , as you know , nor a cloak of covetousness ( God is witness ) ,
52002006	nor seeking glory from men ( neither from you nor from others ) , when we might have claimed authority as apostles of Christ .
52002007	But we were gentle in the midst of you , as when a nurse cherishes her own children .
52002008	Even so , affectionately longing for you , we were well pleased to impart to you , not the gospel of God only , but also our own souls , because you had become very dear to us .
52002009	For you remember , brothers , our labor and travail . Working night and day , that we might not burden any of you , we preached to you the gospel of God .
52002010	You are witnesses with God , how holy , righteously , and blamelessly we behaved ourselves toward you who believe .
52002011	As you know how we exhorted , comforted , and implored everyone of you , as a father does his own children ,
52002012	to the end that you should walk worthily of God , who calls you into his own kingdom and glory .
52002013	For this cause we also thank God without ceasing , that , when you received from us the word of the message of God , you accepted it not as the word of men , but , as it is in truth , the word of God , which also works in you who believe .
52002014	For you , brothers , became imitators of the assemblies of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus ; for you also suffered the same things from your own countrymen , even as they did from the Jews ;
52002015	who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets , and drove us out , and didn't please God , and are contrary to all men ;
52002016	forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved ; to fill up their sins always . But wrath has come on them to the uttermost .
52002017	But we , brothers , being bereaved of you for a short season , in presence , not in heart , tried even harder to see your face with great desire ,
52002018	because we wanted to come to you - - indeed , I , Paul , once and again - - but Satan hindered us .
52002019	For what is our hope , or joy , or crown of rejoicing ? Isn't it even you , before our Lord Jesus at his coming ?
52002020	For you are our glory and our joy .
52003001	Therefore , when we couldn't stand it any longer , we thought it good to be left behind at Athens alone ,
52003002	and sent Timothy , our brother and God's servant in the gospel of Christ , to establish you , and to comfort you concerning your faith ;
52003003	that no one be moved by these afflictions . For you know that we are appointed to this task .
52003004	For most assuredly , when we were with you , we told you beforehand that we are to suffer affliction , even as it happened , and you know .
52003005	For this cause I also , when I couldn't stand it any longer , sent that I might know your faith , for fear that by any means the tempter had tempted you , and our labor would have been in vain .
52003006	But when Timothy came just now to us from you , and brought us glad news of your faith and love , and that you have good memories of us always , longing to see us , even as we also long to see you ;
52003007	for this cause , brothers , we were comforted over you in all our distress and affliction through your faith .
52003008	For now we live , if you stand fast in the Lord .
52003009	For what thanksgiving can we render again to God for you , for all the joy with which we rejoice for your sakes before our God ;
52003010	night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face , and may perfect that which is lacking in your faith ?
52003011	Now may our God and Father himself , and our Lord Jesus Christ , direct our way to you ;
52003012	and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another , and toward all men , even as we also do toward you ,
52003013	to the end he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father , at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints .
52004001	Finally then , brothers , we beg and exhort you in the Lord Jesus , that , as you received from us how you ought to walk and to please God , - - that you abound more and more .
52004002	For you know what charge we gave you through the Lord Jesus .
52004003	For this is the will of God : your sanctification , that you abstain from sexual immorality ,
52004004	that each one of you know how to possess himself of his own vessel in sanctification and honor ,
52004005	not in the passion of lust , even as the Gentiles who don't know God ;
52004006	that no one should take advantage of and wrong a brother or sister in this matter ; because the Lord is an avenger in all these things , as also we forewarned you and testified .
52004007	For God called us not for uncleanness , but in sanctification .
52004008	Therefore he who rejects , doesn't reject man , but God , who has also given his Holy Spirit to you .
52004009	But concerning brotherly love , you have no need that one write to you . For you yourselves are taught by God to love one another ,
52004010	for indeed you do it toward all the brothers who are in all Macedonia . But we exhort you , brothers , that you abound more and more ;
52004011	and that you make it your ambition to lead a quiet life , and to do your own business , and to work with your own hands , even as we charged you ;
52004012	that you may walk properly toward those who are outside , and may have need of nothing .
52004013	But we don't want you to be ignorant , brothers , concerning those who have fallen asleep , so that you don't grieve like the rest , who have no hope .
52004014	For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again , even so those who have fallen asleep in Jesus will God bring with him .
52004015	For this we tell you by the word of the Lord , that we who are alive , who are left to the coming of the Lord , will in no way precede those who have fallen asleep .
52004016	For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout , with the voice of the archangel , and with God's trumpet . The dead in Christ will rise first ,
52004017	then we who are alive , who are left , will be caught up together with them in the clouds , to meet the Lord in the air . So we will be with the Lord forever .
52004018	Therefore comfort one another with these words .
52005001	But concerning the times and the seasons , brothers , you have no need that anything be written to you .
52005002	For you yourselves know well that the day of the Lord comes like a thief in the night .
52005003	For when they are saying , " Peace and safety , " then sudden destruction will come on them , like birth pains on a pregnant woman ; and they will in no way escape .
52005004	But you , brothers , aren't in darkness , that the day should overtake you like a thief .
52005005	You are all sons of light , and sons of the day . We don't belong to the night , nor to darkness ,
52005006	so then let's not sleep , as the rest do , but let us watch and be sober .
52005007	For those who sleep , sleep in the night , and those who are drunken are drunken in the night .
52005008	But let us , since we belong to the day , be sober , putting on the breastplate of faith and love , and , for a helmet , the hope of salvation .
52005009	For God didn't appoint us to wrath , but to the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ ,
52005010	who died for us , that , whether we wake or sleep , we should live together with him .
52005011	Therefore exhort one another , and build each other up , even as you also do .
52005012	But we beg you , brothers , to know those who labor among you , and are over you in the Lord , and admonish you ,
52005013	and to respect and honor them in love for their work's sake . Be at peace among yourselves .
52005014	We exhort you , brothers , admonish the disorderly , encourage the fainthearted , support the weak , be patient toward all .
52005015	See that no one returns evil for evil to anyone , but always follow after that which is good , towards one another , and towards all .
52005016	Rejoice always .
52005017	Pray without ceasing .
52005018	In everything give thanks , for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus toward you .
52005019	Don't quench the Spirit .
52005020	Don't despise prophesies .
52005021	Test all things , and hold firmly that which is good .
52005022	Abstain from every form of evil .
52005023	May the God of peace himself sanctify you completely . May your whole spirit , soul , and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ .
52005024	Faithful is he who calls you , who will also do it .
52005025	Brothers , pray for us .
52005026	Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss .
52005027	I solemnly charge you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the holy brothers .
52005028	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you . Amen .
53001001	Paul , Silvanus , and Timothy , To the assembly of the Thessalonians in God , our Father , and the Lord Jesus Christ :
53001002	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
53001003	We are bound to always give thanks to God for you , brothers , even as it is appropriate , because your faith grows exceedingly , and the love of each and every one of you towards one another abounds ;
53001004	so that we ourselves boast about you in the assemblies of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions which you endure .
53001005	This is an obvious sign of the righteous judgment of God , to the end that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God , for which you also suffer .
53001006	Since it is a righteous thing with God to repay affliction to those who afflict you ,
53001007	and to give relief to you that are afflicted with us , when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire ,
53001008	giving vengeance to those who don't know God , and to those who don't obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus ,
53001009	who will pay the penalty : eternal destruction from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his might ,
53001010	when he comes to be glorified in his saints , and to be admired among all those who have believed ( because our testimony to you was believed ) in that day .
53001011	To this end we also pray always for you , that our God may count you worthy of your calling , and fulfill every desire of goodness and work of faith , with power ;
53001012	that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you , and you in him , according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ .
53002001	Now we beg you , brothers , concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , and our gathering together to him ,
53002002	to the end that you won't be quickly shaken in your mind , nor yet be troubled , either by spirit , or by word , or by letter as from us , saying that the day of Christ had come .
53002003	Let no one deceive you in any way . For it will not be , unless the falling away comes first , and the man of sin is revealed , the son of destruction ,
53002004	he who opposes and exalts himself against all that is called God or that is worshipped ; so that he sits as God in the temple of God , setting himself up as God .
53002005	Don't you remember that , when I was still with you , I told you these things ?
53002006	Now you know what is restraining him , to the end that he may be revealed in his own season .
53002007	For the mystery of lawlessness does already work . Only there is one who restrains now , until he is taken out of the way .
53002008	Then will the lawless one be revealed , whom the Lord will kill with the breath of his mouth , and bring to nothing by the brightness of his coming ;
53002009	even he whose coming is according to the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders ,
53002010	and with all deception of wickedness for those who are being lost , because they didn't receive the love of the truth , that they might be saved .
53002011	Because of this , God sends them a working of error , that they should believe a lie ;
53002012	that they all might be judged who didn't believe the truth , but had pleasure in unrighteousness .
53002013	But we are bound to always give thanks to God for you , brothers loved by the Lord , because God chose you from the beginning for salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth ;
53002014	whereunto he called you through our gospel , to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ .
53002015	So then , brothers , stand firm , and hold the traditions which you were taught by us , whether by word , or by letter .
53002016	Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself , and God , our Father , who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace ,
53002017	comfort your hearts and establish you in every good work and word .
53003001	Finally , brothers , pray for us , that the word of the Lord may run and be glorified , even as also with you ;
53003002	and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and evil men ; for not all have faith .
53003003	But the Lord is faithful , who will establish you , and guard you from the evil one .
53003004	We have confidence in the Lord concerning you , that you both do and will do the things which we command .
53003005	May the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God , and into the patience of Christ .
53003006	Now we command you , brothers , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that you withdraw yourselves from every brother who walks in rebellion , and not after the tradition which they received from us .
53003007	For you know how you ought to imitate us . For we didn't behave ourselves rebelliously among you ,
53003008	neither did we eat bread for nothing from any man's hand , but in labor and travail , working night and day , that we might not burden any of you ;
53003009	not because we don't have the right , but to make ourselves an example to you , that you should imitate us .
53003010	For even when we were with you , we commanded you this : " If anyone will not work , neither let him eat . "
53003011	For we hear of some who walk among you in rebellion , who don't work at all , but are busybodies .
53003012	Now those who are that way , we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ , that with quietness they work , and eat their own bread .
53003013	But you , brothers , don't be weary in doing well .
53003014	If any man doesn't obey our word by this letter , note that man , that you have no company with him , to the end that he may be ashamed .
53003015	Don't count him as an enemy , but admonish him as a brother .
53003016	Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways . The Lord be with you all .
53003017	The greeting of me , Paul , with my own hand , which is the sign in every letter . This is how I write .
53003018	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all . Amen .
54001001	Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God , our Savior , and Christ Jesus , our hope ;
54001002	to Timothy , my true child in faith : Grace , mercy , and peace , from God our Father , and Christ Jesus , our Lord .
54001003	As I exhorted you to stay at Ephesus , when I was going into Macedonia , that you might charge certain men not to teach a different doctrine ,
54001004	neither to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies , which cause disputes , rather than God's stewardship , which is in faith - -
54001005	But the end of the charge is love , out of a pure heart and a good conscience and unfeigned faith ;
54001006	from which things some , having missed the mark , have turned aside to vain talking ;
54001007	desiring to be teachers of the law , though they understand neither what they say , nor about what they strongly affirm .
54001008	But we know that the law is good , if a man uses it lawfully ,
54001009	as knowing this , that law is not made for a righteous man , but for the lawless and insubordinate , for the ungodly and sinners , for the unholy and profane , for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers , for manslayers ,
54001010	for the sexually immoral , for homosexuals , for slave-traders , for liars , for perjurers , and for any other thing contrary to the sound doctrine ;
54001011	according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God , which was committed to my trust .
54001012	And I thank him who enabled me , Christ Jesus , our Lord , because he counted me faithful , appointing me to service ;
54001013	although I was before a blasphemer , a persecutor , and insolent . However , I obtained mercy , because I did it ignorantly in unbelief .
54001014	The grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus .
54001015	The saying is faithful , and worthy of all acceptance , that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners ; of whom I am chief .
54001016	However , for this cause I obtained mercy , that in me as chief , Jesus Christ might display all his patience , for an example of those who were going to believe in him to eternal life .
54001017	Now to the King eternal , immortal , invisible , to God who alone is wise , be honor and glory forever and ever . Amen .
54001018	This charge I commit to you , my child Timothy , according to the prophecies which led the way to you , that by them you may wage the good warfare ;
54001019	holding faith and a good conscience ; which some having thrust away made a shipwreck concerning the faith ;
54001020	of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander ; whom I delivered to Satan , that they might be taught not to blaspheme .
54002001	I exhort therefore , first of all , that petitions , prayers , intercessions , and givings of thanks , be made for all men :
54002002	for kings and all who are in high places ; that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and reverence .
54002003	For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God , our Savior ;
54002004	who desires to have all men to be saved , and come to full knowledge of the truth .
54002005	For there is one God , and one mediator between God and men , the man Christ Jesus ,
54002006	who gave himself as a ransom for all ; the testimony in its own times ;
54002007	to which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle ( I am telling the truth in Christ , not lying ) , a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth .
54002008	I desire therefore that the men in every place pray , lifting up holy hands , without wrath and doubting .
54002009	In the same way , that women also adorn themselves in decent clothing , with modesty and propriety ; not just with braided hair , and gold or pearls or costly clothing ;
54002010	but ( which becomes women professing godliness ) through good works .
54002011	Let a woman learn in quietness with all subjection .
54002012	But I don't permit a woman to teach , nor to exercise authority over a man , but to be in quietness .
54002013	For Adam was first formed , then Eve .
54002014	Adam wasn't deceived , but the woman , being deceived , has fallen into disobedience ;
54002015	but she will be saved through her child-bearing , if they continue in faith , love , and sanctification with sobriety .
54003001	This is a faithful saying : if a man seeks the office of an overseer , he desires a good work .
54003002	The overseer therefore must be without reproach , the husband of one wife , temperate , sensible , modest , hospitable , good at teaching ;
54003003	not a drinker , not violent , not greedy for money , but gentle , not quarrelsome , not covetous ;
54003004	one who rules his own house well , having children in subjection with all reverence ;
54003005	( but if a man doesn't know how to rule his own house , how will he take care of the assembly of God ? )
54003006	not a novice , to avoid being puffed up and falling into the condemnation of the devil .
54003007	Moreover he must have good testimony from those who are outside , to avoid falling into reproach and the snare of the devil .
54003008	Deacons , in the same way , must be reverent , not double-tongued , not addicted to much wine , not greedy for money ;
54003009	holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience .
54003010	Let them also first be tested ; then let them serve as deacons , if they are blameless .
54003011	Their wives in the same way must be reverent , not slanderers , temperate , faithful in all things .
54003012	Let deacons be husbands of one wife , ruling their children and their own houses well .
54003013	For those who have served well as deacons gain to themselves a good standing , and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus .
54003014	These things I write to you , hoping to come to you shortly ;
54003015	but if I wait long , that you may know how men ought to behave themselves in the house of God , which is the assembly of the living God , the pillar and ground of the truth .
54003016	Without controversy , the mystery of godliness is great : God was revealed in the flesh , Justified in the spirit , Seen by angels , Preached among the nations , Believed on in the world , And received up in glory .
54004001	But the Spirit says expressly that in later times some will fall away from the faith , paying attention to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons ,
54004002	through the hypocrisy of men who speak lies , branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron ;
54004003	forbidding marriage and commanding to abstinence from foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth .
54004004	For every creature of God is good , and nothing is to be rejected , if it is received with thanksgiving .
54004005	For it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer .
54004006	If you instruct the brothers of these things , you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus , nourished in the words of the faith , and of the good doctrine which you have followed .
54004007	But refuse profane and old wives ' fables . Exercise yourself toward godliness .
54004008	For bodily exercise has some value , but godliness has value for all things , having the promise of the life which is now , and of that which is to come .
54004009	This saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance .
54004010	For to this end we both labor and suffer reproach , because we have set our trust in the living God , who is the Savior of all men , especially of those who believe .
54004011	Command and teach these things .
54004012	Let no man despise your youth ; but be an example to those who believe , in word , in your way of life , in love , in spirit , in faith , and in purity .
54004013	Until I come , pay attention to reading , to exhortation , and to teaching .
54004014	Don't neglect the gift that is in you , which was given to you by prophecy , with the laying on of the hands of the elders .
54004015	Be diligent in these things . Give yourself wholly to them , that your progress may be revealed to all .
54004016	Pay attention to yourself , and to your teaching . Continue in these things , for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you .
54005001	Don't rebuke an older man , but exhort him as a father ; the younger men as brothers ;
54005002	the elder women as mothers ; the younger as sisters , in all purity .
54005003	Honor widows who are widows indeed .
54005004	But if any widow has children or grandchildren , let them learn first to show piety towards their own family , and to repay their parents , for this is acceptable in the sight of God .
54005005	Now she who is a widow indeed , and desolate , has her hope set on God , and continues in petitions and prayers night and day .
54005006	But she who gives herself to pleasure is dead while she lives .
54005007	Also command these things , that they may be without reproach .
54005008	But if anyone doesn't provide for his own , and specially his own household , he has denied the faith , and is worse than an unbeliever .
54005009	Let none be enrolled as a widow under sixty years old , having been the wife of one man ,
54005010	well reported of for good works ; if she has brought up children , if she has used hospitality to strangers , if she has washed the saints ' feet , if she has relieved the afflicted , if she has diligently followed every good work .
54005011	But refuse younger widows , for when they have grown wanton against Christ , they desire to marry ;
54005012	having condemnation , because they have rejected their first pledge .
54005013	Besides , they also learn to be idle , going about from house to house . Not only idle , but also gossips and busybodies , saying things which they ought not .
54005014	I desire therefore that the younger widows marry , bear children , rule the household , and give no occasion to the adversary for reviling .
54005015	For already some have turned aside after Satan .
54005016	If any man or woman who believes has widows , let them relieve them , and don't let the assembly be burdened ; that it might relieve those who are widows indeed .
54005017	Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor , especially those who labor in the word and in teaching .
54005018	For the scripture says , " You shall not muzzle the ox when he treads out the grain . " And , " The laborer is worthy of his wages . "
54005019	Don't receive an accusation against an elder , except at the word of two or three witnesses .
54005020	Those who sin , reprove in the sight of all , that the rest also may be in fear .
54005021	I charge you in the sight of God , and Christ Jesus , and the elect angels , that you observe these things without prejudice , doing nothing by partiality .
54005022	Lay hands hastily on no one , neither be a participant in other men's sins . Keep yourself pure .
54005023	Be no longer a drinker of water only , but use a little wine for your stomach's sake and your frequent infirmities .
54005024	Some men's sins are evident , going before to judgment , and some men also they follow after .
54005025	In the same way also there are good works that are obvious , and those that are otherwise can't be hidden .
54006001	Let as many as are bondservants under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor , that the name of God and the doctrine not be blasphemed .
54006002	Those who have believing masters , let them not despise them , because they are brothers , but rather let them serve them , because those who partake of the benefit are believing and beloved . Teach and exhort these things .
54006003	If anyone teaches a different doctrine , and doesn't consent to sound words , the words of our Lord , Jesus Christ , and to the doctrine which is according to godliness ;
54006004	he is conceited , knowing nothing , but obsessed with arguments , disputes , and word battles , from which come envy , strife , reviling , evil suspicions ,
54006005	constant friction of men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth , who suppose that godliness is a means of gain . Withdraw yourself from such .
54006006	But godliness with contentment is great gain .
54006007	For we brought nothing into the world , and we certainly can't carry anything out .
54006008	But having food and clothing , we will be content with that .
54006009	But those who are determined to be rich fall into a temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful lusts , such as drown men in ruin and destruction .
54006010	For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil . Some have been led astray from the faith in their greed , and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows .
54006011	But you , man of God , flee these things , and follow after righteousness , godliness , faith , love , patience , and gentleness .
54006012	Fight the good fight of the faith . Lay hold of the eternal life , whereunto you were called , and confessed the good confession in the sight of many witnesses .
54006013	I charge you in the sight of God , who gives life to all things , and of Christ Jesus , who before Pontius Pilate testified the good confession ,
54006014	that you keep the commandment , without spot , without reproach , until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ ;
54006015	which in its own times he will show , who is the blessed and only Ruler , the King of kings , and Lord of lords ;
54006016	who alone has immortality , dwelling in unapproachable light ; whom no man has seen , nor can see : to whom be honor and eternal power . Amen .
54006017	Charge those who are rich in this present world , that they not be haughty , nor have their hope set on the uncertainty of riches , but on the living God , who richly provides us with everything to enjoy ;
54006018	that they do good , that they be rich in good works , that they be ready to distribute , willing to communicate ;
54006019	laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come , that they may lay hold of eternal life .
54006020	Timothy , guard that which is committed to you , turning away from the empty chatter and oppositions of the knowledge which is falsely so called ;
54006021	which some professing have erred concerning the faith . Grace be with you . Amen .
55001001	Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God , according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus ,
55001002	to Timothy , my beloved child : Grace , mercy , and peace , from God , the Father , and Christ Jesus , our Lord .
55001003	I thank God , whom I serve as my forefathers did , with a pure conscience . How unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions , night and day
55001004	longing to see you , remembering your tears , that I may be filled with joy ;
55001005	having been reminded of the unfeigned faith that is in you ; which lived first in your grandmother Lois , and your mother Eunice , and , I am persuaded , in you also .
55001006	For this cause , I remind you that you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands .
55001007	For God didn't give us a spirit of fear , but of power and love and discipline .
55001008	Don't be ashamed therefore of the testimony of our Lord , nor of me , his prisoner ; but suffer hardship with the gospel according to the power of God ,
55001009	who saved us , and called us with a holy calling , not according to our works , but according to his own purpose and grace , which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal ,
55001010	but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior , Christ Jesus , who abolished death , and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel .
55001011	For this , I was appointed as a preacher , an apostle , and a teacher of the Gentiles .
55001012	For this cause I suffer also these things . Yet I am not ashamed , for I know him whom I have believed , and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him against that day .
55001013	Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me , in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus .
55001014	That good thing which was committed to you , guard through the Holy Spirit which dwells in us .
55001015	This you know , that all who are in Asia turned away from me ; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes .
55001016	May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus , for he often refreshed me , and was not ashamed of my chain ,
55001017	but when he was in Rome , he sought me diligently , and found me
55001018	( the Lord grant to him to find the Lord's mercy in that day ) ; and in how many things he served at Ephesus , you know very well .
55002001	You therefore , my child , be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus .
55002002	The things which you have heard from me among many witnesses , commit the same to faithful men , who will be able to teach others also .
55002003	You therefore must endure hardship , as a good soldier of Christ Jesus .
55002004	No soldier on service entangles himself in the affairs of life , that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier .
55002005	If also a man competes in the games , he is not crowned , unless he has competed by the rules .
55002006	The farmers who labor must be the first to get a share of the crops .
55002007	Consider what I say , and may the Lord give you understanding in all things .
55002008	Remember Jesus Christ , risen from the dead , of the seed of David , according to my gospel ,
55002009	in which I suffer hardship to bonds , as a criminal . But God's word isn't bound .
55002010	Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sake , that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory .
55002011	This saying is faithful : For if we died with him , we will also live with him .
55002012	If we endure , we will also reign with him . If we will deny him , he also will deny us .
55002013	If we are faithless , he remains faithful - - he can't deny himself .
55002014	Remind them of these things , charging them in the sight of the Lord , that they don't argue about words , to no profit , to the subverting of those who hear .
55002015	Give diligence to present yourself approved by God , a workman who doesn't need to be ashamed , properly handling the Word of Truth .
55002016	But shun empty chatter , for they will proceed further in ungodliness ,
55002017	and their word will consume like gangrene , of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus ;
55002018	men who have erred concerning the truth , saying that the resurrection is already past , and overthrowing the faith of some .
55002019	However God's firm foundation stands , having this seal , " The Lord knows those who are his , " and , " Let every one who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness . "
55002020	Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver , but also of wood and of clay . Some are for honor , and some for dishonor .
55002021	If a man therefore purges himself from these , he will be a vessel for honor , sanctified , and suitable for the master's use , prepared for every good work .
55002022	Flee from youthful lusts ; but pursue righteousness , faith , love , and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart .
55002023	But refuse foolish and ignorant questionings , knowing that they generate strife .
55002024	The Lord's servant must not quarrel , but be gentle towards all , able to teach , patient ,
55002025	in gentleness correcting those who oppose him ; if perhaps God may give them repentance to the knowledge of the truth ,
55002026	and they may recover themselves out of the devil's snare , having been taken captive by him to his will .
55003001	But know this , that in the last days , grievous times will come .
55003002	For men will be lovers of self , lovers of money , boastful , arrogant , blasphemers , disobedient to parents , unthankful , unholy ,
55003003	without natural affection , unforgiving , slanderers , without self-control , fierce , no lovers of good ,
55003004	traitors , headstrong , conceited , lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God ;
55003005	holding a form of godliness , but having denied the power thereof . Turn away from these , also .
55003006	For of these are those who creep into houses , and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins , led away by various lusts ,
55003007	always learning , and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth .
55003008	Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses , so do these also oppose the truth ; men corrupted in mind , reprobate concerning the faith .
55003009	But they will proceed no further . For their folly will be evident to all men , as theirs also came to be .
55003010	But you did follow my teaching , conduct , purpose , faith , patience , love , steadfastness ,
55003011	persecutions , and sufferings ; those things that happened to me at Antioch , at Iconium , at Lystra ; those persecutions that I endured . Out of them all the Lord delivered me .
55003012	Yes , and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution .
55003013	But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse , deceiving and being deceived .
55003014	But you remain in the things which you have learned and have been assured of , knowing from whom you have learned them .
55003015	From infancy , you have known the sacred writings which are able to make you wise to salvation through faith , which is in Christ Jesus .
55003016	Every scripture inspired by God is also profitable for teaching , for reproof , for correction , for instruction which is in righteousness ,
55003017	that the man of God may be complete , furnished completely to every good work .
55004001	I charge you therefore before God and the Lord , Jesus Christ , who will judge the living and the dead at His appearing and His kingdom :
55004002	preach the word ; be urgent in season and out of season ; reprove , rebuke , and exhort , with all patience and teaching .
55004003	For the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine , but , having itching ears , will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts ;
55004004	and will turn away their ears from the truth , and turn aside to fables .
55004005	But you be sober in all things , suffer hardship , do the work of an evangelist , and fulfill your ministry .
55004006	For I am already being offered , and the time of my departure has come .
55004007	I have fought the good fight . I have finished the course . I have kept the faith .
55004008	From now on , there is stored up for me the crown of righteousness , which the Lord , the righteous judge , will give to me at that day ; and not to me only , but also to all those who have loved his appearing .
55004009	Be diligent to come to me soon ,
55004010	for Demas left me , having loved this present world , and went to Thessalonica ; Crescens to Galatia , and Titus to Dalmatia .
55004011	Only Luke is with me . Take Mark , and bring him with you , for he is useful to me for ministering .
55004012	But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus .
55004013	Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus , when you come , and the books , especially the parchments .
55004014	Alexander , the coppersmith , did much evil to me . The Lord will repay him according to his works ,
55004015	of whom you also must beware ; for he greatly opposed our words .
55004016	At my first defense , no one took my part , but all left me . May it not be held against them .
55004017	But the Lord stood by me , and strengthened me , that through me the message might be fully proclaimed , and that all the Gentiles might hear ; and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion .
55004018	And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work , and will save me to his heavenly kingdom ; to whom be the glory forever and ever . Amen .
55004019	Greet Prisca and Aquila , and the house of Onesiphorus .
55004020	Erastus remained at Corinth , but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick .
55004021	Be diligent to come before winter . Eubulus salutes you , as do Pudens , Linus , Claudia , and all the brothers .
55004022	The Lord , Jesus Christ , be with your spirit . Grace be with you . Amen .
56001001	Paul , a servant of God , and an apostle of Jesus Christ , according to the faith of God's elect , and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness ,
56001002	in hope of eternal life , which God , who can't lie , promised before eternal times ;
56001003	but in his own time revealed his word in the message with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God , our Savior ;
56001004	to Titus , my true child according to a common faith : Grace , mercy , and peace from God , the Father , and the Lord , Jesus Christ , our Savior .
56001005	I left you in Crete for this reason , that you would set in order the things that were lacking , and appoint elders in every city , as I directed you ;
56001006	if anyone is blameless , the husband of one wife , having children who believe , who are not accused of loose or unruly behavior .
56001007	For the overseer must be blameless , as God's steward ; not self-pleasing , not easily angered , not given to wine , not violent , not greedy for dishonest gain ;
56001008	but given to hospitality , as a lover of good , sober-minded , fair , holy , self-controlled ;
56001009	holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching , that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine , and to convict those who contradict him .
56001010	For there are also many unruly men , vain talkers and deceivers , especially those of the circumcision ,
56001011	whose mouths must be stopped ; men who overthrow whole houses , teaching things which they ought not , for dishonest gain's sake .
56001012	One of them , a prophet of their own , said , " Cretans are always liars , evil beasts , and idle gluttons . "
56001013	This testimony is true . For this cause , reprove them sharply , that they may be sound in the faith ,
56001014	not paying attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn away from the truth .
56001015	To the pure , all things are pure ; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving , nothing is pure ; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled .
56001016	They profess that they know God , but by their works they deny him , being abominable , disobedient , and unfit for any good work .
56002001	But say the things which fit the sound doctrine ,
56002002	that older men should be temperate , sensible , sober-minded , sound in faith , in love , and in patience :
56002003	and that older women likewise be reverent in behavior , not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine , teachers of that which is good ;
56002004	that they may train the young women to love their husbands , to love their children ,
56002005	to be sober-minded , chaste , workers at home , kind , being in subjection to their own husbands , that God's word may not be blasphemed .
56002006	Likewise , exhort the younger men to be sober-minded ;
56002007	in all things showing yourself an example of good works ; in your teaching showing integrity , seriousness , incorruptibility ,
56002008	and soundness of speech that can't be condemned ; that he who opposes you may be ashamed , having no evil thing to say about us .
56002009	Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters , and to be well-pleasing in all things ; not contradicting ;
56002010	not stealing , but showing all good fidelity ; that they may adorn the doctrine of God , our Savior , in all things .
56002011	For the grace of God has appeared , bringing salvation to all men ,
56002012	instructing us to the intent that , denying ungodliness and worldly lusts , we would live soberly , righteously , and godly in this present world ;
56002013	looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of the great God and our Savior , Jesus Christ ;
56002014	who gave himself for us , that he might redeem us from all iniquity , and purify to himself a people for his own possession , zealous for good works .
56002015	Say these things and exhort and reprove with all authority . Let no man despise you .
56003001	Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities , to be obedient , to be ready to every good work ,
56003002	to speak evil of no one , not to be contentious , to be gentle , showing all gentleness toward all men .
56003003	For we were also once foolish , disobedient , deceived , serving various lusts and pleasures , living in malice and envy , hateful , and hating one another .
56003004	But when the kindness of God , our Savior , and his love toward man , appeared ,
56003005	not by works of righteousness , which we did ourselves , but according to his mercy , he saved us , through the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit ,
56003006	which he poured out on us richly , through Jesus Christ , our Savior ;
56003007	that , being justified by his grace , we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life .
56003008	This saying is faithful , and concerning these things I desire that you affirm confidently , to the end that they who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works . These things are good and profitable to men ;
56003009	but shun foolish questionings , genealogies , strife , and disputes about the law ; for they are unprofitable and vain .
56003010	Avoid a factious man after a first and second warning ;
56003011	knowing that such a one is perverted , and sins , being self-condemned .
56003012	When I send Artemas to you , or Tychicus , be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis , for I have determined to winter there .
56003013	Send Zenas , the lawyer , and Apollos on their journey diligently , that nothing may be lacking for them .
56003014	Let our people also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses , that they may not be unfruitful .
56003015	All who are with me greet you . Greet those who love us in faith . Grace be with you all . Amen .
57001001	Paul , a prisoner of Christ Jesus , and Timothy our brother , to Philemon , our beloved fellow worker ,
57001002	to the beloved Apphia , to Archippus , our fellow soldier , and to the assembly in your house :
57001003	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
57001004	I thank my God always , making mention of you in my prayers ,
57001005	hearing of your love , and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus , and toward all the saints ;
57001006	that the fellowship of your faith may become effective , in the knowledge of every good thing which is in us , in Christ Jesus .
57001007	For we have much joy and comfort in your love , because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you , brother .
57001008	Therefore , though I have all boldness in Christ to command you that which is appropriate ,
57001009	yet for love's sake I rather beg , being such a one as Paul , the aged , and now a prisoner also of Christ Jesus .
57001010	I beg you for my child , whom I have fathered in my bonds , Onesimus ,
57001011	who once was useless to you , but now is useful to you and to me ;
57001012	I am sending him back . You therefore receive him , that is , my own heart ,
57001013	whom I wanted to keep with me , that in your behalf he might minister to me in the bonds of the gospel .
57001014	But I was willing to do nothing without your consent , that your goodness would not be as of necessity , but of free will .
57001015	For perhaps he was therefore separated from you for a while , that you would have him forever ,
57001016	no longer as a slave , but more than a slave , a beloved brother , specially to me , but how much rather to you , both in the flesh and in the Lord .
57001017	If then you count me a partner , receive him as you would receive me .
57001018	But if he has wronged you at all , or owes you anything , put that to my account .
57001019	I , Paul , write this with my own hand : I will repay it ( not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self besides ) .
57001020	Yes , brother , let me have joy from you in the Lord . Refresh my heart in the Lord .
57001021	Having confidence in your obedience , I write to you , knowing that you will do even beyond what I say .
57001022	Also , prepare a guest room for me , for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you .
57001023	Epaphras , my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus , greets you ,
57001024	as do Mark , Aristarchus , Demas , and Luke , my fellow workers .
57001025	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit . Amen .
58001001	God , having in the past spoken to the fathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways ,
58001002	has at the end of these days spoken to us by his Son , whom he appointed heir of all things , through whom also he made the worlds .
58001003	His Son is the radiance of his glory , the very image of his substance , and upholding all things by the word of his power , when he had by himself made purification for our sins , sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high ;
58001004	having become so much better than the angels , as he has inherited a more excellent name than they have .
58001005	For to which of the angels did he say at any time , " You are my Son , Today have I become your father ? " and again , " I will be to him a Father , And he will be to me a Son ? "
58001006	When he again brings in the firstborn into the world he says , " Let all the angels of God worship him . "
58001007	Of the angels he says , " Who makes his angels winds , And his servants a flame a fire . "
58001008	but of the Son he says , " Your throne , God , is forever and ever ; The scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your kingdom .
58001009	You have loved righteousness , and hated iniquity ; Therefore God , your God , has anointed you With the oil of gladness above your fellows . "
58001010	And , " You , Lord , in the beginning , laid the foundation of the earth . The heavens are the works of your hands .
58001011	They will perish , but you continue . They all will grow old like a garment does .
58001012	As a mantle you will roll them up . And they will be changed . But you are the same . Your years will not fail . "
58001013	But of which of the angels has he said at any time , " Sit at my right hand , Until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet ? "
58001014	Aren't they all ministering spirits , sent forth to do service for the sake of those who will inherit salvation ?
58002001	Therefore we ought to pay greater attention to the things that were heard , lest perhaps we drift away .
58002002	For if the word spoken through angels proved steadfast , and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense ;
58002003	how will we escape , if we neglect so great a salvation - - which at the first having been spoken through the Lord , was confirmed to us by those who heard ;
58002004	God also bearing witness with them , both by signs and wonders , and by various works of power , and by gifts of the Holy Spirit , according to his own will ?
58002005	For he didn't subject the world to come , whereof we speak , to angels .
58002006	But one has somewhere testified , saying , " What is man , that you think of him ? Or the son of man , that you care for him ?
58002007	You made him a little lower than the angels ; You crowned him with glory and honor .
58002008	You have put all things in subjection under his feet . " For in that he subjected all things to him , he left nothing that is not subject to him . But now we don't see all things subjected to him , yet .
58002009	But we see him who has been made a little lower than the angels , Jesus , because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor , that by the grace of God he should taste of death for everyone .
58002010	For it became him , for whom are all things , and through whom are all things , in bringing many sons to glory , to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings .
58002011	For both he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one , for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers ,
58002012	saying , " I will declare your name to my brothers , In the midst of the congregation will I sing your praise . "
58002013	Again , " I will put my trust in him . " Again , " Behold , here am I and the children whom God has given me . "
58002014	Since then the children have shared in flesh and blood , he also himself in like manner partook of the same , that through death he might bring to nothing him who had the power of death , that is , the devil ,
58002015	and might deliver all of them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage .
58002016	For most assuredly , not to angels does he give help , but he gives help to the seed of Abraham .
58002017	Therefore he was obligated in all things to be made like his brothers , that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God , to make atonement for the sins of the people .
58002018	For in that he himself has suffered being tempted , he is able to help those who are tempted .
58003001	Therefore , holy brothers , partakers of a heavenly calling , consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession , Jesus ;
58003002	who was faithful to him who appointed him , as also was Moses in all his house .
58003003	For he has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses , by so much as he who built the house has more honor than the house .
58003004	For every house is built by someone ; but he who built all things is God .
58003005	Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant , for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken ,
58003006	but Christ as a Son , over his house ; whose house are we , if we hold fast our boldness and the glorying of our hope firm to the end .
58003007	Therefore , even as the Holy Spirit says , " Today if you will hear his voice ,
58003008	Don't harden your hearts , as in the provocation , Like as in the day of the trial in the wilderness ,
58003009	Where your fathers tested me by proving me , And saw my works for forty years .
58003010	Therefore I was displeased with that generation , And said , ' They always err in their heart , But they didn't know my ways ; '
58003011	As I swore in my wrath , ' They will not enter into my rest . ' "
58003012	Beware , brothers , lest perhaps there will be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief , in falling away from the living God ;
58003013	but exhort one another day by day , so long as it is called " today ; " lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin .
58003014	For we have become partakers of Christ , if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm to the end :
58003015	while it is said , " Today if you will hear his voice , Don't harden your hearts , as in the provocation . "
58003016	For who , when they heard , did provoke ? No , didn't all those who came out of Egypt by Moses ?
58003017	With whom was he displeased forty years ? was it not with those who sinned , whose bodies fell in the wilderness ?
58003018	To whom did he swear that they should not enter into his rest , but to those who were disobedient ?
58003019	We see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief .
58004001	Let us fear therefore , lest perhaps a promise being left of entering into his rest , anyone of you should seem to have come short of it .
58004002	For indeed we have had good news preached to us , even as also they , but the word of hearing did not profit them , because it was not mixed with faith by those who heard .
58004003	For we who have believed do enter into that rest , even as he has said , " As I swore in my wrath , They will not enter into my rest ; " although the works were finished from the foundation of the world .
58004004	For he has said somewhere about the seventh day like this , " God rested on the seventh day from all his works ; "
58004005	and in this place again , " They will not enter into my rest . "
58004006	Seeing therefore it remains that some should enter therein , and they to whom the good news were before preached failed to enter in because of disobedience ,
58004007	he again defines a certain day , today , saying through David so long a time afterward ( just as has been said ) , " Today if you will hear his voice , Don't harden your hearts . "
58004008	For if Joshua had given them rest , he would not have spoken afterward of another day .
58004009	There remains therefore a Sabbath rest for the people of God .
58004010	For he who has entered into his rest has himself also rested from his works , as God did from his .
58004011	Let us therefore give diligence to enter into that rest , that no man fall after the same example of disobedience .
58004012	For the word of God is living , and active , and sharper than any two-edged sword , and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit , of both joints and marrow , and quick to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart .
58004013	There is no creature that is hidden from his sight , but all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him with whom we have to do .
58004014	Having then a great high priest , who has passed through the heavens , Jesus , the Son of God , let us hold tightly to our confession .
58004015	For we don't have a high priest who can't be touched with the feeling of our infirmities , but one who has been in all points tempted like we are , yet without sin .
58004016	Let us therefore draw near with boldness to the throne of grace , that we may receive mercy , and may find grace for timely help .
58005001	For every high priest , being taken from among men , is appointed for men in things pertaining to God , that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins .
58005002	The high priest can deal gently with those who are ignorant and going astray , because he himself is also surrounded with weakness .
58005003	Because of this , he must offer sacrifices for sins for the people , as well as for himself .
58005004	No man takes this honor on himself , but he is called by God , just like Aaron was .
58005005	So also Christ didn't glorify himself to be made a high priest , but he who said to him , " You are my Son . Today I have become your father . "
58005006	As he says also in another place , " You are a priest forever , After the order of Melchizedek . "
58005007	Who in the days of his flesh , having offered up prayers and petitions with strong crying and tears to him who was able to save him from death , and having been heard for his godly fear ,
58005008	though he was a Son , yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered ;
58005009	and having been made perfect , he became to all of those who obey him the author of eternal salvation ,
58005010	named by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek .
58005011	Of whom we have many words to say , and hard to interpret , seeing you have become dull of hearing .
58005012	For when by reason of the time you ought to be teachers , you again need to have someone teach you the rudiments of the first principles of the oracles of God . You have come to need milk , and not solid food .
58005013	For everyone who lives on milk is not experienced in the word of righteousness , for he is a baby .
58005014	But solid food is for full grown men , those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern good and evil .
58006001	Therefore leaving the doctrine of the first principles of Christ , let us press on to perfection - - not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works , of faith toward God ,
58006002	of the teaching of baptisms , of laying on of hands , of resurrection of the dead , and of eternal judgment .
58006003	This will we do , if God permits .
58006004	For concerning those who were once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift , and were made partakers of the Holy Spirit ,
58006005	and tasted the good word of God , and the powers of the age to come ,
58006006	and then fell away , it is impossible to renew them again to repentance ; seeing they crucify the Son of God for themselves again , and put him to open shame .
58006007	For the land which has drunk the rain that comes often on it , and brings forth a crop suitable for them for whose sake it is also tilled , receives blessing from God ;
58006008	but if it bears thorns and thistles , it is rejected and near a curse , whose end is to be burned .
58006009	But , beloved , we are persuaded of better things for you , and things that accompany salvation , though we speak like this ,
58006010	for God is not unrighteous , so as to forget your work and the labor of love which you showed toward his name , in that you served to the saints , and still do serve them .
58006011	We desire that each one of you may show the same diligence to the fullness of hope even to the end ,
58006012	that you won't be sluggish , but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherited the promises .
58006013	For when God made a promise to Abraham , since he could swear by none greater , he swore by himself ,
58006014	saying , " Most surely I will bless you , and I will surely multiply you . "
58006015	Thus , having patiently endured , he obtained the promise .
58006016	For men indeed swear by a greater one , and in every dispute of theirs the oath is final for confirmation .
58006017	Wherein God , being determined to show more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel , interposed with an oath ;
58006018	that by two immutable things , in which it is impossible for God to lie , we may have a strong encouragement , who have fled for refuge to take hold of the hope set before us ,
58006019	which we have as an anchor of the soul , a hope both sure and steadfast and entering into that which is within the veil ;
58006020	where as a forerunner Jesus entered for us , having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek .
58007001	For this Melchizedek , king of Salem , priest of God Most High , who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him ,
58007002	to whom also Abraham divided a tenth part of all ( being first , by interpretation , King of righteousness , and then also King of Salem , which is King of peace ;
58007003	without father , without mother , without genealogy , having neither beginning of days nor end of life , but made like the Son of God ) , remains a priest continually .
58007004	Now consider how great this man was , to whom even Abraham , the patriarch , gave a tenth out of the best spoils .
58007005	They indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest's office have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law , that is , of their brothers , though these have come out of the loins of Abraham ,
58007006	but he whose genealogy is not counted from them has taken tithes of Abraham , and has blessed him who has the promises .
58007007	But without any dispute the less is blessed of the better .
58007008	Here men who die receive tithes , but there one , of whom it is testified that he lives .
58007009	So to say , through Abraham even Levi , who receives tithes , has paid tithes ,
58007010	for he was yet in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him .
58007011	Now if there was perfection through the Levitical priesthood ( for under it have the people received the law ) , what further need was there for another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek , and not be called after the order of Aaron ?
58007012	For the priesthood being changed , there is of necessity a change made also of the law .
58007013	For he of whom these things are said belongs to another tribe , from which no man has given attendance at the altar .
58007014	For it is evident that our Lord has sprung out of Judah , as to which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood .
58007015	This is yet more abundantly evident , if after the likeness of Melchizedek there arises another priest ,
58007016	who has been made , not after the law of a fleshly commandment , but after the power of an endless life :
58007017	for it is testified , " You are a priest forever , According to the order of Melchizedek . "
58007018	For there is an annulling of a foregoing commandment because of its weakness and uselessness
58007019	( for the law made nothing perfect ) , and a bringing in thereupon of a better hope , through which we draw near to God .
58007020	Inasmuch as it is not without the taking of an oath ,
58007021	for they indeed have been made priests without an oath ; but he with an oath by him that says of him , " The Lord swore and will not change his mind , ' You are a priest forever , According to the order of Melchizedek ' " .
58007022	By so much has Jesus become the collateral of a better covenant .
58007023	Many , indeed , have been made priests , because they are hindered from continuing by death .
58007024	But he , because he lives forever , has his priesthood unchangeable .
58007025	Therefore he is also able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him , seeing he ever lives to make intercession for them .
58007026	For such a high priest was fitting for us : holy , guiltless , undefiled , separated from sinners , and made higher than the heavens ;
58007027	who doesn't need , like those high priests , to daily offer up sacrifices , first for his own sins , and then for the sins of the people . For this he did once for all , when he offered up himself .
58007028	For the law appoints men high priests , having infirmity ; but the word of the oath , which was after the law , appoints a Son , perfected forevermore .
58008001	Now in the things which we are saying , the main point is this . We have such a high priest , who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens ,
58008002	a minister of the sanctuary , and of the true tent , which the Lord pitched , not man .
58008003	For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices . Therefore it is necessary that this high priest also have something to offer .
58008004	For if he were on earth , he would not be a priest at all , seeing there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law ;
58008005	who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things , even as Moses was warned by God when he was about to make the tent , for , " See , " he said , " that you make all things according to the pattern that was shown you on the mountain . "
58008006	But now he has obtained a more excellent ministry , by so much as he is also the mediator of a better covenant , which has been enacted on better promises .
58008007	For if that first covenant had been faultless , then no place would have been sought for a second .
58008008	For finding fault with them , he said , " Behold , the days come , " says the Lord , " That I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah ;
58008009	Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers , In the day that I took them by the hand to lead them forth out of the land of Egypt ; For they didn't continue in my covenant , And I disregarded them , " says the Lord .
58008010	" For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel . After those days , " says the Lord ; " I will put my laws into their mind , I will also write them on their heart . I will be to them a God , And they will be to me a people .
58008011	They will not teach every man his fellow citizen , Every man his brother , saying , ' Know the Lord , ' For all will know me , From the least of them to the greatest of them .
58008012	For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness . I will remember their sins and lawless deeds no more . "
58008013	In that he says , " A new covenant , " he has made the first old . But that which is becoming old and grows aged is near to vanishing away .
58009001	Now indeed even the first covenant had ordinances of divine service , and an earthly sanctuary .
58009002	For there was a tent prepared , the first , in which were the lampstand , the table , and the show bread ; which is called the Holy Place .
58009003	After the second veil , the tent which is called the Holy of Holies ,
58009004	having a golden altar of incense , and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold , in which was a golden pot holding the manna , Aaron's rod that budded , and the tables of the covenant ;
58009005	and above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat , of which things we can't now speak in detail .
58009006	Now these things having been thus prepared , the priests go in continually into the first tent , accomplishing the services ,
58009007	but into the second the high priest alone , once in the year , not without blood , which he offers for himself , and for the errors of the people .
58009008	The Holy Spirit is signifying this , that the way into the Holy Place has not yet been revealed , while the first tent is yet standing ;
58009009	which is an illustration of the present age , where gifts and sacrifices are offered that are incapable , concerning the conscience , of making the worshipper perfect ;
58009010	being only ( with meats and drinks and various washings ) fleshly ordinances , imposed until a time of reformation .
58009011	But Christ having come as a high priest of the coming good things , through the greater and more perfect tent , not made with hands , that is to say , not of this creation ,
58009012	nor yet through the blood of goats and calves , but through his own blood , entered in once for all into the Holy Place , having obtained eternal redemption .
58009013	For if the blood of goats and bulls , and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled , sanctify to the cleanness of the flesh :
58009014	how much more will the blood of Christ , who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God , cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God ?
58009015	For this cause he is the mediator of a new covenant , that a death having taken place for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant , those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance .
58009016	For where a last will and testament is , there must of necessity be the death of him who made it .
58009017	For a will is in force where there has been death , for it is never in force while he who made it lives .
58009018	Therefore even the first covenant has not been dedicated without blood .
58009019	For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the law , he took the blood of the calves and the goats , with water and scarlet wool and hyssop , and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people ,
58009020	saying , " This is the blood of the covenant which God commanded toward you . "
58009021	Moreover he sprinkled the tent and all the vessels of the ministry in like manner with the blood .
58009022	According to the law , nearly everything is cleansed with blood , and apart from shedding of blood there is no remission .
58009023	It was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these ; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these .
58009024	For Christ entered not into a holy place made with hands , similar in pattern to the true , but into heaven itself , now to appear before the face of God for us ;
58009025	nor yet that he should offer himself often , as the high priest enters into the holy place year by year with blood not his own ,
58009026	or else he must have suffered often since the foundation of the world . But now once at the end of the ages , he has been revealed to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself .
58009027	Inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once , and after this , judgment ,
58009028	so Christ also , having been once offered to bear the sins of many , will appear a second time , without sin , to those who are eagerly waiting for him for salvation .
58010001	For the law , having a shadow of the good to come , not the very image of the things , can never with the same sacrifices year by year , which they offer continually , make perfect those who draw near .
58010002	Or else wouldn't they have ceased to be offered , because the worshippers , having been once cleansed , would have had no more consciousness of sins ?
58010003	But in those sacrifices there is a memory made of sins year by year .
58010004	For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins .
58010005	Therefore when he comes into the world , he says , " Sacrifice and offering you didn't desire , But a body did you prepare for me ;
58010006	In whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin you had no pleasure .
58010007	Then I said , ' Behold , I have come ( In the scroll of the book it is written of me ) To do your will , God . ' "
58010008	Saying above , " Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin you didn't desire , neither had pleasure in them " ( those which are offered according to the law ) ,
58010009	then has he said , " Behold , I have come to do your will . " He takes away the first , that he may establish the second ,
58010010	by which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all .
58010011	Every priest indeed stands day by day ministering and often offering the same sacrifices , which can never take away sins ,
58010012	but he , when he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever , sat down on the right hand of God ;
58010013	henceforth expecting until his enemies to be made the footstool of his feet .
58010014	For by one offering he has perfected forever those who are sanctified .
58010015	The Holy Spirit also testifies to us , for after he has said ,
58010016	" This is the covenant that I will make with them : ' After those days , ' says the Lord , ' I will put my laws on their heart , I will also write them on their mind ; ' " then ,
58010017	" I will remember their sins and their iniquities no more . "
58010018	Now where remission of these is , there is no more offering for sin .
58010019	Having therefore , brothers , boldness to enter into the holy place by the blood of Jesus ,
58010020	by the way which he dedicated for us , a new and living way , through the veil , that is to say , his flesh ;
58010021	and having a great priest over the house of God ;
58010022	let us draw near with a true heart in fullness of faith , having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience , and having our body washed with pure water ,
58010023	let us hold fast the confession of our hope unyieldingly . For he who promised is faithful .
58010024	Let us consider how to provoke one another to love and good works ,
58010025	not forsaking our own assembling together , as the custom of some is , but exhorting one another ; and so much the more , as you see the Day approaching .
58010026	For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth , there remains no more a sacrifice for sins ,
58010027	but a certain fearful expectation of judgment , and a fierceness of fire which will devour the adversaries .
58010028	A man who has set at nothing Moses ' law dies without compassion on the word of two or three witnesses .
58010029	How much worse punishment , do you think , will he be judged worthy of , who has trodden under foot the Son of God , and has counted the blood of the covenant with which he was sanctified an unholy thing , and has insulted the Spirit of grace ?
58010030	For we know him who said , " Vengeance belongs to me , " says the Lord , " I will repay . " Again , " The Lord will judge his people . "
58010031	It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God .
58010032	But remember the former days , in which , after you were enlightened , you endured a great struggle with sufferings ;
58010033	partly , being exposed to both reproaches and oppressions ; and partly , becoming partakers with those who were treated so .
58010034	For you both had compassion on me in my chains , and joyfully accepted the plundering of your possessions , knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and an enduring one in the heavens .
58010035	Therefore don't throw away your boldness , which has a great reward .
58010036	For you need patience , so that , having done the will of God , you may receive the promise .
58010037	" For yet a very little while , He who comes will come , and will not wait .
58010038	But the righteous will live by faith . If he shrinks back , my soul has no pleasure in him . "
58010039	But we are not of those who shrink back to destruction , but of those who have faith to the saving of the soul .
58011001	Now faith is assurance of things hoped for , proof of things not seen .
58011002	For by this , the elders obtained testimony .
58011003	By faith , we understand that the universe has been framed by the word of God , so that what is seen has not been made out of things which are visible .
58011004	By faith , Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain , through which he had testimony given to him that he was righteous , God bearing witness with respect to his gifts ; and through it he , being dead , still speaks .
58011005	By faith , Enoch was translated , so that he should not see death , and he was not found , because God translated him . For he has had testimony given to him that before his translation he had been well pleasing to God .
58011006	Without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to him , for he who comes to God must believe that he exists , and that he is a rewarder of those who seek him .
58011007	By faith , Noah , being warned about things not yet seen , moved with godly fear , prepared an ark for the saving of his house , through which he condemned the world , and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith .
58011008	By faith , Abraham , when he was called , obeyed to go out to the place which he was to receive for an inheritance . He went out , not knowing where he went .
58011009	By faith , he lived as an alien in the land of promise , as in a land not his own , dwelling in tents , with Isaac and Jacob , the heirs with him of the same promise .
58011010	For he looked for the city which has the foundations , whose builder and maker is God .
58011011	By faith , even Sarah herself received power to conceive , and she bore a child when she was past age , since she counted him faithful who had promised .
58011012	Therefore they were fathered by one , and him as good as dead , as many as the stars of the sky in multitude , and as innumerable as the sand which is by the sea shore .
58011013	These all died in faith , not having received the promises , but having seen them and embraced them from afar , and having confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth .
58011014	For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking after a country of their own .
58011015	If indeed they had been thinking of that country from which they went out , they would have had enough time to return .
58011016	But now they desire a better country , that is , a heavenly one . Therefore God is not ashamed of them , to be called their God , for he has prepared a city for them .
58011017	By faith , Abraham , being tested , offered up Isaac . Yes , he who had gladly received the promises was offering up his one and only son ;
58011018	even he to whom it was said , " In Isaac will your seed be called ; "
58011019	accounting that God is able to raise up , even from the dead . Figuratively speaking , he also did receive him back from the dead .
58011020	By faith , Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau , even concerning things to come .
58011021	By faith , Jacob , when he was dying , blessed each of the sons of Joseph , and worshipped , leaning on the top of his staff .
58011022	By faith , Joseph , when his end was near , made mention of the departure of the children of Israel ; and gave instructions concerning his bones .
58011023	By faith , Moses , when he was born , was hidden for three months by his parents , because they saw that he was a beautiful child , and they were not afraid of the king's commandment .
58011024	By faith , Moses , when he had grown up , refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter ,
58011025	choosing rather to share ill treatment with the people of God , than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a time ;
58011026	accounting the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt ; for he looked to the reward .
58011027	By faith , he left Egypt , not fearing the wrath of the king ; for he endured , as seeing him who is invisible .
58011028	By faith , he kept the Passover , and the sprinkling of the blood , that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch them .
58011029	By faith , they passed through the Red sea as by dry land . When the Egyptians tried to do so , they were swallowed up .
58011030	By faith , the walls of Jericho fell down , after they had been encircled for seven days .
58011031	By faith , Rahab , the prostitute , didn't perish with those who were disobedient , having received the spies in peace .
58011032	What will I more say ? For the time will fail me if I tell of Gideon , Barak , Samson , Jephthah , David , Samuel , and the prophets ;
58011033	who , through faith , subdued kingdoms , worked out righteousness , obtained promises , stopped the mouths of lions ,
58011034	quenched the power of fire , escaped the edge of the sword , from weakness were made strong , grew mighty in war , and turned to flight armies of aliens .
58011035	Women received their dead by resurrection . Others were tortured , not accepting their deliverance , that they might obtain a better resurrection .
58011036	Others were tried by mocking and scourging , yes , moreover by bonds and imprisonment .
58011037	They were stoned . They were sawn apart . They were tempted . They were slain with the sword . They went around in sheepskins , in goatskins ; being destitute , afflicted , ill-treated
58011038	( of whom the world was not worthy ) , wandering in deserts and mountains and caves , and the holes of the earth .
58011039	These all , having had testimony given to them through their faith , didn't receive the promise ,
58011040	God having provided some better thing concerning us , so that apart from us they should not be made perfect .
58012001	Therefore let us also , seeing we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses , lay aside every weight and the sin which so easily entangles us , and let us run with patience the race that is set before us ,
58012002	looking to Jesus , the author and perfecter of faith , who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross , despising shame , and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God .
58012003	For consider him who has endured such contradiction of sinners against himself , that you don't grow weary , fainting in your souls .
58012004	You have not yet resisted to blood , striving against sin ;
58012005	and you have forgotten the exhortation which reasons with you as with sons , " My son , don't take lightly the chastening of the Lord , Nor faint when you are reproved by him ;
58012006	For whom the Lord loves , he chastens , And scourges every son whom he receives . "
58012007	It is for discipline that you endure . God deals with you as with sons , for what son is there whom his father doesn't discipline ?
58012008	But if you are without discipline , whereof all have been made partakers , then are you illegitimate , and not sons .
58012009	Furthermore , we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us , and we paid them respect . Shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits , and live ?
58012010	For they indeed , for a few days , punished us as seemed good to them ; but he for our profit , that we may be partakers of his holiness .
58012011	All chastening seems for the present to be not joyous but grievous ; yet afterward it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised thereby .
58012012	Therefore , lift up the hands that hang down and the feeble knees ,
58012013	and make straight paths for your feet , that that which is lame may not be dislocated , but rather be healed .
58012014	Follow after peace with all men , and the sanctification without which no man will see the Lord ,
58012015	looking carefully lest there be any man who falls short of the grace of God ; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you , and thereby the many be defiled ;
58012016	lest there be any sexually immoral person , or profane person , as Esau , who sold his birthright for one meal .
58012017	For you know that even when he afterward desired to inherit the blessing , he was rejected , for he found no place for a change of mind though he sought it diligently with tears .
58012018	For you have not come to a mountain that might be touched , and that burned with fire , and to blackness , darkness , tempest ,
58012019	the sound of a trumpet , and the voice of words ; which those who heard it begged that not one more word should be spoken to them ,
58012020	for they could not stand that which was enjoined , " If even a animal touch the mountain , it will be stoned ; "
58012021	and so fearful was the appearance , that Moses said , " I am terrified and trembling . "
58012022	But you have come to Mount Zion , and to the city of the living God , the heavenly Jerusalem , and to innumerable hosts of angels ,
58012023	to the general assembly and assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven , to God , the Judge of all , to the spirits of just men made perfect ,
58012024	to Jesus , the mediator of a new covenant , and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better than that of Abel .
58012025	See that you don't refuse him who speaks . For if they didn't escape when they refused him who warned on the Earth , how much more will we not escape who turn away from him who warns from heaven ,
58012026	whose voice shook the earth , then , but now he has promised , saying , " Yet once more will I shake not only the earth , but also the heavens . "
58012027	This phrase , " Yet once more , " signifies the removing of those things that are shaken , as of things that have been made , that those things which are not shaken may remain .
58012028	Therefore , receiving a kingdom that can't be shaken , let us have grace , whereby we may offer service well pleasing to God , with reverence and awe ,
58012029	for our God is a consuming fire .
58013001	Let brotherly love continue .
58013002	Don't forget to show hospitality to strangers , for in doing so , some have entertained angels without knowing it .
58013003	Remember those who are in bonds , as bound with them ; and those who are ill-treated , since you are also in the body .
58013004	Let marriage be held in honor among all , and let the bed be undefiled : but God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterers .
58013005	Be free from the love of money , content with such things as you have , for he has said , " I will in no way leave you , neither will I in any way forsake you . "
58013006	So that with good courage we say , " The Lord is my helper . I will not fear . What will man do to me ? "
58013007	Remember your leaders , men who spoke to you the word of God , and considering the results of their conduct , imitate their faith .
58013008	Jesus Christ is the same yesterday , today , and forever .
58013009	Don't be carried away by various and strange teachings , for it is good that the heart be established by grace , not by food , through which those who were so occupied were not benefited .
58013010	We have an altar from which those who serve the holy tent have no right to eat .
58013011	For the bodies of those animals , whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin , are burned outside of the camp .
58013012	Therefore Jesus also , that he might sanctify the people through his own blood , suffered outside of the gate .
58013013	Let us therefore go forth to him outside of the camp , bearing his reproach .
58013014	For we don't have here an enduring city , but we seek that which is to come .
58013015	Through him , then , let us offer up a sacrifice of praise to God continually , that is , the fruit of lips which make confession to his name .
58013016	But don't forget to be doing good and sharing , for with such sacrifices God is well pleased .
58013017	Obey those who have the rule over you , and submit to them , for they watch on behalf of your souls , as those who will give account , that they may do this with joy , and not with groaning , for that would be unprofitable for you .
58013018	Pray for us , for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience , desiring to live honorably in all things .
58013019	I strongly urge you to do this , that I may be restored to you sooner .
58013020	Now may the God of peace , who brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep with the blood of an eternal covenant , our Lord Jesus ,
58013021	make you complete in every good work to do his will , working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight , through Jesus Christ , to whom be the glory forever and ever . Amen .
58013022	But I exhort you , brothers , endure the word of exhortation , for I have written to you in few words .
58013023	Know that our brother Timothy has been freed , with whom , if he comes shortly , I will see you .
58013024	Greet all of your leaders and all the saints . The Italians Greet you .
58013025	Grace be with you all . Amen .
59001001	James , a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ , to the twelve tribes which are in the Dispersion : greetings .
59001002	Count it all joy , my brothers , when you fall into various temptations ,
59001003	Knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience .
59001004	Let patience have its perfect work , that you may be perfect and complete , lacking in nothing .
59001005	But if any of you lacks wisdom , let him ask of God , who gives to all liberally and without reproach ; and it will be given him .
59001006	But let him ask in faith , without any doubting , for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea , driven by the wind and tossed .
59001007	For let that man not think that he will receive anything from the Lord .
59001008	He is a double-minded man , unstable in all his ways .
59001009	But let the brother in humble circumstances glory in his high position ;
59001010	and the rich , in that he is made humble , because like the flower in the grass , he will pass away .
59001011	For the sun arises with the scorching wind , and withers the grass , and the flower in it falls , and the beauty of its appearance perishes . So also will the rich man fade away in his pursuits .
59001012	Blessed is the man who endures temptation , for when he has been approved , he will receive the crown of life , which the Lord promised to those who love him .
59001013	Let no man say when he is tempted , " I am tempted by God , " for God can't be tempted with evil , and he himself tempts no one .
59001014	But each one is tempted , when he is drawn away by his own lust , and enticed .
59001015	Then the lust , when it has conceived , bears sin ; and the sin , when it is full grown , brings forth death .
59001016	Don't be deceived , my beloved brothers .
59001017	Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above , coming down from the Father of lights , with whom can be no variation , nor turning shadow .
59001018	Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth , that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures .
59001019	So , then , my beloved brothers , let every man be swift to hear , slow to speak , and slow to anger ;
59001020	for the anger of man doesn't produce the righteousness of God .
59001021	Therefore , putting away all filthiness and overflowing of wickedness , receive with humility the implanted word , which is able to save your souls .
59001022	But be doers of the word , and not only hearers , deluding your own selves .
59001023	For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer , he is like a man beholding his natural face in a mirror ;
59001024	for he sees himself , and goes away , and immediately forgets what kind of man he was .
59001025	But he who looks into the perfect law , the law of freedom , and continues , not being a hearer who forgets but a doer of the work , this man will be blessed in what he does .
59001026	If anyone among you thinks himself to be religious , while he doesn't bridle his tongue , but deceives his heart , this man's religion is worthless .
59001027	Pure religion and undefiled before our God and Father is this : to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction , and to keep oneself unstained by the world .
59002001	My brothers , don't hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ , [ the Lord ] of glory , with respect of persons .
59002002	For if a man with a gold ring , in fine clothing , comes into your assembly , and there come in also a poor man in filthy clothing ;
59002003	and you pay special attention to him who wears the fine clothing , and say , " Sit here in a good place ; " and you tell the poor man , " Stand there , " or " Sit by my footstool ; "
59002004	haven't you shown partiality among yourselves , and become judges with evil thoughts ?
59002005	Listen , my beloved brothers . Didn't God choose those who are poor in this world to be rich in faith , and heirs of the kingdom which he promised to those who love him ?
59002006	But you have dishonored the poor man . Don't the rich oppress you , and personally drag you before the courts ?
59002007	Don't they blaspheme the honorable name by which you are called ?
59002008	However , if you fulfill the royal law , according to the Scripture , " You shall love your neighbor as yourself , " you do well .
59002009	But if you show partiality , you commit sin , being convicted by the law as transgressors .
59002010	For whoever shall keep the whole law , and yet stumble in one point , he has become guilty of all .
59002011	For he who said , " Do not commit adultery , " said also , " Do not commit murder . " Now if you do not commit adultery , but murder , you have become a transgressor of the law .
59002012	So speak , and so do , as men who are to be judged by a law of freedom .
59002013	For judgment is without mercy to him who has showed no mercy . Mercy triumphs over judgment .
59002014	What good is it , my brothers , if a man says he has faith , but has no works ? Can that faith save him ?
59002015	And if a brother or sister is naked and in lack of daily food ,
59002016	and one of you tells them , " Go in peace , be warmed and filled ; " and yet you didn't give them the things the body needs , what good is it ?
59002017	Even so faith , if it has no works , is dead in itself .
59002018	Yes , a man will say , " You have faith , and I have works . " Show me your faith without your works , and I by my works will show you my faith .
59002019	You believe that God is one . You do well . The demons also believe , and shudder .
59002020	But do you want to know , vain man , that faith apart from works is dead ?
59002021	Wasn't Abraham , our father , justified by works , in that he offered up Isaac his son on the altar ?
59002022	You see that faith worked with his works , and by works faith was perfected ;
59002023	and the scripture was fulfilled which says , " Abraham believed God , and it was accounted to him as righteousness ; " and he was called the friend of God .
59002024	You see then that by works , a man is justified , and not only by faith .
59002025	In like manner wasn't Rahab the prostitute also justified by works , in that she received the messengers , and sent them out another way ?
59002026	For as the body apart from the spirit is dead , even so faith apart from works is dead .
59003001	Let not many of you be teachers , my brothers , knowing that we will receive heavier judgment .
59003002	For in many things we all stumble . If anyone doesn't stumble in word , the same is a perfect man , able to bridle the whole body also .
59003003	Indeed , we put bits into the horses ' mouths so that they may obey us , and we turn about their whole body .
59003004	Behold , the ships also , though they are so big and are driven by fierce winds , are yet turned about by a very small rudder , wherever the pilot desires .
59003005	So the tongue is also a little member , and boasts great things . Behold , how much wood is kindled by how small a fire !
59003006	And the tongue is a fire . The world of iniquity among our members is the tongue , which defiles the whole body , and sets on fire the course of nature , and is set on fire by Gehenna .
59003007	For every kind of animal , bird , creeping thing , and thing in the sea , is tamed , and has been tamed by mankind .
59003008	But nobody can tame the tongue . It is a restless evil , full of deadly poison .
59003009	With it we bless our God and Father , and with it we curse men , who are made in the image of God .
59003010	Out of the same mouth comes forth blessing and cursing . My brothers , these things ought not to be so .
59003011	Does a spring send forth from the same opening fresh and bitter water ?
59003012	Can a fig tree , my brothers , yield olives , or a vine figs ? Thus no spring yields both salt water and fresh water .
59003013	Who is wise and understanding among you ? Let him show his deeds done in gentleness of wisdom by his good life .
59003014	But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart , don't boast and don't lie against the truth .
59003015	This wisdom is not that which comes down from above , but is earthly , sensual , and demonic .
59003016	For where jealousy and selfish ambition are , there is confusion and every evil deed .
59003017	But the wisdom that is from above is first pure , then peaceful , gentle , reasonable , full of mercy and good fruits , without partiality , and without hypocrisy .
59003018	Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace .
59004001	Where do wars and fightings among you come from ? Don't they come from your pleasures that war in your members ?
59004002	You lust , and don't have . You kill , covet , and can't obtain . You fight and make war . Yet you don't have , because you don't ask .
59004003	You ask , and don't receive , because you ask amiss , so that you may spend it for your pleasures .
59004004	You adulterers and adulteresses , don't you know that friendship with the world is enmity with God ? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God .
59004005	Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain , " The Spirit who lives in us yearns jealously " ?
59004006	But he gives more grace . Therefore it says , " God resists the proud , but gives grace to the humble . "
59004007	Be subject therefore to God . But resist the devil , and he will flee from you .
59004008	Draw near to God , and he will draw near to you . Cleanse your hands , you sinners ; and purify your hearts , you double-minded .
59004009	Lament , mourn , and weep . Let your laughter be turned to mourning , and your joy to gloom .
59004010	Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord , and he will exalt you .
59004011	Don't speak against one another , brothers . He who speaks against a brother and judges his brother , speaks against the law and judges the law . But if you judge the law , you are not a doer of the law , but a judge .
59004012	Only one is the lawgiver , who is able to save and to destroy . But who are you to judge another ?
59004013	Come now , you who say , " Today or tomorrow let's go into this city , and spend a year there , and trade , and get gain . "
59004014	Whereas you don't know what your life will be like tomorrow . For what is your life ? For you are a vapor , that appears for a little time , and then vanishes away .
59004015	For you ought to say , " If the Lord wills , we will both live , and do this or that . "
59004016	But now you glory in your boasting . All such boasting is evil .
59004017	To him therefore who knows to do good , and doesn't do it , to him it is sin .
59005001	Come now , you rich , weep and howl for your miseries that are coming on you .
59005002	Your riches are corrupted and your garments are moth-eaten .
59005003	Your gold and your silver are corroded , and their corrosion will be for a testimony against you , and will eat your flesh like fire . You have laid up your treasure in the last days .
59005004	Behold , the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields , which you have kept back by fraud , cries out , and the cries of those who reaped have entered into the ears of the Lord of Hosts .
59005005	You have lived delicately on the earth , and taken your pleasure . You have nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter .
59005006	You have condemned , you have murdered the righteous one . He doesn't resist you .
59005007	Be patient therefore , brothers , until the coming of the Lord . Behold , the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth , being patient over it , until it receives the early and late rain .
59005008	You also be patient . Establish your hearts , for the coming of the Lord is at hand .
59005009	Don't grumble , brothers , against one another , so that you won't be judged . Behold , the judge stands at the door .
59005010	Take , brothers , for an example of suffering and of patience , the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord .
59005011	Behold , we call them blessed who endured . You have heard of the patience of Job , and have seen the Lord in the end , and how the Lord is full of compassion and mercy .
59005012	But above all things , my brothers , don't swear , neither by heaven , nor by the earth , nor by any other oath ; but let your yes be yes , and your no , no ; so that you don't fall into hypocrisy .
59005013	Is any among you suffering ? Let him pray . Is any cheerful ? Let him sing praises .
59005014	Is any among you sick ? Let him call for the elders of the assembly , and let them pray over him , anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord ,
59005015	and the prayer of faith will heal him who is sick , and the Lord will raise him up . If he has committed sins , it will be forgiven him .
59005016	Confess your offenses one to another , and pray one for another , that you may be healed . The effective , earnest prayer of a righteous man is powerfully effective .
59005017	Elijah was a man with a nature like ours , and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain , and it didn't rain on the earth for three years and six months .
59005018	He prayed again , and the sky gave rain , and the earth brought forth its fruit .
59005019	Brothers , if any among you wanders from the truth , and someone turns him back ,
59005020	let him know , that he who converts a sinner from the error of his way will save a soul from death , and will cover a multitude of sins .
60001001	Peter , an apostle of Jesus Christ , to the chosen ones who are living as aliens in the Dispersion in Pontus , Galatia , Cappadocia , Asia , and Bithynia ,
60001002	according to the foreknowledge of God the Father , in sanctification of the Spirit , to obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ : Grace to you and peace be multiplied .
60001003	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who according to his great mercy became the father of us again to a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead ,
60001004	to an incorruptible and undefiled inheritance , and that doesn't fade away , reserved in heaven for you ,
60001005	who by the power of God are guarded through faith to a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time .
60001006	Wherein you greatly rejoice , though now for a little while , if need be , you have been put to grief in various trials ,
60001007	that the proof of your faith , which is more precious than gold that perishes even though it is tested by fire , may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ - -
60001008	whom not having known you love ; on whom , though now you don't see him , yet believing , you rejoice greatly with joy unspeakable and full of glory - -
60001009	receiving the end of your faith , the salvation of your souls .
60001010	Concerning this salvation , the prophets sought and searched diligently , who prophesied of the grace that would come to you ,
60001011	searching for what or what kind of time the Spirit of Christ , which was in them , pointed to , when he testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ , and the glories that should follow them .
60001012	To whom it was revealed , that not to themselves , but to you , did they minister these things , which now have been announced to you through those who preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent forth from heaven ; which things angels desire to look into .
60001013	Therefore , prepare your minds for action , be sober and set your hope perfectly on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ - -
60001014	as children of obedience , not conforming yourselves according to your former lusts as in your ignorance ,
60001015	but just as he who called you is holy , you yourselves also be holy in all of your behavior ;
60001016	because it is written , " You shall be holy ; for I am holy . "
60001017	If you call on him as Father , who without respect of persons judges according to each man's work , pass the time of your living as strangers here in reverent fear :
60001018	knowing that you were redeemed , not with corruptible things , with silver or gold , from the useless way of life handed down from your fathers ,
60001019	but with precious blood , as of a lamb without spot , the blood of Christ ;
60001020	who was foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world , but was revealed at the end of times for your sake ,
60001021	who through him are believers in God , that raised him from the dead , and gave him glory ; so that your faith and hope might be in God .
60001022	Seeing you have purified your souls in your obedience to the truth through the Spirit in sincere brotherly affection , love one another from the heart fervently :
60001023	having been born again , not of corruptible seed , but of incorruptible , through the word of God , which lives and remains forever .
60001024	For , " All flesh is like grass , And all of man's glory like the flower in the grass . The grass withers , and its flower falls ;
60001025	But the Lord's word endures forever . " This is the word of good news which was preached to you .
60002001	Putting away therefore all wickedness , all deceit , hypocrisies , envies , and all evil speaking ,
60002002	as newborn babes , long for the pure milk of the Word , that you may grow thereby ,
60002003	if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is gracious :
60002004	coming to him , a living stone , rejected indeed by men , but chosen by God , precious .
60002005	You also , as living stones , are built up as a spiritual house , to be a holy priesthood , to offer up spiritual sacrifices , acceptable to God through Jesus Christ .
60002006	Because it is contained in scripture , " Behold , I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone , elect , precious : He who believes in him will not be put to shame . "
60002007	For you therefore who believe is the honor , but for such as are disobedient , " The stone which the builders rejected , Has become the chief cornerstone , "
60002008	and , " A stone of stumbling , and a rock of offense . " For they stumble at the word , being disobedient , whereunto also they were appointed .
60002009	But you are an elect race , a royal priesthood , a holy nation , a people for God's own possession , that you may show forth the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light :
60002010	who in time past were no people , but now are the people of God , who had not obtained mercy , but now have obtained mercy .
60002011	Beloved , I beg you as sojourners and pilgrims , to abstain from fleshly lust , which war against the soul ;
60002012	having good behavior among the nations , so in that which they speak against you as evil-doers , they may by your good works , which they see , glorify God in the day of visitation .
60002013	Therefore subject yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake : whether to the king , as supreme ;
60002014	or to governors , as sent by him for vengeance on evil-doers and for praise to those who do well .
60002015	For so is the will of God , that by well-doing you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men :
60002016	as free , and not using your freedom for a cloak of wickedness , but as bondservants of God .
60002017	Honor all men . Love the brotherhood . Fear God . Honor the king .
60002018	Servants , be in subjection to your masters with all fear ; not only to the good and gentle , but also to the wicked .
60002019	For it is commendable if someone endures pain , suffering unjustly , because of conscience toward God .
60002020	For what glory is it , if , when you sin , you patiently endure beating ? But if , when you do well , you patiently endure suffering , this is commendable with God .
60002021	For to this were you called , because Christ also suffered for us , leaving us an example , that you should follow his steps ,
60002022	who did not sin , " neither was deceit found in his mouth . "
60002023	Who , when he was reviled , didn't revile back . When he suffered , didn't threaten , but committed himself to him who judges righteously ;
60002024	who his own self bore our sins in his body on the tree , that we , having died to sins , might live to righteousness ; by whose stripes you were healed .
60002025	For you were going astray like sheep ; but are now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls .
60003001	In like manner , wives , be in subjection to your own husbands ; so that , even if any don't obey the Word , they may be gained by the behavior of their wives without a word ;
60003002	seeing your pure behavior in fear .
60003003	Let your beauty be not just the outward adorning of braiding the hair , and of wearing jewels of gold , or of putting on fine clothing ;
60003004	but in the hidden person of the heart , in the incorruptible adornment of a gentle and quiet spirit , which is in the sight of God very precious .
60003005	For this is how the holy women before , who hoped in God , also adorned themselves , being in subjection to their own husbands :
60003006	as Sarah obeyed Abraham , calling him lord , whose children you now are , if you do well , and are not put in fear by any terror .
60003007	You husbands , in like manner , live with your wives according to knowledge , giving honor to the woman , as to the weaker vessel , as being also joint heirs of the grace of life ; not cutting off your prayers .
60003008	Finally , be all like-minded , compassionate , loving as brothers , tenderhearted , courteous ,
60003009	not rendering evil for evil , or reviling for reviling ; but instead blessing ; knowing that to this were you called , that you may inherit a blessing .
60003010	For , " He who would love life , And see good days , Let him keep his tongue from evil , And his lips from speaking deceit .
60003011	Let him turn away from evil , and do good . Let him seek peace , and pursue it .
60003012	For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous , And his ears open to their prayer ; But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil . "
60003013	Now who is he who will harm you , if you become imitators of that which is good ?
60003014	But even if you should suffer for righteousness ' sake , you are blessed . " Don't fear what they fear , neither be troubled . "
60003015	But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts : and always be ready to give an answer to everyone who asks you a reason concerning the hope that is in you , with humility and fear :
60003016	having a good conscience ; that , while you are spoken against as evildoers , they may be put to shame who revile your good manner of life in Christ .
60003017	For it is better , if the will of God should so will , that you suffer for doing well than for doing evil .
60003018	Because Christ also suffered for sins once , the righteous for the unrighteous , that he might bring you to God ; being put to death in the flesh , but made alive in the spirit ;
60003019	in which he also went and preached to the spirits in prison ,
60003020	who before were disobedient , when the longsuffering of God waited patiently in the days of Noah , while the ark was being built . In it , few , that is , eight souls , were saved through water .
60003021	This is a symbol of baptism , which now saves you - not the putting away of the filth of the flesh , but the answer of a good conscience toward God , through the resurrection of Jesus Christ ,
60003022	who is at the right hand of God , having gone into heaven , angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him .
60004001	Forasmuch then as Christ suffered for us in the flesh , arm yourselves also with the same mind ; for he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin ;
60004002	that you no longer should live the rest of your time in the flesh to the lusts of men , but to the will of God .
60004003	For we have spent enough of our past time living in doing the desire of the Gentiles , and to have walked in lasciviousness , lusts , drunken binges , orgies , carousings , and abominable idolatries .
60004004	They think it is strange that you don't run with them into the same excess of riot , blaspheming :
60004005	who will give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead .
60004006	For to this end was the gospel preached even to the dead , that they might be judged indeed as men in the flesh , but live as to God in the spirit .
60004007	But the end of all things is near . Therefore be of sound mind , self-controlled , and sober in prayer .
60004008	And above all things be earnest in your love among yourselves , for love covers a multitude of sins .
60004009	Be hospitable one to another without grumbling .
60004010	According as each has received a gift , be ministering it among yourselves , as good stewards of the grace of God in its various forms .
60004011	If any man speaks , let it be as it were oracles of God . If any man serves , let it be as of the strength which God supplies , that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ , whose is the glory and the dominion forever and ever . Amen .
60004012	Beloved , don't be astonished at the fiery trial which has come upon you , to test you , as though a strange thing happened to you .
60004013	But because you are partakers of Christ's sufferings , rejoice ; that at the revelation of his glory also you may rejoice with exceeding joy .
60004014	If you are insulted for the name of Christ , blessed are you ; because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you . On their part he is blasphemed , but on your part he is glorified .
60004015	For let none of you suffer as a murderer , or a thief , or an evil doer , or as a meddler in other men's matters .
60004016	But if one of you suffers for being a Christian , let him not be ashamed ; but let him glorify God in this matter .
60004017	For the time [ has come ] for judgment to begin at the house of God . If it begins first at us , what will happen to those who don't obey the gospel of God ?
60004018	" If it is hard for the righteous to be saved , what will happen to the ungodly and the sinner ? "
60004019	Therefore let them also who suffer according to the will of God in doing good entrust their souls to him , as to a faithful Creator .
60005001	I exhort the elders among you , as a fellow elder , and a witness of the sufferings of Christ , and who will also share in the glory that will be revealed .
60005002	Tend the flock of God which is among you , exercising the oversight , not under compulsion , but voluntarily , not for dishonest gain , but willingly ;
60005003	neither as lording it over the charge allotted to you , but making yourselves examples to the flock .
60005004	When the chief Shepherd will be revealed , you will receive the crown of glory that doesn't fade away .
60005005	Likewise , you younger ones , be subject to the elder . Yes , all of you gird yourselves with humility , to subject yourselves to one another ; for " God resists the proud , but gives grace to the humble . "
60005006	Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God , that he may exalt you in due time ;
60005007	casting all your worries on him , because he cares for you .
60005008	Be sober and self-controlled . Be watchful . Your adversary the devil , walks about like a roaring lion , seeking whom he may devour .
60005009	Withstand him steadfast in your faith , knowing that your brothers who are in the world are undergoing the same sufferings .
60005010	But may the God of all grace ( who called you to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus ) , after you have suffered a while , perfect , establish , strengthen , and settle you .
60005011	To him be the glory and the power forever and ever . Amen .
60005012	Through Silvanus , our faithful brother , as I consider him , I have written to you briefly , exhorting , and testifying that this is the true grace of God in which you stand .
60005013	She who is in Babylon , elect together with you , greets you ; and so does Mark , my son .
60005014	Greet one another with a kiss of love . Peace be to you all who are in Christ Jesus . Amen .
61001001	Simon Peter , a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ , to those who have obtained a like precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God and Savior , Jesus Christ :
61001002	Grace to you and peace be multiplied in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord ,
61001003	seeing that his divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness , through the knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and virtue ;
61001004	whereby he has granted to us his precious and exceedingly great promises ; that through these you may become partakers of the divine nature , having escaped from the corruption that is in that world by lust .
61001005	Yes , and for this very cause adding on your part all diligence , in your faith supply moral excellence ; and in moral excellence , knowledge ;
61001006	and in knowledge , self-control ; and in self-control patience ; and in patience godliness ;
61001007	and in godliness brotherly affection ; and in brotherly affection , love .
61001008	For if these things are yours and abound , they make you to be not idle nor unfruitful to the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ .
61001009	For he who lacks these things is blind , seeing only what is near , having forgotten the cleansing from his old sins .
61001010	Therefore , brothers , be more diligent to make your calling and election sure . For if you do these things , you will never stumble .
61001011	For thus will be richly supplied to you the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior , Jesus Christ .
61001012	Therefore I will not be negligent to remind you of these things , though you know them , and are established in the present truth .
61001013	I think it right , as long as I am in this tent , to stir you up by reminding you ;
61001014	knowing that the putting off of my tent comes swiftly , even as our Lord , Jesus Christ , made clear to me .
61001015	Yes , I will make every effort that you may always be able to remember these things even after my departure .
61001016	For we did not follow cunningly devised fables , when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord , Jesus Christ , but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty .
61001017	For he received from God the Father honor and glory , when the voice came to him from the Majestic Glory , " This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased . "
61001018	This voice we heard come out of heaven , when we were with him in the holy mountain .
61001019	We have the more sure word of prophecy ; whereunto you do well that you take heed , as to a lamp shining in a dark place , until the day dawns , and the day star arises in your hearts :
61001020	knowing this first , that no prophecy of scripture is of private interpretation .
61001021	For no prophecy ever came by the will of man : but holy men of God spoke , being moved by the Holy Spirit .
61002001	But there also arose false prophets among the people , as among you also there will be false teachers , who will secretly bring in destructive heresies , denying even the Master who bought them , bringing on themselves swift destruction .
61002002	Many will follow their destructive ways , and as a result , the way of the truth will be maligned .
61002003	In covetousness will they exploit you with deceptive words : whose sentence now from of old doesn't linger , and their destruction will not slumber .
61002004	For if God didn't spare angels when they sinned , but cast them down to Tartarus , and committed them to pits of darkness , to be reserved to judgment ;
61002005	and didn't spare the ancient world , but preserved Noah with seven others , a preacher of righteousness , when he brought a flood on the world of the ungodly ;
61002006	and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes , condemned them to destruction , having made them an example to those who would live ungodly ;
61002007	and delivered righteous Lot , very distressed by the lustful life of the wicked
61002008	( for that righteous man dwelling among them , in seeing and hearing , tormented his righteous soul from day to day with lawless deeds ) :
61002009	the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation , and to keep the unrighteous under punishment to the day of judgment ;
61002010	but chiefly those who walk after the flesh in the lust of defilement , and despise authority . Daring , self-willed , they are not afraid to speak evil of dignitaries ;
61002011	whereas angels , though greater in might and power , don't bring a railing judgment against them before the Lord .
61002012	But these , as creatures without reason , born mere animals to be taken and destroyed , speaking evil in matters about which they are ignorant , will in their destroying surely be destroyed ,
61002013	receiving the wages of unrighteousness ; people who count it pleasure to revel in the day-time , spots and blemishes , reveling in their deceit while they feast with you ;
61002014	having eyes full of adultery , and who can't cease from sin ; enticing unsettled souls ; having a heart trained in greed ; children of cursing ;
61002015	forsaking the right way , they went astray , having followed the way of Balaam the son of Beor , who loved the wages of wrong-doing ;
61002016	but he was rebuked for his own disobedience . A mute donkey spoke with man's voice and stopped the madness of the prophet .
61002017	These are wells without water , clouds driven by a storm ; for whom the blackness of darkness has been reserved forever .
61002018	For , uttering great swelling words of emptiness , they entice in the lusts of the flesh , by licentiousness , those who are indeed escaping from those who live in error ;
61002019	promising them liberty , while they themselves are bondservants of corruption ; for by whom a man is overcome , by the same is he also brought into bondage .
61002020	For if , after they have escaped the defilement of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior , Jesus Christ , they are again entangled therein and overcome , the last state has become worse with them than the first .
61002021	For it would be better for them not to have known the way of righteousness , than , after knowing it , to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them .
61002022	But it has happened to them according to the true proverb , " The dog turns to his own vomit again , " and " the sow that had washed to wallowing in the mire . "
61003001	This is now , beloved , the second letter that I have written to you ; and in both of them I stir up your sincere mind by reminding you ;
61003002	that you should remember the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets , and the commandments of us , the apostles of the Lord and Savior :
61003003	knowing this first , that in the last days mockers will come , walking after their own lusts ,
61003004	and saying , " Where is the promise of his coming ? " For , from the day that the fathers fell asleep , all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation .
61003005	For this they willfully forget , that there were heavens from of old , and an earth formed out of water and amid water , by the word of God ;
61003006	by which means the world that then was , being overflowed with water , perished .
61003007	But the heavens that now are , and the earth , by the same word have been stored up for fire , being reserved against the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men .
61003008	But don't forget this one thing , beloved , that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years , and a thousand years as one day .
61003009	The Lord is not slow concerning his promise , as some count slowness ; but is longsuffering towards us , not wishing that any should perish , but that all should come to repentance .
61003010	But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night ; in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise , and the elements will be dissolved with fervent heat , and the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up .
61003011	Therefore since all these things are thus to be destroyed , what manner of persons ought you to be in holy living and godliness ,
61003012	looking for and earnestly desiring the coming of the day of God , by reason of which the heavens being on fire will be dissolved , and the elements will melt with fervent heat ?
61003013	But , according to his promise , we look for new heavens and a new earth , in which dwells righteousness .
61003014	Therefore , beloved , seeing that you look for these things , be diligent to be found in peace , without blemish and blameless in his sight .
61003015	Regard the patience of our Lord as salvation ; even as our beloved brother Paul also , according to the wisdom given to him , wrote to you ;
61003016	as also in all of his letters , speaking in them of these things . In those are some things hard to be understood , which the ignorant and unsettled twist , as they do also to the other scriptures , to their own destruction .
61003017	You therefore , beloved , knowing these things beforehand , beware lest , being carried away with the error of the wicked , you fall from your own steadfastness .
61003018	But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ . To him be the glory both now and forever . Amen .
62001001	That which was from the beginning , that which we have heard , that which we have seen with our eyes , that which we saw , and our hands touched , concerning the Word of life
62001002	( and the life was revealed , and we have seen , and testify , and declare to you the life , the eternal life , which was with the Father , and was revealed to us ) ;
62001003	that which we have seen and heard we declare to you , that you also may have fellowship with us . Yes , and our fellowship is with the Father , and with his Son , Jesus Christ .
62001004	And we write these things to you , that our joy may be fulfilled .
62001005	This is the message which we have heard from him and announce to you , that God is light , and in him is no darkness at all .
62001006	If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness , we lie , and don't tell the truth .
62001007	But if we walk in the light , as he is in the light , we have fellowship with one another , and the blood of Jesus Christ , his Son , cleanses us from all sin .
62001008	If we say that we have no sin , we deceive ourselves , and the truth is not in us .
62001009	If we confess our sins , he is faithful and righteous to forgive us the sins , and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness .
62001010	If we say that we haven't sinned , we make him a liar , and his word is not in us .
62002001	My little children , I write these things to you so that you may not sin . If anyone sins , we have a Counselor with the Father , Jesus Christ , the righteous .
62002002	And he is the atoning sacrifice for our sins , and not for ours only , but also for the whole world .
62002003	This is how we know that we know him : if we keep his commandments .
62002004	He who says , " I know him , " and doesn't keep his commandments , is a liar , and the truth is not in him .
62002005	But whoever keeps his word , God's love has most assuredly been perfected in him . This is how we know that we are in him :
62002006	he who says he remains in him ought himself also to walk just like he walked .
62002007	Brothers , I write no new commandment to you , but an old commandment which you had from the beginning . The old commandment is the word which you heard from the beginning .
62002008	Again , I write a new commandment to you , which thing is true in him and in you ; because the darkness is passing away , and the true light already shines .
62002009	He who says he is in the light and hates his brother , is in the darkness even until now .
62002010	He who loves his brother remains in the light , and there is no occasion for stumbling in him .
62002011	But he who hates his brother is in the darkness , and walks in the darkness , and doesn't know where he is going , because the darkness has blinded his eyes .
62002012	I write to you , little children , because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake .
62002013	I write to you , fathers , because you know him who is from the beginning . I write to you , young men , because you have overcome the evil one . I write to you , little children , because you know the Father .
62002014	I have written to you , fathers , because you know him who is from the beginning . I have written to you , young men , because you are strong , and the word of God remains in you , and you have overcome the evil one .
62002015	Don't love the world , neither the things that are in the world . If anyone loves the world , the Father's love isn't in him .
62002016	For all that is in the world , the lust of the flesh , the lust of the eyes , and the pride of life , isn't the Father's , but is the world's .
62002017	The world is passing away with its lusts , but he who does God's will remains forever .
62002018	Little children , these are the end times , and as you heard that the Antichrist is coming , even now many antichrists have arisen . By this we know that it is the end times .
62002019	They went out from us , but they didn't belong to us ; for if they had belonged to us , they would have continued with us . But they left , that they might be revealed that none of them belong to us .
62002020	You have an anointing from the Holy One , and you know the truth .
62002021	I have not written to you because you don't know the truth , but because you know it , and because no lie is of the truth .
62002022	Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ ? This is the Antichrist , he who denies the Father and the Son .
62002023	Whoever denies the Son , the same doesn't have the Father . He who confesses the Son has the Father also .
62002024	Therefore , as for you , let that remain in you which you heard from the beginning . If that which you heard from the beginning remains in you , you also will remain in the Son , and in the Father .
62002025	This is the promise which he promised us , the eternal life .
62002026	These things I have written to you concerning those who would lead you astray .
62002027	As for you , the anointing which you received from him remains in you , and you don't need for anyone to teach you . But as his anointing teaches you concerning all things , and is true , and is no lie , and even as it taught you , you will remain in him .
62002028	Now , little children , remain in him , that when he appears , we may have boldness , and not be ashamed before him at his coming .
62002029	If you know that he is righteous , you know that everyone who practices righteousness is born of him .
62003001	Behold , how great a love the Father has bestowed on us , that we should be called children of God ! For this cause the world doesn't know us , because it didn't know him .
62003002	Beloved , now we are children of God , and it is not yet revealed what we will be . But we know that , when he is revealed , we will be like him ; for we will see him just as he is .
62003003	Everyone who has this hope set on him purifies himself , even as he is pure .
62003004	Everyone who sins also commits lawlessness . Sin is lawlessness .
62003005	You know that he was revealed to take away our sins , and in him is no sin .
62003006	Whoever remains in him doesn't sin . Whoever sins hasn't seen him , neither knows him .
62003007	Little children , let no one lead you astray . He who does righteousness is righteous , even as he is righteous .
62003008	He who sins is of the devil , for the devil has been sinning from the beginning . To this end the Son of God was revealed , that he might destroy the works of the devil .
62003009	Whoever is born of God doesn't commit sin , because his seed remains in him ; and he can't sin , because he is born of God .
62003010	In this the children of God are revealed , and the children of the devil . Whoever doesn't do righteousness is not of God , neither is he who doesn't love his brother .
62003011	For this is the message which you heard from the beginning , that we should love one another ;
62003012	unlike Cain , who was of the evil one , and killed his brother . Why did he kill him ? Because his works were evil , and his brother's righteous .
62003013	Don't be surprised , my brothers , if the world hates you .
62003014	We know that we have passed out of death into life , because we love the brothers . He who doesn't love his brother remains in death .
62003015	Whoever hates his brother is a murderer , and you know that no murderer has eternal life remaining in him .
62003016	By this we know love , because he laid down his life for us . We ought to lay down our lives for the brothers .
62003017	But whoever has the world's goods , and sees his brother in need , and shuts up his compassion from him , how does the love of God remain in him ?
62003018	My little children , let's not love in word only , neither with the tongue only , but in deed and truth .
62003019	And by this we know that we are of the truth , and persuade our hearts before him ,
62003020	because if our heart condemns us , God is greater than our heart , and knows all things .
62003021	Beloved , if our hearts don't condemn us , we have boldness toward God ;
62003022	and whatever we ask , we receive from him , because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his sight .
62003023	This is his commandment , that we should believe in the name of his Son , Jesus Christ , and love one another , even as he commanded .
62003024	He who keeps his commandments remains in him , and he in him . By this we know that he remains in us , by the Spirit which he gave us .
62004001	Beloved , don't believe every spirit , but test the spirits , whether they are of God , because many false prophets have gone out into the world .
62004002	By this you know the Spirit of God : every spirit who confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God ,
62004003	and every spirit who doesn't confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God , and this is the spirit of the antichrist , of whom you have heard that it comes . Now it is in the world already .
62004004	You are of God , little children , and have overcome them ; because greater is he who is in you than he who is in the world .
62004005	They are of the world . Therefore they speak of the world , and the world hears them .
62004006	We are of God . He who knows God listens to us . He who is not of God doesn't listen to us . By this we know the spirit of truth , and the spirit of error .
62004007	Beloved , let us love one another , for love is of God ; and everyone who loves is born of God , and knows God .
62004008	He who doesn't love doesn't know God , for God is love .
62004009	By this was God's love revealed in us , that God has sent his only born Son into the world that we might live through him .
62004010	In this is love , not that we loved God , but that he loved us , and sent his Son as the atoning sacrifice for our sins .
62004011	Beloved , if God loved us so , we also ought to love one another .
62004012	No one has seen God at any time . If we love one another , God remains in us , and his love has been perfected in us .
62004013	By this we know that we remain in him and he in us , because he has given us of his Spirit .
62004014	We have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son as the Savior of the world .
62004015	Whoever will confess that Jesus is the Son of God , God remains in him , and he in God .
62004016	We know and have believed the love which God has in us . God is love , and he who remains in love remains in God , and God remains in him .
62004017	In this love has been made perfect with us , that we may have boldness in the day of judgment , because as he is , even so are we in this world .
62004018	There is no fear in love ; but perfect love casts out fear , because fear has punishment . He who fears is not made perfect in love .
62004019	We love Him , because he first loved us .
62004020	If a man says , " I love God , " and hates his brother , he is a liar ; for he who doesn't love his brother whom he has seen , how can he love God whom he has not seen ?
62004021	This commandment have we from him , that he who loves God should also love his brother .
62005001	Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God . Whoever loves the father also loves the child who is born of him .
62005002	By this we know that we love the children of God , when we love God and keep his commandments .
62005003	For this is the love of God , that we keep his commandments . His commandments are not grievous .
62005004	For whatever is born of God overcomes the world . This is the victory that has overcome the world : your faith .
62005005	Who is he who overcomes the world , but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God ?
62005006	This is he who came by water and blood , Jesus Christ ; not with the water only , but with the water and the blood .
62005007	It is the Spirit who bears witness , because the Spirit is the truth .
62005008	For there are three who bear witness , the Spirit , and the water , and the blood ; and the three agree as one .
62005009	If we receive the witness of men , the witness of God is greater ; for this is God's testimony which he has testified concerning his Son .
62005010	He who believes in the Son of God has the witness in him . He who doesn't believe God has made him a liar , because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given concerning his Son .
62005011	The testimony is this , that God gave to us eternal life , and this life is in his Son .
62005012	He who has the Son has the life . He who doesn't have God's Son doesn't have the life .
62005013	These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God , that you may know that you have eternal life , and that you may continue to believe in the name of the Son of God .
62005014	This is the boldness which we have toward him , that , if we ask anything according to his will , he listens to us .
62005015	And if we know that he listens to us whatever we ask , we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him .
62005016	If anyone sees his brother sinning a sin not leading to death , he shall ask , and God will give him life for those who sin not to death . There is a sin leading to death . I don't say that concerning this he should make a request .
62005017	All unrighteousness is sin , and there is a sin not leading to death .
62005018	We know that whoever is born of God doesn't sin , but he who was born of God keeps himself , and the evil one doesn't touch him .
62005019	We know that we are of God , and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one .
62005020	We know that the Son of God has come , and has given us an understanding , that we know him who is true , and we are in him who is true , in his Son Jesus Christ . This is the true God , and eternal life .
62005021	Little children , keep yourselves from idols .
63001001	The elder , to the elect lady and her children , whom I love in truth ; and not I only , but also all those who know the truth ;
63001002	for the truth's sake , which remains in us , and it will be with us forever :
63001003	Grace , mercy , and peace will be with us , from God the Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ , the Son of the Father , in truth and love .
63001004	I rejoice greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth , even as we have been commanded by the Father .
63001005	Now I beg you , dear lady , not as though I wrote to you a new commandment , but that which we had from the beginning , that we love one another .
63001006	This is love , that we should walk according to his commandments . This is the commandment , even as you heard from the beginning , that you should walk in it .
63001007	For many deceivers have gone out into the world , those who don't confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh . This is the deceiver and the Antichrist .
63001008	Watch yourselves , that we don't lose the things which we have accomplished , but that we receive a full reward .
63001009	Whoever transgresses and doesn't remain in the teaching of Christ , doesn't have God . He who remains in the teaching , the same has both the Father and the Son .
63001010	If anyone comes to you , and doesn't bring this teaching , don't receive him into your house , and don't welcome him ,
63001011	for he who welcomes him participates in his evil works .
63001012	Having many things to write to you , I don't want to do so with paper and ink , but I hope to come to you , and to speak face to face , that our joy may be made full .
63001013	The children of your chosen sister greet you . Amen .
64001001	The elder to Gaius the beloved , whom I love in truth .
64001002	Beloved , I pray that you may prosper in all things and be healthy , even as your soul prospers .
64001003	For I rejoiced greatly , when brothers came and testified about your truth , even as you walk in truth .
64001004	I have no greater joy than this , to hear about my children walking in truth .
64001005	Beloved , you do a faithful work in whatever you accomplish for those who are brothers and strangers .
64001006	They have testified about your love before the assembly . You will do well to send them forward on their journey in a manner worthy of God ,
64001007	because for the sake of the Name they went out , taking nothing from the Gentiles .
64001008	We therefore ought to receive such , that we may be fellow workers for the truth .
64001009	I wrote to the assembly , but Diotrephes , who loves to be first among them , doesn't accept what we say .
64001010	Therefore , if I come , I will call attention to his deeds which he does , unjustly accusing us with wicked words . Not content with this , neither does he himself receive the brothers , and those who would , he forbids and throws out of the assembly .
64001011	Beloved , don't imitate that which is evil , but that which is good . He who does good is of God . He who does evil hasn't seen God .
64001012	Demetrius has the testimony of all , and of the truth itself ; yes , we also testify , and you know that our testimony is true .
64001013	I had many things to write to you , but I am unwilling to write to you with ink and pen ;
64001014	but I hope to see you soon , and we will speak face to face . Peace be to you . The friends greet you . Greet the friends by name .
64001015	
65001001	Jude , a servant of Jesus Christ , and brother of James , to those who are called , sanctified by God the Father , and kept for Jesus Christ :
65001002	Mercy to you and peace and love be multiplied .
65001003	Beloved , while I was very eager to write to you about our common salvation , I was constrained to write to you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints .
65001004	For there are certain men who crept in secretly , even they who were of old written of beforehand to this condemnation : ungodly men , turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness , and denying our only Master , God , and Lord , Jesus Christ .
65001005	Now I desire to remind you , though you already know this , that the Lord , having saved a people out of the land of Egypt , afterward destroyed those who didn't believe .
65001006	Angels who didn't keep their first domain , but deserted their own dwelling place , he has kept in everlasting bonds under darkness for the judgment of the great day .
65001007	Even as Sodom and Gomorrah , and the cities around them , having , in the same way as these , given themselves over to sexual immorality and gone after strange flesh , are set forth as an example , suffering the punishment of eternal fire .
65001008	Yet in like manner these also in their dreaming defile the flesh , despise authority , and slander celestial beings .
65001009	But Michael , the archangel , when contending with the devil and arguing about the body of Moses , dared not bring against him an abusive condemnation , but said , " May the Lord rebuke you ! "
65001010	But these speak evil of whatever things they don't know . What they understand naturally , like the creatures without reason , in these things are they destroyed .
65001011	Woe to them ! For they went in the way of Cain , and ran riotously in the error of Balaam for hire , and perished in Korah's rebellion .
65001012	These are hidden rocky reefs in your love feasts when they feast with you , shepherds who without fear feed themselves ; clouds without water , carried along by winds ; autumn leaves without fruit , twice dead , plucked up by the roots ;
65001013	wild waves of the sea , foaming out their own shame ; wandering stars , for whom the blackness of darkness has been reserved forever .
65001014	To these also Enoch , the seventh from Adam , prophesied , saying , " Behold , the Lord came with ten thousands of his holy ones ,
65001015	to execute judgment on all , and to convict all the ungodly of all their works of ungodliness which they have done in an ungodly way , and of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him . "
65001016	These are murmurers and complainers , walking after their lusts ( and their mouth speaks proud things ) , showing respect of persons for the sake of advantage .
65001017	But you , beloved , remember the words which have been spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ .
65001018	They said to you that " In the last time there will be mockers , walking after their own ungodly lusts . "
65001019	These are they who cause divisions , and are sensual , not having the Spirit .
65001020	But you , beloved , keep building up yourselves on your most holy faith , praying in the Holy Spirit .
65001021	Keep yourselves in the love of God , looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to eternal life .
65001022	On some have compassion , making a distinction ,
65001023	and some save , snatching them out of the fire with fear , hating even the clothing stained by the flesh .
65001024	Now to him who is able to keep them from stumbling , and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory in great joy ,
65001025	to God our Savior , who alone is wise , be glory and majesty , dominion and power , both now and forever . Amen .
66001001	This is the Revelation of Jesus Christ , which God gave him to show to his servants the things which must happen soon , which he sent and made known by his angel to his servant , John ,
66001002	who testified to God's word , and of the testimony of Jesus Christ , about everything that he saw .
66001003	Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy , and keep the things that are written in it , for the time is at hand .
66001004	John , to the seven assemblies that are in Asia : Grace to you and peace , from God , who is and who was and who is to come ; and from the seven Spirits who are before his throne ;
66001005	and from Jesus Christ , the faithful witness , the firstborn of the dead , and the ruler of the kings of the earth . To him who loves us , and washed us from our sins by his blood ;
66001006	and he made us to be a kingdom , priests to his God and Father ; to him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever . Amen .
66001007	Behold , he is coming with the clouds , and every eye will see him , including those who pierced him . All the tribes of the earth will mourn over him . Even so , Amen .
66001008	" I am the Alpha and the Omega , the Beginning and the End , " says the Lord God , " who is and who was and who is to come , the Almighty . "
66001009	I John , your brother and partaker with you in oppression and kingdom and perseverance which are in Jesus , was on the isle that is called Patmos because of God's Word and the testimony of Jesus Christ .
66001010	I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day , and I heard behind me a loud voice , as of a trumpet
66001011	saying , " What you see , write in a book and send to the seven assemblies : to Ephesus , Smyrna , Pergamum , Thyatira , Sardis , Philadelphia , and to Laodicea . "
66001012	I turned to see the voice that spoke with me . Having turned , I saw seven golden lampstands .
66001013	And in the midst of the lampstands was one like a son of man , clothed with a robe reaching down to his feet , and with a golden sash around his chest .
66001014	His head and his hair were white as white wool , like snow . His eyes were like a flame of fire .
66001015	His feet were like burnished brass , as if it had been refined in a furnace . His voice was like the voice of many waters .
66001016	He had seven stars in his right hand . Out of his mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword . His face was like the sun shining at its brightest .
66001017	When I saw him , I fell at his feet like a dead man . He laid his right hand on me , saying , " Don't be afraid . I am the first and the last ,
66001018	and the Living one . I was dead , and behold , I am alive forevermore . I have the keys of Death and of Hades .
66001019	Write therefore the things which you have seen , and the things which are , and the things which will happen hereafter ;
66001020	the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand , and the seven golden lampstands . The seven stars are the angels of the seven assemblies . The seven lampstands are seven assemblies .
66002001	To the angel of the assembly in Ephesus write : " He who holds the seven stars in his right hand , he who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands says these things :
66002002	" I know your works , and your toil and perseverance , and that you can't tolerate evil men , and have tested those who call themselves apostles , and they are not , and found them false .
66002003	You have perseverance and have endured for my name's sake , and have not grown weary .
66002004	But I have this against you , that you left your first love .
66002005	Remember therefore from where you have fallen , and repent and do the first works ; or else I am coming to you , and will move your lampstand out of its place , unless you repent .
66002006	But this you have , that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans , which I also hate .
66002007	He who has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies . To him who overcomes I will give to eat of the tree of life , which is in the Paradise of my God .
66002008	" To the angel of the assembly in Smyrna write : " The first and the last , who was dead , and has come to life says these things :
66002009	" I know your oppression , and your poverty ( but you are rich ) , and the blasphemy of those who say they are Jews , and they are not , but are a synagogue of Satan .
66002010	Don't be afraid of the things which you are about to suffer . Behold , the devil is about to throw some of you into prison , that you may be tested ; and you will have oppression for ten days . Be faithful to death , and I will give you the crown of life .
66002011	He who has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies . He who overcomes won't be hurt by the second death .
66002012	" To the angel of the assembly in Pergamum write : " He who has the sharp two-edged sword says these things :
66002013	" I know your works and where you dwell , where Satan's throne is . You hold firmly to my name , and didn't deny my faith , even in the days of Antipas my witness , my faithful one , who was killed among you , where Satan dwells .
66002014	But I have a few things against you , because you have there some who hold the teaching of Balaam , who taught Balak to throw a stumbling block before the children of Israel , to eat things sacrificed to idols , and to commit sexual immorality .
66002015	So you also have some who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans in the same way .
66002016	Repent therefore , or else I am coming to you quickly , and I will make war against them with the sword of my mouth .
66002017	He who has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies . To him who overcomes , to him will I give of the hidden manna , and I will give him a white stone , and on the stone a new name written , which no one knows but he who receives it .
66002018	" To the angel of the assembly in Thyatira write : " The Son of God , who has his eyes like a flame of fire , and his feet are like burnished brass , says these things :
66002019	I know your works , your love , faith , service , patient endurance , and that your last works are more than the first .
66002020	But I have this against you , that you tolerate your woman , Jezebel , who calls herself a prophetess . She teaches and seduces my servants to commit sexual immorality , and to eat things sacrificed to idols .
66002021	I gave her time to repent , but she refuses to repent of her sexual immorality .
66002022	Behold , I will throw her into a bed , and those who commit adultery with her into great oppression , unless they repent of her works .
66002023	I will kill her children with Death , and all the assemblies will know that I am he who searches the minds and hearts . I will give to each one of you according to your deeds .
66002024	But to you I say , to the rest who are in Thyatira , as many as don't have this teaching , who don't know what some call ' the deep things of Satan , ' to you I say , I don't lay on you any other burden .
66002025	Nevertheless that which you have , hold firmly until I come .
66002026	He who overcomes , and he who keeps my works to the end , to him will I give authority over the nations .
66002027	He will rule them with a rod of iron , shattering them like clay pots ; as I also have received of my Father :
66002028	and I will give him the morning star .
66002029	He who has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies .
66003001	" And to the angel of the assembly in Sardis write : He who has the seven Spirits of God , and the seven stars says these things : " I know your works , that you have a reputation of being alive , but you are dead .
66003002	Wake up , and establish the things that remain , which were ready to die , for I have found no works of yours perfected before my God .
66003003	Remember therefore how you have received and heard . Keep it , and repent . If therefore you won't watch , I will come as a thief , and you won't know what hour I will come on you .
66003004	Nevertheless you have a few names in Sardis that did not defile their garments . They will walk with me in white , for they are worthy .
66003005	He who overcomes will be arrayed like this in white garments , and I will in no way blot his name out of the book of life , and I will confess his name before my Father , and before his angels .
66003006	He who has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies .
66003007	" To the angel of the assembly in Philadelphia write : " He who is holy , he who is true , he who has the key of David , he who opens and no one can shut , and that shuts and no one opens , says these things :
66003008	" I know your works ( behold , I have set before you an open door , which no one can shut ) , that you have a little power , and kept my word , and didn't deny my name .
66003009	Behold , I give of the synagogue of Satan , of those who say they are Jews , and they are not , but lie . Behold , I will make them to come and worship before your feet , and to know that I have loved you .
66003010	Because you kept the word of my patience , I also will keep you from the hour of testing , that which is to come on the whole world , to test those who dwell on the earth .
66003011	I come quickly . Hold firmly that which you have , so that no one takes your crown .
66003012	He who overcomes , I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God , and he will go out from there no more . I will write on him the name of my God , and the name of the city of my God , the new Jerusalem , which comes down out of heaven from my God , and my own new name .
66003013	He who has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies .
66003014	" To the angel of the assembly in Laodicea write : " The Amen , the Faithful and True Witness , the Head of God's creation , says these things :
66003015	" I know your works , that you are neither cold nor hot . I wish you were cold or hot .
66003016	So , because you are lukewarm , and neither hot nor cold , I will vomit you out of my mouth .
66003017	Because you say , ' I am rich , and have gotten riches , and have need of nothing ; ' and don't know that you are the wretched one , miserable , poor , blind , and naked ;
66003018	I counsel you to buy from me gold refined by fire , that you may become rich ; and white garments , that you may clothe yourself , and that the shame of your nakedness may not be revealed ; and eye salve to anoint your eyes , that you may see .
66003019	As many as I love , I reprove and chasten . Be zealous therefore , and repent .
66003020	Behold , I stand at the door and knock . If anyone hears my voice and opens the door , I will come in to him , and will dine with him , and he with me .
66003021	He who overcomes , I will give to him to sit down with me on my throne , as I also overcame , and sat down with my Father on his throne .
66003022	He who has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies . "
66004001	After these things I looked and saw a door opened in heaven , and the first voice that I heard , like a trumpet speaking with me , was one saying , " Come up here , and I will show you the things which must happen after this . "
66004002	Immediately I was in the Spirit . Behold , there was a throne set in heaven , and one sitting on the throne
66004003	that looked like a jasper stone and a sardius . There was a rainbow around the throne , like an emerald to look at .
66004004	Around the throne were twenty-four thrones . On the thrones were twenty-four elders sitting , dressed in white garments , with crowns of gold on their heads .
66004005	Out of the throne proceed lightnings , sounds , and thunders . There were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne , which are the seven Spirits of God .
66004006	Before the throne was something like a sea of glass , like a crystal . In the midst of the throne , and around the throne were four living creatures full of eyes before and behind .
66004007	The first creature was like a lion , and the second creature like a calf , and the third creature had a face like a man , and the fourth creature was like a flying eagle .
66004008	and the four living creatures , having each one of them six wings , are full of eyes around about and within . They have no rest day and night , saying , Holy , holy , holy is the Lord God , the Almighty , who was and who is and who is to come .
66004009	When the living creatures give glory , honor , and thanks to him who sits on the throne , to him who lives forever and ever ,
66004010	the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne , and worship him who lives forever and ever , and will throw their crowns before the throne , saying ,
66004011	" Worthy are you , our Lord and our God , to receive the glory , the honor , and the power , for you created all things , and because of your desire they existed , and were created . "
66005001	I saw , in the right hand of him who sat on the throne , a book written within and on the back , sealed shut with seven seals .
66005002	I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice , " Who is worthy to open the book , and to break its seals ? "
66005003	No one in heaven , or on the earth , or under the earth , was able to open the book , or to look in it .
66005004	And I wept much , because no one was found worthy to open the book , or to look in it .
66005005	One of the elders said to me , " Don't weep . Behold , the Lion who is of the tribe of Judah , the Root of David , has overcome to open the book and its seven seals . "
66005006	I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures , and in the midst of the elders , a Lamb standing , as though it had been slain , having seven horns , and seven eyes , which are the seven Spirits of God , sent forth into all the earth .
66005007	Then he came , and he took it out of the right hand of him who sat on the throne .
66005008	Now when he had taken the book , the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb , each one having a harp , and golden bowls full of incense , which are the prayers of the saints .
66005009	They sang a new song , saying , " You are worthy to take the book , And to open its seals : For you were killed , And bought us for God with your blood , Out of every tribe , language , people , and nation ,
66005010	And made them kings and priests to our God , And they reign on earth . "
66005011	I saw , and I heard a voice of many angels around the throne , the living creatures , and the elders ; and the number of them was ten thousands of ten thousands , and thousands of thousands ;
66005012	saying with a loud voice , " Worthy is the Lamb who has been killed to receive the power , riches , wisdom , might , honor , glory , and blessing ! "
66005013	I heard every created thing which is in heaven , on the earth , under the earth , on the sea , and everything in them , saying , " To him who sits on the throne , and to the Lamb be the blessing , the honor , the glory , and the dominion , forever and ever . Amen . "
66005014	The four living creatures said , " Amen ! " The elders fell down and worshipped .
66006001	I saw that the Lamb opened one of the seven seals , and I heard one of the four living creatures saying , as with a voice of thunder , " Come and see ! "
66006002	I saw , and behold , a white horse , and he who sat on it had a bow . A crown was given to him , and he came forth conquering , and to conquer .
66006003	When he opened the second seal , I heard the second living creature saying , " Come ! "
66006004	Another came forth , a red horse . To him who sat on it was given to take peace from the earth , and that they should kill one another . There was given to him a great sword .
66006005	When he opened the third seal , I heard the third living creature saying , " Come and see ! " I saw , and behold , a black horse . He who sat on it had a balance in his hand .
66006006	I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying , " A choenix of wheat for a denarius , and three choenix of barley for a denarius ! Don't damage the oil and the wine ! "
66006007	When he opened the fourth seal , I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying , " Come and see ! "
66006008	I saw , and behold , a pale horse . He who sat on him , his name was Death . Hades followed with him . Authority over one fourth of the earth , to kill with the sword , with famine , with death , and by the wild animals of the earth was given to them .
66006009	When he opened the fifth seal , I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been killed for the word of God , and for the testimony which they held .
66006010	They cried with a loud voice , saying , " How long , Master , the holy and true , do you not judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth ? "
66006011	There was given to each one of them a white robe . It was said to them that they should rest yet for a little time , until their fellow servants and their brothers , who would also be killed even as they were , had been fulfilled .
66006012	I saw when he opened the sixth seal , and there was a great earthquake . The sun became black as sackcloth made of hair , and the whole moon became as blood .
66006013	The stars of the sky fell to the earth , as a fig tree drops its unripe figs when it is shaken by a great wind .
66006014	The sky was removed as a scroll when it is rolled up . Every mountain and island were moved out of their places .
66006015	The kings of the earth , the princes , the commanding officers , the rich , the strong , and every slave and freeman , hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains .
66006016	They told the mountains and the rocks , " Fall on us , and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne , and from the wrath of the Lamb ,
66006017	for the great day of his wrath has come ; and who is able to stand ? "
66007001	After this , I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth , holding the four winds of the earth , so that no wind would blow on the earth , or on the sea , or on any tree .
66007002	I saw another angel ascend from the sunrise , having the seal of the living God . He cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to harm the earth and the sea ,
66007003	saying , " Don't harm the earth , neither the sea , nor the trees , until we have sealed the bondservants of our God on their foreheads ! "
66007004	I heard the number of those who were sealed , one hundred forty-four thousand , sealed out of every tribe of the children of Israel :
66007005	Of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand , Of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand , Of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand ,
66007006	Of the tribe of Asher twelve thousand , Of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand , Of the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand ,
66007007	Of the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand , Of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand , Of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand ,
66007008	Of the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand , Of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand , Of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand .
66007009	After these things I saw , and behold , a great multitude , which no man could number , out of every nation and of all tribes , peoples , and languages , standing before the throne and before the Lamb , dressed in white robes , with palm branches in their hands .
66007010	They cried with a loud voice , saying , " Salvation be to our God , who sits on the throne , and to the Lamb . "
66007011	All the angels were standing around the throne , the elders , and the four living creatures ; and they fell before the throne on their faces , and worshipped God ,
66007012	saying , " Amen ! Blessing , glory , wisdom , thanksgiving , honor , power , and might , be to our God forever and ever ! Amen . "
66007013	One of the elders answered , saying to me , " These who are arrayed in white robes , who are they , and where did they come from ? "
66007014	I told him , " My lord , you know . " He said to me , " These are those who came out of the great oppression . They washed their robes , and made them white in the Lamb's blood .
66007015	Therefore are they before the throne of God , they serve him day and night in his temple . He who sits on the throne will spread his tent over them .
66007016	They will never be hungry , neither thirsty any more ; neither will the sun beat on them , nor any heat ;
66007017	for the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne will be their shepherd , and will guide them to living springs of waters . God will wipe away every tear from their eyes . "
66008001	When he opened the seventh seal , there followed a silence in heaven for about half an hour .
66008002	I saw the seven angels who stand before God , and seven trumpets were given to them .
66008003	Another angel came and stood over the altar , having a golden censer . Much incense was given to him , that he should add it to the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar which was before the throne .
66008004	The smoke of the incense , with the prayers of the saints , went up before God out of the angel's hand .
66008005	The angel took the censer , and he filled it with the fire of the altar , and threw it on the earth . There followed thunders , sounds , lightnings , and an earthquake .
66008006	The seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound .
66008007	The first sounded , and there followed hail and fire , mingled with blood , and they were thrown on the earth . One third of the earth was burnt up , and one third of the trees were burnt up , and all green grass was burnt up .
66008008	The second angel sounded , and something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea . One third of the sea became blood ,
66008009	and one third of the creatures which were in the sea died , those who had life . One third of the ships were destroyed .
66008010	The third angel sounded , and a great star fell from the sky , burning like a torch , and it fell on one third of the rivers , and on the springs of the waters .
66008011	The name of the star is called " Wormwood . " One third of the waters became wormwood . Many men died from the waters , because they were made bitter .
66008012	The fourth angel sounded , and one third of the sun was struck , and one third of the moon , and one third of the stars ; so that one third of them would be darkened , and the day wouldn't shine for one third of it , and the night in the same way .
66008013	I saw , and I heard an eagle , flying in mid heaven , saying with a loud voice , " Woe ! Woe ! Woe for those who dwell on the earth , because of the other voices of the trumpets of the three angels , who are yet to sound .
66009001	The fifth angel sounded , and I saw a star from the sky fallen to the earth . The key to the pit of the abyss was given to him .
66009002	He opened the pit of the abyss , and smoke went up out of the pit , like the smoke from a great furnace . The sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke from the pit .
66009003	Then out of the smoke came forth locusts on the earth , and power was given to them , as the scorpions of the earth have power .
66009004	They were told that they should not hurt the grass of the earth , neither any green thing , neither any tree , but only those men who don't have God's seal on their foreheads .
66009005	They were given power not to kill them , but to torment them for five months . Their torment was like the torment of a scorpion , when it strikes a man .
66009006	In those days men will seek death , and will in no way find it . They will desire to die , and death will flee from them .
66009007	The shapes of the locusts were like horses prepared for war . On their heads were something like gold crowns , and their faces were like men's faces .
66009008	They had hair like women's hair , and their teeth were like those of lions .
66009009	They had breastplates , like breastplates of iron . The sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots , or of many horses rushing to war .
66009010	They have tails like those of scorpions , and stings . In their tails is their power to harm men for five months .
66009011	They have over them as king the angel of the abyss . His name in Hebrew is " Abaddon , " but in Greek , he has the name " Apollyon . "
66009012	The first woe is past . Behold , there are still two woes coming after this .
66009013	The sixth angel sounded . I heard a voice from the horns of the golden altar which is before God ,
66009014	saying to the sixth angel who had one trumpet , " Free the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates . "
66009015	The four angels were freed who had been prepared for that hour and day and month and year , so that they would kill one third of mankind .
66009016	The number of the armies of the horsemen was two hundred million . I heard the number of them .
66009017	Thus I saw the horses in the vision , and those who sat on them , having breastplates of fiery red , hyacinth blue , and sulfur yellow ; and the heads of lions . Out of their mouths proceed fire , smoke , and sulfur .
66009018	By these three plagues were one third of mankind killed : by the fire , the smoke , and the sulfur , which proceeded out of their mouths .
66009019	For the power of the horses is in their mouths , and in their tails . For their tails are like serpents , and have heads , and with them they harm .
66009020	The rest of mankind , who were not killed with these plagues , didn't repent of the works of their hands , that they wouldn't worship demons , and the idols of gold , and of silver , and of brass , and of stone , and of wood ; which can neither see , nor hear , nor walk .
66009021	They didn't repent of their murders , nor of their sorceries , nor of their sexual immorality , nor of their thefts .
66010001	I saw another mighty angel coming down out of the sky , clothed with a cloud . A rainbow was on his head . His face was like the sun , and his feet like pillars of fire .
66010002	He had in his hand a little book open . He set his right foot on the sea , and his left on the land .
66010003	He cried with a loud voice , as a lion roars . When he cried , the seven thunders uttered their voices .
66010004	When the seven thunders sounded , I was about to write ; but I heard a voice from the sky saying , " Seal up the things which the seven thunders said , and don't write them . "
66010005	The angel who I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted up his right hand to the sky ,
66010006	and swore by him who lives forever and ever , who created heaven and the things that are in it , the earth and the things that are in it , and the sea and the things that are in it , that there will no longer be delay ,
66010007	but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel , when he is about to sound , then the mystery of God is finished , as he declared to his servants , the prophets .
66010008	The voice which I heard from heaven , again speaking with me , said , " Go , take the book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the land . "
66010009	I went to the angel , saying , " Give me the little book . " He said to me , " Take it , and eat it up . It will make your belly bitter , but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey . "
66010010	I took the little book out of the angel's hand , and ate it up . It was as sweet as honey in my mouth . When I had eaten it , my belly was made bitter .
66010011	He told me , " You must prophesy again over many peoples , nations , languages , and kings . "
66011001	A reed like a rod was given to me . One said , " Rise , and measure God's temple , and the altar , and those who worship in it .
66011002	Leave out the court which is outside of the temple , and don't measure it , for it has been given to the gentiles . They will tread the holy city under foot for forty-two months .
66011003	I will give power to my two witnesses , and they will prophesy one thousand two hundred sixty days , clothed in sackcloth .
66011004	These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands , standing before the Lord of the earth .
66011005	If anyone desires to harm them , fire proceeds out of their mouth and devours their enemies . If anyone desires to harm them , he must be killed in this way .
66011006	These have the power to shut up the sky , that it may not rain during the days of their prophecy . They have power over the waters , to turn them into blood , and to strike the earth with every plague , as often as they desire .
66011007	When they have finished their testimony , the beast that comes up out of the abyss will make war with them , and overcome them , and kill them .
66011008	Their dead bodies will be in the street of the great city , which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt , where also their Lord was crucified .
66011009	From among the peoples , tribes , languages , and nations will people look at their dead bodies for three and a half days , and will not allow their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb .
66011010	Those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them , and make merry . They will send gifts to one another , because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth .
66011011	After the three and a half days , the breath of life from God entered into them , and they stood on their feet . Great fear fell on those who saw them .
66011012	I heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them , " Come up here ! " They went up into heaven in the cloud , and their enemies saw them .
66011013	In that hour there was a great earthquake , and a tenth of the city fell . Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake , and the rest were terrified , and gave glory to the God of heaven .
66011014	The second woe is past . Behold , the third woe comes quickly .
66011015	The seventh angel sounded , and there followed great voices in heaven , saying , " The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord , and of his Christ . He will reign forever and ever ! "
66011016	The twenty-four elders , who sit before God on their thrones , fell on their faces and worshipped God ,
66011017	saying : " We give you thanks , Lord God , the Almighty , the one who is and who was ; because you have taken your great power , and reigned .
66011018	The nations were angry , and your wrath came , as did the time for the dead to be judged , and to give your servants , the prophets , their reward , as well as the saints , and those who fear your name , the small and the great ; and to destroy those who destroy the earth . "
66011019	God's temple that is in heaven was opened , and the ark of the Lord's covenant was seen in his temple . There followed lightnings , sounds , thunders , an earthquake , and great hail .
66012001	A great sign was seen in heaven : a woman clothed with the sun , and the moon under her feet , and on her head a crown of twelve stars .
66012002	She was with child . She cried out , laboring and in pain , giving birth .
66012003	Another sign was seen in heaven . Behold , a great red dragon , having seven heads and ten horns , and on his heads seven crowns .
66012004	His tail drew one third of the stars of the sky , and threw them to the earth . The dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth , so that when she gave birth he might devour her child .
66012005	She gave birth to a son , a male child , who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron . Her child was caught up to God , and to his throne .
66012006	The woman fled into the wilderness , where she has a place prepared by God , that there they may nourish her one thousand two hundred sixty days .
66012007	There was war in the sky . Michael and his angels made war on the dragon . The dragon and his angels made war .
66012008	They didn't prevail , neither was a place found for him any more in heaven .
66012009	The great dragon was thrown down , the old serpent , he who is called the Devil and Satan , the deceiver of the whole world . He was thrown down to the earth , and his angels were thrown down with him .
66012010	I heard a loud voice in heaven , saying , " Now is come the salvation , the power , and the kingdom of our God , and the authority of his Christ ; for the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down , who accuses them before our God day and night .
66012011	They overcame him because of the Lamb's blood , and because of the word of their testimony . They didn't love their life , even to death .
66012012	Therefore rejoice , heavens , and you who dwell in them . Woe for the earth and for the sea , because the devil has gone down to you , having great wrath , knowing that he has but a short time . "
66012013	When the dragon saw that he was thrown down to the earth , he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male child .
66012014	Two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman , that she might fly into the wilderness to her place , where she was nourished for a time , and times , and half a time , from the face of the serpent .
66012015	The serpent spewed water out of his mouth after the woman like a river , that he might cause her to be carried away by the stream .
66012016	The earth helped the woman , and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the river which the dragon spewed out of his mouth .
66012017	The dragon grew angry with the woman , and went away to make war with the rest of her seed , who keep God's commandments and hold Jesus ' testimony .
66013001	Then I stood on the sand of the sea . I saw a beast coming up out of the sea , having ten horns and seven heads . On his horns were ten crowns , and on his heads , blasphemous names .
66013002	The beast which I saw was like a leopard , and his feet were like those of a bear , and his mouth like the mouth of a lion . The dragon gave him his power , his throne , and great authority .
66013003	One of his heads looked like it had been wounded fatally . His fatal wound was healed , and the whole earth marveled at the beast .
66013004	They worshipped the dragon , because he gave his authority to the beast , and they worshipped the beast , saying , " Who is like the beast ? Who is able to make war with him ? "
66013005	A mouth speaking great things and blasphemy was given to him . Authority to continue for forty-two months was given to him .
66013006	He opened his mouth for blasphemy against God , to blaspheme his name , and his tent , those who dwell in heaven .
66013007	It was given to him to make war with the saints , and to overcome them . Authority over every tribe , people , language , and nation was given to him .
66013008	All who dwell on the earth will worship him , everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb who has been killed .
66013009	If anyone has an ear , let him hear .
66013010	If anyone gathers into captivity , into captivity he goes . If anyone will kill with the sword , with the sword he must be killed . Here is the patience and the faith of the saints .
66013011	I saw another beast coming up out of the earth . He had two horns like a lamb , and he spoke like a dragon .
66013012	He exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence . He makes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast , whose fatal wound was healed .
66013013	He performs great signs , even making fire come down out of the sky on the earth in the sight of men .
66013014	He deceives my own people who dwell on the earth because of the signs which it was given him to do in front of the beast ; saying to those who dwell on the earth , that they should make an image to the beast who had the sword wound and lived .
66013015	It was given to him to give breath to it , to the image of the beast , that the image of the beast should both speak , and cause as many as wouldn't worship the image of the beast to be killed .
66013016	He causes all , the small and the great , the rich and the poor , and the free and the slave , to be given a mark on their right hand , or on their forehead ;
66013017	and that no one would be able to buy or to sell , unless he has that mark , the name of the beast or the number of his name .
66013018	Here is wisdom . He who has understanding , let him calculate the number of the beast , for it is the number of a man . His number is six hundred sixty-six .
66014001	I saw , and behold , the Lamb standing on Mount Zion , and with him one hundred forty-four thousand , having his name , and the name of his Father , written on their foreheads .
66014002	I heard a sound from heaven , like the sound of many waters , and like the sound of a great thunder . The sound which I heard was like that of harpers playing on their harps .
66014003	They sing something like a new song before the throne , and before the four living creatures and the elders . None could learn the song except the one hundred forty-four thousand , those who had been redeemed out of the earth .
66014004	These are those who were not defiled with women , for they are virgins . These are those who follow the Lamb wherever he goes . These were redeemed by Jesus from among men , the first fruits to God and to the Lamb .
66014005	In their mouth was found no lie . They are without fault .
66014006	I saw another angel flying in mid heaven , having an eternal gospel to proclaim to those who dwell on the earth , and to every nation , tribe , language , and people .
66014007	He said with a loud voice , " Fear God , and give him glory ; for the hour of his judgment has come . Worship him who made the heaven , the earth , the sea , and the springs of waters ! "
66014008	Another , a second angel , followed , saying , " Babylon the great has fallen , which has made all the nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her sexual immorality . "
66014009	Another angel , a third , followed them , saying with a great voice , " If anyone worships the beast and his image , and receives a mark on his forehead , or on his hand ,
66014010	he also will drink of the wine of the wrath of God , which is prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger . He will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels , and in the presence of the Lamb .
66014011	The smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever . They have no rest day and night , those who worship the beast and his image , and whoever receives the mark of his name .
66014012	Here is the patience of the saints , those who keep the commandments of God , and the faith of Jesus . "
66014013	I heard the voice from heaven saying , " Write , ' Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on . ' " " Yes , " says the Spirit , " that they may rest from their labors ; for their works follow with them . "
66014014	I looked , and behold , a white cloud ; and on the cloud one sitting like a son of man , having on his head a golden crown , and in his hand a sharp sickle .
66014015	Another angel came out from the temple , crying with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud , " Send forth your sickle , and reap ; for the hour to reap has come ; for the harvest of the earth is ripe ! "
66014016	He who sat on the cloud thrust his sickle on the earth , and the earth was reaped .
66014017	Another angel came out from the temple which is in heaven . He also had a sharp sickle .
66014018	Another angel came out from the altar , he who has power over fire , and he called with a great voice to him who had the sharp sickle , saying , " Send forth your sharp sickle , and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth , for her grapes are fully ripe ! "
66014019	The angel thrust his sickle into the earth , and gathered the vintage of the earth , and threw it into the great winepress of the wrath of God .
66014020	The winepress was trodden outside of the city , and blood came out from the winepress , even to the bridles of the horses , as far as one thousand six hundred stadia .
66015001	I saw another great and marvelous sign in the sky : seven angels having the seven last plagues , for in them God's wrath is finished .
66015002	I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire . Those who overcame the beast , and his image , and the number of his name , standing on the sea of glass , having harps of God .
66015003	They sang the song of Moses , the servant of God , and the song of the Lamb , saying , " Great and marvelous are your works , Lord God , the Almighty ; Righteous and true are your ways , you King of the nations .
66015004	Who wouldn't fear you , Lord , And glorify your name ? For you only are holy . For all the nations will come and worship before you . For your righteous acts have been revealed .
66015005	After these things I looked , and the temple of the tent of the testimony in heaven was opened .
66015006	The seven angels who had the seven plagues came out from the temple , clothed with pure , bright linen , and wearing golden sashes around their breasts .
66015007	One of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God , who lives forever and ever .
66015008	The temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God , and from his power . No one was able to enter into the temple , until the seven plagues of the seven angels would be finished .
66016001	I heard a loud voice out of the temple , saying to the seven angels , " Go and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath of God on the earth ! "
66016002	The first went , and poured out his bowl into the earth , and it became a harmful and evil sore on the men that had the mark of the beast , and that worshipped his image .
66016003	The second angel poured out his bowl into the sea , and it became blood as of a dead man . Every living thing in the sea died .
66016004	The third poured out his bowl into the rivers and springs of water , and it became blood .
66016005	I heard the angel of the waters saying , " You are righteous , who are and who were , you Holy One , because you judged this way .
66016006	For they poured out the blood of the saints and the prophets , and you have given them blood to drink . They deserve this . "
66016007	I heard the altar saying , " Yes , Lord God , the Almighty , true and righteous are your judgments . "
66016008	The fourth poured out his bowl on the sun , and it was given to him to scorch men with fire .
66016009	Men were scorched with great heat , and they blasphemed the name of God who has the power over these plagues . They didn't repent and give him glory .
66016010	The fifth poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast , and his kingdom was darkened . They gnawed their tongues because of the pain ,
66016011	and they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores . They didn't repent of their works .
66016012	The sixth poured out his bowl on the great river , the Euphrates . Its water was dried up , that the way might be made ready for the kings that come from the sunrise .
66016013	I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon , and out of the mouth of the beast , and out of the mouth of the false prophet , three unclean spirits , something like frogs ;
66016014	for they are spirits of demons , performing signs ; which go forth to the kings of the whole world , to gather them together for the war of the great day of God , the Almighty .
66016015	" Behold , I come like a thief . Blessed is he who watches , and keeps his clothes , so that he doesn't walk naked , and they see his shame . "
66016016	He gathered them together into the place which is called in Hebrew , " Har-magedon . "
66016017	The seventh poured out his bowl into the air . A loud voice came forth out of the temple , from the throne , saying , " It is done ! "
66016018	There were lightnings , sounds , and thunders ; and there was a great earthquake , such as was not since there were men on the earth , so great an earthquake , so mighty .
66016019	The great city was divided into three parts , and the cities of the nations fell . Babylon the great was remembered in the sight of God , to give to her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath .
66016020	Every island fled away , and the mountains were not found .
66016021	Great hailstones , about the weight of a talent , came down out of the sky on men . Men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail , for the plague of it is exceeding great .
66017001	One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me , saying , " Come here . I will show you the judgment of the great prostitute who sits on many waters ,
66017002	with whom the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality , and those who dwell in the earth were made drunken with the wine of her sexual immorality . "
66017003	He carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness . I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet-colored animal , full of blasphemous names , having seven heads and ten horns .
66017004	The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet , and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls , having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations , even the unclean things of her sexual immorality ,
66017005	and on her forehead a name written , " MYSTERY , BABYLON THE GREAT , THE MOTHER OF THE PROSTITUTES AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH . "
66017006	I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints , and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus . When I saw her , I wondered with great amazement .
66017007	The angel said to me , " Why do you wonder ? I will tell you the mystery of the woman , and of the beast that carries her , which has the seven heads and the ten horns .
66017008	The beast that you saw was , and is not ; and is about to come up out of the abyss , and to go into destruction . Those who dwell on the earth will wonder , whose name has not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world , when they see the beast , how that he was , and is not , and will come .
66017009	Here is the mind that has wisdom . The seven heads are seven mountains , on which the woman sits .
66017010	They are seven kings . Five have fallen , the one is , the other is not yet come . When he comes , he must continue a little while .
66017011	The beast that was , and is not , is himself also an eighth , and is of the seven ; and he goes to destruction .
66017012	The ten horns that you saw are ten kings , who have received no kingdom as yet , but they receive authority as kings , with the beast , for one hour .
66017013	These have one mind , and they give their power and authority to the beast .
66017014	These will war against the Lamb , and the Lamb will overcome them , for he is Lord of lords , and King of kings . They also will overcome who are with him , called and chosen and faithful . "
66017015	He said to me , " The waters which you saw , where the prostitute sits , are peoples , multitudes , nations , and languages .
66017016	The ten horns which you saw , and the beast , these will hate the prostitute , and will make her desolate and naked , and will eat her flesh , and will burn her utterly with fire .
66017017	For God has put in their hearts to do what he has in mind , and to come to unity of mind , and to give their kingdom to the beast , until the words of God should be accomplished .
66017018	The woman whom you saw is the great city , which reigns over the kings of the earth . "
66018001	After these things , I saw another angel coming down out of the sky , having great authority . The earth was illuminated with his glory .
66018002	He cried with a mighty voice , saying , " Fallen , fallen is Babylon the great , and has become a habitation of demons , and a prison of every unclean spirit , and a prison of every unclean and hateful bird !
66018003	For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her sexual immorality , the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality with her , and the merchants of the earth grew rich from the abundance of her luxury . "
66018004	I heard another voice from heaven , saying , " Come forth , my people , out of her , that you have no participation her sins , and that you don't receive of her plagues ,
66018005	for her sins have reached to the sky , and God has remembered her iniquities .
66018006	Return to her just as she returned , and double to her the double according to her works . In the cup which she mixed , mix to her double .
66018007	However much she glorified herself , and grew wanton , so much give her of torment and mourning . For she says in her heart , ' I sit a queen , and am no widow , and will in no way see mourning . '
66018008	Therefore in one day her plagues will come : death , mourning , and famine ; and she will be utterly burned with fire ; for the Lord God who has judged her is strong .
66018009	The kings of the earth , who committed sexual immorality and lived wantonly with her , will weep and wail over her , when they look at the smoke of her burning ,
66018010	standing far away for the fear of her torment , saying , ' Woe , woe , the great city , Babylon , the strong city ! For your judgment has come in one hour . '
66018011	The merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her , for no one buys their merchandise any more ;
66018012	merchandise of gold , silver , precious stones , pearls , fine linen , purple , silk , scarlet , all expensive wood , every vessel of ivory , every vessel made of most precious wood , and of brass , and iron , and marble ;
66018013	and cinnamon , spices , incense , ointment , frankincense , wine , oil , fine flour , wheat , cattle , and sheep ; and merchandise of horses and chariots and slaves ; and souls of men .
66018014	The fruits which your soul lusted after have been lost to you , and all things that were dainty and sumptuous have perished from you , and you will find them no more at all .
66018015	The merchants of these things , who were made rich by her , will stand far away for the fear of her torment , weeping and mourning ;
66018016	saying , ' Woe , woe , the great city , she who was dressed in fine linen , purple , and scarlet , and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls !
66018017	For in an hour such great riches are made desolate . ' Every shipmaster , and everyone who sails anywhere , and mariners , and as many as gain their living by sea , stood far away ,
66018018	and cried out as they looked at the smoke of her burning , saying , ' What is like the great city ? '
66018019	They cast dust on their heads , and cried , weeping and mourning , saying , ' Woe , woe , the great city , in which all who had their ships in the sea were made rich by reason of her great wealth ! ' For in one hour is she made desolate .
66018020	Rejoice over her , O heaven , you saints , you apostles , and you prophets ; for God has judged your judgment on her . "
66018021	A mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and cast it into the sea , saying , " Thus with violence will Babylon , the great city , be thrown down , and will be found no more at all .
66018022	The voice of harpers and minstrels and flute players and trumpeters will be heard no more at all in you . No craftsman , of whatever craft , will be found any more at all in you . The sound of a mill will be heard no more at all in you .
66018023	The light of a lamp will shine no more at all in you . The voice of the bridegroom and of the bride will be heard no more at all in you ; for your merchants were the princes of the earth ; for with your sorcery all the nations were deceived .
66018024	In her was found the blood of prophets and of saints , and of all who have been slain on the earth . "
66019001	After these things I heard something like a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven , saying , " Hallelujah ! Salvation , glory , and power belong to our God :
66019002	for true and righteous are his judgments . For he has judged the great prostitute , her who corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality , and he has avenged the blood of his servants at her hand . "
66019003	A second time they said , " Hallelujah ! Her smoke goes up forever and ever . "
66019004	The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped God who sits on the throne , saying , " Amen ! Hallelujah ! "
66019005	A voice came forth from the throne , saying , " Give praise to our God , all you his servants , you who fear him , the small and the great ! "
66019006	I heard something like the voice of a great multitude , and like the voice of many waters , and like the voice of mighty thunders , saying , " Hallelujah ! For the Lord our God , the Almighty , reigns !
66019007	Let us rejoice and be exceedingly glad , and let us give the glory to him . For the marriage of the Lamb has come , and his wife has made herself ready . "
66019008	It was given to her that she would array herself in bright , pure , fine linen : for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints .
66019009	He said to me , " Write , ' Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb . ' " He said to me , " These are true words of God . "
66019010	I fell down before his feet to worship him . He said to me , " Look ! Don't do it ! I am a fellow bondservant with you and with your brothers who hold the testimony of Jesus . Worship God , for the testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of Prophecy . "
66019011	I saw the heaven opened , and behold , a white horse , and he who sat on it is called Faithful and True . In righteousness he judges and makes war .
66019012	His eyes are a flame of fire , and on his head are many crowns . He has names written and a name written which no one knows but he himself .
66019013	He is clothed in a garment sprinkled with blood . His name is called " The Word of God . "
66019014	The armies which are in heaven followed him on white horses , clothed in white , pure , fine linen .
66019015	Out of his mouth proceeds a sharp , two-edged sword , that with it he should strike the nations . He will rule them with a rod of iron . He treads the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of God , the Almighty .
66019016	He has on his garment and on his thigh a name written , " KING OF KINGS , AND LORD OF LORDS . "
66019017	I saw an angel standing in the sun . He cried with a loud voice , saying to all the birds that fly in the sky , " Come ! Be gathered together to the great supper of God ,
66019018	that you may eat the flesh of kings , the flesh of captains , the flesh of mighty men , and the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them , and the flesh of all men , both free and slave , and small and great . "
66019019	I saw the beast , and the kings of the earth , and their armies , gathered together to make war against him who sat on the horse , and against his army .
66019020	The beast was taken , and with him the false prophet who worked the signs in his sight , with which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshipped his image . They two were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur .
66019021	The rest were killed with the sword of him who sat on the horse , the sword which came forth out of his mouth . All the birds were filled with their flesh .
66020001	I saw an angel coming down out of heaven , having the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand .
66020002	He seized the dragon , the old serpent , which is the Devil and Satan , and bound him for one thousand years ,
66020003	and cast him into the abyss , and shut it , and sealed it over him , that he should deceive the nations no more , until the thousand years were finished . After this , he must be freed for a short time .
66020004	I saw thrones , and they sat on them , and judgment was given to them . I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus , and for the word of God , and such as didn't worship the beast nor his image , and didn't receive the mark on their forehead and on their hand . They lived , and reigned with Christ one thousand years .
66020005	The rest of the dead didn't live until the thousand years were finished . This is the first resurrection .
66020006	Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection . Over these , the second death has no power , but they will be priests of God and of Christ , and will reign with him one thousand years .
66020007	And after the thousand years , Satan will be freed out of his prison ,
66020008	and will come forth to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth , Gog and Magog , to gather them together to the war ; the number of whom is as the sand of the sea .
66020009	They went up over the breadth of the earth , and surrounded the camp of the saints , and the beloved city . Fire came down out of heaven , and devoured them .
66020010	The devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur , where are also the beast and the false prophet . They will be tormented day and night forever and ever .
66020011	I saw a great white throne , and him who sat on it , from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away . There was found no place for them .
66020012	I saw the dead , the great and the small , standing before the throne . Books were opened . Another book was opened , which is the book of life . The dead were judged out of the things which were written in the books , according to their works .
66020013	The sea gave up the dead who were in it . Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them . They were judged , each one according to his works .
66020014	Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire . This is the second death , the lake of fire .
66020015	If anyone was not found written in the book of life , he was cast into the lake of fire .
66021001	I saw a new heaven and a new earth : for the first heaven and the first earth have passed away , and the sea is no more .
66021002	I saw the holy city , New Jerusalem , coming down out of heaven from God , made ready as a bride adorned for her husband .
66021003	I heard a loud voice out of heaven saying , " Behold , God's tent is with men , and he will dwell with them , and they will be his people , and God himself will be with them as their God .
66021004	He will wipe away every tear from their eyes . Death will be no more ; neither will there be mourning , nor crying , nor pain , any more . The first things have passed away .
66021005	He who sits on the throne said , " Behold , I make all things new . " He said , " Write , for these words are faithful and true . "
66021006	He said to me , " It is done ! I am the Alpha and the Omega , the Beginning and the End . I will give freely to him who is thirsty from the spring of the water of life .
66021007	He who overcomes , I will give him these things . I will be his God , and he will be my son .
66021008	But for the cowardly , unbelieving , sinners , abominable , murderers , sexually immoral , sorcerers , idolaters , and all liars , their part is in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur , which is the second death . "
66021009	One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls , who were laden with the seven last plagues came , and he spoke with me , saying , " Come here . I will show you the wife , the Lamb's bride . "
66021010	He carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain , and showed me the holy city , Jerusalem , coming down out of heaven from God ,
66021011	having the glory of God . Her light was like a most precious stone , as if it was a jasper stone , clear as crystal ;
66021012	having a great and high wall ; having twelve gates , and at the gates twelve angels ; and names written on them , which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel .
66021013	On the east were three gates ; and on the north three gates ; and on the south three gates ; and on the west three gates .
66021014	The wall of the city had twelve foundations , and on them twelve names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb .
66021015	He who spoke with me had for a measure a golden reed to measure the city , its gates , and its walls .
66021016	The city lies foursquare , and its length is as great as its breadth . He measured the city with the reed , twelve thousand stadia . Its length , breadth , and height are equal .
66021017	He measured its wall , one hundred forty-four cubits , by the measure of a man , that is , of an angel .
66021018	The construction of its wall was jasper . The city was pure gold , like pure glass .
66021019	The foundations of the city's wall were adorned with all kinds of precious stones . The first foundation was jasper ; the second , sapphire ; the third , chalcedony ; the fourth , emerald ;
66021020	the fifth , sardonyx ; the sixth , sardius ; the seventh , chrysolite ; the eighth , beryl ; the ninth , topaz ; the tenth , chrysoprasus ; the eleventh , jacinth ; and the twelfth , amethyst .
66021021	The twelve gates were twelve pearls . Each one of the gates was made of one pearl . The street of the city was pure gold , like transparent glass .
66021022	I saw no temple in it , for the Lord God , the Almighty , and the Lamb , are its temple .
66021023	The city has no need for the sun , neither of the moon , to shine , for the very glory of God illuminated it , and its lamp is the Lamb .
66021024	The nations will walk in its light . The kings of the earth bring their glory into it .
66021025	Its gates will in no way be shut by day ( for there will be no night there ) ,
66021026	and they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it .
66021027	There will in no way enter into it anything profane , or one who causes an abomination or a lie , but only those who are written in the Lamb's book of life .
66022001	He showed me a river of water of life , clear as crystal , proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb ,
66022002	in the midst of its street . On this side of the river and on that was the tree of life , bearing twelve kinds of fruits , yielding its fruit every month . The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations .
66022003	There will be no curse any more . The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it , and his servants will serve him .
66022004	They will see his face , and his name will be on their foreheads .
66022005	There will be no more night , and they need no lamp light , neither sunlight ; for the Lord God will give them light . They will reign forever and ever .
66022006	He said to me , " These words are faithful and true . The Lord , the God of the spirits of the prophets , sent his angels to show to his servants the things which must happen soon . "
66022007	" Behold , I come quickly . Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book . "
66022008	Now I , John , am the one who heard and saw these things . When I heard and saw , I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who showed me these things .
66022009	He said to me , " See you don't do it ! I am a fellow bondservant with you and with your brothers , the prophets , and with those who keep the words of this book . Worship God . "
66022010	He said to me , " Don't seal up the words of the prophecy of this book , for the time is at hand .
66022011	He who acts unjustly , let him act unjustly still . He who is filthy , let him be filthy still . He who is righteous , let him do righteousness still . He who is holy , let him be holy still . "
66022012	" Behold , I come quickly . My reward is with me , to repay to each man according to his work .
66022013	I am the Alpha and the Omega , the First and the Last , the Beginning and the End .
66022014	Blessed are those who do his commandments , that they may have the right to the tree of life , and may enter in by the gates into the city .
66022015	Outside are the dogs , the sorcerers , the sexually immoral , the murderers , the idolaters , and everyone who loves and practices falsehood .
66022016	I , Jesus , have sent my angel to testify these things to you for the assemblies . I am the root and the offspring of David ; the Bright and Morning Star . "
66022017	The Spirit and the bride say , " Come ! " He who hears , let him say , " Come ! " He who is thirsty , let him come . He who desires , let him take the water of life freely .
66022018	I testify to every man who hears the words of the prophecy of this book , if anyone adds to them , may God add to him the plagues which are written in this book .
66022019	If anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy , may God take away his part from the tree of life , and out of the holy city , which are written in this book .
66022020	He who testifies these things says , " Yes , I come quickly . " Amen ! Come , Lord Jesus .
66022021	The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the saints . Amen .
