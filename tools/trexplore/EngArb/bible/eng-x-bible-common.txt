40001001	A record of the ancestors of Jesus Christ , son of David , son of Abraham :
40001002	Abraham was the father of Isaac . Isaac was the father of Jacob . Jacob was the father of Judah and his brothers .
40001003	Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah , whose mother was Tamar . Perez was the father of Hezron . Hezron was the father of Aram .
40001004	Aram was the father of Amminadab . Amminadab was the father of Nahshon . Nahshon was the father of Salmon .
40001005	Salmon was the father of Boaz , whose mother was Rahab . Boaz was the father of Obed , whose mother was Ruth . Obed was the father of Jesse .
40001006	Jesse was the father of David the king . David was the father of Solomon , whose mother had been the wife of Uriah .
40001007	Solomon was the father of Rehoboam . Rehoboam was the father of Abijah . Abijah was the father of Asaph .
40001008	Asaph was the father of Jehoshaphat . Jehoshaphat was the father of Joram . Joram was the father of Uzziah .
40001009	Uzziah was the father of Jotham . Jotham was the father of Ahaz . Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah .
40001010	Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh . Manasseh was the father of Amos . Amos was the father of Josiah .
40001011	Josiah was the father of Jechoniah and his brothers . This was at the time of the exile to Babylon .
40001012	After the exile to Babylon : Jechoniah was the father of Shealtiel . Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel .
40001013	Zerubbabel was the father of Abiud . Abiud was the father of Eliakim . Eliakim was the father of Azor .
40001014	Azor was the father of Zadok . Zadok was the father of Achim . Achim was the father of Eliud .
40001015	Eliud was the father of Eleazar . Eleazar was the father of Matthan . Matthan was the father of Jacob .
40001016	Jacob was the father of Joseph , the husband of Mary — of whom Jesus was born , who is called the Christ .
40001017	So there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David , fourteen generations from David to the exile to Babylon , and fourteen generations from the exile to Babylon to the Christ .
40001018	This is how the birth of Jesus Christ took place . When Mary his mother was engaged to Joseph , before they were married , she became pregnant by the Holy Spirit .
40001019	Joseph her husband was a righteous man . Because he didn’t want to humiliate her , he decided to call off their engagement quietly .
40001020	As he was thinking about this , an angel from the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said , " Joseph son of David , don’t be afraid to take Mary as your wife , because the child she carries was conceived by the Holy Spirit .
40001021	She will give birth to a son , and you will call him Jesus , because he will save his people from their sins . "
40001022	Now all of this took place so that what the Lord had spoken through the prophet would be fulfilled :
40001023	Look ! A virgin will become pregnant and give birth to a son , ( Emmanuel means " God with us . " )
40001024	When Joseph woke up , he did just as an angel from God commanded and took Mary as his wife .
40001025	But he didn’t have sexual relations with her until she gave birth to a son . Joseph called him Jesus .
40002001	After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in the territory of Judea during the rule of King Herod , magi came from the east to Jerusalem .
40002002	They asked , " Where is the newborn king of the Jews ? We’ve seen his star in the east , and we’ve come to honor him . "
40002003	When King Herod heard this , he was troubled , and everyone in Jerusalem was troubled with him .
40002004	He gathered all the chief priests and the legal experts and asked them where the Christ was to be born .
40002005	They said , " In Bethlehem of Judea , for this is what the prophet wrote :
40002006	You , Bethlehem , land of Judah ,
40002007	Then Herod secretly called for the magi and found out from them the time when the star had first appeared .
40002008	He sent them to Bethlehem , saying , " Go and search carefully for the child . When you’ve found him , report to me so that I too may go and honor him . "
40002009	When they heard the king , they went ; and look , the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stood over the place where the child was .
40002010	When they saw the star , they were filled with joy .
40002011	They entered the house and saw the child with Mary his mother . Falling to their knees , they honored him . Then they opened their treasure chests and presented him with gifts of gold , frankincense , and myrrh .
40002012	Because they were warned in a dream not to return to Herod , they went back to their own country by another route .
40002013	When the magi had departed , an angel from the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said , " Get up . Take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt . Stay there until I tell you , for Herod will soon search for the child in order to kill him . "
40002014	Joseph got up and , during the night , took the child and his mother to Egypt .
40002015	He stayed there until Herod died . This fulfilled what the Lord had spoken through the prophet : I have called my son out of Egypt .
40002016	When Herod knew the magi had fooled him , he grew very angry . He sent soldiers to kill all the male children in Bethlehem and in all the surrounding territory who were two years old and younger , according to the time that he had learned from the magi .
40002017	This fulfilled the word spoken through Jeremiah the prophet :
40002018	A voice was heard in Ramah , weeping and much grieving .
40002019	After King Herod died , an angel from the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt .
40002020	" Get up , " the angel said , " and take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel . Those who were trying to kill the child are dead . "
40002021	Joseph got up , took the child and his mother , and went to the land of Israel .
40002022	But when he heard that Archelaus ruled over Judea in place of his father Herod , Joseph was afraid to go there . Having been warned in a dream , he went to the area of Galilee .
40002023	He settled in a city called Nazareth so that what was spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled : He will be called a Nazarene .
40003001	In those days John the Baptist appeared in the desert of Judea announcing ,
40003002	" Change your hearts and lives ! Here comes the kingdom of heaven ! "
40003003	He was the one of whom Isaiah the prophet spoke when he said : The voice of one shouting in the wilderness ,
40003004	John wore clothes made of camel’s hair , with a leather belt around his waist . He ate locusts and wild honey .
40003005	People from Jerusalem , throughout Judea , and all around the Jordan River came to him .
40003006	As they confessed their sins , he baptized them in the Jordan River .
40003007	Many Pharisees and Sadducees came to be baptized by John . He said to them , " You children of snakes ! Who warned you to escape from the angry judgment that is coming soon ?
40003008	Produce fruit that shows you have changed your hearts and lives .
40003009	And don’t even think about saying to yourselves , Abraham is our father . I tell you that God is able to raise up Abraham’s children from these stones .
40003010	The ax is already at the root of the trees . Therefore , every tree that doesn’t produce good fruit will be chopped down and tossed into the fire .
40003011	I baptize with water those of you who have changed your hearts and lives . The one who is coming after me is stronger than I am . I’m not worthy to carry his sandals . He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire .
40003012	The shovel he uses to sift the wheat from the husks is in his hands . He will clean out his threshing area and bring the wheat into his barn . But he will burn the husks with a fire that can’t be put out . "
40003013	At that time Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River so that John would baptize him .
40003014	John tried to stop him and said , " I need to be baptized by you , yet you come to me ? "
40003015	Jesus answered , " Allow me to be baptized now . This is necessary to fulfill all righteousness . " So John agreed to baptize Jesus .
40003016	When Jesus was baptized , he immediately came up out of the water . Heaven was opened to him , and he saw the Spirit of God coming down like a dove and resting on him .
40003017	A voice from heaven said , " This is my Son whom I dearly love ; I find happiness in him . "
40004001	Then the Spirit led Jesus up into the wilderness so that the devil might tempt him .
40004002	After Jesus had fasted for forty days and forty nights , he was starving .
40004003	The tempter came to him and said , " Since you are God’s Son , command these stones to become bread . "
40004004	Jesus replied , " It’s written , People won’t live only by bread , but by every word spoken by God . "
40004005	After that the devil brought him into the holy city and stood him at the highest point of the temple . He said to him ,
40004006	" Since you are God’s Son , throw yourself down ; for it is written , I will command my angels concerning you , and they will take you up in their hands so that you won’t hit your foot on a stone . "
40004007	Jesus replied , " Again it’s written , Don’t test the Lord your God . "
40004008	Then the devil brought him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory .
40004009	He said , " I’ll give you all these if you bow down and worship me . "
40004010	Jesus responded , " Go away , Satan , because it’s written , You will worship the Lord your God and serve only him . "
40004011	The devil left him , and angels came and took care of him .
40004012	Now when Jesus heard that John was arrested , he went to Galilee .
40004013	He left Nazareth and settled in Capernaum , which lies alongside the sea in the area of Zebulun and Naphtali .
40004014	This fulfilled what Isaiah the prophet said :
40004015	Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali ,
40004016	the people who lived in the dark have seen a great light ,
40004017	From that time Jesus began to announce , " Change your hearts and lives ! Here comes the kingdom of heaven ! "
40004018	As Jesus walked alongside the Galilee Sea , he saw two brothers , Simon , who is called Peter , and Andrew , throwing fishing nets into the sea , because they were fishermen .
40004019	" Come , follow me , " he said , " and I’ll show you how to fish for people . "
40004020	Right away , they left their nets and followed him .
40004021	Continuing on , he saw another set of brothers , James the son of Zebedee and his brother John . They were in a boat with Zebedee their father repairing their nets . Jesus called them and
40004022	immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him .
40004023	Jesus traveled throughout Galilee , teaching in their synagogues . He announced the good news of the kingdom and healed every disease and sickness among the people .
40004024	News about him spread throughout Syria . People brought to him all those who had various kinds of diseases , those in pain , those possessed by demons , those with epilepsy , and those who were paralyzed , and he healed them .
40004025	Large crowds followed him from Galilee , the Decapolis , Jerusalem , Judea , and from the areas beyond the Jordan River .
40005001	Now when Jesus saw the crowds , he went up a mountain . He sat down and his disciples came to him .
40005002	He taught them , saying :
40005003	“ Happy are people who are hopeless , because the kingdom of heaven is theirs .
40005004	“ Happy are people who grieve , because they will be made glad .
40005005	“ Happy are people who are humble , because they will inherit the earth .
40005006	“ Happy are people who are hungry and thirsty for righteousness , because they will be fed until they are full .
40005007	“ Happy are people who show mercy , because they will receive mercy .
40005008	“ Happy are people who have pure hearts , because they will see God .
40005009	“ Happy are people who make peace , because they will be called God’s children .
40005010	“ Happy are people whose lives are harassed because they are righteous , because the kingdom of heaven is theirs .
40005011	“ Happy are you when people insult you and harass you and speak all kinds of bad and false things about you , all because of me .
40005012	Be full of joy and be glad , because you have a great reward in heaven . In the same way , people harassed the prophets who came before you .
40005013	“ You are the salt of the earth . But if salt loses its saltiness , how will it become salty again ? It’s good for nothing except to be thrown away and trampled under people’s feet .
40005014	You are the light of the world . A city on top of a hill can’t be hidden .
40005015	Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a basket . Instead , they put it on top of a lampstand , and it shines on all who are in the house .
40005016	In the same way , let your light shine before people , so they can see the good things you do and praise your Father who is in heaven .
40005017	“ Don’t even begin to think that I have come to do away with the Law and the Prophets . I haven’t come to do away with them but to fulfill them .
40005018	I say to you very seriously that as long as heaven and earth exist , neither the smallest letter nor even the smallest stroke of a pen will be erased from the Law until everything there becomes a reality .
40005019	Therefore , whoever ignores one of the least of these commands and teaches others to do the same will be called the lowest in the kingdom of heaven . But whoever keeps these commands and teaches people to keep them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven .
40005020	I say to you that unless your righteousness is greater than the righteousness of the legal experts and the Pharisees , you will never enter the kingdom of heaven .
40005021	“ You have heard that it was said to those who lived long ago , Don’t commit murder , and all who commit murder will be in danger of judgment .
40005022	But I say to you that everyone who is angry with their brother or sister will be in danger of judgment . If they say to their brother or sister , ‘ You idiot , ’ they will be in danger of being condemned by the governing council . And if they say , ‘ You fool , ’ they will be in danger of fiery hell .
40005023	Therefore , if you bring your gift to the altar and there remember that your brother or sister has something against you ,
40005024	leave your gift at the altar and go . First make things right with your brother or sister and then come back and offer your gift .
40005025	Be sure to make friends quickly with your opponents while you are with them on the way to court . Otherwise , they will haul you before the judge , the judge will turn you over to the officer of the court , and you will be thrown into prison .
40005026	I say to you in all seriousness that you won’t get out of there until you’ve paid the very last penny .
40005027	“ You have heard that it was said , Don’t commit adultery .
40005028	But I say to you that every man who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery in his heart .
40005029	And if your right eye causes you to fall into sin , tear it out and throw it away . It’s better that you lose a part of your body than that your whole body be thrown into hell .
40005030	And if your right hand causes you to fall into sin , chop it off and throw it away . It’s better that you lose a part of your body than that your whole body go into hell .
40005031	“ It was said , ‘ Whoever divorces his wife must give her a divorce certificate . ’
40005032	But I say to you that whoever divorces his wife except for sexual unfaithfulness forces her to commit adultery . And whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery .
40005033	“ Again you have heard that it was said to those who lived long ago : Don’t make a false solemn pledge , but you should follow through on what you have pledged to the Lord .
40005034	But I say to you that you must not pledge at all . You must not pledge by heaven , because it’s God’s throne .
40005035	You must not pledge by the earth , because it’s God’s footstool . You must not pledge by Jerusalem , because it’s the city of the great king .
40005036	And you must not pledge by your head , because you can’t turn one hair white or black .
40005037	Let your yes mean yes , and your no mean no . Anything more than this comes from the evil one .
40005038	“ You have heard that it was said , An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth .
40005039	But I say to you that you must not oppose those who want to hurt you . If people slap you on your right cheek , you must turn the left cheek to them as well .
40005040	When they wish to haul you to court and take your shirt , let them have your coat too .
40005041	When they force you to go one mile , go with them two .
40005042	Give to those who ask , and don’t refuse those who wish to borrow from you .
40005043	“ You have heard that it was said , You must love your neighbor and hate your enemy .
40005044	But I say to you , love your enemies and pray for those who harass you
40005045	so that you will be acting as children of your Father who is in heaven . He makes the sun rise on both the evil and the good and sends rain on both the righteous and the unrighteous .
40005046	If you love only those who love you , what reward do you have ? Don’t even the tax collectors do the same ?
40005047	And if you greet only your brothers and sisters , what more are you doing ? Don’t even the Gentiles do the same ?
40005048	Therefore , just as your heavenly Father is complete in showing love to everyone , so also you must be complete .
40006001	“ Be careful that you don’t practice your religion in front of people to draw their attention . If you do , you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven .
40006002	“ Whenever you give to the poor , don’t blow your trumpet as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets so that they may get praise from people . I assure you , that’s the only reward they’ll get .
40006003	But when you give to the poor , don’t let your left hand know what your right hand is doing
40006004	so that you may give to the poor in secret . Your Father who sees what you do in secret will reward you .
40006005	“ When you pray , don’t be like hypocrites . They love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners so that people will see them . I assure you , that’s the only reward they’ll get .
40006006	But when you pray , go to your room , shut the door , and pray to your Father who is present in that secret place . Your Father who sees what you do in secret will reward you .
40006007	“ When you pray , don’t pour out a flood of empty words , as the Gentiles do . They think that by saying many words they’ll be heard .
40006008	Don’t be like them , because your Father knows what you need before you ask .
40006009	Pray like this : Our Father who is in heaven , uphold the holiness of your name .
40006010	Bring in your kingdom so that your will is done on earth as it’s done in heaven .
40006011	Give us the bread we need for today .
40006012	Forgive us for the ways we have wronged you , just as we also forgive those who have wronged us .
40006013	And don’t lead us into temptation , but rescue us from the evil one .
40006014	“ If you forgive others their sins , your heavenly Father will also forgive you .
40006015	But if you don’t forgive others , neither will your Father forgive your sins .
40006016	“ And when you fast , don’t put on a sad face like the hypocrites . They distort their faces so people will know they are fasting . I assure you that they have their reward .
40006017	When you fast , brush your hair and wash your face .
40006018	Then you won’t look like you are fasting to people , but only to your Father who is present in that secret place . Your Father who sees in secret will reward you .
40006019	“ Stop collecting treasures for your own benefit on earth , where moth and rust eat them and where thieves break in and steal them .
40006020	Instead , collect treasures for yourselves in heaven , where moth and rust don’t eat them and where thieves don’t break in and steal them .
40006021	Where your treasure is , there your heart will be also .
40006022	“ The eye is the lamp of the body . Therefore , if your eye is healthy , your whole body will be full of light .
40006023	But if your eye is bad , your whole body will be full of darkness . If then the light in you is darkness , how terrible that darkness will be !
40006024	No one can serve two masters . Either you will hate the one and love the other , or you will be loyal to the one and have contempt for the other . You cannot serve God and wealth .
40006025	“ Therefore , I say to you , don’t worry about your life , what you’ll eat or what you’ll drink , or about your body , what you’ll wear . Isn’t life more than food and the body more than clothes ?
40006026	Look at the birds in the sky . They don’t sow seed or harvest grain or gather crops into barns . Yet your heavenly Father feeds them . Aren’t you worth much more than they are ?
40006027	Who among you by worrying can add a single moment to your life ?
40006028	And why do you worry about clothes ? Notice how the lilies in the field grow . They don’t wear themselves out with work , and they don’t spin cloth .
40006029	But I say to you that even Solomon in all of his splendor wasn’t dressed like one of these .
40006030	If God dresses grass in the field so beautifully , even though it’s alive today and tomorrow it’s thrown into the furnace , won’t God do much more for you , you people of weak faith ?
40006031	Therefore , don’t worry and say , ‘ What are we going to eat ? ’ or ‘ What are we going to drink ? ’ or ‘ What are we going to wear ? ’
40006032	Gentiles long for all these things . Your heavenly Father knows that you need them .
40006033	Instead , desire first and foremost God’s kingdom and God’s righteousness , and all these things will be given to you as well .
40006034	Therefore , stop worrying about tomorrow , because tomorrow will worry about itself . Each day has enough trouble of its own .
40007001	“ Don’t judge , so that you won’t be judged .
40007002	You’ll receive the same judgment you give . Whatever you deal out will be dealt out to you .
40007003	Why do you see the splinter that’s in your brother’s or sister’s eye , but don’t notice the log in your own eye ?
40007004	How can you say to your brother or sister , ‘ Let me take the splinter out of your eye , ’ when there’s a log in your eye ?
40007005	You deceive yourself ! First take the log out of your eye , and then you’ll see clearly to take the splinter out of your brother’s or sister’s eye .
40007006	Don’t give holy things to dogs , and don’t throw your pearls in front of pigs . They will stomp on the pearls , then turn around and attack you .
40007007	“ Ask , and you will receive . Search , and you will find . Knock , and the door will be opened to you .
40007008	For everyone who asks , receives . Whoever seeks , finds . And to everyone who knocks , the door is opened .
40007009	Who among you will give your children a stone when they ask for bread ?
40007010	Or give them a snake when they ask for fish ?
40007011	If you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will your heavenly Father give good things to those who ask him .
40007012	Therefore , you should treat people in the same way that you want people to treat you ; this is the Law and the Prophets .
40007013	“ Go in through the narrow gate . The gate that leads to destruction is broad and the road wide , so many people enter through it .
40007014	But the gate that leads to life is narrow and the road difficult , so few people find it .
40007015	“ Watch out for false prophets . They come to you dressed like sheep , but inside they are vicious wolves .
40007016	You will know them by their fruit . Do people get bunches of grapes from thorny weeds , or do they get figs from thistles ?
40007017	In the same way , every good tree produces good fruit , and every rotten tree produces bad fruit .
40007018	A good tree can’t produce bad fruit . And a rotten tree can’t produce good fruit .
40007019	Every tree that doesn’t produce good fruit is chopped down and thrown into the fire .
40007020	Therefore , you will know them by their fruit .
40007021	“ Not everybody who says to me , ‘ Lord , Lord , ’ will get into the kingdom of heaven . Only those who do the will of my Father who is in heaven will enter .
40007022	On the Judgment Day , many people will say to me , ‘ Lord , Lord , didn’t we prophesy in your name and expel demons in your name and do lots of miracles in your name ? ’
40007023	Then I’ll tell them , ‘ I’ve never known you . Get away from me , you people who do wrong . ’
40007024	" Everybody who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise builder who built a house on bedrock .
40007025	The rain fell , the floods came , and the wind blew and beat against that house . It didn’t fall because it was firmly set on bedrock .
40007026	But everybody who hears these words of mine and doesn’t put them into practice will be like a fool who built a house on sand .
40007027	The rain fell , the floods came , and the wind blew and beat against that house . It fell and was completely destroyed . "
40007028	When Jesus finished these words , the crowds were amazed at his teaching
40007029	because he was teaching them like someone with authority and not like their legal experts .
40008001	Now when Jesus had come down from the mountain , large crowds followed him .
40008002	A man with a skin disease came , kneeled before him , and said , " Lord , if you want , you can make me clean . "
40008003	Jesus reached out his hand and touched him , saying , " I do want to . Become clean . " Instantly his skin disease was cleansed .
40008004	Jesus said to him , " Don’t say anything to anyone . Instead , go and show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded . This will be a testimony to them . "
40008005	When Jesus went to Capernaum , a centurion approached ,
40008006	pleading with him , " Lord , my servant is flat on his back at home , paralyzed , and his suffering is awful . "
40008007	Jesus responded , " I’ll come and heal him . "
40008008	But the centurion replied , " Lord , I don’t deserve to have you come under my roof . Just say the word and my servant will be healed .
40008009	I’m a man under authority , with soldiers under me . I say to one , ‘ Go , ’ and he goes , and to another , ‘ Come , ’ and he comes . I say to my servant , ‘ Do this , ’ and the servant does it . "
40008010	When Jesus heard this , he was impressed and said to the people following him , " I say to you with all seriousness that even in Israel I haven’t found faith like this .
40008011	I say to you that there are many who will come from east and west and sit down to eat with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven .
40008012	But the children of the kingdom will be thrown outside into the darkness . People there will be weeping and grinding their teeth . "
40008013	Jesus said to the centurion , " Go ; it will be done for you just as you have believed . " And his servant was healed that very moment .
40008014	Jesus went home with Peter and saw Peter’s mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever .
40008015	He touched her hand , and the fever left her . Then she got up and served them .
40008016	That evening people brought to Jesus many who were demon-possessed . He threw the spirits out with just a word . He healed everyone who was sick .
40008017	This happened so that what Isaiah the prophet said would be fulfilled : He is the one who took our illnesses and carried away our diseases .
40008018	Now when Jesus saw the crowd , he ordered his disciples to go over to the other side of the lake .
40008019	A legal expert came and said to him , " Teacher , I’ll follow you wherever you go . "
40008020	Jesus replied , " Foxes have dens , and the birds in the sky have nests , but the Human One has no place to lay his head . "
40008021	Another man , one of his disciples , said to him , " Lord , first let me go and bury my father . "
40008022	But Jesus said to him , " Follow me , and let the dead bury their own dead . "
40008023	When Jesus got into a boat , his disciples followed him .
40008024	A huge storm arose on the lake so that waves were sloshing over the boat . But Jesus was asleep .
40008025	They came and woke him , saying , " Lord , rescue us ! We’re going to drown ! "
40008026	He said to them , " Why are you afraid , you people of weak faith ? " Then he got up and gave orders to the winds and the lake , and there was a great calm .
40008027	The people were amazed and said , " What kind of person is this ? Even the winds and the lake obey him ! "
40008028	When Jesus arrived on the other side of the lake in the country of the Gadarenes , two men who were demon-possessed came from among the tombs to meet him . They were so violent that nobody could travel on that road .
40008029	They cried out , " What are you going to do with us , Son of God ? Have you come to torture us before the time of judgment ? "
40008030	Far off in the distance a large herd of pigs was feeding .
40008031	The demons pleaded with him , " If you throw us out , send us into the herd of pigs . "
40008032	Then he said to the demons , " Go away , " and they came out and went into the pigs . The whole herd rushed down the cliff into the lake and drowned .
40008033	Those who tended the pigs ran into the city and told everything that had happened to the demon-possessed men .
40008034	Then the whole city came out and met Jesus . When they saw him , they pleaded with him to leave their region .
40009001	Boarding a boat , Jesus crossed to the other side of the lake and went to his own city .
40009002	People brought to him a man who was paralyzed , lying on a cot . When Jesus saw their faith , he said to the man who was paralyzed , " Be encouraged , my child , your sins are forgiven . "
40009003	Some legal experts said among themselves , " This man is insulting God . "
40009004	But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said , " Why do you fill your minds with evil things ?
40009005	Which is easier — to say , ‘ Your sins are forgiven , ’ or to say , ‘ Get up and walk ’ ?
40009006	But so you will know that the Human One has authority on the earth to forgive sins " — he said to the man who was paralyzed — " Get up , take your cot , and go home . "
40009007	The man got up and went home .
40009008	When the crowds saw what had happened , they were afraid and praised God , who had given such authority to human beings .
40009009	As Jesus continued on from there , he saw a man named Matthew sitting at a kiosk for collecting taxes . He said to him , " Follow me , " and he got up and followed him .
40009010	As Jesus sat down to eat in Matthew’s house , many tax collectors and sinners joined Jesus and his disciples at the table .
40009011	But when the Pharisees saw this , they said to his disciples , " Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners ? "
40009012	When Jesus heard it , he said , " Healthy people don’t need a doctor , but sick people do .
40009013	Go and learn what this means : I want mercy and not sacrifice . I didn’t come to call righteous people , but sinners . "
40009014	At that time John’s disciples came and asked Jesus , " Why do we and the Pharisees frequently fast , but your disciples never fast ? "
40009015	Jesus responded , “ The wedding guests can’t mourn while the groom is still with them , can they ? But the days will come when the groom will be taken away from them , and then they’ll fast .
40009016	" No one sews a piece of new , unshrunk cloth on old clothes because the patch tears away the cloth and makes a worse tear .
40009017	No one pours new wine into old wineskins . If they did , the wineskins would burst , the wine would spill , and the wineskins would be ruined . Instead , people pour new wine into new wineskins so that both are kept safe . "
40009018	While Jesus was speaking to them , a ruler came and knelt in front of him , saying , " My daughter has just died . But come and place your hand on her , and she’ll live . "
40009019	So Jesus and his disciples got up and went with him .
40009020	Then a woman who had been bleeding for twelve years came up behind Jesus and touched the hem of his clothes .
40009021	She thought , If I only touch his robe I’ll be healed .
40009022	When Jesus turned and saw her , he said , " Be encouraged , daughter . Your faith has healed you . " And the woman was healed from that time on .
40009023	When Jesus went into the ruler’s house , he saw the flute players and the distressed crowd .
40009024	He said , " Go away , because the little girl isn’t dead but is asleep " ; but they laughed at him .
40009025	After he had sent the crowd away , Jesus went in and touched her hand , and the little girl rose up .
40009026	News about this spread throughout that whole region .
40009027	As Jesus departed , two blind men followed him , crying out , " Show us mercy , Son of David . "
40009028	When he came into the house , the blind men approached him . Jesus said to them , " Do you believe I can do this ? " " Yes , Lord , " they replied .
40009029	Then Jesus touched their eyes and said , " It will happen for you just as you have believed . "
40009030	Their eyes were opened . Then Jesus sternly warned them , " Make sure nobody knows about this . "
40009031	But they went out and spread the word about him throughout that whole region .
40009032	As they were leaving , people brought to him a man who was demon-possessed and unable to speak .
40009033	When Jesus had thrown out the demon , the man who couldn’t speak began to talk . The crowds were amazed and said , " Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel . "
40009034	But the Pharisees said , " He throws out demons with the authority of the ruler of demons . "
40009035	Jesus traveled among all the cities and villages , teaching in their synagogues , announcing the good news of the kingdom , and healing every disease and every sickness .
40009036	Now when Jesus saw the crowds , he had compassion for them because they were troubled and helpless , like sheep without a shepherd .
40009037	Then he said to his disciples , " The size of the harvest is bigger than you can imagine , but there are few workers .
40009038	Therefore , plead with the Lord of the harvest to send out workers for his harvest . "
40010001	He called his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits to throw them out and to heal every disease and every sickness .
40010002	Here are the names of the twelve apostles : first , Simon , who is called Peter ; and Andrew his brother ; James the son of Zebedee ; and John his brother ;
40010003	Philip ; and Bartholomew ; Thomas ; and Matthew the tax collector ; James the son of Alphaeus ; and Thaddaeus ;
40010004	Simon the Cananaean ; and Judas , who betrayed Jesus .
40010005	Jesus sent these twelve out and commanded them , “ Don’t go among the Gentiles or into a Samaritan city .
40010006	Go instead to the lost sheep , the people of Israel .
40010007	As you go , make this announcement : ‘ The kingdom of heaven has come near . ’
40010008	Heal the sick , raise the dead , cleanse those with skin diseases , and throw out demons . You received without having to pay . Therefore , give without demanding payment .
40010009	Workers deserve to be fed , so don’t gather gold or silver or copper coins for your money belts to take on your trips .
40010010	Don’t take a backpack for the road or two shirts or sandals or a walking stick .
40010011	Whatever city or village you go into , find somebody in it who is worthy and stay there until you go on your way .
40010012	When you go into a house , say , ‘ Peace ! ’
40010013	If the house is worthy , give it your blessing of peace . But if the house isn’t worthy , take back your blessing .
40010014	If anyone refuses to welcome you or listen to your words , shake the dust off your feet as you leave that house or city .
40010015	I assure you that it will be more bearable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah on Judgment Day than it will be for that city .
40010016	“ Look , I’m sending you as sheep among wolves . Therefore , be wise as snakes and innocent as doves .
40010017	Watch out for people — because they will hand you over to councils and they will beat you in their synagogues .
40010018	They will haul you in front of governors and even kings because of me so that you may give your testimony to them and to the Gentiles .
40010019	Whenever they hand you over , don’t worry about how to speak or what you will say , because what you can say will be given to you at that moment .
40010020	You aren’t doing the talking , but the Spirit of my Father is doing the talking through you .
40010021	Brothers and sisters will hand each other over to be executed . A father will turn his child in . Children will defy their parents and have them executed .
40010022	Everyone will hate you on account of my name . But whoever stands firm until the end will be saved .
40010023	Whenever they harass you in one city , escape to the next , because I assure that you will not go through all the cities of Israel before the Human One comes .
40010024	“ Disciples aren’t greater than their teacher , and slaves aren’t greater than their master .
40010025	It’s enough for disciples to be like their teacher and slaves like their master . If they have called the head of the house Beelzebul , it’s certain that they will call the members of his household by even worse names .
40010026	“ Therefore , don’t be afraid of those people because nothing is hidden that won’t be revealed , and nothing secret that won’t be brought out into the open .
40010027	What I say to you in the darkness , tell in the light ; and what you hear whispered , announce from the rooftops .
40010028	Don’t be afraid of those who kill the body but can’t kill the soul . Instead , be afraid of the one who can destroy both body and soul in hell .
40010029	Aren’t two sparrows sold for a small coin ? But not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father knowing about it already .
40010030	Even the hairs of your head are all counted .
40010031	Don’t be afraid . You are worth more than many sparrows .
40010032	“ Therefore , everyone who acknowledges me before people , I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven .
40010033	But everyone who denies me before people , I also will deny before my Father who is in heaven .
40010034	“ Don’t think that I’ve come to bring peace to the earth . I haven’t come to bring peace but a sword .
40010035	I’ve come to turn a man against his father , a daughter against her mother , and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law .
40010036	People’s enemies are members of their own households .
40010037	“ Those who love father or mother more than me aren’t worthy of me . Those who love son or daughter more than me aren’t worthy of me .
40010038	Those who don’t pick up their crosses and follow me aren’t worthy of me .
40010039	Those who find their lives will lose them , and those who lose their lives because of me will find them .
40010040	" Those who receive you are also receiving me , and those who receive me are receiving the one who sent me .
40010041	Those who receive a prophet as a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward . Those who receive a righteous person as a righteous person will receive a righteous person’s reward .
40010042	I assure you that everybody who gives even a cup of cold water to these little ones because they are my disciples will certainly be rewarded . "
40011001	When Jesus finished teaching his twelve disciples , he went on from there to teach and preach in their cities .
40011002	Now when John heard in prison about the things Jesus was doing , he sent word by his disciples to Jesus , asking ,
40011003	" Are you the one who is to come , or should we look for another ? "
40011004	Jesus responded , " Go , report to John what you hear and see .
40011005	Those who were blind are able to see . Those who were crippled are walking . People with skin diseases are cleansed . Those who were deaf now hear . Those who were dead are raised up . The poor have good news proclaimed to them .
40011006	Happy are those who don’t stumble and fall because of me . "
40011007	When John’s disciples had gone , Jesus spoke to the crowds about John : “ What did you go out to the wilderness to see ? A stalk blowing in the wind ?
40011008	What did you go out to see ? A man dressed up in refined clothes ? Look , those who wear refined clothes are in royal palaces .
40011009	What did you go out to see ? A prophet ? Yes , I tell you , and more than a prophet .
40011010	He is the one of whom it is written : Look , I’m sending my messenger before you , who will prepare your way before you .
40011011	“ I assure you that no one who has ever been born is greater than John the Baptist . Yet whoever is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he .
40011012	From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven is violently attacked as violent people seize it .
40011013	All the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John came .
40011014	If you are willing to accept it , he is Elijah who is to come .
40011015	Let the person who has ears , hear .
40011016	" To what will I compare this generation ? It is like a child sitting in the marketplaces calling out to others ,
40011017	‘ We played the flute for you and you didn’t dance . We sang a funeral song and you didn’t mourn . ’
40011018	For John came neither eating nor drinking , and they say , ‘ He has a demon . ’
40011019	Yet the Human One came eating and drinking , and they say , ‘ Look , a glutton and a drunk , a friend of tax collectors and sinners . ’ But wisdom is proved to be right by her works . "
40011020	Then he began to scold the cities where he had done his greatest miracles because they didn’t change their hearts and lives .
40011021	" How terrible it will be for you , Chorazin ! How terrible it will be for you , Bethsaida ! For if the miracles done among you had been done in Tyre and Sidon , they would have changed their hearts and lives and put on funeral clothes and ashes a long time ago .
40011022	But I say to you that Tyre and Sidon will be better off on Judgment Day than you .
40011023	And you , Capernaum , will you be honored by being raised up to heaven ? No , you will be thrown down to the place of the dead . After all , if the miracles that were done among you had been done in Sodom , it would still be here today .
40011024	But I say to you that it will be better for the land of Sodom on the Judgment Day than it will be for you . "
40011025	At that time Jesus said , “ I praise you , Father , Lord of heaven and earth , because you’ve hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have shown them to babies .
40011026	Indeed , Father , this brings you happiness .
40011027	“ My Father has handed all things over to me . No one knows the Son except the Father . And nobody knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son wants to reveal him .
40011028	" Come to me , all you who are struggling hard and carrying heavy loads , and I will give you rest .
40011029	Put on my yoke , and learn from me . I’m gentle and humble . And you will find rest for yourselves .
40011030	My yoke is easy to bear , and my burden is light . "
40012001	At that time Jesus went through the wheat fields on the Sabbath . His disciples were hungry so they were picking heads of wheat and eating them .
40012002	When the Pharisees saw this , they said to him , " Look , your disciples are breaking the Sabbath law . "
40012003	But he said to them , " Haven’t you read what David did when he and those with him were hungry ?
40012004	He went into God’s house and broke the law by eating the bread of the presence , which only the priests were allowed to eat .
40012005	Or haven’t you read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple treat the Sabbath as any other day and are still innocent ?
40012006	But I tell you that something greater than the temple is here .
40012007	If you had known what this means , I want mercy and not sacrifice , you wouldn’t have condemned the innocent .
40012008	The Human One is Lord of the Sabbath . "
40012009	Jesus left that place and went into their synagogue .
40012010	A man with a withered hand was there . Wanting to bring charges against Jesus , they asked , " Does the Law allow a person to heal on the Sabbath ? "
40012011	Jesus replied , " Who among you has a sheep that falls into a pit on the Sabbath and will not take hold of it and pull it out ?
40012012	How much more valuable is a person than a sheep ! So the Law allows a person to do what is good on the Sabbath . "
40012013	Then Jesus said to the man , " Stretch out your hand . " So he did and it was made healthy , just like the other one .
40012014	The Pharisees went out and met in order to find a way to destroy Jesus .
40012015	Jesus knew what they intended to do , so he went away from there . Large crowds followed him , and he healed them all .
40012016	But he ordered them not to spread the word about him ,
40012017	so that what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled :
40012018	Look , my Servant whom I chose , I’ll put my Spirit upon him ,
40012019	He won’t argue or shout ,
40012020	He won’t break a bent stalk ,
40012021	And the Gentiles will put their hope in his name .
40012022	They brought to Jesus a demon-possessed man who was blind and unable to speak . Jesus healed him so that he could both speak and see .
40012023	All the crowds were amazed and said , " This man couldn’t be the Son of David , could he ? "
40012024	When the Pharisees heard , they said , " This man throws out demons only by the authority of Beelzebul , the ruler of the demons . "
40012025	Because Jesus knew what they were thinking , he replied , “ Every kingdom involved in civil war becomes a wasteland . Every city or house torn apart by divisions will collapse .
40012026	If Satan throws out Satan , he is at war with himself . How then can his kingdom endure ?
40012027	And if I throw out demons by the authority of Beelzebul , then by whose authority do your followers throw them out ? Therefore , they will be your judges .
40012028	But if I throw out demons by the power of God’s Spirit , then God’s kingdom has already overtaken you .
40012029	Can people go into a house that belongs to a strong man and steal his possessions , unless they first tie up the strong man ? Then they can rob his house .
40012030	Whoever isn’t with me is against me , and whoever doesn’t gather with me scatters .
40012031	“ Therefore , I tell you that people will be forgiven for every sin and insult to God . But insulting the Holy Spirit won’t be forgiven .
40012032	And whoever speaks a word against the Human One will be forgiven . But whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit won’t be forgiven , not in this age or in the age that is coming .
40012033	" Either consider the tree good and its fruit good , or consider the tree rotten and its fruit rotten . A tree is known by its fruit .
40012034	Children of snakes ! How can you speak good things while you are evil ? What fills the heart comes out of the mouth .
40012035	Good people bring out good things from their good treasure . But evil people bring out evil things from their evil treasure .
40012036	I tell you that people will have to answer on Judgment Day for every useless word they speak .
40012037	By your words you will be either judged innocent or condemned as guilty . "
40012038	At that time some of the legal experts and the Pharisees requested of Jesus , " Teacher , we would like to see a sign from you . "
40012039	But he replied , “ An evil and unfaithful generation searches for a sign , but it won’t receive any sign except Jonah’s sign .
40012040	Just as Jonah was in the whale’s belly for three days and three nights , so the Human One will be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights .
40012041	The citizens of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it as guilty , because they changed their hearts and lives in response to Jonah’s preaching . And look , someone greater than Jonah is here .
40012042	The queen of the South will be raised up by God at the judgment with this generation and condemn it because she came from a distant land to hear Solomon’s wisdom . And look , someone greater than Solomon is here .
40012043	" When an unclean spirit leaves a person , it wanders through dry places looking for a place to rest . But it doesn’t find any .
40012044	Then it says , ‘ I’ll go back to the house I left . ’ When it arrives , it finds the place vacant , cleaned up , and decorated .
40012045	Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself . They go in and make their home there . That person is worse off at the end than at the beginning . This is the way it will be also for this evil generation . "
40012046	While Jesus was speaking to the crowds , his mother and brothers stood outside trying to speak with him .
40012047	Someone said to him , " Look , your mother and brothers are outside wanting to speak with you . "
40012048	Jesus replied , " Who is my mother ? Who are my brothers ? "
40012049	He stretched out his hand toward his disciples and said , " Look , here are my mother and my brothers .
40012050	Whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven is my brother , sister , and mother . "
40013001	That day Jesus went out of the house and sat down beside the lake .
40013002	Such large crowds gathered around him that he climbed into a boat and sat down . The whole crowd was standing on the shore .
40013003	He said many things to them in parables : " A farmer went out to scatter seed .
40013004	As he was scattering seed , some fell on the path , and birds came and ate it .
40013005	Other seed fell on rocky ground where the soil was shallow . They sprouted immediately because the soil wasn’t deep .
40013006	But when the sun came up , it scorched the plants , and they dried up because they had no roots .
40013007	Other seed fell among thorny plants . The thorny plants grew and choked them .
40013008	Other seed fell on good soil and bore fruit , in one case a yield of one hundred to one , in another case a yield of sixty to one , and in another case a yield of thirty to one .
40013009	Everyone who has ears should pay attention . "
40013010	Jesus’ disciples came and said to him , " Why do you use parables when you speak to the crowds ? "
40013011	Jesus replied , “ Because they haven’t received the secrets of the kingdom of heaven , but you have .
40013012	For those who have will receive more and they will have more than enough . But as for those who don’t have , even the little they have will be taken away from them .
40013013	This is why I speak to the crowds in parables : although they see , they don’t really see ; and although they hear , they don’t really hear or understand .
40013014	What Isaiah prophesied has become completely true for them : You will hear , to be sure , but never understand ;
40013015	For this people’s senses have become calloused ,
40013016	“ Happy are your eyes because they see . Happy are your ears because they hear .
40013017	I assure you that many prophets and righteous people wanted to see what you see and hear what you hear , but they didn’t .
40013018	" Consider then the parable of the farmer .
40013019	Whenever people hear the word about the kingdom and don’t understand it , the evil one comes and carries off what was planted in their hearts . This is the seed that was sown on the path .
40013020	As for the seed that was spread on rocky ground , this refers to people who hear the word and immediately receive it joyfully .
40013021	Because they have no roots , they last for only a little while . When they experience distress or abuse because of the word , they immediately fall away .
40013022	As for the seed that was spread among thorny plants , this refers to those who hear the word , but the worries of this life and the false appeal of wealth choke the word , and it bears no fruit .
40013023	As for what was planted on good soil , this refers to those who hear and understand , and bear fruit and produce — in one case a yield of one hundred to one , in another case a yield of sixty to one , and in another case a yield of thirty to one . "
40013024	Jesus told them another parable : “ The kingdom of heaven is like someone who planted good seed in his field .
40013025	While people were sleeping , an enemy came and planted weeds among the wheat and went away .
40013026	When the stalks sprouted and bore grain , then the weeds also appeared .
40013027	“ The servants of the landowner came and said to him , ‘ Master , didn’t you plant good seed in your field ? Then how is it that it has weeds ? ’
40013028	“ ‘ An enemy has done this , ’ he answered . “ The servants said to him , ‘ Do you want us to go and gather them ? ’
40013029	" But the landowner said , ‘ No , because if you gather the weeds , you’ll pull up the wheat along with them .
40013030	Let both grow side by side until the harvest . And at harvesttime I’ll say to the harvesters , " First gather the weeds and tie them together in bundles to be burned . But bring the wheat into my barn . " ’ "
40013031	He told another parable to them : " The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that someone took and planted in his field .
40013032	It’s the smallest of all seeds . But when it’s grown , it’s the largest of all vegetable plants . It becomes a tree so that the birds in the sky come and nest in its branches . "
40013033	He told them another parable : " The kingdom of heaven is like yeast , which a woman took and hid in a bushel of wheat flour until the yeast had worked its way through all the dough . "
40013034	Jesus said all these things to the crowds in parables , and he spoke to them only in parables .
40013035	This was to fulfill what the prophet spoke : I’ll speak in parables ;
40013036	Jesus left the crowds and went into the house . His disciples came to him and said , " Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field . "
40013037	Jesus replied , " The one who plants the good seed is the Human One .
40013038	The field is the world . And the good seeds are the followers of the kingdom . But the weeds are the followers of the evil one .
40013039	The enemy who planted them is the devil . The harvest is the end of the present age . The harvesters are the angels .
40013040	Just as people gather weeds and burn them in the fire , so it will be at the end of the present age .
40013041	The Human One will send his angels , and they will gather out of his kingdom all things that cause people to fall away and all people who sin .
40013042	He will throw them into a burning furnace . People there will be weeping and grinding their teeth .
40013043	Then the righteous will shine like the sun in their Father’s kingdom . Those who have ears should hear . "
40013044	“ The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure that somebody hid in a field , which someone else found and covered up . Full of joy , the finder sold everything and bought that field .
40013045	“ Again , the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls .
40013046	When he found one very precious pearl , he went and sold all that he owned and bought it .
40013047	“ Again , the kingdom of heaven is like a net that people threw into the lake and gathered all kinds of fish .
40013048	When it was full , they pulled it to the shore , where they sat down and put the good fish together into containers . But the bad fish they threw away .
40013049	That’s the way it will be at the end of the present age . The angels will go out and separate the evil people from the righteous people ,
40013050	and will throw the evil ones into a burning furnace . People there will be weeping and grinding their teeth .
40013051	" Have you understood all these things ? " Jesus asked . They said to him , " Yes . "
40013052	Then he said to them , " Therefore , every legal expert who has been trained as a disciple for the kingdom of heaven is like the head of a household who brings old and new things out of their treasure chest . "
40013053	When Jesus finished these parables , he departed .
40013054	When he came to his hometown , he taught the people in their synagogue . They were surprised and said , " Where did he get this wisdom ? Where did he get the power to work miracles ?
40013055	Isn’t he the carpenter’s son ? Isn’t his mother named Mary ? Aren’t James , Joseph , Simon , and Judas his brothers ?
40013056	And his sisters , aren’t they here with us ? Where did this man get all this ? "
40013057	They were repulsed by him and fell into sin . But Jesus said to them , " Prophets are honored everywhere except in their own hometowns and in their own households . "
40013058	He was unable to do many miracles there because of their disbelief .
40014001	At that time Herod the ruler heard the news about Jesus .
40014002	He said to his servants , " This is John the Baptist . He’s been raised from the dead . This is why these miraculous powers are at work through him . "
40014003	Herod had arrested John , bound him , and put him in prison because of Herodias , the wife of Herod’s brother Philip .
40014004	That’s because John told Herod , " It’s against the law for you to marry her . "
40014005	Although Herod wanted to kill him , he feared the crowd because they thought John was a prophet .
40014006	But at Herod’s birthday party Herodias’ daughter danced in front of the guests and thrilled Herod .
40014007	Then he swore to give her anything she asked .
40014008	At her mother’s urging , the girl said , " Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a plate . "
40014009	Although the king was upset , because of his solemn pledge and his guests he commanded that they give it to her .
40014010	Then he had John beheaded in prison .
40014011	They brought his head on a plate and gave it to the young woman , and she brought it to her mother .
40014012	But John’s disciples came and took his body and buried it . Then they went and told Jesus what had happened .
40014013	When Jesus heard about John , he withdrew in a boat to a deserted place by himself . When the crowds learned this , they followed him on foot from the cities .
40014014	When Jesus arrived and saw a large crowd , he had compassion for them and healed those who were sick .
40014015	That evening his disciples came and said to him , " This is an isolated place and it’s getting late . Send the crowds away so they can go into the villages and buy food for themselves . "
40014016	But Jesus said to them , " There’s no need to send them away . You give them something to eat . "
40014017	They replied , " We have nothing here except five loaves of bread and two fish . "
40014018	He said , " Bring them here to me . "
40014019	He ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass . He took the five loaves of bread and the two fish , looked up to heaven , blessed them and broke the loaves apart and gave them to his disciples . Then the disciples gave them to the crowds .
40014020	Everyone ate until they were full , and they filled twelve baskets with the leftovers .
40014021	About five thousand men plus women and children had eaten .
40014022	Right then , Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead to the other side of the lake while he dismissed the crowds .
40014023	When he sent them away , he went up onto a mountain by himself to pray . Evening came and he was alone .
40014024	Meanwhile , the boat , fighting a strong headwind , was being battered by the waves and was already far away from land .
40014025	Very early in the morning he came to his disciples , walking on the lake .
40014026	When the disciples saw him walking on the lake , they were terrified and said , " It’s a ghost ! " They were so frightened they screamed .
40014027	Just then Jesus spoke to them , " Be encouraged ! It’s me . Don’t be afraid . "
40014028	Peter replied , " Lord , if it’s you , order me to come to you on the water . "
40014029	And Jesus said , " Come . " Then Peter got out of the boat and was walking on the water toward Jesus .
40014030	But when Peter saw the strong wind , he became frightened . As he began to sink , he shouted , " Lord , rescue me ! "
40014031	Jesus immediately reached out and grabbed him , saying , " You man of weak faith ! Why did you begin to have doubts ? "
40014032	When they got into the boat , the wind settled down .
40014033	Then those in the boat worshipped Jesus and said , " You must be God’s Son ! "
40014034	When they had crossed the lake , they landed at Gennesaret .
40014035	When the people who lived in that place recognized him , they sent word throughout that whole region , and they brought to him everyone who was sick .
40014036	Then they begged him that they might just touch the edge of his clothes . Everyone who touched him was cured .
40015001	Then Pharisees and legal experts came to Jesus from Jerusalem and said ,
40015002	" Why are your disciples breaking the elders’ rules handed down to us ? They don’t ritually purify their hands by washing before they eat . "
40015003	Jesus replied , " Why do you break the command of God by keeping the rules handed down to you ?
40015004	For God said , Honor your father and your mother , and The person who speaks against father or mother will certainly be put to death .
40015005	But you say , ‘ If you tell your father or mother , " Everything I’m expected to contribute to you I’m giving to God as a gift , " then you don’t have to honor your father . ’
40015006	So you do away with God’s Law for the sake of the rules that have been handed down to you .
40015007	Hypocrites ! Isaiah really knew what he was talking about when he prophesied about you ,
40015008	This people honors me with their lips , but their hearts are far away from me .
40015009	Their worship of me is empty since they teach instructions that are human rules . "
40015010	Jesus called the crowd near and said to them , " Listen and understand .
40015011	It’s not what goes into the mouth that contaminates a person in God’s sight . It’s what comes out of the mouth that contaminates the person . "
40015012	Then the disciples came and said to him , " Do you know that the Pharisees were offended by what you just said ? "
40015013	Jesus replied , " Every plant that my heavenly Father didn’t plant will be pulled up .
40015014	Leave the Pharisees alone . They are blind people who are guides to blind people . But if a blind person leads another blind person , they will both fall into a ditch . "
40015015	Then Peter spoke up , " Explain this riddle to us . "
40015016	Jesus said , " Don’t you understand yet ?
40015017	Don’t you know that everything that goes into the mouth enters the stomach and goes out into the sewer ?
40015018	But what goes out of the mouth comes from the heart . And that’s what contaminates a person in God’s sight .
40015019	Out of the heart come evil thoughts , murders , adultery , sexual sins , thefts , false testimonies , and insults .
40015020	These contaminate a person in God’s sight . But eating without washing hands doesn’t contaminate in God’s sight . "
40015021	From there , Jesus went to the regions of Tyre and Sidon .
40015022	A Canaanite woman from those territories came out and shouted , " Show me mercy , Son of David . My daughter is suffering terribly from demon possession . "
40015023	But he didn’t respond to her at all . His disciples came and urged him , " Send her away ; she keeps shouting out after us . "
40015024	Jesus replied , " I’ve been sent only to the lost sheep , the people of Israel . "
40015025	But she knelt before him and said , " Lord , help me . "
40015026	He replied , " It is not good to take the children’s bread and toss it to dogs . "
40015027	She said , " Yes , Lord . But even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall off their masters’ table . "
40015028	Jesus answered , " Woman , you have great faith . It will be just as you wish . " And right then her daughter was healed .
40015029	Jesus moved on from there along the shore of the Galilee Sea . He went up a mountain and sat down .
40015030	Large crowds came to him , including those who were paralyzed , blind , injured , and unable to speak , and many others . They laid them at his feet , and he healed them .
40015031	So the crowd was amazed when they saw those who had been unable to speak talking , and the paralyzed cured , and the injured walking , and the blind seeing . And they praised the God of Israel .
40015032	Now Jesus called his disciples and said , " I feel sorry for the crowd because they have been with me for three days and have nothing to eat . I don’t want to send them away hungry for fear they won’t have enough strength to travel . "
40015033	His disciples replied , " Where are we going to get enough food in this wilderness to satisfy such a big crowd ? "
40015034	Jesus said , " How much bread do you have ? " They responded , " Seven loaves and a few fish . "
40015035	He told the crowd to sit on the ground .
40015036	He took the seven loaves of bread and the fish . After he gave thanks , he broke them into pieces and gave them to the disciples , and the disciples gave them to the crowds .
40015037	Everyone ate until they were full . The disciples collected seven baskets full of leftovers .
40015038	Four thousand men ate , plus women and children .
40015039	After dismissing the crowds , Jesus got into the boat and came to the region of Magadan .
40016001	The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus . In order to test him they asked him to show them a sign from heaven .
40016002	But he replied , " At evening you say , ‘ It will be nice weather because the sky is bright red . ’
40016003	And in the morning you say , ‘ There will be bad weather today because the sky is cloudy . ’ You know how to make sense of the sky’s appearance . But you are unable to recognize the signs that point to what the time is .
40016004	An evil and unfaithful generation searches for a sign . But it won’t receive any sign except Jonah’s sign . " Then he left them and went away .
40016005	When the disciples arrived on the other side of the lake , they had forgotten to bring bread .
40016006	Jesus said to them , " Watch out and be on your guard for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees . "
40016007	They discussed this among themselves and said , " We didn’t bring any bread . "
40016008	Jesus knew what they were discussing and said , " You people of weak faith ! Why are you discussing among yourselves the fact that you don’t have any bread ?
40016009	Don’t you understand yet ? Don’t you remember the five loaves that fed the five thousand and how many baskets of leftovers you gathered ?
40016010	And the seven loaves that fed the four thousand and how many large baskets of leftovers you gathered ?
40016011	Don’t you know that I wasn’t talking about bread ? But be on your guard for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees . "
40016012	Then they understood that he wasn’t telling them to be on their guard for yeast used in making bread . No , he was telling them to watch out for the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees .
40016013	Now when Jesus came to the area of Caesarea Philippi , he asked his disciples , " Who do people say the Human One is ? "
40016014	They replied , " Some say John the Baptist , others Elijah , and still others Jeremiah or one of the other prophets . "
40016015	He said , " And what about you ? Who do you say that I am ? "
40016016	Simon Peter said , " You are the Christ , the Son of the living God . "
40016017	Then Jesus replied , " Happy are you , Simon son of Jonah , because no human has shown this to you . Rather my Father who is in heaven has shown you .
40016018	I tell you that you are Peter . And I’ll build my church on this rock . The gates of the underworld won’t be able to stand against it .
40016019	I’ll give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven . Anything you fasten on earth will be fastened in heaven . Anything you loosen on earth will be loosened in heaven . "
40016020	Then he ordered the disciples not to tell anybody that he was the Christ .
40016021	From that time Jesus began to show his disciples that he had to go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders , chief priests , and legal experts , and that he had to be killed and raised on the third day .
40016022	Then Peter took hold of Jesus and , scolding him , began to correct him : " God forbid , Lord ! This won’t happen to you . "
40016023	But he turned to Peter and said , " Get behind me , Satan . You are a stone that could make me stumble , for you are not thinking God’s thoughts but human thoughts . "
40016024	Then Jesus said to his disciples , " All who want to come after me must say no to themselves , take up their cross , and follow me .
40016025	All who want to save their lives will lose them . But all who lose their lives because of me will find them .
40016026	Why would people gain the whole world but lose their lives ? What will people give in exchange for their lives ?
40016027	For the Human One is about to come with the majesty of his Father with his angels . And then he will repay each one for what that person has done .
40016028	I assure you that some standing here won’t die before they see the Human One coming in his kingdom . "
40017001	Six days later Jesus took Peter , James , and John his brother , and brought them to the top of a very high mountain .
40017002	He was transformed in front of them . His face shone like the sun , and his clothes became as white as light .
40017003	Moses and Elijah appeared to them , talking with Jesus .
40017004	Peter reacted to all of this by saying to Jesus , " Lord , it’s good that we’re here . If you want , I’ll make three shrines : one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . "
40017005	While he was still speaking , look , a bright cloud overshadowed them . A voice from the cloud said , " This is my Son whom I dearly love . I am very pleased with him . Listen to him ! "
40017006	Hearing this , the disciples fell on their faces , filled with awe .
40017007	But Jesus came and touched them . " Get up , " he said . " Don’t be afraid . "
40017008	When they looked up , they saw no one except Jesus .
40017009	As they were coming down the mountain , Jesus commanded them , " Don’t tell anybody about the vision until the Human One is raised from the dead . "
40017010	The disciples asked , " Then why do the legal experts say that Elijah must first come ? "
40017011	Jesus responded , " Elijah does come first and will restore all things .
40017012	In fact , I tell you that Elijah has already come , and they didn’t know him . But they did to him whatever they wanted . In the same way the Human One is also going to suffer at their hands . "
40017013	Then the disciples realized he was telling them about John the Baptist .
40017014	When they came to the crowd , a man met Jesus . He knelt before him ,
40017015	saying , " Lord , show mercy to my son . He is epileptic and suffers terribly , for he often falls into the fire or the water .
40017016	I brought him to your disciples , but they couldn’t heal him . "
40017017	Jesus answered , " You faithless and crooked generation , how long will I be with you ? How long will I put up with you ? Bring the boy here to me . "
40017018	Then Jesus spoke harshly to the demon . And it came out of the child , who was healed from that time on .
40017019	Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and said , " Why couldn’t we throw the demon out ? "
40017020	" Because you have little faith , " he said . " I assure you that if you have faith the size of a mustard seed , you could say to this mountain , ‘ Go from here to there , ’ and it will go . There will be nothing that you can’t do . "
40017022	When the disciples came together in Galilee , Jesus said to them , " The Human One is about to be delivered over into human hands .
40017023	They will kill him . But he will be raised on the third day . " And they were heartbroken .
40017024	When they came to Capernaum , the people who collected the half-shekel temple tax came to Peter and said , " Doesn’t your teacher pay the temple tax ? "
40017025	" Yes , " he said . But when they came into the house , Jesus spoke to Peter first . " What do you think , Simon ? From whom do earthly kings collect taxes , from their children or from strangers ? "
40017026	" From strangers , " he said . Jesus said to him , " Then the children don’t have to pay .
40017027	But just so we don’t offend them , go to the lake , throw out a fishing line and hook , and take the first fish you catch . When you open its mouth , you will find a shekel coin . Take it and pay the tax for both of us . "
40018001	At that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked , " Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven ? "
40018002	Then he called a little child over to sit among the disciples ,
40018003	and said , “ I assure you that if you don’t turn your lives around and become like this little child , you will definitely not enter the kingdom of heaven .
40018004	Those who humble themselves like this little child will be the greatest in the kingdom of heaven .
40018005	Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me .
40018006	“ As for whoever causes these little ones who believe in me to trip and fall into sin , it would be better for them to have a huge stone hung around their necks and be drowned in the bottom of the lake .
40018007	How terrible it is for the world because of the things that cause people to trip and fall into sin ! Such things have to happen , but how terrible it is for the person who causes those things to happen !
40018008	If your hand or your foot causes you to fall into sin , chop it off and throw it away . It’s better to enter into life crippled or lame than to be thrown into the eternal fire with two hands or two feet .
40018009	If your eye causes you to fall into sin , tear it out and throw it away . It’s better to enter into life with one eye than to be cast into a burning hell with two eyes .
40018010	“ Be careful that you don’t look down on one of these little ones . I say to you that their angels in heaven are always looking into the face of my Father who is in heaven .
40018012	What do you think ? If someone had one hundred sheep and one of them wandered off , wouldn’t he leave the ninety-nine on the hillsides and go in search for the one that wandered off ?
40018013	If he finds it , I assure you that he is happier about having that one sheep than about the ninety-nine who didn’t wander off .
40018014	In the same way , my Father who is in heaven doesn’t want to lose one of these little ones .
40018015	" If your brother or sister sins against you , go and correct them when you are alone together . If they listen to you , then you’ve won over your brother or sister .
40018016	But if they won’t listen , take with you one or two others so that every word may be established by the mouth of two or three witnesses .
40018017	But if they still won’t pay attention , report it to the church . If they won’t pay attention even to the church , treat them as you would a Gentile and tax collector .
40018018	I assure you that whatever you fasten on earth will be fastened in heaven . And whatever you loosen on earth will be loosened in heaven .
40018019	Again I assure you that if two of you agree on earth about anything you ask , then my Father who is in heaven will do it for you .
40018020	For where two or three are gathered in my name , I’m there with them . "
40018021	Then Peter said to Jesus , " Lord , how many times should I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me ? Should I forgive as many as seven times ? "
40018022	Jesus said , “ Not just seven times , but rather as many as seventy-seven times .
40018023	Therefore , the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants .
40018024	When he began to settle accounts , they brought to him a servant who owed him ten thousand bags of gold .
40018025	Because the servant didn’t have enough to pay it back , the master ordered that he should be sold , along with his wife and children and everything he had , and that the proceeds should be used as payment .
40018026	But the servant fell down , kneeled before him , and said , ‘ Please , be patient with me , and I’ll pay you back . ’
40018027	The master had compassion on that servant , released him , and forgave the loan .
40018028	“ When that servant went out , he found one of his fellow servants who owed him one hundred coins . He grabbed him around the throat and said , ‘ Pay me back what you owe me . ’
40018029	“ Then his fellow servant fell down and begged him , ‘ Be patient with me , and I’ll pay you back . ’
40018030	But he refused . Instead , he threw him into prison until he paid back his debt .
40018031	“ When his fellow servants saw what happened , they were deeply offended . They came and told their master all that happened .
40018032	His master called the first servant and said , ‘ You wicked servant ! I forgave you all that debt because you appealed to me .
40018033	Shouldn’t you also have mercy on your fellow servant , just as I had mercy on you ? ’
40018034	His master was furious and handed him over to the guard responsible for punishing prisoners , until he had paid the whole debt .
40018035	" My heavenly Father will also do the same to you if you don’t forgive your brother or sister from your heart . "
40019001	When Jesus finished saying these things , he left Galilee and came to the area of Judea on the east side of the Jordan .
40019002	Large crowds followed him , and he healed them .
40019003	Some Pharisees came to him . In order to test him , they said , " Does the Law allow a man to divorce his wife for just any reason ? "
40019004	Jesus answered , " Haven’t you read that at the beginning the creator made them male and female ?
40019005	And God said , ‘ Because of this a man should leave his father and mother and be joined together with his wife , and the two will be one flesh . ’
40019006	So they are no longer two but one flesh . Therefore , humans must not pull apart what God has put together . "
40019007	The Pharisees said to him , " Then why did Moses command us to give a divorce certificate and divorce her ? "
40019008	Jesus replied , " Moses allowed you to divorce your wives because your hearts are unyielding . But it wasn’t that way from the beginning .
40019009	I say to you that whoever divorces his wife , except for sexual unfaithfulness , and marries another woman commits adultery . "
40019010	His disciples said to him , " If that’s the way things are between a man and his wife , then it’s better not to marry . "
40019011	He replied , " Not everybody can accept this teaching , but only those who have received the ability to accept it .
40019012	For there are eunuchs who have been eunuchs from birth . And there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by other people . And there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs because of the kingdom of heaven . Those who can accept it should accept it . "
40019013	Some people brought children to Jesus so that he would place his hands on them and pray . But the disciples scolded them .
40019014	" Allow the children to come to me , " Jesus said . " Don’t forbid them , because the kingdom of heaven belongs to people like these children . "
40019015	Then he blessed the children and went away from there .
40019016	A man approached him and said , " Teacher , what good thing must I do to have eternal life ? "
40019017	Jesus said , " Why do you ask me about what is good ? There’s only one who is good . If you want to enter eternal life , keep the commandments . "
40019018	The man said , " Which ones ? " Then Jesus said , " Don’t commit murder . Don’t commit adultery . Don’t steal . Don’t give false testimony .
40019019	Honor your father and mother , and love your neighbor as you love yourself . "
40019020	The young man replied , " I’ve kept all these . What am I still missing ? "
40019021	Jesus said , " If you want to be complete , go , sell what you own , and give the money to the poor . Then you will have treasure in heaven . And come follow me . "
40019022	But when the young man heard this , he went away saddened , because he had many possessions .
40019023	Then Jesus said to his disciples , " I assure you that it will be very hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven .
40019024	In fact , it’s easier for a camel to squeeze through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter God’s kingdom . "
40019025	When his disciples heard this , they were stunned . " Then who can be saved ? " they asked .
40019026	Jesus looked at them carefully and said , " It’s impossible for human beings . But all things are possible for God . "
40019027	Then Peter replied , " Look , we’ve left everything and followed you . What will we have ? "
40019028	Jesus said to them , “ I assure you who have followed me that , when everything is made new , when the Human One sits on his magnificent throne , you also will sit on twelve thrones overseeing the twelve tribes of Israel .
40019029	And all who have left houses , brothers , sisters , father , mother , children , or farms because of my name will receive one hundred times more and will inherit eternal life .
40019030	But many who are first will be last . And many who are last will be first .
40020001	“ The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard .
40020002	After he agreed with the workers to pay them a denarion , he sent them into his vineyard .
40020003	“ Then he went out around nine in the morning and saw others standing around the marketplace doing nothing .
40020004	He said to them , ‘ You also go into the vineyard , and I’ll pay you whatever is right . ’
40020005	And they went . “ Again around noon and then at three in the afternoon , he did the same thing .
40020006	Around five in the afternoon he went and found others standing around , and he said to them , ‘ Why are you just standing around here doing nothing all day long ? ’
40020007	“ ‘ Because nobody has hired us , ’ they replied . “ He responded , ‘ You also go into the vineyard . ’
40020008	“ When evening came , the owner of the vineyard said to his manager , ‘ Call the workers and give them their wages , beginning with the last ones hired and moving on finally to the first . ’
40020009	When those who were hired at five in the afternoon came , each one received a denarion .
40020010	Now when those hired first came , they thought they would receive more . But each of them also received a denarion .
40020011	When they received it , they grumbled against the landowner ,
40020012	‘ These who were hired last worked one hour , and they received the same pay as we did even though we had to work the whole day in the hot sun . ’
40020013	" But he replied to one of them , ‘ Friend , I did you no wrong . Didn’t I agree to pay you a denarion ?
40020014	Take what belongs to you and go . I want to give to this one who was hired last the same as I give to you .
40020015	Don’t I have the right to do what I want with what belongs to me ? Or are you resentful because I’m generous ? ’
40020016	So those who are last will be first . And those who are first will be last . "
40020017	As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem , he took the Twelve aside by themselves on the road . He told them ,
40020018	" Look , we are going up to Jerusalem . The Human One will be handed over to the chief priests and legal experts . They will condemn him to death .
40020019	They will hand him over to the Gentiles to be ridiculed , tortured , and crucified . But he will be raised on the third day . "
40020020	Then the mother of Zebedee’s sons came to Jesus along with her sons . Bowing before him , she asked a favor of him .
40020021	" What do you want ? " he asked . She responded , " Say that these two sons of mine will sit , one on your right hand and one on your left , in your kingdom . "
40020022	Jesus replied , " You don’t know what you’re asking ! Can you drink from the cup that I’m about to drink from ? " They said to him , " We can . "
40020023	He said to them , " You will drink from my cup , but to sit at my right or left hand isn’t mine to give . It belongs to those for whom my Father prepared it . "
40020024	Now when the other ten disciples heard about this , they became angry with the two brothers .
40020025	But Jesus called them over and said , " You know that those who rule the Gentiles show off their authority over them and their high-ranking officials order them around .
40020026	But that’s not the way it will be with you . Whoever wants to be great among you will be your servant .
40020027	Whoever wants to be first among you will be your slave —
40020028	just as the Human One didn’t come to be served but rather to serve and to give his life to liberate many people . "
40020029	As Jesus and his disciples were going out of Jericho a large crowd followed him .
40020030	When two blind men sitting along the road heard that Jesus was passing by , they shouted , " Show us mercy , Lord , Son of David ! "
40020031	Now the crowd scolded them and told them to be quiet . But they shouted even louder , " Show us mercy , Lord , Son of David ! "
40020032	Jesus stopped in his tracks and called to them . " What do you want me to do for you ? " he asked .
40020033	" Lord , we want to see , " they replied .
40020034	Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes . Immediately they were able to see , and they followed him .
40021001	When they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives , Jesus gave two disciples a task .
40021002	He said to them , " Go into the village over there . As soon as you enter , you will find a donkey tied up and a colt with it . Untie them and bring them to me .
40021003	If anybody says anything to you , say that the Lord needs it . " He sent them off right away .
40021004	Now this happened to fulfill what the prophet said ,
40021005	Say to Daughter Zion , " Look , your king is coming to you , humble and riding on a donkey , and on a colt the donkey’s offspring . "
40021006	The disciples went and did just as Jesus had ordered them .
40021007	They brought the donkey and the colt and laid their clothes on them . Then he sat on them .
40021008	Now a large crowd spread their clothes on the road . Others cut palm branches off the trees and spread them on the road .
40021009	The crowds in front of him and behind him shouted , " Hosanna to the Son of David ! Blessings on the one who comes in the name of the Lord ! Hosanna in the highest ! "
40021010	And when Jesus entered Jerusalem , the whole city was stirred up . " Who is this ? " they asked .
40021011	The crowds answered , " It’s the prophet Jesus from Nazareth in Galilee . "
40021012	Then Jesus went into the temple and threw out all those who were selling and buying there . He pushed over the tables used for currency exchange and the chairs of those who sold doves .
40021013	He said to them , " It’s written , My house will be called a house of prayer . But you’ve made it a hideout for crooks . "
40021014	People who were blind and lame came to Jesus in the temple , and he healed them .
40021015	But when the chief priests and legal experts saw the amazing things he was doing and the children shouting in the temple , " Hosanna to the Son of David ! " they were angry .
40021016	They said to Jesus , " Do you hear what these children are saying ? " " Yes , " he answered . " Haven’t you ever read , From the mouths of babies and infants you’ve arranged praise for yourself ? "
40021017	Then he left them and went out of the city to Bethany and spent the night there .
40021018	Early in the morning as Jesus was returning to the city , he was hungry .
40021019	He saw a fig tree along the road , but when he came to it , he found nothing except leaves . Then he said to it , " You’ll never again bear fruit ! " The fig tree dried up at once .
40021020	When the disciples saw it , they were amazed . " How did the fig tree dry up so fast ? " they asked .
40021021	Jesus responded , " I assure you that if you have faith and don’t doubt , you will not only do what was done to the fig tree . You will even say to this mountain , ‘ Be lifted up and thrown into the lake . ’ And it will happen .
40021022	If you have faith , you will receive whatever you pray for . "
40021023	When Jesus entered the temple , the chief priests and elders of the people came to him as he was teaching . They asked , " What kind of authority do you have for doing these things ? Who gave you this authority ? "
40021024	Jesus replied , " I have a question for you . If you tell me the answer , I’ll tell you what kind of authority I have to do these things .
40021025	Where did John get his authority to baptize ? Did he get it from heaven or from humans ? " They argued among themselves , " If we say ‘ from heaven , ’ he’ll say to us , ‘ Then why didn’t you believe him ? ’
40021026	But we can’t say ‘ from humans’ because we’re afraid of the crowd , since everyone thinks John was a prophet . "
40021027	Then they replied , " We don’t know . " Jesus also said to them , “ Neither will I tell you what kind of authority I have to do these things .
40021028	“ What do you think ? A man had two sons . Now he came to the first and said , ‘ Son , go and work in the vineyard today . ’
40021029	“ ‘ No , I don’t want to , ’ he replied . But later he changed his mind and went .
40021030	“ The father said the same thing to the other son , who replied , ‘ Yes , sir . ’ But he didn’t go .
40021031	" Which one of these two did his father’s will ? " They said , " The first one . " Jesus said to them , “ I assure you that tax collectors and prostitutes are entering God’s kingdom ahead of you .
40021032	For John came to you on the righteous road , and you didn’t believe him . But tax collectors and prostitutes believed him . Yet even after you saw this , you didn’t change your hearts and lives and you didn’t believe him .
40021033	“ Listen to another parable . There was a landowner who planted a vineyard . He put a fence around it , dug a winepress in it , and built a tower . Then he rented it to tenant farmers and took a trip .
40021034	When it was time for harvest , he sent his servants to the tenant farmers to collect his fruit .
40021035	But the tenant farmers grabbed his servants . They beat some of them , and some of them they killed . Some of them they stoned to death .
40021036	“ Again he sent other servants , more than the first group . They treated them in the same way .
40021037	Finally he sent his son to them . ‘ They will respect my son , ’ he said .
40021038	“ But when the tenant farmers saw the son , they said to each other , ‘ This is the heir . Come on , let’s kill him and we’ll have his inheritance . ’
40021039	They grabbed him , threw him out of the vineyard , and killed him .
40021040	" When the owner of the vineyard comes , what will he do to those tenant farmers ? "
40021041	They said , " He will totally destroy those wicked farmers and rent the vineyard to other tenant farmers who will give him the fruit when it’s ready . "
40021042	Jesus said to them , " Haven’t you ever read in the scriptures , The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone . The Lord has done this , and it’s amazing in our eyes ?
40021043	Therefore , I tell you that God’s kingdom will be taken away from you and will be given to a people who produce its fruit .
40021044	Whoever falls on this stone will be crushed . And the stone will crush the person it falls on . "
40021045	Now when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard the parable , they knew Jesus was talking about them .
40021046	They were trying to arrest him , but they feared the crowds , who thought he was a prophet .
40022001	Jesus responded by speaking again in parables :
40022002	“ The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding party for his son .
40022003	He sent his servants to call those invited to the wedding party . But they didn’t want to come .
40022004	Again he sent other servants and said to them , ‘ Tell those who have been invited , " Look , the meal is all prepared . I’ve butchered the oxen and the fattened cattle . Now everything’s ready . Come to the wedding party ! " ’
40022005	But they paid no attention and went away — some to their fields , others to their businesses .
40022006	The rest of them grabbed his servants , abused them , and killed them .
40022007	“ The king was angry . He sent his soldiers to destroy those murderers and set their city on fire .
40022008	Then he said to his servants , ‘ The wedding party is prepared , but those who were invited weren’t worthy .
40022009	Therefore , go to the roads on the edge of town and invite everyone you find to the wedding party . ’
40022010	“ Then those servants went to the roads and gathered everyone they found , both evil and good . The wedding party was full of guests .
40022011	Now when the king came in and saw the guests , he spotted a man who wasn’t wearing wedding clothes .
40022012	He said to him , ‘ Friend , how did you get in here without wedding clothes ? ’ But he was speechless .
40022013	Then the king said to his servants , ‘ Tie his hands and feet and throw him out into the farthest darkness . People there will be weeping and grinding their teeth . ’
40022014	" Many people are invited , but few people are chosen . "
40022015	Then the Pharisees met together to find a way to trap Jesus in his words .
40022016	They sent their disciples , along with the supporters of Herod , to him . " Teacher , " they said , " we know that you are genuine and that you teach God’s way as it really is . We know that you are not swayed by people’s opinions , because you don’t show favoritism .
40022017	So tell us what you think : Does the Law allow people to pay taxes to Caesar or not ? "
40022018	Knowing their evil motives , Jesus replied , " Why do you test me , you hypocrites ?
40022019	Show me the coin used to pay the tax . " And they brought him a denarion .
40022020	" Whose image and inscription is this ? " he asked .
40022021	" Caesar’s , " they replied . Then he said , " Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar and to God what belongs to God . "
40022022	When they heard this they were astonished , and they departed .
40022023	That same day Sadducees , who deny that there is a resurrection , came to Jesus .
40022024	They asked , " Teacher , Moses said , If a man who doesn’t have children dies , his brother must marry his wife and produce children for his brother .
40022025	Now there were seven brothers among us . The first one married , then died . Because he had no children he left his widow to his brother .
40022026	The same thing happened with the second brother and the third , and in fact with all seven brothers .
40022027	Finally , the woman died .
40022028	At the resurrection , which of the seven brothers will be her husband ? They were all married to her . "
40022029	Jesus responded , " You are wrong because you don’t know either the scriptures or God’s power .
40022030	At the resurrection people won’t marry nor will they be given in marriage . Instead , they will be like angels from God .
40022031	As for the resurrection of the dead , haven’t you read what God told you ,
40022032	I’m the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ? He isn’t the God of the dead but of the living . "
40022033	Now when the crowd heard this , they were astonished at his teaching .
40022034	When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had left the Sadducees speechless , they met together .
40022035	One of them , a legal expert , tested him .
40022036	" Teacher , what is the greatest commandment in the Law ? "
40022037	He replied , " You must love the Lord your God with all your heart , with all your being , and with all your mind .
40022038	This is the first and greatest commandment .
40022039	And the second is like it : You must love your neighbor as you love yourself .
40022040	All the Law and the Prophets depend on these two commands . "
40022041	Now as the Pharisees were gathering , Jesus asked them ,
40022042	" What do you think about the Christ ? Whose son is he ? " " David’s son , " they replied .
40022043	He said , " Then how is it that David , inspired by the Holy Spirit , called him Lord when he said ,
40022044	The Lord said to my lord , ‘ Sit at my right side until I turn your enemies into your footstool ’ ?
40022045	If David calls him Lord , how can he be David’s son ? "
40022046	Nobody was able to answer him . And from that day forward nobody dared to ask him anything .
40023001	Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and his disciples ,
40023002	“ The legal experts and the Pharisees sit on Moses’ seat .
40023003	Therefore , you must take care to do everything they say . But don’t do what they do .
40023004	For they tie together heavy packs that are impossible to carry . They put them on the shoulders of others , but are unwilling to lift a finger to move them .
40023005	Everything they do , they do to be noticed by others . They make extra-wide prayer bands for their arms and long tassels for their clothes .
40023006	They love to sit in places of honor at banquets .
40023007	They love to be greeted with honor in the markets and to be addressed as ‘ Rabbi . ’
40023008	“ But you shouldn’t be called Rabbi , because you have one teacher , and all of you are brothers and sisters .
40023009	Don’t call anybody on earth your father , because you have one Father , who is heavenly .
40023010	Don’t be called teacher , because Christ is your one teacher .
40023011	But the one who is greatest among you will be your servant .
40023012	All who lift themselves up will be brought low . But all who make themselves low will be lifted up .
40023013	“ How terrible it will be for you legal experts and Pharisees ! Hypocrites ! You shut people out of the kingdom of heaven . You don’t enter yourselves , and you won’t allow those who want to enter to do so .
40023015	“ How terrible it will be for you , legal experts and Pharisees ! Hypocrites ! You travel over sea and land to make one convert . But when they’ve been converted , they become twice the child of hell you are .
40023016	“ How terrible it will be for you blind guides who say , ‘ If people swear by the temple , it’s nothing . But if people swear by the gold in the temple , they are obligated to do what they swore . ’
40023017	You foolish and blind people ! Which is greater , the gold or the temple that makes the gold holy ?
40023018	You say , ‘ If people swear by the altar , it’s nothing . But if they swear by the gift on the altar , they are obligated to do what they swore . ’
40023019	You blind people ! Which is greater , the gift or the altar that makes the gift holy ?
40023020	Therefore , those who swear by the altar swear by it and by everything that’s on it .
40023021	Those who swear by the temple swear by it and by everything that’s part of it .
40023022	Those who swear by heaven swear by God’s throne and by the one who sits on it .
40023023	“ How terrible it will be for you legal experts and Pharisees ! Hypocrites ! You give to God a tenth of mint , dill , and cumin , but you forget about the more important matters of the Law : justice , peace , and faith . You ought to give a tenth but without forgetting about those more important matters .
40023024	You blind guides ! You filter out an ant but swallow a camel .
40023025	“ How terrible it will be for you legal experts and Pharisees ! Hypocrites ! You clean the outside of the cup and plate , but inside they are full of violence and pleasure seeking .
40023026	Blind Pharisee ! First clean the inside of the cup so that the outside of the cup will be clean too .
40023027	“ How terrible it will be for you legal experts and Pharisees ! Hypocrites ! You are like whitewashed tombs . They look beautiful on the outside . But inside they are full of dead bones and all kinds of filth .
40023028	In the same way you look righteous to people . But inside you are full of pretense and rebellion .
40023029	“ How terrible it will be for you legal experts and Pharisees ! Hypocrites ! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous .
40023030	You say , ‘ If we had lived in our ancestors’ days , we wouldn’t have joined them in killing the prophets . ’
40023031	You testify against yourselves that you are children of those who murdered the prophets .
40023032	Go ahead , complete what your ancestors did .
40023033	You snakes ! You children of snakes ! How will you be able to escape the judgment of hell ?
40023034	Therefore , look , I’m sending you prophets , wise people , and legal experts . Some of them you will kill and crucify . And some you will beat in your synagogues and chase from city to city .
40023035	Therefore , upon you will come all the righteous blood that has been poured out on the earth , from the blood of that righteous man Abel to the blood of Zechariah the son of Barachiah , whom you killed between the temple and the altar .
40023036	I assure you that all these things will come upon this generation .
40023037	" Jerusalem , Jerusalem ! You who kill the prophets and stone those who were sent to you . How often I wanted to gather your people together , just as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings . But you didn’t want that .
40023038	Look , your house is left to you deserted .
40023039	I tell you , you won’t see me until you say , Blessings on the one who comes in the Lord’s name . "
40024001	Now Jesus left the temple and was going away . His disciples came to point out to him the temple buildings .
40024002	He responded , " Do you see all these things ? I assure that no stone will be left on another . Everything will be demolished . "
40024003	Now while Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives , the disciples came to him privately and said , " Tell us , when will these things happen ? What will be the sign of your coming and the end of the age ? "
40024004	Jesus replied , “ Watch out that no one deceives you .
40024005	Many will come in my name , saying , ‘ I’m the Christ . ’ They will deceive many people .
40024006	You will hear about wars and reports of wars . Don’t be alarmed . These things must happen , but this isn’t the end yet .
40024007	Nations and kingdoms will fight against each other , and there will be famines and earthquakes in all sorts of places .
40024008	But all these things are just the beginning of the sufferings associated with the end .
40024009	They will arrest you , abuse you , and they will kill you . All nations will hate you on account of my name .
40024010	At that time many will fall away . They will betray each other and hate each other .
40024011	Many false prophets will appear and deceive many people .
40024012	Because disobedience will expand , the love of many will grow cold .
40024013	But the one who endures to the end will be delivered .
40024014	This gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the world as a testimony to all the nations . Then the end will come .
40024015	“ When you see the disgusting and destructive thing that Daniel talked about standing in the holy place ( the reader should understand this ) ,
40024016	then those in Judea must escape to the mountains .
40024017	Those on the roof shouldn’t come down to grab things from their houses .
40024018	Those in the field shouldn’t come back to grab their clothes .
40024019	How terrible it will be at that time for women who are pregnant and for women who are nursing their children .
40024020	Pray that it doesn’t happen in winter or on the Sabbath day .
40024021	There will be great suffering such as the world has never before seen and will never again see .
40024022	If that time weren’t shortened , nobody would be rescued . But for the sake of the ones whom God chose , that time will be cut short .
40024023	“ Then if somebody says to you , ‘ Look , here’s the Christ , ’ or ‘ He’s over here , ’ don’t believe it .
40024024	False christs and false prophets will appear , and they will offer great signs and wonders in order to deceive , if possible , even those whom God has chosen .
40024025	Look , I’ve told you ahead of time .
40024026	So if they say to you , ‘ Look , he’s in the desert , ’ don’t go out . And if they say , ‘ Look , he’s in the rooms deep inside the house , ’ don’t believe it .
40024027	Just as the lightning flashes from the east to the west , so it will be with the coming of the Human One .
40024028	The vultures gather wherever there’s a dead body .
40024029	“ Now immediately after the suffering of that time the sun will become dark , and the moon won’t give its light . The stars will fall from the sky and the planets and other heavenly bodies will be shaken .
40024030	Then the sign of the Human One will appear in the sky . At that time all the tribes of the earth will be full of sadness , and they will see the Human One coming in the heavenly clouds with power and great splendor .
40024031	He will send his angels with the sound of a great trumpet , and they will gather his chosen ones from the four corners of the earth , from one end of the sky to the other .
40024032	“ Learn this parable from the fig tree . After its branch becomes tender and it sprouts new leaves , you know that summer is near .
40024033	In the same way , when you see all these things , you know that the Human One is near , at the door .
40024034	I assure you that this generation won’t pass away until all these things happen .
40024035	Heaven and earth will pass away , but my words will certainly not pass away .
40024036	“ But nobody knows when that day or hour will come , not the heavenly angels and not the Son . Only the Father knows .
40024037	As it was in the time of Noah , so it will be at the coming of the Human One .
40024038	In those days before the flood , people were eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , until the day Noah entered the ark .
40024039	They didn’t know what was happening until the flood came and swept them all away . The coming of the Human One will be like that .
40024040	At that time there will be two men in the field . One will be taken and the other left .
40024041	Two women will be grinding at the mill . One will be taken and the other left .
40024042	Therefore , stay alert ! You don’t know what day the Lord is coming .
40024043	But you understand that if the head of the house knew at what time the thief would come , he would keep alert and wouldn’t allow the thief to break into his house .
40024044	Therefore , you also should be prepared , because the Human One will come at a time you don’t know .
40024045	“ Who then are the faithful and wise servants whom their master puts in charge of giving food at the right time to those who live in his house ?
40024046	Happy are those servants whom the master finds fulfilling their responsibilities when he comes .
40024047	I assure you that he will put them in charge of all his possessions .
40024048	But suppose those bad servants should say to themselves , My master won’t come until later .
40024049	And suppose they began to beat their fellow servants and to eat and drink with the drunks ?
40024050	The master of those servants will come on a day when they are not expecting him , at a time they couldn’t predict .
40024051	He will cut them in pieces and put them in a place with the hypocrites . People there will be weeping and grinding their teeth .
40025001	“ At that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten young bridesmaids who took their lamps and went out to meet the groom .
40025002	Now five of them were wise , and the other five were foolish .
40025003	The foolish ones took their lamps but didn’t bring oil for them .
40025004	But the wise ones took their lamps and also brought containers of oil .
40025005	“ When the groom was late in coming , they all became drowsy and went to sleep .
40025006	But at midnight there was a cry , ‘ Look , the groom ! Come out to meet him . ’
40025007	“ Then all those bridesmaids got up and prepared their lamps .
40025008	But the foolish bridesmaids said to the wise ones , ‘ Give us some of your oil , because our lamps have gone out . ’
40025009	“ But the wise bridesmaids replied , ‘ No , because if we share with you , there won’t be enough for our lamps and yours . We have a better idea . You go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves . ’
40025010	But while they were gone to buy oil , the groom came . Those who were ready went with him into the wedding . Then the door was shut .
40025011	“ Later the other bridesmaids came and said , ‘ Lord , lord , open the door for us . ’
40025012	“ But he replied , ‘ I tell you the truth , I don’t know you . ’
40025013	“ Therefore , keep alert , because you don’t know the day or the hour .
40025014	“ The kingdom of heaven is like a man who was leaving on a trip . He called his servants and handed his possessions over to them .
40025015	To one he gave five valuable coins , and to another he gave two , and to another he gave one . He gave to each servant according to that servant’s ability . Then he left on his journey .
40025016	“ After the man left , the servant who had five valuable coins took them and went to work doing business with them . He gained five more .
40025017	In the same way , the one who had two valuable coins gained two more .
40025018	But the servant who had received the one valuable coin dug a hole in the ground and buried his master’s money .
40025019	“ Now after a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them .
40025020	The one who had received five valuable coins came forward with five additional coins . He said , ‘ Master , you gave me five valuable coins . Look , I’ve gained five more . ’
40025021	“ His master replied , ‘ Excellent ! You are a good and faithful servant ! You’ve been faithful over a little . I’ll put you in charge of much . Come , celebrate with me . ’
40025022	“ The second servant also came forward and said , ‘ Master , you gave me two valuable coins . Look , I’ve gained two more . ’
40025023	“ His master replied , ‘ Well done ! You are a good and faithful servant . You’ve been faithful over a little . I’ll put you in charge of much . Come , celebrate with me . ’
40025024	“ Now the one who had received one valuable coin came and said , ‘ Master , I knew that you are a hard man . You harvest grain where you haven’t sown . You gather crops where you haven’t spread seed .
40025025	So I was afraid . And I hid my valuable coin in the ground . Here , you have what’s yours . ’
40025026	“ His master replied , ‘ You evil and lazy servant ! You knew that I harvest grain where I haven’t sown and that I gather crops where I haven’t spread seed ?
40025027	In that case , you should have turned my money over to the bankers so that when I returned , you could give me what belonged to me with interest .
40025028	Therefore , take from him the valuable coin and give it to the one who has ten coins .
40025029	Those who have much will receive more , and they will have more than they need . But as for those who don’t have much , even the little bit they have will be taken away from them .
40025030	Now take the worthless servant and throw him outside into the darkness . ’ “ People there will be weeping and grinding their teeth .
40025031	“ Now when the Human One comes in his majesty and all his angels are with him , he will sit on his majestic throne .
40025032	All the nations will be gathered in front of him . He will separate them from each other , just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats .
40025033	He will put the sheep on his right side . But the goats he will put on his left .
40025034	“ Then the king will say to those on his right , ‘ Come , you who will receive good things from my Father . Inherit the kingdom that was prepared for you before the world began .
40025035	I was hungry and you gave me food to eat . I was thirsty and you gave me a drink . I was a stranger and you welcomed me .
40025036	I was naked and you gave me clothes to wear . I was sick and you took care of me . I was in prison and you visited me . ’
40025037	“ Then those who are righteous will reply to him , ‘ Lord , when did we see you hungry and feed you , or thirsty and give you a drink ?
40025038	When did we see you as a stranger and welcome you , or naked and give you clothes to wear ?
40025039	When did we see you sick or in prison and visit you ? ’
40025040	“ Then the king will reply to them , ‘ I assure you that when you have done it for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine , you have done it for me . ’
40025041	“ Then he will say to those on his left , ‘ Get away from me , you who will receive terrible things . Go into the unending fire that has been prepared for the devil and his angels .
40025042	I was hungry and you didn’t give me food to eat . I was thirsty and you didn’t give me anything to drink .
40025043	I was a stranger and you didn’t welcome me . I was naked and you didn’t give me clothes to wear . I was sick and in prison , and you didn’t visit me . ’
40025044	" Then they will reply , ‘ Lord , when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and didn’t do anything to help you ? ’
40025045	Then he will answer , ‘ I assure you that when you haven’t done it for one of the least of these , you haven’t done it for me . ’
40025046	And they will go away into eternal punishment . But the righteous ones will go into eternal life . "
40026001	When Jesus finished speaking all these words , he said to his disciples ,
40026002	" You know that the Passover is two days from now . And the Human One will be handed over to be crucified . "
40026003	Then the chief priests and elders of the people gathered in the courtyard of Caiaphas the high priest .
40026004	They were plotting to arrest Jesus by cunning tricks and to kill him .
40026005	But they agreed that it shouldn’t happen during the feast so there wouldn’t be an uproar among the people .
40026006	When Jesus was at Bethany visiting the house of Simon , who had a skin disease ,
40026007	a woman came to him with a vase made of alabaster containing very expensive perfume . She poured it on Jesus’ head while he was sitting at dinner .
40026008	Now when the disciples saw it they were angry and said , " Why this waste ?
40026009	This perfume could have been sold for a lot of money and given to the poor . "
40026010	But Jesus knew what they were thinking . He said , " Why do you make trouble for the woman ? She’s done a good thing for me .
40026011	You always have the poor with you , but you won’t always have me .
40026012	By pouring this perfume over my body she’s prepared me to be buried .
40026013	I tell you the truth that wherever in the whole world this good news is announced , what she’s done will also be told in memory of her . "
40026014	Then one of the Twelve , who was called Judas Iscariot , went to the chief priests
40026015	and said , " What will you give me if I turn Jesus over to you ? " They paid him thirty pieces of silver .
40026016	From that time on he was looking for an opportunity to turn him in .
40026017	On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread , the disciples came to Jesus and said , " Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover meal ? "
40026018	He replied , " Go into the city , to a certain man , and say , ‘ The teacher says , " My time is near . I’m going to celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house . " ’ "
40026019	The disciples did just as Jesus instructed them . They prepared the Passover .
40026020	That evening he took his place at the table with the twelve disciples .
40026021	As they were eating he said , " I assure you that one of you will betray me . "
40026022	Deeply saddened , each one said to him , " I’m not the one , am I , Lord ? "
40026023	He replied , " The one who will betray me is the one who dips his hand with me into this bowl .
40026024	The Human One goes to his death just as it is written about him . But how terrible it is for that person who betrays the Human One ! It would have been better for him if he had never been born . "
40026025	Now Judas , who would betray him , replied , " It’s not me , is it , Rabbi ? " Jesus answered , " You said it . "
40026026	While they were eating , Jesus took bread , blessed it , broke it , and gave it to the disciples and said , " Take and eat . This is my body . "
40026027	He took a cup , gave thanks , and gave it to them , saying , " Drink from this , all of you .
40026028	This is my blood of the covenant , which is poured out for many so that their sins may be forgiven .
40026029	I tell you , I won’t drink wine again until that day when I drink it in a new way with you in my Father’s kingdom . "
40026030	Then , after singing songs of praise , they went to the Mount of Olives .
40026031	Then Jesus said to his disciples , " Tonight you will all fall away because of me . This is because it is written , I will hit the shepherd , and the sheep of the flock will go off in all directions .
40026032	But after I’m raised up , I’ll go before you to Galilee . "
40026033	Peter replied , " If everyone else stumbles because of you , I’ll never stumble . "
40026034	Jesus said to him , " I assure you that , before the rooster crows tonight , you will deny me three times . "
40026035	Peter said , " Even if I must die alongside you , I won’t deny you . " All the disciples said the same thing .
40026036	Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane . He said to the disciples , " Stay here while I go and pray over there . "
40026037	When he took Peter and Zebedee’s two sons , he began to feel sad and anxious .
40026038	Then he said to them , " I’m very sad . It’s as if I’m dying . Stay here and keep alert with me . "
40026039	Then he went a short distance farther and fell on his face and prayed , " My Father , if it’s possible , take this cup of suffering away from me . However — not what I want but what you want . "
40026040	He came back to the disciples and found them sleeping . He said to Peter , " Couldn’t you stay alert one hour with me ?
40026041	Stay alert and pray so that you won’t give in to temptation . The spirit is eager , but the flesh is weak . "
40026042	A second time he went away and prayed , " My Father , if it’s not possible that this cup be taken away unless I drink it , then let it be what you want . "
40026043	Again he came and found them sleeping . Their eyes were heavy with sleep .
40026044	But he left them and again went and prayed the same words for the third time .
40026045	Then he came to his disciples and said to them , " Will you sleep and rest all night ? Look , the time has come for the Human One to be betrayed into the hands of sinners .
40026046	Get up . Let’s go . Look , here comes my betrayer . "
40026047	While Jesus was still speaking , Judas , one of the Twelve , came . With him was a large crowd carrying swords and clubs . They had been sent by the chief priests and elders of the people .
40026048	His betrayer had given them a sign : " Arrest the man I kiss . "
40026049	Just then he came to Jesus and said , " Hello , Rabbi . " Then he kissed him .
40026050	But Jesus said to him , " Friend , do what you came to do . " Then they came and grabbed Jesus and arrested him .
40026051	One of those with Jesus reached for his sword . Striking the high priest’s slave , he cut off his ear .
40026052	Then Jesus said to him , " Put the sword back into its place . All those who use the sword will die by the sword .
40026053	Or do you think that I’m not able to ask my Father and he will send to me more than twelve battle groups of angels right away ?
40026054	But if I did that , how would the scriptures be fulfilled that say this must happen ? "
40026055	Then Jesus said to the crowds , " Have you come with swords and clubs to arrest me , like a thief ? Day after day , I sat in the temple teaching , but you didn’t arrest me .
40026056	But all this has happened so that what the prophets said in the scriptures might be fulfilled . " Then all the disciples left Jesus and ran away .
40026057	Those who arrested Jesus led him to Caiaphas the high priest . The legal experts and the elders had gathered there .
40026058	Peter followed him from a distance until he came to the high priest’s courtyard . He entered that area and sat outside with the officers to see how it would turn out .
40026059	The chief priests and the whole council were looking for false testimony against Jesus so that they could put him to death .
40026060	They didn’t find anything they could use from the many false witnesses who were willing to come forward . But finally they found two
40026061	who said , " This man said , ‘ I can destroy God’s temple and rebuild it in three days . ’ "
40026062	Then the high priest stood and said to Jesus , " Aren’t you going to respond to the testimony these people have brought against you ? "
40026063	But Jesus was silent . The high priest said , " By the living God , I demand that you tell us whether you are the Christ , God’s Son . "
40026064	" You said it , " Jesus replied . " But I say to you that from now on you’ll see the Human One sitting on the right side of the Almighty and coming on the heavenly clouds . "
40026065	Then the high priest tore his clothes and said , " He’s insulting God ! Why do we need any more witnesses ? Look , you’ve heard his insult against God .
40026066	What do you think ? " And they answered , " He deserves to die ! "
40026067	Then they spit in his face and beat him . They hit him
40026068	and said , " Prophesy for us , Christ ! Who hit you ? "
40026069	Meanwhile , Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard . A servant woman came and said to him , " You were also with Jesus the Galilean . "
40026070	But he denied it in front of all of them , saying , " I don’t know what you are talking about . "
40026071	When he went over to the gate , another woman saw him and said to those who were there , " This man was with Jesus , the man from Nazareth . "
40026072	With a solemn pledge , he denied it again , saying , " I don’t know the man . "
40026073	A short time later those standing there came and said to Peter , " You must be one of them . The way you talk gives you away . "
40026074	Then he cursed and swore , " I don’t know the man ! " At that very moment the rooster crowed .
40026075	Peter remembered Jesus’ words , " Before the rooster crows you will deny me three times . " And Peter went out and cried uncontrollably .
40027001	Early in the morning all the chief priests and the elders of the people reached the decision to have Jesus put to death .
40027002	They bound him , led him away , and turned him over to Pilate the governor .
40027003	When Judas , who betrayed Jesus , saw that Jesus was condemned to die , he felt deep regret . He returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders , and
40027004	said , " I did wrong because I betrayed an innocent man . " But they said , " What is that to us ? That’s your problem . "
40027005	Judas threw the silver pieces into the temple and left . Then he went and hanged himself .
40027006	The chief priests picked up the silver pieces and said , " According to the Law it’s not right to put this money in the treasury . Since it was used to pay for someone’s life , it’s unclean . "
40027007	So they decided to use it to buy the potter’s field where strangers could be buried .
40027008	That’s why that field is called " Field of Blood " to this very day .
40027009	This fulfilled the words of Jeremiah the prophet : And I took the thirty pieces of silver , the price for the one whose price had been set by some of the Israelites ,
40027010	and I gave them for the potter’s field , as the Lord commanded me .
40027011	Jesus was brought before the governor . The governor said , " Are you the king of the Jews ? " Jesus replied , " That’s what you say . "
40027012	But he didn’t answer when the chief priests and elders accused him .
40027013	Then Pilate said , " Don’t you hear the testimony they bring against you ? "
40027014	But he didn’t answer , not even a single word . So the governor was greatly amazed .
40027015	It was customary during the festival for the governor to release to the crowd one prisoner , whomever they might choose .
40027016	At that time there was a well-known prisoner named Jesus Barabbas .
40027017	When the crowd had come together , Pilate asked them , " Whom would you like me to release to you , Jesus Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ ? "
40027018	He knew that the leaders of the people had handed him over because of jealousy .
40027019	While he was serving as judge , his wife sent this message to him , " Leave that righteous man alone . I’ve suffered much today in a dream because of him . "
40027020	But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and kill Jesus .
40027021	The governor said , " Which of the two do you want me to release to you ? " " Barabbas , " they replied .
40027022	Pilate said , " Then what should I do with Jesus who is called Christ ? " They all said , " Crucify him ! "
40027023	But he said , " Why ? What wrong has he done ? " They shouted even louder , " Crucify him ! "
40027024	Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere and that a riot was starting . So he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd . " I’m innocent of this man’s blood , " he said . " It’s your problem . "
40027025	All the people replied , " Let his blood be on us and on our children . "
40027026	Then he released Barabbas to them . He had Jesus whipped , then handed him over to be crucified .
40027027	The governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the governor’s house , and they gathered the whole company of soldiers around him .
40027028	They stripped him and put a red military coat on him .
40027029	They twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head . They put a stick in his right hand . Then they bowed down in front of him and mocked him , saying , " Hey ! King of the Jews ! "
40027030	After they spit on him , they took the stick and struck his head again and again .
40027031	When they finished mocking him , they stripped him of the military coat and put his own clothes back on him . They led him away to crucify him .
40027032	As they were going out , they found Simon , a man from Cyrene . They forced him to carry his cross .
40027033	When they came to a place called Golgotha , which means Skull Place ,
40027034	they gave Jesus wine mixed with vinegar to drink . But after tasting it , he didn’t want to drink it .
40027035	After they crucified him , they divided up his clothes among them by drawing lots .
40027036	They sat there , guarding him .
40027037	They placed above his head the charge against him . It read , " This is Jesus , the king of the Jews . "
40027038	They crucified with him two outlaws , one on his right side and one on his left .
40027039	Those who were walking by insulted Jesus , shaking their heads
40027040	and saying , " So you were going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days , were you ? Save yourself ! If you are God’s Son , come down from the cross . "
40027041	In the same way , the chief priests , along with the legal experts and the elders , were making fun of him , saying ,
40027042	" He saved others , but he can’t save himself . He’s the king of Israel , so let him come down from the cross now . Then we’ll believe in him .
40027043	He trusts in God , so let God deliver him now if he wants to . He said , ‘ I’m God’s Son . ’ "
40027044	The outlaws who were crucified with him insulted him in the same way .
40027045	From noon until three in the afternoon the whole earth was dark .
40027046	At about three Jesus cried out with a loud shout , " Eli , Eli , lama sabachthani , " which means , " My God , my God , why have you left me ? "
40027047	After hearing him , some standing there said , " He’s calling Elijah . "
40027048	One of them ran over , took a sponge full of vinegar , and put it on a pole . He offered it to Jesus to drink .
40027049	But the rest of them said , " Let’s see if Elijah will come and save him . "
40027050	Again Jesus cried out with a loud shout . Then he died .
40027051	Look , the curtain of the sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom . The earth shook , the rocks split ,
40027052	and the bodies of many holy people who had died were raised .
40027053	After Jesus’ resurrection they came out of their graves and went into the holy city where they appeared to many people .
40027054	When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and what had just happened , they were filled with awe and said , " This was certainly God’s Son . "
40027055	Many women were watching from a distance . They had followed Jesus from Galilee to serve him .
40027056	Among them were Mary Magdalene , Mary the mother of James and Joseph , and the mother of Zebedee’s sons .
40027057	That evening a man named Joseph came . He was a rich man from Arimathea who had become a disciple of Jesus .
40027058	He came to Pilate and asked for Jesus’ body . Pilate gave him permission to take it .
40027059	Joseph took the body , wrapped it in a clean linen cloth ,
40027060	and laid it in his own new tomb , which he had carved out of the rock . After he rolled a large stone at the door of the tomb , he went away .
40027061	Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there , sitting in front of the tomb .
40027062	The next day , which was the day after Preparation Day , the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate .
40027063	They said , " Sir , we remember that while that deceiver was still alive he said , ‘ After three days I will arise . ’
40027064	Therefore , order the grave to be sealed until the third day . Otherwise , his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people , ‘ He’s been raised from the dead . ’ This last deception will be worse than the first . "
40027065	Pilate replied , " You have soldiers for guard duty . Go and make it as secure as you know how . "
40027066	Then they went and secured the tomb by sealing the stone and posting the guard .
40028001	After the Sabbath , at dawn on the first day of the week , Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to look at the tomb .
40028002	Look , there was a great earthquake , for an angel from the Lord came down from heaven . Coming to the stone , he rolled it away and sat on it .
40028003	Now his face was like lightning and his clothes as white as snow .
40028004	The guards were so terrified of him that they shook with fear and became like dead men .
40028005	But the angel said to the women , " Don’t be afraid . I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified .
40028006	He isn’t here , because he’s been raised from the dead , just as he said . Come , see the place where they laid him .
40028007	Now hurry , go and tell his disciples , ‘ He’s been raised from the dead . He’s going on ahead of you to Galilee . You will see him there . ’ I’ve given the message to you . "
40028008	With great fear and excitement , they hurried away from the tomb and ran to tell his disciples .
40028009	But Jesus met them and greeted them . They came and grabbed his feet and worshipped him .
40028010	Then Jesus said to them , " Don’t be afraid . Go and tell my brothers that I am going into Galilee . They will see me there . "
40028011	Now as the women were on their way , some of the guards came into the city and told the chief priests everything that had happened .
40028012	They met with the elders and decided to give a large sum of money to the soldiers .
40028013	They told them , " Say that Jesus’ disciples came at night and stole his body while you were sleeping .
40028014	And if the governor hears about this , we will take care of it with him so you will have nothing to worry about . "
40028015	So the soldiers took the money and did as they were told . And this report has spread throughout all Judea to this very day .
40028016	Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee , to the mountain where Jesus told them to go .
40028017	When they saw him , they worshipped him , but some doubted .
40028018	Jesus came near and spoke to them , " I’ve received all authority in heaven and on earth .
40028019	Therefore , go and make disciples of all nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit ,
40028020	teaching them to obey everything that I’ve commanded you . Look , I myself will be with you every day until the end of this present age . "
41001001	The beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ , God’s Son ,
41001002	happened just as it was written about in the prophecy of Isaiah : Look , I am sending my messenger before you . He will prepare your way ,
41001003	a voice shouting in the wilderness :
41001004	John was in the wilderness calling for people to be baptized to show that they were changing their hearts and lives and wanted God to forgive their sins .
41001005	Everyone in Judea and all the people of Jerusalem went out to the Jordan River and were being baptized by John as they confessed their sins .
41001006	John wore clothes made of camel’s hair , with a leather belt around his waist . He ate locusts and wild honey .
41001007	He announced , " One stronger than I am is coming after me . I’m not even worthy to bend over and loosen the strap of his sandals .
41001008	I baptize you with water , but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit . "
41001009	About that time , Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee , and John baptized him in the Jordan River .
41001010	While he was coming up out of the water , Jesus saw heaven splitting open and the Spirit , like a dove , coming down on him .
41001011	And there was a voice from heaven : " You are my Son , whom I dearly love ; in you I find happiness . "
41001012	At once the Spirit forced Jesus out into the wilderness .
41001013	He was in the wilderness for forty days , tempted by Satan . He was among the wild animals , and the angels took care of him .
41001014	After John was arrested , Jesus came into Galilee announcing God’s good news ,
41001015	saying , " Now is the time ! Here comes God’s kingdom ! Change your hearts and lives , and trust this good news ! "
41001016	As Jesus passed alongside the Galilee Sea , he saw two brothers , Simon and Andrew , throwing fishing nets into the sea , for they were fishermen .
41001017	" Come , follow me , " he said , " and I’ll show you how to fish for people . "
41001018	Right away , they left their nets and followed him .
41001019	After going a little farther , he saw James and John , Zebedee’s sons , in their boat repairing the fishing nets .
41001020	At that very moment he called them . They followed him , leaving their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired workers .
41001021	Jesus and his followers went into Capernaum . Immediately on the Sabbath Jesus entered the synagogue and started teaching .
41001022	The people were amazed by his teaching , for he was teaching them with authority , not like the legal experts .
41001023	Suddenly , there in the synagogue , a person with an evil spirit screamed ,
41001024	" What have you to do with us , Jesus of Nazareth ? Have you come to destroy us ? I know who you are . You are the holy one from God . "
41001025	" Silence ! " Jesus said , speaking harshly to the demon . " Come out of him ! "
41001026	The unclean spirit shook him and screamed , then it came out .
41001027	Everyone was shaken and questioned among themselves , " What’s this ? A new teaching with authority ! He even commands unclean spirits and they obey him ! "
41001028	Right away the news about him spread throughout the entire region of Galilee .
41001029	After leaving the synagogue , Jesus , James , and John went home with Simon and Andrew .
41001030	Simon’s mother-in-law was in bed , sick with a fever , and they told Jesus about her at once .
41001031	He went to her , took her by the hand , and raised her up . The fever left her , and she served them .
41001032	That evening , at sunset , people brought to Jesus those who were sick or demon-possessed .
41001033	The whole town gathered near the door .
41001034	He healed many who were sick with all kinds of diseases , and he threw out many demons . But he didn’t let the demons speak , because they recognized him .
41001035	Early in the morning , well before sunrise , Jesus rose and went to a deserted place where he could be alone in prayer .
41001036	Simon and those with him tracked him down .
41001037	When they found him , they told him , " Everyone’s looking for you ! "
41001038	He replied , " Let’s head in the other direction , to the nearby villages , so that I can preach there too . That’s why I’ve come . "
41001039	He traveled throughout Galilee , preaching in their synagogues and throwing out demons .
41001040	A man with a skin disease approached Jesus , fell to his knees , and begged , " If you want , you can make me clean . "
41001041	Incensed , Jesus reached out his hand , touched him , and said , " I do want to . Be clean . "
41001042	Instantly , the skin disease left him , and he was clean .
41001043	Sternly , Jesus sent him away ,
41001044	saying , " Don’t say anything to anyone . Instead , go and show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifice for your cleansing that Moses commanded . This will be a testimony to them . "
41001045	Instead , he went out and started talking freely and spreading the news so that Jesus wasn’t able to enter a town openly . He remained outside in deserted places , but people came to him from everywhere .
41002001	After a few days , Jesus went back to Capernaum , and people heard that he was at home .
41002002	So many gathered that there was no longer space , not even near the door . Jesus was speaking the word to them .
41002003	Some people arrived , and four of them were bringing to him a man who was paralyzed .
41002004	They couldn’t carry him through the crowd , so they tore off part of the roof above where Jesus was . When they had made an opening , they lowered the mat on which the paralyzed man was lying .
41002005	When Jesus saw their faith , he said to the paralytic , " Child , your sins are forgiven ! "
41002006	Some legal experts were sitting there , muttering among themselves ,
41002007	" Why does he speak this way ? He’s insulting God . Only the one God can forgive sins . "
41002008	Jesus immediately recognized what they were discussing , and he said to them , " Why do you fill your minds with these questions ?
41002009	Which is easier — to say to a paralyzed person , ‘ Your sins are forgiven , ’ or to say , ‘ Get up , take up your bed , and walk ’ ?
41002010	But so you will know that the Human One has authority on the earth to forgive sins " — he said to the man who was paralyzed ,
41002011	" Get up , take your mat , and go home . "
41002012	Jesus raised him up , and right away he picked up his mat and walked out in front of everybody . They were all amazed and praised God , saying , " We’ve never seen anything like this ! "
41002013	Jesus went out beside the lake again . The whole crowd came to him , and he began to teach them .
41002014	As he continued along , he saw Levi , Alphaeus’ son , sitting at a kiosk for collecting taxes . Jesus said to him , " Follow me . " Levi got up and followed him .
41002015	Jesus sat down to eat at Levi’s house . Many tax collectors and sinners were eating with Jesus and his disciples . Indeed , many of them had become his followers .
41002016	When some of the legal experts from among the Pharisees saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors , they asked his disciples , " Why is he eating with sinners and tax collectors ? "
41002017	When Jesus heard it , he said to them , " Healthy people don’t need a doctor , but sick people do . I didn’t come to call righteous people , but sinners . "
41002018	John’s disciples and the Pharisees had a habit of fasting . Some people asked Jesus , " Why do John’s disciples and the Pharisees’ disciples fast , but yours don’t ? "
41002019	Jesus said , “ The wedding guests can’t fast while the groom is with them , can they ? As long as they have the groom with them , they can’t fast .
41002020	But the days will come when the groom will be taken away from them , and then they will fast .
41002021	" No one sews a piece of new , unshrunk cloth on old clothes ; otherwise , the patch tears away from it , the new from the old , and makes a worse tear .
41002022	No one pours new wine into old leather wineskins ; otherwise , the wine would burst the wineskins and the wine would be lost and the wineskins destroyed . But new wine is for new wineskins . "
41002023	Jesus went through the wheat fields on the Sabbath . As the disciples made their way , they were picking the heads of wheat .
41002024	The Pharisees said to Jesus , " Look ! Why are they breaking the Sabbath law ? "
41002025	He said to them , " Haven’t you ever read what David did when he was in need , when he and those with him were hungry ?
41002026	During the time when Abiathar was high priest , David went into God’s house and ate the bread of the presence , which only the priests were allowed to eat . He also gave bread to those who were with him . "
41002027	Then he said , " The Sabbath was created for humans ; humans weren’t created for the Sabbath .
41002028	This is why the Human One is Lord even over the Sabbath . "
41003001	Jesus returned to the synagogue . A man with a withered hand was there .
41003002	Wanting to bring charges against Jesus , they were watching Jesus closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath .
41003003	He said to the man with the withered hand , " Step up where people can see you . "
41003004	Then he said to them , " Is it legal on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil , to save life or to kill ? " But they said nothing .
41003005	Looking around at them with anger , deeply grieved at their unyielding hearts , he said to the man , " Stretch out your hand . " So he did , and his hand was made healthy .
41003006	At that , the Pharisees got together with the supporters of Herod to plan how to destroy Jesus .
41003007	Jesus left with his disciples and went to the lake . A large crowd followed him because they had heard what he was doing . They were from Galilee ,
41003008	Judea , Jerusalem , Idumea , beyond the Jordan , and the area surrounding Tyre and Sidon .
41003009	Jesus told his disciples to get a small boat ready for him so the crowd wouldn’t crush him .
41003010	He had healed so many people that everyone who was sick pushed forward so that they could touch him .
41003011	Whenever the evil spirits saw him , they fell down at his feet and shouted , " You are God’s Son ! "
41003012	But he strictly ordered them not to reveal who he was .
41003013	Jesus went up on a mountain and called those he wanted , and they came to him .
41003014	He appointed twelve and called them apostles . He appointed them to be with him , to be sent out to preach ,
41003015	and to have authority to throw out demons .
41003016	He appointed twelve : Peter , a name he gave Simon ;
41003017	James and John , Zebedee’s sons , whom he nicknamed Boanerges , which means " sons of Thunder " ;
41003018	and Andrew ; Philip ; Bartholomew ; Matthew ; Thomas ; James , Alphaeus’ son ; Thaddaeus ; Simon the Cananaean ;
41003019	and Judas Iscariot , who betrayed Jesus .
41003020	Jesus entered a house . A crowd gathered again so that it was impossible for him and his followers even to eat .
41003021	When his family heard what was happening , they came to take control of him . They were saying , " He’s out of his mind ! "
41003022	The legal experts came down from Jerusalem . Over and over they charged , " He’s possessed by Beelzebul . He throws out demons with the authority of the ruler of demons . "
41003023	When Jesus called them together he spoke to them in a parable : " How can Satan throw Satan out ?
41003024	A kingdom involved in civil war will collapse .
41003025	And a house torn apart by divisions will collapse .
41003026	If Satan rebels against himself and is divided , then he can’t endure . He’s done for .
41003027	No one gets into the house of a strong person and steals anything without first tying up the strong person . Only then can the house be burglarized .
41003028	I assure you that human beings will be forgiven for everything , for all sins and insults of every kind .
41003029	But whoever insults the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven . That person is guilty of a sin with consequences that last forever . "
41003030	He said this because the legal experts were saying , " He’s possessed by an evil spirit . "
41003031	His mother and brothers arrived . They stood outside and sent word to him , calling for him .
41003032	A crowd was seated around him , and those sent to him said , " Look , your mother , brothers , and sisters are outside looking for you . "
41003033	He replied , " Who is my mother ? Who are my brothers ? "
41003034	Looking around at those seated around him in a circle , he said , " Look , here are my mother and my brothers .
41003035	Whoever does God’s will is my brother , sister , and mother . "
41004001	Jesus began to teach beside the lake again . Such a large crowd gathered that he climbed into a boat there on the lake . He sat in the boat while the whole crowd was nearby on the shore .
41004002	He said many things to them in parables . While teaching them , he said ,
41004003	" Listen to this ! A farmer went out to scatter seed .
41004004	As he was scattering seed , some fell on the path ; and the birds came and ate it .
41004005	Other seed fell on rocky ground where the soil was shallow . They sprouted immediately because the soil wasn’t deep .
41004006	When the sun came up , it scorched the plants ; and they dried up because they had no roots .
41004007	Other seed fell among thorny plants . The thorny plants grew and choked the seeds , and they produced nothing .
41004008	Other seed fell into good soil and bore fruit . Upon growing and increasing , the seed produced in one case a yield of thirty to one , in another case a yield of sixty to one , and in another case a yield of one hundred to one . "
41004009	He said , " Whoever has ears to listen should pay attention ! "
41004010	When they were alone , the people around Jesus , along with the Twelve , asked him about the parables .
41004011	He said to them , “ The secret of God’s kingdom has been given to you , but to those who are outside everything comes in parables .
41004012	This is so that they can look and see but have no insight , and they can hear but not understand . Otherwise , they might turn their lives around and be forgiven .
41004013	" Don’t you understand this parable ? Then how will you understand all the parables ?
41004014	The farmer scatters the word .
41004015	This is the meaning of the seed that fell on the path : When the word is scattered and people hear it , right away Satan comes and steals the word that was planted in them .
41004016	Here’s the meaning of the seed that fell on rocky ground : When people hear the word , they immediately receive it joyfully .
41004017	Because they have no roots , they last for only a little while . When they experience distress or abuse because of the word , they immediately fall away .
41004018	Others are like the seed scattered among the thorny plants . These are the ones who have heard the word ;
41004019	but the worries of this life , the false appeal of wealth , and the desire for more things break in and choke the word , and it bears no fruit .
41004020	The seed scattered on good soil are those who hear the word and embrace it . They bear fruit , in one case a yield of thirty to one , in another case sixty to one , and in another case one hundred to one . "
41004021	Jesus said to them , " Does anyone bring in a lamp in order to put it under a basket or a bed ? Shouldn’t it be placed on a lampstand ?
41004022	Everything hidden will be revealed , and everything secret will come out into the open .
41004023	Whoever has ears to listen should pay attention ! "
41004024	He said to them , " Listen carefully ! God will evaluate you with the same standard you use to evaluate others . Indeed , you will receive even more .
41004025	Those who have will receive more , but as for those who don’t have , even what they don’t have will be taken away from them . "
41004026	Then Jesus said , " This is what God’s kingdom is like . It’s as though someone scatters seed on the ground ,
41004027	then sleeps and wakes night and day . The seed sprouts and grows , but the farmer doesn’t know how .
41004028	The earth produces crops all by itself , first the stalk , then the head , then the full head of grain .
41004029	Whenever the crop is ready , the farmer goes out to cut the grain because it’s harvesttime . "
41004030	He continued , " What’s a good image for God’s kingdom ? What parable can I use to explain it ?
41004031	Consider a mustard seed . When scattered on the ground , it’s the smallest of all the seeds on the earth ;
41004032	but when it’s planted , it grows and becomes the largest of all vegetable plants . It produces such large branches that the birds in the sky are able to nest in its shade . "
41004033	With many such parables he continued to give them the word , as much as they were able to hear .
41004034	He spoke to them only in parables , then explained everything to his disciples when he was alone with them .
41004035	Later that day , when evening came , Jesus said to them , " Let’s cross over to the other side of the lake . "
41004036	They left the crowd and took him in the boat just as he was . Other boats followed along .
41004037	Gale-force winds arose , and waves crashed against the boat so that the boat was swamped .
41004038	But Jesus was in the rear of the boat , sleeping on a pillow . They woke him up and said , " Teacher , don’t you care that we’re drowning ? "
41004039	He got up and gave orders to the wind , and he said to the lake , " Silence ! Be still ! " The wind settled down and there was a great calm .
41004040	Jesus asked them , " Why are you frightened ? Don’t you have faith yet ? "
41004041	Overcome with awe , they said to each other , " Who then is this ? Even the wind and the sea obey him ! "
41005001	Jesus and his disciples came to the other side of the lake , to the region of the Gerasenes .
41005002	As soon as Jesus got out of the boat , a man possessed by an evil spirit came out of the tombs .
41005003	This man lived among the tombs , and no one was ever strong enough to restrain him , even with a chain .
41005004	He had been secured many times with leg irons and chains , but he broke the chains and smashed the leg irons . No one was tough enough to control him .
41005005	Night and day in the tombs and the hills , he would howl and cut himself with stones .
41005006	When he saw Jesus from far away , he ran and knelt before him ,
41005007	shouting , " What have you to do with me , Jesus , Son of the Most High God ? Swear to God that you won’t torture me ! "
41005008	He said this because Jesus had already commanded him , " Unclean spirit , come out of the man ! "
41005009	Jesus asked him , " What is your name ? " He responded , " Legion is my name , because we are many . "
41005010	They pleaded with Jesus not to send them out of that region .
41005011	A large herd of pigs was feeding on the hillside .
41005012	" Send us into the pigs ! " they begged . " Let us go into the pigs ! "
41005013	Jesus gave them permission , so the unclean spirits left the man and went into the pigs . Then the herd of about two thousand pigs rushed down the cliff into the lake and drowned .
41005014	Those who tended the pigs ran away and told the story in the city and in the countryside . People came to see what had happened .
41005015	They came to Jesus and saw the man who used to be demon-possessed . They saw the very man who had been filled with many demons sitting there fully dressed and completely sane , and they were filled with awe .
41005016	Those who had actually seen what had happened to the demon-possessed man told the others about the pigs .
41005017	Then they pleaded with Jesus to leave their region .
41005018	While he was climbing into the boat , the one who had been demon-possessed pleaded with Jesus to let him come along as one of his disciples .
41005019	But Jesus wouldn’t allow it . " Go home to your own people , " Jesus said , " and tell them what the Lord has done for you and how he has shown you mercy . "
41005020	The man went away and began to proclaim in the Ten Cities all that Jesus had done for him , and everyone was amazed .
41005021	Jesus crossed the lake again , and on the other side a large crowd gathered around him on the shore .
41005022	Jairus , one of the synagogue leaders , came forward . When he saw Jesus , he fell at his feet
41005023	and pleaded with him , " My daughter is about to die . Please , come and place your hands on her so that she can be healed and live . "
41005024	So Jesus went with him . A swarm of people were following Jesus , crowding in on him .
41005025	A woman was there who had been bleeding for twelve years .
41005026	She had suffered a lot under the care of many doctors , and had spent everything she had without getting any better . In fact , she had gotten worse .
41005027	Because she had heard about Jesus , she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his clothes .
41005028	She was thinking , If I can just touch his clothes , I’ll be healed .
41005029	Her bleeding stopped immediately , and she sensed in her body that her illness had been healed .
41005030	At that very moment , Jesus recognized that power had gone out from him . He turned around in the crowd and said , " Who touched my clothes ? "
41005031	His disciples said to him , " Don’t you see the crowd pressing against you ? Yet you ask , ‘ Who touched me ? ’ "
41005032	But Jesus looked around carefully to see who had done it .
41005033	The woman , full of fear and trembling , came forward . Knowing what had happened to her , she fell down in front of Jesus and told him the whole truth .
41005034	He responded , " Daughter , your faith has healed you ; go in peace , healed from your disease . "
41005035	While Jesus was still speaking with her , messengers came from the synagogue leader’s house , saying to Jairus , " Your daughter has died . Why bother the teacher any longer ? "
41005036	But Jesus overheard their report and said to the synagogue leader , " Don’t be afraid ; just keep trusting . "
41005037	He didn’t allow anyone to follow him except Peter , James , and John , James’ brother .
41005038	They came to the synagogue leader’s house , and he saw a commotion , with people crying and wailing loudly .
41005039	He went in and said to them , " What’s all this commotion and crying about ? The child isn’t dead . She’s only sleeping . "
41005040	They laughed at him , but he threw them all out . Then , taking the child’s parents and his disciples with him , he went to the room where the child was .
41005041	Taking her hand , he said to her , " Talitha koum , " which means , " Young woman , get up . "
41005042	Suddenly the young woman got up and began to walk around . She was 12 years old . They were shocked !
41005043	He gave them strict orders that no one should know what had happened . Then he told them to give her something to eat .
41006001	Jesus left that place and came to his hometown . His disciples followed him .
41006002	On the Sabbath , he began to teach in the synagogue . Many who heard him were surprised . " Where did this man get all this ? What’s this wisdom he’s been given ? What about the powerful acts accomplished through him ?
41006003	Isn’t this the carpenter ? Isn’t he Mary’s son and the brother of James , Joses , Judas , and Simon ? Aren’t his sisters here with us ? " They were repulsed by him and fell into sin .
41006004	Jesus said to them , " Prophets are honored everywhere except in their own hometowns , among their relatives , and in their own households . "
41006005	He was unable to do any miracles there , except that he placed his hands on a few sick people and healed them .
41006006	He was appalled by their disbelief . Then Jesus traveled through the surrounding villages teaching .
41006007	He called for the Twelve and sent them out in pairs . He gave them authority over unclean spirits .
41006008	He instructed them to take nothing for the journey except a walking stick — no bread , no bags , and no money in their belts .
41006009	He told them to wear sandals but not to put on two shirts .
41006010	He said , " Whatever house you enter , remain there until you leave that place .
41006011	If a place doesn’t welcome you or listen to you , as you leave , shake the dust off your feet as a witness against them . "
41006012	So they went out and proclaimed that people should change their hearts and lives .
41006013	They cast out many demons , and they anointed many sick people with olive oil and healed them .
41006014	Herod the king heard about these things , because the name of Jesus had become well-known . Some were saying , " John the Baptist has been raised from the dead , and this is why miraculous powers are at work through him . "
41006015	Others were saying , " He is Elijah . " Still others were saying , " He is a prophet like one of the ancient prophets . "
41006016	But when Herod heard these rumors , he said , " John , whom I beheaded , has been raised to life . "
41006017	He said this because Herod himself had arranged to have John arrested and put in prison because of Herodias , the wife of Herod’s brother Philip . Herod had married her ,
41006018	but John told Herod , " It’s against the law for you to marry your brother’s wife ! "
41006019	So Herodias had it in for John . She wanted to kill him , but she couldn’t .
41006020	This was because Herod respected John . He regarded him as a righteous and holy person , so he protected him . John’s words greatly confused Herod , yet he enjoyed listening to him .
41006021	Finally , the time was right . It was on one of Herod’s birthdays , when he had prepared a feast for his high-ranking officials and military officers and Galilee’s leading residents .
41006022	Herod’s daughter Herodias came in and danced , thrilling Herod and his dinner guests . The king said to the young woman , " Ask me whatever you wish , and I will give it to you . "
41006023	Then he swore to her , " Whatever you ask I will give to you , even as much as half of my kingdom . "
41006024	She left the banquet hall and said to her mother , " What should I ask for ? " " John the Baptist’s head , " Herodias replied .
41006025	Hurrying back to the ruler , she made her request : " I want you to give me John the Baptist’s head on a plate , right this minute . "
41006026	Although the king was upset , because of his solemn pledge and his guests , he didn’t want to refuse her .
41006027	So he ordered a guard to bring John’s head . The guard went to the prison , cut off John’s head ,
41006028	brought his head on a plate , and gave it to the young woman , and she gave it to her mother .
41006029	When John’s disciples heard what had happened , they came and took his dead body and laid it in a tomb .
41006030	The apostles returned to Jesus and told him everything they had done and taught .
41006031	Many people were coming and going , so there was no time to eat . He said to the apostles , " Come by yourselves to a secluded place and rest for a while . "
41006032	They departed in a boat by themselves for a deserted place .
41006033	Many people saw them leaving and recognized them , so they ran ahead from all the cities and arrived before them .
41006034	When Jesus arrived and saw a large crowd , he had compassion on them because they were like sheep without a shepherd . Then he began to teach them many things .
41006035	Late in the day , his disciples came to him and said , " This is an isolated place , and it’s already late in the day .
41006036	Send them away so that they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy something to eat for themselves . "
41006037	He replied , " You give them something to eat . " But they said to him , " Should we go off and buy bread worth almost eight months’ pay and give it to them to eat ? "
41006038	He said to them , " How much bread do you have ? Take a look . " After checking , they said , " Five loaves of bread and two fish . "
41006039	He directed the disciples to seat all the people in groups as though they were having a banquet on the green grass .
41006040	They sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties .
41006041	He took the five loaves and the two fish , looked up to heaven , blessed them , broke the loaves into pieces , and gave them to his disciples to set before the people . He also divided the two fish among them all .
41006042	Everyone ate until they were full .
41006043	They filled twelve baskets with the leftover pieces of bread and fish .
41006044	About five thousand had eaten .
41006045	Right then , Jesus made his disciples get into a boat and go ahead to the other side of the lake , toward Bethsaida , while he dismissed the crowd .
41006046	After saying good-bye to them , Jesus went up onto a mountain to pray .
41006047	Evening came and the boat was in the middle of the lake , but he was alone on the land .
41006048	He saw his disciples struggling . They were trying to row forward , but the wind was blowing against them . Very early in the morning , he came to them , walking on the lake . He intended to pass by them .
41006049	When they saw him walking on the lake , they thought he was a ghost and they screamed .
41006050	Seeing him was terrifying to all of them . Just then he spoke to them , " Be encouraged ! It’s me . Don’t be afraid . "
41006051	He got into the boat , and the wind settled down . His disciples were so baffled they were beside themselves .
41006052	That’s because they hadn’t understood about the loaves . Their hearts had been changed so that they resisted God’s ways .
41006053	When Jesus and his disciples had crossed the lake , they landed at Gennesaret , anchored the boat ,
41006054	and came ashore . People immediately recognized Jesus
41006055	and ran around that whole region bringing sick people on their mats to wherever they heard he was .
41006056	Wherever he went — villages , cities , or farming communities — they would place the sick in the marketplaces and beg him to allow them to touch even the hem of his clothing . Everyone who touched him was healed .
41007001	The Pharisees and some legal experts from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus .
41007002	They saw some of his disciples eating food with unclean hands . ( They were eating without first ritually purifying their hands through washing .
41007003	The Pharisees and all the Jews don’t eat without first washing their hands carefully . This is a way of observing the rules handed down by the elders .
41007004	Upon returning from the marketplace , they don’t eat without first immersing themselves . They observe many other rules that have been handed down , such as the washing of cups , jugs , pans , and sleeping mats . )
41007005	So the Pharisees and legal experts asked Jesus , " Why are your disciples not living according to the rules handed down by the elders but instead eat food with ritually unclean hands ? "
41007006	He replied , " Isaiah really knew what he was talking about when he prophesied about you hypocrites . He wrote , This people honors me with their lips , but their hearts are far away from me .
41007007	Their worship of me is empty since they teach instructions that are human words .
41007008	You ignore God’s commandment while holding on to rules created by humans and handed down to you . "
41007009	Jesus continued , " Clearly , you are experts at rejecting God’s commandment in order to establish these rules .
41007010	Moses said , Honor your father and your mother , and The person who speaks against father or mother will certainly be put to death .
41007011	But you say , ‘ If you tell your father or mother , " Everything I’m expected to contribute to you is corban ( that is , a gift I’m giving to God ) , "
41007012	then you are no longer required to care for your father or mother . ’
41007013	In this way you do away with God’s word in favor of the rules handed down to you , which you pass on to others . And you do a lot of other things just like that . "
41007014	Then Jesus called the crowd again and said , " Listen to me , all of you , and understand .
41007015	Nothing outside of a person can enter and contaminate a person in God’s sight ; rather , the things that come out of a person contaminate the person . "
41007017	After leaving the crowd , he entered a house where his disciples asked him about that riddle .
41007018	He said to them , " Don’t you understand either ? Don’t you know that nothing from the outside that enters a person has the power to contaminate ?
41007019	That’s because it doesn’t enter into the heart but into the stomach , and it goes out into the sewer . " By saying this , Jesus declared that no food could contaminate a person in God’s sight .
41007020	" It’s what comes out of a person that contaminates someone in God’s sight , " he said .
41007021	" It’s from the inside , from the human heart , that evil thoughts come : sexual sins , thefts , murders ,
41007022	adultery , greed , evil actions , deceit , unrestrained immorality , envy , insults , arrogance , and foolishness .
41007023	All these evil things come from the inside and contaminate a person in God’s sight . "
41007024	Jesus left that place and went into the region of Tyre . He didn’t want anyone to know that he had entered a house , but he couldn’t hide .
41007025	In fact , a woman whose young daughter was possessed by an unclean spirit heard about him right away . She came and fell at his feet .
41007026	The woman was Greek , Syrophoenician by birth . She begged Jesus to throw the demon out of her daughter .
41007027	He responded , " The children have to be fed first . It isn’t right to take the children’s bread and toss it to the dogs . "
41007028	But she answered , " Lord , even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs . "
41007029	" Good answer ! " he said . " Go on home . The demon has already left your daughter . "
41007030	When she returned to her house , she found the child lying on the bed and the demon gone .
41007031	After leaving the region of Tyre , Jesus went through Sidon toward the Galilee Sea through the region of the Ten Cities .
41007032	Some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly speak , and they begged him to place his hand on the man for healing .
41007033	Jesus took him away from the crowd by himself and put his fingers in the man’s ears . Then he spit and touched the man’s tongue .
41007034	Looking into heaven , Jesus sighed deeply and said , " Ephphatha , " which means , " Open up . "
41007035	At once , his ears opened , his twisted tongue was released , and he began to speak clearly .
41007036	Jesus gave the people strict orders not to tell anyone . But the more he tried to silence them , the more eagerly they shared the news .
41007037	People were overcome with wonder , saying , " He does everything well ! He even makes the deaf to hear and gives speech to those who can’t speak . "
41008001	In those days there was another large crowd with nothing to eat . Jesus called his disciples and told them ,
41008002	" I feel sorry for the crowd because they have been with me for three days and have nothing to eat .
41008003	If I send them away hungry to their homes , they won’t have enough strength to travel , for some have come a long distance . "
41008004	His disciples responded , " How can anyone get enough food in this wilderness to satisfy these people ? "
41008005	Jesus asked , " How much bread do you have ? " They said , " Seven loaves . "
41008006	He told the crowd to sit on the ground . He took the seven loaves , gave thanks , broke them apart , and gave them to his disciples to distribute ; and they gave the bread to the crowd .
41008007	They also had a few fish . He said a blessing over them , then gave them to the disciples to hand out also .
41008008	They ate until they were full . They collected seven baskets full of leftovers .
41008009	This was a crowd of about four thousand people ! Jesus sent them away ,
41008010	then got into a boat with his disciples and went over to the region of Dalmanutha .
41008011	The Pharisees showed up and began to argue with Jesus . To test him , they asked for a sign from heaven .
41008012	With an impatient sigh , Jesus said , " Why does this generation look for a sign ? I assure you that no sign will be given to it . "
41008013	Leaving them , he got back in the boat and crossed to the other side of the lake .
41008014	Jesus’ disciples had forgotten to bring any bread , so they had only one loaf with them in the boat .
41008015	He gave them strict orders : " Watch out and be on your guard for the yeast of the Pharisees as well as the yeast of Herod . "
41008016	The disciples discussed this among themselves , " He said this because we have no bread . "
41008017	Jesus knew what they were discussing and said , " Why are you talking about the fact that you don’t have any bread ? Don’t you grasp what has happened ? Don’t you understand ? Are your hearts so resistant to what God is doing ?
41008018	Don’t you have eyes ? Why can’t you see ? Don’t you have ears ? Why can’t you hear ? Don’t you remember ?
41008019	When I broke five loaves of bread for those five thousand people , how many baskets full of leftovers did you gather ? " They answered , " Twelve . "
41008020	" And when I broke seven loaves of bread for those four thousand people , how many baskets full of leftovers did you gather ? " They answered , " Seven . "
41008021	Jesus said to them , " And you still don’t understand ? "
41008022	Jesus and his disciples came to Bethsaida . Some people brought a blind man to Jesus and begged him to touch and heal him .
41008023	Taking the blind man’s hand , Jesus led him out of the village . After spitting on his eyes and laying his hands on the man , he asked him , " Do you see anything ? "
41008024	The man looked up and said , " I see people . They look like trees , only they are walking around . "
41008025	Then Jesus placed his hands on the man’s eyes again . He looked with his eyes wide open , his sight was restored , and he could see everything clearly .
41008026	Then Jesus sent him home , saying , " Don’t go into the village ! "
41008027	Jesus and his disciples went into the villages near Caesarea Philippi . On the way he asked his disciples , " Who do people say that I am ? "
41008028	They told him , " Some say John the Baptist , others Elijah , and still others one of the prophets . "
41008029	He asked them , " And what about you ? Who do you say that I am ? " Peter answered , " You are the Christ . "
41008030	Jesus ordered them not to tell anyone about him .
41008031	Then Jesus began to teach his disciples : " The Human One must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders , chief priests , and the legal experts , and be killed , and then , after three days , rise from the dead . "
41008032	He said this plainly . But Peter took hold of Jesus and , scolding him , began to correct him .
41008033	Jesus turned and looked at his disciples , then sternly corrected Peter : " Get behind me , Satan . You are not thinking God’s thoughts but human thoughts . "
41008034	After calling the crowd together with his disciples , Jesus said to them , " All who want to come after me must say no to themselves , take up their cross , and follow me .
41008035	All who want to save their lives will lose them . But all who lose their lives because of me and because of the good news will save them .
41008036	Why would people gain the whole world but lose their lives ?
41008037	What will people give in exchange for their lives ?
41008038	Whoever is ashamed of me and my words in this unfaithful and sinful generation , the Human One will be ashamed of that person when he comes in the Father’s glory with the holy angels . "
41009001	Jesus continued , " I assure you that some standing here won’t die before they see God’s kingdom arrive in power . "
41009002	Six days later Jesus took Peter , James , and John , and brought them to the top of a very high mountain where they were alone . He was transformed in front of them ,
41009003	and his clothes were amazingly bright , brighter than if they had been bleached white .
41009004	Elijah and Moses appeared and were talking with Jesus .
41009005	Peter reacted to all of this by saying to Jesus , " Rabbi , it’s good that we’re here . Let’s make three shrines — one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . "
41009006	He said this because he didn’t know how to respond , for the three of them were terrified .
41009007	Then a cloud overshadowed them , and a voice spoke from the cloud , " This is my Son , whom I dearly love . Listen to him ! "
41009008	Suddenly , looking around , they no longer saw anyone with them except Jesus .
41009009	As they were coming down the mountain , he ordered them not to tell anyone what they had seen until after the Human One had risen from the dead .
41009010	So they kept it to themselves , wondering , " What’s this ‘ rising from the dead ’ ? "
41009011	They asked Jesus , " Why do the legal experts say that Elijah must come first ? "
41009012	He answered , " Elijah does come first to restore all things . Why was it written that the Human One would suffer many things and be rejected ?
41009013	In fact , I tell you that Elijah has come , but they did to him whatever they wanted , just as it was written about him . "
41009014	When Jesus , Peter , James , and John approached the other disciples , they saw a large crowd surrounding them and legal experts arguing with them .
41009015	Suddenly the whole crowd caught sight of Jesus . They ran to greet him , overcome with excitement .
41009016	Jesus asked them , " What are you arguing about ? "
41009017	Someone from the crowd responded , " Teacher , I brought my son to you , since he has a spirit that doesn’t allow him to speak .
41009018	Wherever it overpowers him , it throws him into a fit . He foams at the mouth , grinds his teeth , and stiffens up . So I spoke to your disciples to see if they could throw it out , but they couldn’t . "
41009019	Jesus answered them , " You faithless generation , how long will I be with you ? How long will I put up with you ? Bring him to me . "
41009020	They brought him . When the spirit saw Jesus , it immediately threw the boy into a fit . He fell on the ground and rolled around , foaming at the mouth .
41009021	Jesus asked his father , " How long has this been going on ? " He said , " Since he was a child .
41009022	It has often thrown him into a fire or into water trying to kill him . If you can do anything , help us ! Show us compassion ! "
41009023	Jesus said to him , " ‘ If you can do anything ’ ? All things are possible for the one who has faith . "
41009024	At that the boy’s father cried out , " I have faith ; help my lack of faith ! "
41009025	Noticing that the crowd had surged together , Jesus spoke harshly to the unclean spirit , " Mute and deaf spirit , I command you to come out of him and never enter him again . "
41009026	After screaming and shaking the boy horribly , the spirit came out . The boy seemed to be dead ; in fact , several people said that he had died .
41009027	But Jesus took his hand , lifted him up , and he arose .
41009028	After Jesus went into a house , his disciples asked him privately , " Why couldn’t we throw this spirit out ? "
41009029	Jesus answered , " Throwing this kind of spirit out requires prayer . "
41009030	From there Jesus and his followers went through Galilee , but he didn’t want anyone to know it .
41009031	This was because he was teaching his disciples , " The Human One will be delivered into human hands . They will kill him . Three days after he is killed he will rise up . "
41009032	But they didn’t understand this kind of talk , and they were afraid to ask him .
41009033	They entered Capernaum . When they had come into a house , he asked them , " What were you arguing about during the journey ? "
41009034	They didn’t respond , since on the way they had been debating with each other about who was the greatest .
41009035	He sat down , called the Twelve , and said to them , " Whoever wants to be first must be least of all and the servant of all . "
41009036	Jesus reached for a little child , placed him among the Twelve , and embraced him . Then he said ,
41009037	" Whoever welcomes one of these children in my name welcomes me ; and whoever welcomes me isn’t actually welcoming me but rather the one who sent me . "
41009038	John said to Jesus , “ Teacher , we saw someone throwing demons out in your name , and we tried to stop him because he wasn’t following us . ”
41009039	Jesus replied , “ Don’t stop him . No one who does powerful acts in my name can quickly turn around and curse me .
41009040	Whoever isn’t against us is for us .
41009041	I assure you that whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christ will certainly be rewarded .
41009042	" As for whoever causes these little ones who believe in me to trip and fall into sin , it would be better for them to have a huge stone hung around their necks and to be thrown into the lake .
41009043	If your hand causes you to fall into sin , chop it off . It’s better for you to enter into life crippled than to go away with two hands into the fire of hell , which can’t be put out .
41009045	If your foot causes you to fall into sin , chop it off . It’s better for you to enter life lame than to be thrown into hell with two feet .
41009047	If your eye causes you to fall into sin , tear it out . It’s better for you to enter God’s kingdom with one eye than to be thrown into hell with two .
41009048	That’s a place where worms don’t die and the fire never goes out .
41009049	Everyone will be salted with fire .
41009050	Salt is good ; but if salt loses its saltiness , how will it become salty again ? Maintain salt among yourselves and keep peace with each other . "
41010001	Jesus left that place and went beyond the Jordan and into the region of Judea . Crowds gathered around him again and , as usual , he taught them .
41010002	Some Pharisees came and , trying to test him , they asked , " Does the Law allow a man to divorce his wife ? "
41010003	Jesus answered , " What did Moses command you ? "
41010004	They said , " Moses allowed a man to write a divorce certificate and to divorce his wife . "
41010005	Jesus said to them , " He wrote this commandment for you because of your unyielding hearts .
41010006	At the beginning of creation , God made them male and female .
41010007	Because of this , a man should leave his father and mother and be joined together with his wife ,
41010008	and the two will be one flesh . So they are no longer two but one flesh .
41010009	Therefore , humans must not pull apart what God has put together . "
41010010	Inside the house , the disciples asked him again about this .
41010011	He said to them , " Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her ;
41010012	and if a wife divorces her husband and marries another , she commits adultery . "
41010013	People were bringing children to Jesus so that he would bless them . But the disciples scolded them .
41010014	When Jesus saw this , he grew angry and said to them , " Allow the children to come to me . Don’t forbid them , because God’s kingdom belongs to people like these children .
41010015	I assure you that whoever doesn’t welcome God’s kingdom like a child will never enter it . "
41010016	Then he hugged the children and blessed them .
41010017	As Jesus continued down the road , a man ran up , knelt before him , and asked , " Good Teacher , what must I do to obtain eternal life ? "
41010018	Jesus replied , " Why do you call me good ? No one is good except the one God .
41010019	You know the commandments : Don’t commit murder . Don’t commit adultery . Don’t steal . Don’t give false testimony . Don’t cheat . Honor your father and mother . "
41010020	" Teacher , " he responded , " I’ve kept all of these things since I was a boy . "
41010021	Jesus looked at him carefully and loved him . He said , " You are lacking one thing . Go , sell what you own , and give the money to the poor . Then you will have treasure in heaven . And come , follow me . "
41010022	But the man was dismayed at this statement and went away saddened , because he had many possessions .
41010023	Looking around , Jesus said to his disciples , " It will be very hard for the wealthy to enter God’s kingdom ! "
41010024	His words startled the disciples , so Jesus told them again , " Children , it’s difficult to enter God’s kingdom !
41010025	It’s easier for a camel to squeeze through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter God’s kingdom . "
41010026	They were shocked even more and said to each other , " Then who can be saved ? "
41010027	Jesus looked at them carefully and said , " It’s impossible with human beings , but not with God . All things are possible for God . "
41010028	Peter said to him , " Look , we’ve left everything and followed you . "
41010029	Jesus said , " I assure you that anyone who has left house , brothers , sisters , mother , father , children , or farms because of me and because of the good news
41010030	will receive one hundred times as much now in this life — houses , brothers , sisters , mothers , children , and farms ( with harassment ) — and in the coming age , eternal life .
41010031	But many who are first will be last . And many who are last will be first . "
41010032	Jesus and his disciples were on the road , going up to Jerusalem , with Jesus in the lead . The disciples were amazed while the others following behind were afraid . Taking the Twelve aside again , he told them what was about to happen to him .
41010033	" Look ! " he said . " We’re going up to Jerusalem . The Human One will be handed over to the chief priests and the legal experts . They will condemn him to death and hand him over to the Gentiles .
41010034	They will ridicule him , spit on him , torture him , and kill him . After three days , he will rise up . "
41010035	James and John , Zebedee’s sons , came to Jesus and said , " Teacher , we want you to do for us whatever we ask . "
41010036	" What do you want me to do for you ? " he asked .
41010037	They said , " Allow one of us to sit on your right and the other on your left when you enter your glory . "
41010038	Jesus replied , " You don’t know what you’re asking ! Can you drink the cup I drink or receive the baptism I receive ? "
41010039	" We can , " they answered . Jesus said , " You will drink the cup I drink and receive the baptism I receive ,
41010040	but to sit at my right or left hand isn’t mine to give . It belongs to those for whom it has been prepared . "
41010041	Now when the other ten disciples heard about this , they became angry with James and John .
41010042	Jesus called them over and said , " You know that the ones who are considered the rulers by the Gentiles show off their authority over them and their high-ranking officials order them around .
41010043	But that’s not the way it will be with you . Whoever wants to be great among you will be your servant .
41010044	Whoever wants to be first among you will be the slave of all ,
41010045	for the Human One didn’t come to be served but rather to serve and to give his life to liberate many people . "
41010046	Jesus and his followers came into Jericho . As Jesus was leaving Jericho , together with his disciples and a sizable crowd , a blind beggar named Bartimaeus , Timaeus’ son , was sitting beside the road .
41010047	When he heard that Jesus of Nazareth was there , he began to shout , " Jesus , Son of David , show me mercy ! "
41010048	Many scolded him , telling him to be quiet , but he shouted even louder , " Son of David , show me mercy ! "
41010049	Jesus stopped and said , " Call him forward . " They called the blind man , " Be encouraged ! Get up ! He’s calling you . "
41010050	Throwing his coat to the side , he jumped up and came to Jesus .
41010051	Jesus asked him , " What do you want me to do for you ? " The blind man said , " Teacher , I want to see . "
41010052	Jesus said , " Go , your faith has healed you . " At once he was able to see , and he began to follow Jesus on the way .
41011001	When Jesus and his followers approached Jerusalem , they came to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives . Jesus gave two disciples a task ,
41011002	saying to them , " Go into the village over there . As soon as you enter it , you will find tied up there a colt that no one has ridden . Untie it and bring it here .
41011003	If anyone says to you , ‘ Why are you doing this ? ’ say , ‘ Its master needs it , and he will send it back right away . ’ "
41011004	They went and found a colt tied to a gate outside on the street , and they untied it .
41011005	Some people standing around said to them , " What are you doing , untying the colt ? "
41011006	They told them just what Jesus said , and they left them alone .
41011007	They brought the colt to Jesus and threw their clothes upon it , and he sat on it .
41011008	Many people spread out their clothes on the road while others spread branches cut from the fields .
41011009	Those in front of him and those following were shouting , " Hosanna ! Blessings on the one who comes in the name of the Lord !
41011010	Blessings on the coming kingdom of our ancestor David ! Hosanna in the highest ! "
41011011	Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the temple . After he looked around at everything , because it was already late in the evening , he returned to Bethany with the Twelve .
41011012	The next day , after leaving Bethany , Jesus was hungry .
41011013	From far away , he noticed a fig tree in leaf , so he went to see if he could find anything on it . When he came to it , he found nothing except leaves , since it wasn’t the season for figs .
41011014	So he said to it , " No one will ever again eat your fruit ! " His disciples heard this .
41011015	They came into Jerusalem . After entering the temple , he threw out those who were selling and buying there . He pushed over the tables used for currency exchange and the chairs of those who sold doves .
41011016	He didn’t allow anyone to carry anything through the temple .
41011017	He taught them , " Hasn’t it been written , My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations ? But you’ve turned it into a hideout for crooks . "
41011018	The chief priests and legal experts heard this and tried to find a way to destroy him . They regarded him as dangerous because the whole crowd was enthralled at his teaching .
41011019	When it was evening , Jesus and his disciples went outside the city .
41011020	Early in the morning , as Jesus and his disciples were walking along , they saw the fig tree withered from the root up .
41011021	Peter remembered and said to Jesus , " Rabbi , look how the fig tree you cursed has dried up . "
41011022	Jesus responded to them , " Have faith in God !
41011023	I assure you that whoever says to this mountain , ‘ Be lifted up and thrown into the sea ’ — and doesn’t waver but believes that what is said will really happen — it will happen .
41011024	Therefore I say to you , whatever you pray and ask for , believe that you will receive it , and it will be so for you .
41011025	And whenever you stand up to pray , if you have something against anyone , forgive so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your wrongdoings . "
41011027	Jesus and his disciples entered Jerusalem again . As Jesus was walking around the temple , the chief priests , legal experts , and elders came to him .
41011028	They asked , " What kind of authority do you have for doing these things ? Who gave you this authority to do them ? "
41011029	Jesus said to them , " I have a question for you . Give me an answer , then I’ll tell you what kind of authority I have to do these things .
41011030	Was John’s baptism of heavenly or of human origin ? Answer me . "
41011031	They argued among themselves , " If we say , ‘ It’s of heavenly origin , ’ he’ll say , ‘ Then why didn’t you believe him ? ’
41011032	But we can’t say , ‘ It’s of earthly origin . ’ " They said this because they were afraid of the crowd , because they all thought John was a prophet .
41011033	They answered Jesus , " We don’t know . " Jesus replied , " Neither will I tell you what kind of authority I have to do these things . "
41012001	Jesus spoke to them in parables . “ A man planted a vineyard , put a fence around it , dug a pit for the winepress , and built a tower . Then he rented it to tenant farmers and took a trip .
41012002	When it was time , he sent a servant to collect from the tenants his share of the fruit of the vineyard .
41012003	But they grabbed the servant , beat him , and sent him away empty-handed .
41012004	Again the landowner sent another servant to them , but they struck him on the head and treated him disgracefully .
41012005	He sent another one ; that one they killed . The landlord sent many other servants , but the tenants beat some and killed others .
41012006	Now the landowner had one son whom he loved dearly . He sent him last , thinking , They will respect my son .
41012007	But those tenant farmers said to each other , ‘ This is the heir . Let’s kill him , and the inheritance will be ours . ’
41012008	They grabbed him , killed him , and threw him out of the vineyard .
41012009	" So what will the owner of the vineyard do ? He will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others .
41012010	Haven’t you read this scripture , The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone .
41012011	The Lord has done this , and it’s amazing in our eyes ? "
41012012	They wanted to arrest Jesus because they knew that he had told the parable against them . But they were afraid of the crowd , so they left him and went away .
41012013	They sent some of the Pharisees and supporters of Herod to trap him in his words .
41012014	They came to him and said , " Teacher , we know that you’re genuine and you don’t worry about what people think . You don’t show favoritism but teach God’s way as it really is . Does the Law allow people to pay taxes to Caesar or not ? Should we pay taxes or not ? "
41012015	Since Jesus recognized their deceit , he said to them , " Why are you testing me ? Bring me a coin . Show it to me . "
41012016	And they brought one . He said to them , " Whose image and inscription is this ? " " Caesar’s , " they replied .
41012017	Jesus said to them , " Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar and to God what belongs to God . " His reply left them overcome with wonder .
41012018	Sadducees , who deny that there is a resurrection , came to Jesus and asked ,
41012019	" Teacher , Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies , leaving a widow but no children , the brother must marry the widow and raise up children for his brother .
41012020	Now there were seven brothers . The first one married a woman ; when he died , he left no children .
41012021	The second married her and died without leaving any children . The third did the same .
41012022	None of the seven left any children . Finally , the woman died .
41012023	At the resurrection , when they all rise up , whose wife will she be ? All seven were married to her . "
41012024	Jesus said to them , " Isn’t this the reason you are wrong , because you don’t know either the scriptures or God’s power ?
41012025	When people rise from the dead , they won’t marry nor will they be given in marriage . Instead , they will be like God’s angels .
41012026	As for the resurrection from the dead , haven’t you read in the scroll from Moses , in the passage about the burning bush , how God said to Moses , I am the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ?
41012027	He isn’t the God of the dead but of the living . You are seriously mistaken . "
41012028	One of the legal experts heard their dispute and saw how well Jesus answered them . He came over and asked him , " Which commandment is the most important of all ? "
41012029	Jesus replied , " The most important one is Israel , listen ! Our God is the one Lord ,
41012030	and you must love the Lord your God with all your heart , with all your being , with all your mind , and with all your strength .
41012031	The second is this , You will love your neighbor as yourself . No other commandment is greater than these . "
41012032	The legal expert said to him , " Well said , Teacher . You have truthfully said that God is one and there is no other besides him .
41012033	And to love God with all of the heart , a full understanding , and all of one’s strength , and to love one’s neighbor as oneself is much more important than all kinds of entirely burned offerings and sacrifices . "
41012034	When Jesus saw that he had answered with wisdom , he said to him , " You aren’t far from God’s kingdom . " After that , no one dared to ask him any more questions .
41012035	While Jesus was teaching in the temple , he said , " Why do the legal experts say that the Christ is David’s son ?
41012036	David himself , inspired by the Holy Spirit , said , The Lord said to my lord , ‘ Sit at my right side until I turn your enemies into your footstool . ’
41012037	David himself calls him ‘ Lord , ’ so how can he be David’s son ? " The large crowd listened to him with delight .
41012038	As he was teaching , he said , " Watch out for the legal experts . They like to walk around in long robes . They want to be greeted with honor in the markets .
41012039	They long for places of honor in the synagogues and at banquets .
41012040	They are the ones who cheat widows out of their homes , and to show off they say long prayers . They will be judged most harshly . "
41012041	Jesus sat across from the collection box for the temple treasury and observed how the crowd gave their money . Many rich people were throwing in lots of money .
41012042	One poor widow came forward and put in two small copper coins worth a penny .
41012043	Jesus called his disciples to him and said , " I assure you that this poor widow has put in more than everyone who’s been putting money in the treasury .
41012044	All of them are giving out of their spare change . But she from her hopeless poverty has given everything she had , even what she needed to live on . "
41013001	As Jesus left the temple , one of his disciples said to him , " Teacher , look ! What awesome stones and buildings ! "
41013002	Jesus responded , " Do you see these enormous buildings ? Not even one stone will be left upon another . All will be demolished . "
41013003	Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives across from the temple . Peter , James , John , and Andrew asked him privately ,
41013004	" Tell us , when will these things happen ? What sign will show that all these things are about to come to an end ? "
41013005	Jesus said , “ Watch out that no one deceives you .
41013006	Many people will come in my name , saying , ‘ I’m the one ! ’ They will deceive many people .
41013007	When you hear of wars and reports of wars , don’t be alarmed . These things must happen , but this isn’t the end yet .
41013008	Nations and kingdoms will fight against each other , and there will be earthquakes and famines in all sorts of places . These things are just the beginning of the sufferings associated with the end .
41013009	“ Watch out for yourselves . People will hand you over to the councils . You will be beaten in the synagogues . You will stand before governors and kings because of me so that you can testify before them .
41013010	First , the good news must be proclaimed to all the nations .
41013011	When they haul you in and hand you over , don’t worry ahead of time about what to answer or say . Instead , say whatever is given to you at that moment , for you aren’t doing the speaking but the Holy Spirit is .
41013012	Brothers and sisters will hand each other over to death . A father will turn in his children . Children will rise up against their parents and have them executed .
41013013	Everyone will hate you because of my name . But whoever stands firm until the end will be saved .
41013014	“ When you see the disgusting and destructive thing standing where it shouldn’t be ( the reader should understand this ) , then those in Judea must escape to the mountains .
41013015	Those on the roof shouldn’t come down or enter their houses to grab anything .
41013016	Those in the field shouldn’t come back to grab their clothes .
41013017	How terrible it will be at that time for women who are pregnant and for women who are nursing their children .
41013018	Pray that it doesn’t happen in winter .
41013019	In those days there will be great suffering such as the world has never before seen and will never again see .
41013020	If the Lord hadn’t shortened that time , no one would be rescued . But for the sake of the chosen ones , the ones whom God chose , he has cut short the time .
41013021	“ Then if someone says to you , ‘ Look , here’s the Christ , ’ or ‘ There he is , ’ don’t believe it .
41013022	False christs and false prophets will appear , and they will offer signs and wonders in order to deceive , if possible , those whom God has chosen .
41013023	But you , watch out ! I’ve told you everything ahead of time .
41013024	“ In those days , after the suffering of that time , the sun will become dark , and the moon won’t give its light .
41013025	The stars will fall from the sky , and the planets and other heavenly bodies will be shaken .
41013026	Then they will see the Human One coming in the clouds with great power and splendor .
41013027	Then he will send the angels and gather together his chosen people from the four corners of the earth , from the end of the earth to the end of heaven .
41013028	“ Learn this parable from the fig tree . After its branch becomes tender and it sprouts new leaves , you know that summer is near .
41013029	In the same way , when you see these things happening , you know that he’s near , at the door .
41013030	I assure you that this generation won’t pass away until all these things happen .
41013031	Heaven and earth will pass away , but my words will certainly not pass away .
41013032	" But nobody knows when that day or hour will come , not the angels in heaven and not the Son . Only the Father knows .
41013033	Watch out ! Stay alert ! You don’t know when the time is coming .
41013034	It is as if someone took a trip , left the household behind , and put the servants in charge , giving each one a job to do , and told the doorkeeper to stay alert .
41013035	Therefore , stay alert ! You don’t know when the head of the household will come , whether in the evening or at midnight , or when the rooster crows in the early morning or at daybreak .
41013036	Don’t let him show up when you weren’t expecting and find you sleeping .
41013037	What I say to you , I say to all : Stay alert ! "
41014001	It was two days before Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread . The chief priests and legal experts through cunning tricks were searching for a way to arrest Jesus and kill him .
41014002	But they agreed that it shouldn’t happen during the festival ; otherwise , there would be an uproar among the people .
41014003	Jesus was at Bethany visiting the house of Simon , who had a skin disease . During dinner , a woman came in with a vase made of alabaster and containing very expensive perfume of pure nard . She broke open the vase and poured the perfume on his head .
41014004	Some grew angry . They said to each other , " Why waste the perfume ?
41014005	This perfume could have been sold for almost a year’s pay and the money given to the poor . " And they scolded her .
41014006	Jesus said , " Leave her alone . Why do you make trouble for her ? She has done a good thing for me .
41014007	You always have the poor with you ; and whenever you want , you can do something good for them . But you won’t always have me .
41014008	She has done what she could . She has anointed my body ahead of time for burial .
41014009	I tell you the truth that , wherever in the whole world the good news is announced , what she’s done will also be told in memory of her . "
41014010	Judas Iscariot , one of the Twelve , went to the chief priests to give Jesus up to them .
41014011	When they heard it , they were delighted and promised to give him money . So he started looking for an opportunity to turn him in .
41014012	On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread , when the Passover lamb was sacrificed , the disciples said to Jesus , " Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover meal ? "
41014013	He sent two of his disciples and said to them , " Go into the city . A man carrying a water jar will meet you . Follow him .
41014014	Wherever he enters , say to the owner of the house , ‘ The teacher asks , " Where is my guest room where I can eat the Passover meal with my disciples ? " ’
41014015	He will show you a large room upstairs already furnished . Prepare for us there . "
41014016	The disciples left , came into the city , found everything just as he had told them , and they prepared the Passover meal .
41014017	That evening , Jesus arrived with the Twelve .
41014018	During the meal , Jesus said , " I assure you that one of you will betray me — someone eating with me . "
41014019	Deeply saddened , they asked him , one by one , " It’s not me , is it ? "
41014020	Jesus answered , " It’s one of the Twelve , one who is dipping bread with me into this bowl .
41014021	The Human One goes to his death just as it is written about him . But how terrible it is for that person who betrays the Human One ! It would have been better for him if he had never been born . "
41014022	While they were eating , Jesus took bread , blessed it , broke it , and gave it to them , and said , " Take ; this is my body . "
41014023	He took a cup , gave thanks , and gave it to them , and they all drank from it .
41014024	He said to them , " This is my blood of the covenant , which is poured out for many .
41014025	I assure you that I won’t drink wine again until that day when I drink it in a new way in God’s kingdom . "
41014026	After singing songs of praise , they went out to the Mount of Olives .
41014027	Jesus said to them , " You will all falter in your faithfulness to me . It is written , I will hit the shepherd , and the sheep will go off in all directions .
41014028	But after I’m raised up , I will go before you to Galilee . "
41014029	Peter said to him , " Even if everyone else stumbles , I won’t . "
41014030	But Jesus said to him , " I assure you that on this very night , before the rooster crows twice , you will deny me three times . "
41014031	But Peter insisted , " If I must die alongside you , I won’t deny you . " And they all said the same thing .
41014032	Jesus and his disciples came to a place called Gethsemane . Jesus said to them , " Sit here while I pray . "
41014033	He took Peter , James , and John along with him . He began to feel despair and was anxious .
41014034	He said to them , " I’m very sad . It’s as if I’m dying . Stay here and keep alert . "
41014035	Then he went a short distance farther and fell to the ground . He prayed that , if possible , he might be spared the time of suffering .
41014036	He said , " Abba , Father , for you all things are possible . Take this cup of suffering away from me . However — not what I want but what you want . "
41014037	He came and found them sleeping . He said to Peter , " Simon , are you asleep ? Couldn’t you stay alert for one hour ?
41014038	Stay alert and pray so that you won’t give in to temptation . The spirit is eager , but the flesh is weak . "
41014039	Again , he left them and prayed , repeating the same words .
41014040	And , again , when he came back , he found them sleeping , for they couldn’t keep their eyes open , and they didn’t know how to respond to him .
41014041	He came a third time and said to them , " Will you sleep and rest all night ? That’s enough ! The time has come for the Human One to be betrayed into the hands of sinners .
41014042	Get up ! Let’s go ! Look , here comes my betrayer . "
41014043	Suddenly , while Jesus was still speaking , Judas , one of the Twelve , came with a mob carrying swords and clubs . They had been sent by the chief priests , legal experts , and elders .
41014044	His betrayer had given them a sign : " Arrest the man I kiss , and take him away under guard . "
41014045	As soon as he got there , Judas said to Jesus , " Rabbi ! " Then he kissed him .
41014046	Then they came and grabbed Jesus and arrested him .
41014047	One of the bystanders drew a sword and struck the high priest’s slave and cut off his ear .
41014048	Jesus responded , " Have you come with swords and clubs to arrest me , like an outlaw ?
41014049	Day after day , I was with you , teaching in the temple , but you didn’t arrest me . But let the scriptures be fulfilled . "
41014050	And all his disciples left him and ran away .
41014051	One young man , a disciple , was wearing nothing but a linen cloth . They grabbed him ,
41014052	but he left the linen cloth behind and ran away naked .
41014053	They led Jesus away to the high priest , and all the chief priests , elders , and legal experts gathered .
41014054	Peter followed him from a distance , right into the high priest’s courtyard . He was sitting with the guards , warming himself by the fire .
41014055	The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for testimony against Jesus in order to put him to death , but they couldn’t find any .
41014056	Many brought false testimony against him , but they contradicted each other .
41014057	Some stood to offer false witness against him , saying ,
41014058	" We heard him saying , ‘ I will destroy this temple , constructed by humans , and within three days I will build another , one not made by humans . ’ "
41014059	But their testimonies didn’t agree even on this point .
41014060	Then the high priest stood up in the middle of the gathering and examined Jesus . " Aren’t you going to respond to the testimony these people have brought against you ? "
41014061	But Jesus was silent and didn’t answer . Again , the high priest asked , " Are you the Christ , the Son of the blessed one ? "
41014062	Jesus said , " I am . And you will see the Human One sitting on the right side of the Almighty and coming on the heavenly clouds . "
41014063	Then the high priest tore his clothes and said , " Why do we need any more witnesses ?
41014064	You’ve heard his insult against God . What do you think ? " They all condemned him . " He deserves to die ! "
41014065	Some began to spit on him . Some covered his face and hit him , saying , " Prophesy ! " Then the guards took him and beat him .
41014066	Meanwhile , Peter was below in the courtyard . A woman , one of the high priest’s servants , approached
41014067	and saw Peter warming himself by the fire . She stared at him and said , " You were also with the Nazarene , Jesus . "
41014068	But he denied it , saying , " I don’t know what you’re talking about . I don’t understand what you’re saying . " And he went outside into the outer courtyard . A rooster crowed .
41014069	The female servant saw him and began a second time to say to those standing around , " This man is one of them . "
41014070	But he denied it again . A short time later , those standing around again said to Peter , " You must be one of them , because you are also a Galilean . "
41014071	But he cursed and swore , " I don’t know this man you’re talking about . "
41014072	At that very moment , a rooster crowed a second time . Peter remembered what Jesus told him , " Before a rooster crows twice , you will deny me three times . " And he broke down , sobbing .
41015001	At daybreak , the chief priests — with the elders , legal experts , and the whole Sanhedrin — formed a plan . They bound Jesus , led him away , and turned him over to Pilate .
41015002	Pilate questioned him , " Are you the king of the Jews ? " Jesus replied , " That’s what you say . "
41015003	The chief priests were accusing him of many things .
41015004	Pilate asked him again , " Aren’t you going to answer ? What about all these accusations ? "
41015005	But Jesus gave no more answers , so that Pilate marveled .
41015006	During the festival , Pilate released one prisoner to them , whomever they requested .
41015007	A man named Barabbas was locked up with the rebels who had committed murder during an uprising .
41015008	The crowd pushed forward and asked Pilate to release someone , as he regularly did .
41015009	Pilate answered them , " Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews ? "
41015010	He knew that the chief priests had handed him over because of jealousy .
41015011	But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release Barabbas to them instead .
41015012	Pilate replied , " Then what do you want me to do with the one you call king of the Jews ? "
41015013	They shouted back , " Crucify him ! "
41015014	Pilate said to them , " Why ? What wrong has he done ? " They shouted even louder , " Crucify him ! "
41015015	Pilate wanted to satisfy the crowd , so he released Barabbas to them . He had Jesus whipped , then handed him over to be crucified .
41015016	The soldiers led Jesus away into the courtyard of the palace known as the governor’s headquarters , and they called together the whole company of soldiers .
41015017	They dressed him up in a purple robe and twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on him .
41015018	They saluted him , " Hey ! King of the Jews ! "
41015019	Again and again , they struck his head with a stick . They spit on him and knelt before him to honor him .
41015020	When they finished mocking him , they stripped him of the purple robe and put his own clothes back on him . Then they led him out to crucify him .
41015021	Simon , a man from Cyrene , Alexander and Rufus’ father , was coming in from the countryside . They forced him to carry his cross .
41015022	They brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha , which means Skull Place .
41015023	They tried to give him wine mixed with myrrh , but he didn’t take it .
41015024	They crucified him . They divided up his clothes , drawing lots for them to determine who would take what .
41015025	It was nine in the morning when they crucified him .
41015026	The notice of the formal charge against him was written , " The king of the Jews . "
41015027	They crucified two outlaws with him , one on his right and one on his left .
41015029	People walking by insulted him , shaking their heads and saying , " Ha ! So you were going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days , were you ?
41015030	Save yourself and come down from that cross ! "
41015031	In the same way , the chief priests were making fun of him among themselves , together with the legal experts . " He saved others , " they said , " but he can’t save himself .
41015032	Let the Christ , the king of Israel , come down from the cross . Then we’ll see and believe . " Even those who had been crucified with Jesus insulted him .
41015033	From noon until three in the afternoon the whole earth was dark .
41015034	At three , Jesus cried out with a loud shout , " Eloi , eloi , lama sabachthani , " which means , " My God , my God , why have you left me ? "
41015035	After hearing him , some standing there said , " Look ! He’s calling Elijah ! "
41015036	Someone ran , filled a sponge with sour wine , and put it on a pole . He offered it to Jesus to drink , saying , " Let’s see if Elijah will come to take him down . "
41015037	But Jesus let out a loud cry and died .
41015038	The curtain of the sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom .
41015039	When the centurion , who stood facing Jesus , saw how he died , he said , " This man was certainly God’s Son . "
41015040	Some women were watching from a distance , including Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James ( the younger one ) and Joses , and Salome .
41015041	When Jesus was in Galilee , these women had followed and supported him , along with many other women who had come to Jerusalem with him .
41015042	Since it was late in the afternoon on Preparation Day , just before the Sabbath ,
41015043	Joseph from Arimathea dared to approach Pilate and ask for Jesus’ body . ( Joseph was a prominent council member who also eagerly anticipated the coming of God’s kingdom . )
41015044	Pilate wondered if Jesus was already dead . He called the centurion and asked him whether Jesus had already died .
41015045	When he learned from the centurion that Jesus was dead , Pilate gave the dead body to Joseph .
41015046	He bought a linen cloth , took Jesus down from the cross , wrapped him in the cloth , and laid him in a tomb that had been carved out of rock . He rolled a stone against the entrance to the tomb .
41015047	Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was buried .
41016001	When the Sabbath was over , Mary Magdalene , Mary the mother of James , and Salome bought spices so that they could go and anoint Jesus’ dead body .
41016002	Very early on the first day of the week , just after sunrise , they came to the tomb .
41016003	They were saying to each other , " Who’s going to roll the stone away from the entrance for us ? "
41016004	When they looked up , they saw that the stone had been rolled away . ( And it was a very large stone ! )
41016005	Going into the tomb , they saw a young man in a white robe seated on the right side ; and they were startled .
41016006	But he said to them , " Don’t be alarmed ! You are looking for Jesus of Nazareth , who was crucified . He has been raised . He isn’t here . Look , here’s the place where they laid him .
41016007	Go , tell his disciples , especially Peter , that he is going ahead of you into Galilee . You will see him there , just as he told you . "
41016008	Overcome with terror and dread , they fled from the tomb . They said nothing to anyone , because they were afraid .
41016009	After Jesus rose up early on the first day of the week , he appeared first to Mary Magdalene , from whom he had cast out seven demons .
41016010	She went and reported to the ones who had been with him , who were mourning and weeping .
41016011	But even after they heard the news , they didn’t believe that Jesus was alive and that Mary had seen him .
41016012	After that he appeared in a different form to two of them who were walking along in the countryside .
41016013	When they returned , they reported it to the others , but they didn’t believe them .
41016014	Finally he appeared to the eleven while they were eating . Jesus criticized their unbelief and stubbornness because they didn’t believe those who saw him after he was raised up .
41016015	He said to them , " Go into the whole world and proclaim the good news to every creature .
41016016	Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved , but whoever doesn’t believe will be condemned .
41016017	These signs will be associated with those who believe : they will throw out demons in my name . They will speak in new languages .
41016018	They will pick up snakes with their hands . If they drink anything poisonous , it will not hurt them . They will place their hands on the sick , and they will get well . "
41016019	After the Lord Jesus spoke to them , he was lifted up into heaven and sat down on the right side of God .
41016020	But they went out and proclaimed the message everywhere . The Lord worked with them , confirming the word by the signs associated with them .
42001001	Many people have already applied themselves to the task of compiling an account of the events that have been fulfilled among us .
42001002	They used what the original eyewitnesses and servants of the word handed down to us .
42001003	Now , after having investigated everything carefully from the beginning , I have also decided to write a carefully ordered account for you , most honorable Theophilus .
42001004	I want you to have confidence in the soundness of the instruction you have received .
42001005	During the rule of King Herod of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah . His wife Elizabeth was a descendant of Aaron .
42001006	They were both righteous before God , blameless in their observance of all the Lord’s commandments and regulations .
42001007	They had no children because Elizabeth was unable to become pregnant and they both were very old .
42001008	One day Zechariah was serving as a priest before God because his priestly division was on duty .
42001009	Following the customs of priestly service , he was chosen by lottery to go into the Lord’s sanctuary and burn incense .
42001010	All the people who gathered to worship were praying outside during this hour of incense offering .
42001011	An angel from the Lord appeared to him , standing to the right of the altar of incense .
42001012	When Zechariah saw the angel , he was startled and overcome with fear .
42001013	The angel said , " Don’t be afraid , Zechariah . Your prayers have been heard . Your wife Elizabeth will give birth to your son and you must name him John .
42001014	He will be a joy and delight to you , and many people will rejoice at his birth ,
42001015	for he will be great in the Lord’s eyes . He must not drink wine and liquor . He will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before his birth .
42001016	He will bring many Israelites back to the Lord their God .
42001017	He will go forth before the Lord , equipped with the spirit and power of Elijah . He will turn the hearts of fathers back to their children , and he will turn the disobedient to righteous patterns of thinking . He will make ready a people prepared for the Lord . "
42001018	Zechariah said to the angel , " How can I be sure of this ? My wife and I are very old . "
42001019	The angel replied , " I am Gabriel . I stand in God’s presence . I was sent to speak to you and to bring this good news to you .
42001020	Know this : What I have spoken will come true at the proper time . But because you didn’t believe , you will remain silent , unable to speak until the day when these things happen . "
42001021	Meanwhile , the people were waiting for Zechariah , and they wondered why he was in the sanctuary for such a long time .
42001022	When he came out , he was unable to speak to them . They realized he had seen a vision in the temple , for he gestured to them and couldn’t speak .
42001023	When he completed the days of his priestly service , he returned home .
42001024	Afterward , his wife Elizabeth became pregnant . She kept to herself for five months , saying ,
42001025	" This is the Lord’s doing . He has shown his favor to me by removing my disgrace among other people . "
42001026	When Elizabeth was six months pregnant , God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth , a city in Galilee ,
42001027	to a virgin who was engaged to a man named Joseph , a descendant of David’s house . The virgin’s name was Mary .
42001028	When the angel came to her , he said , " Rejoice , favored one ! The Lord is with you ! "
42001029	She was confused by these words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be .
42001030	The angel said , " Don’t be afraid , Mary . God is honoring you .
42001031	Look ! You will conceive and give birth to a son , and you will name him Jesus .
42001032	He will be great and he will be called the Son of the Most High . The Lord God will give him the throne of David his father .
42001033	He will rule over Jacob’s house forever , and there will be no end to his kingdom . "
42001034	Then Mary said to the angel , " How will this happen since I haven’t had sexual relations with a man ? "
42001035	The angel replied , " The Holy Spirit will come over you and the power of the Most High will overshadow you . Therefore , the one who is to be born will be holy . He will be called God’s Son .
42001036	Look , even in her old age , your relative Elizabeth has conceived a son . This woman who was labeled ‘ unable to conceive ’ is now six months pregnant .
42001037	Nothing is impossible for God . "
42001038	Then Mary said , " I am the Lord’s servant . Let it be with me just as you have said . " Then the angel left her .
42001039	Mary got up and hurried to a city in the Judean highlands .
42001040	She entered Zechariah’s home and greeted Elizabeth .
42001041	When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting , the child leaped in her womb , and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit .
42001042	With a loud voice she blurted out , " God has blessed you above all women , and he has blessed the child you carry .
42001043	Why do I have this honor , that the mother of my Lord should come to me ?
42001044	As soon as I heard your greeting , the baby in my womb jumped for joy .
42001045	Happy is she who believed that the Lord would fulfill the promises he made to her . "
42001046	Mary said , " With all my heart I glorify the Lord !
42001047	In the depths of who I am I rejoice in God my savior .
42001048	He has looked with favor on the low status of his servant . Look ! From now on , everyone will consider me highly favored Holy is his name .
42001050	He shows mercy to everyone ,
42001051	He has shown strength with his arm . He has scattered those with arrogant thoughts and proud inclinations .
42001052	He has pulled the powerful down from their thrones
42001053	He has filled the hungry with good things and sent the rich away empty-handed .
42001054	He has come to the aid of his servant Israel ,
42001055	just as he promised to our ancestors ,
42001056	Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months , and then returned to her home .
42001057	When the time came for Elizabeth to have her child , she gave birth to a boy .
42001058	Her neighbors and relatives celebrated with her because they had heard that the Lord had shown her great mercy .
42001059	On the eighth day , it came time to circumcise the child . They wanted to name him Zechariah because that was his father’s name .
42001060	But his mother replied , " No , his name will be John . "
42001061	They said to her , " None of your relatives have that name . "
42001062	Then they began gesturing to his father to see what he wanted to call him .
42001063	After asking for a tablet , he surprised everyone by writing , " His name is John . "
42001064	At that moment , Zechariah was able to speak again , and he began praising God .
42001065	All their neighbors were filled with awe , and everyone throughout the Judean highlands talked about what had happened .
42001066	All who heard about this considered it carefully . They said , " What then will this child be ? " Indeed , the Lord’s power was with him .
42001067	John’s father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied ,
42001068	" Bless the Lord God of Israel because he has come to help and has delivered his people .
42001069	He has raised up a mighty savior for us in his servant David’s house ,
42001070	just as he said through the mouths of his holy prophets long ago .
42001071	He has brought salvation from our enemies and from the power of all those who hate us .
42001072	He has shown the mercy promised to our ancestors , and remembered his holy covenant , He has granted
42001074	that we would be rescued so that we could serve him without fear ,
42001076	You , child , will be called a prophet of the Most High , for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way .
42001077	You will tell his people how to be saved through the forgiveness of their sins .
42001078	Because of our God’s deep compassion , the dawn from heaven will break upon us ,
42001079	to give light to those who are sitting in darkness and in the shadow of death ,
42001080	The child grew up , becoming strong in character . He was in the wilderness until he began his public ministry to Israel .
42002001	In those days Caesar Augustus declared that everyone throughout the empire should be enrolled in the tax lists .
42002002	This first enrollment occurred when Quirinius governed Syria .
42002003	Everyone went to their own cities to be enrolled .
42002004	Since Joseph belonged to David’s house and family line , he went up from the city of Nazareth in Galilee to David’s city , called Bethlehem , in Judea .
42002005	He went to be enrolled together with Mary , who was promised to him in marriage and who was pregnant .
42002006	While they were there , the time came for Mary to have her baby .
42002007	She gave birth to her firstborn child , a son , wrapped him snugly , and laid him in a manger , because there was no place for them in the guestroom .
42002008	Nearby shepherds were living in the fields , guarding their sheep at night .
42002009	The Lord’s angel stood before them , the Lord’s glory shone around them , and they were terrified .
42002010	The angel said , " Don’t be afraid ! Look ! I bring good news to you — wonderful , joyous news for all people .
42002011	Your savior is born today in David’s city . He is Christ the Lord .
42002012	This is a sign for you : you will find a newborn baby wrapped snugly and lying in a manger . "
42002013	Suddenly a great assembly of the heavenly forces was with the angel praising God . They said ,
42002014	" Glory to God in heaven , and on earth peace among those whom he favors . "
42002015	When the angels returned to heaven , the shepherds said to each other , " Let’s go right now to Bethlehem and see what’s happened . Let’s confirm what the Lord has revealed to us . "
42002016	They went quickly and found Mary and Joseph , and the baby lying in the manger .
42002017	When they saw this , they reported what they had been told about this child .
42002018	Everyone who heard it was amazed at what the shepherds told them .
42002019	Mary committed these things to memory and considered them carefully .
42002020	The shepherds returned home , glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen . Everything happened just as they had been told .
42002021	When eight days had passed , Jesus’ parents circumcised him and gave him the name Jesus . This was the name given to him by the angel before he was conceived .
42002022	When the time came for their ritual cleansing , in accordance with the Law from Moses , they brought Jesus up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord . (
42002023	It’s written in the Law of the Lord , " Every firstborn male will be dedicated to the Lord . " )
42002024	They offered a sacrifice in keeping with what’s stated in the Law of the Lord , A pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons .
42002025	A man named Simeon was in Jerusalem . He was righteous and devout . He eagerly anticipated the restoration of Israel , and the Holy Spirit rested on him .
42002026	The Holy Spirit revealed to him that he wouldn’t die before he had seen the Lord’s Christ .
42002027	Led by the Spirit , he went into the temple area . Meanwhile , Jesus’ parents brought the child to the temple so that they could do what was customary under the Law .
42002028	Simeon took Jesus in his arms and praised God . He said ,
42002029	" Now , master , let your servant go in peace according to your word ,
42002030	because my eyes have seen your salvation .
42002031	You prepared this salvation in the presence of all peoples .
42002032	It’s a light for revelation to the Gentiles and a glory for your people Israel . "
42002033	His father and mother were amazed by what was said about him .
42002034	Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother , " This boy is assigned to be the cause of the falling and rising of many in Israel and to be a sign that generates opposition
42002035	so that the inner thoughts of many will be revealed . And a sword will pierce your innermost being too . "
42002036	There was also a prophet , Anna the daughter of Phanuel , who belonged to the tribe of Asher . She was very old . After she married , she lived with her husband for seven years .
42002037	She was now an 84 - year - old widow . She never left the temple area but worshipped God with fasting and prayer night and day .
42002038	She approached at that very moment and began to praise God and to speak about Jesus to everyone who was looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem .
42002039	When Mary and Joseph had completed everything required by the Law of the Lord , they returned to their hometown , Nazareth in Galilee .
42002040	The child grew up and became strong . He was filled with wisdom , and God’s favor was on him .
42002041	Each year his parents went to Jerusalem for the Passover Festival .
42002042	When he was 12 years old , they went up to Jerusalem according to their custom .
42002043	After the festival was over , they were returning home , but the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem . His parents didn’t know it .
42002044	Supposing that he was among their band of travelers , they journeyed on for a full day while looking for him among their family and friends .
42002045	When they didn’t find Jesus , they returned to Jerusalem to look for him .
42002046	After three days they found him in the temple . He was sitting among the teachers , listening to them and putting questions to them .
42002047	Everyone who heard him was amazed by his understanding and his answers .
42002048	When his parents saw him , they were shocked . His mother said , " Child , why have you treated us like this ? Listen ! Your father and I have been worried . We’ve been looking for you ! "
42002049	Jesus replied , " Why were you looking for me ? Didn’t you know that it was necessary for me to be in my Father’s house ? "
42002050	But they didn’t understand what he said to them .
42002051	Jesus went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them . His mother cherished every word in her heart .
42002052	Jesus matured in wisdom and years , and in favor with God and with people .
42003001	In the fifteenth year of the rule of the emperor Tiberius — when Pontius Pilate was governor over Judea and Herod was ruler over Galilee , his brother Philip was ruler over Ituraea and Trachonitis , and Lysanias was ruler over Abilene ,
42003002	during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas — God’s word came to John son of Zechariah in the wilderness .
42003003	John went throughout the region of the Jordan River , calling for people to be baptized to show that they were changing their hearts and lives and wanted God to forgive their sins .
42003004	This is just as it was written in the scroll of the words of Isaiah the prophet , A voice crying out in the wilderness : " Prepare the way for the Lord ;
42003005	Every valley will be filled , and every mountain and hill will be leveled . The crooked will be made straight and the rough places made smooth .
42003006	All humanity will see God’s salvation . "
42003007	Then John said to the crowds who came to be baptized by him , " You children of snakes ! Who warned you to escape from the angry judgment that is coming soon ?
42003008	Produce fruit that shows you have changed your hearts and lives . And don’t even think about saying to yourselves , Abraham is our father . I tell you that God is able to raise up Abraham’s children from these stones .
42003009	The ax is already at the root of the trees . Therefore , every tree that doesn’t produce good fruit will be chopped down and tossed into the fire . "
42003010	The crowds asked him , " What then should we do ? "
42003011	He answered , " Whoever has two shirts must share with the one who has none , and whoever has food must do the same . "
42003012	Even tax collectors came to be baptized . They said to him , " Teacher , what should we do ? "
42003013	He replied , " Collect no more than you are authorized to collect . "
42003014	Soldiers asked , " What about us ? What should we do ? " He answered , " Don’t cheat or harass anyone , and be satisfied with your pay . "
42003015	The people were filled with expectation , and everyone wondered whether John might be the Christ .
42003016	John replied to them all , " I baptize you with water , but the one who is more powerful than me is coming . I’m not worthy to loosen the strap of his sandals . He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire .
42003017	The shovel he uses to sift the wheat from the husks is in his hands . He will clean out his threshing area and bring the wheat into his barn . But he will burn the husks with a fire that can’t be put out . "
42003018	With many other words John appealed to them , proclaiming good news to the people .
42003019	But Herod the ruler had been criticized harshly by John because of Herodias , Herod’s brother’s wife , and because of all the evil he had done .
42003020	He added this to the list of his evil deeds : he locked John up in prison .
42003021	When everyone was being baptized , Jesus also was baptized . While he was praying , heaven was opened
42003022	and the Holy Spirit came down on him in bodily form like a dove . And there was a voice from heaven : " You are my Son , whom I dearly love ; in you I find happiness . "
42003023	Jesus was about 30 years old when he began his ministry . People supposed that he was the son of Joseph son of Heli
42003024	son of Matthat son of Levi son of Melchi son of Jannai son of Joseph
42003025	son of Mattathias son of Amos son of Nahum son of Esli son of Naggai
42003026	son of Maath son of Mattathias son of Semein son of Josech son of Joda
42003027	son of Joanan son of Rhesa son of Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel son of Neri
42003028	son of Melchi son of Addi son of Cosam son of Elmadam son of Er
42003029	son of Joshua son of Eliezer son of Jorim son of Matthat son of Levi
42003030	son of Simeon son of Judah son of Joseph son of Jonam son of Eliakim
42003031	son of Melea son of Menna son of Mattatha son of Nathan son of David
42003032	son of Jesse son of Obed son of Boaz son of Sala son of Nahshon
42003033	son of Amminadab son of Admin son of Arni son of Hezron son of Perez son of Judah
42003034	son of Jacob son of Isaac son of Abraham son of Terah son of Nahor
42003035	son of Serug son of Reu son of Peleg son of Eber son of Shelah
42003036	son of Cainan son of Arphaxad son of Shem son of Noah son of Lamech
42003037	son of Methuselah son of Enoch son of Jared son of Mahalalel son of Cainan
42003038	son of Enos son of Seth son of Adam son of God .
42004001	Jesus returned from the Jordan River full of the Holy Spirit , and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness .
42004002	There he was tempted for forty days by the devil . He ate nothing during those days and afterward Jesus was starving .
42004003	The devil said to him , " Since you are God’s Son , command this stone to become a loaf of bread . "
42004004	Jesus replied , " It’s written , People won’t live only by bread . "
42004005	Next the devil led him to a high place and showed him in a single instant all the kingdoms of the world .
42004006	The devil said , " I will give you this whole domain and the glory of all these kingdoms . It’s been entrusted to me and I can give it to anyone I want .
42004007	Therefore , if you will worship me , it will all be yours . "
42004008	Jesus answered , " It’s written , You will worship the Lord your God and serve only him . "
42004009	The devil brought him into Jerusalem and stood him at the highest point of the temple . He said to him , " Since you are God’s Son , throw yourself down from here ;
42004010	for it’s written : He will command his angels concerning you , to protect you
42004011	and they will take you up in their hands so that you won’t hit your foot on a stone . "
42004012	Jesus answered , " It’s been said , Don’t test the Lord your God . "
42004013	After finishing every temptation , the devil departed from him until the next opportunity .
42004014	Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee , and news about him spread throughout the whole countryside .
42004015	He taught in their synagogues and was praised by everyone .
42004016	Jesus went to Nazareth , where he had been raised . On the Sabbath he went to the synagogue as he normally did and stood up to read .
42004017	The synagogue assistant gave him the scroll from the prophet Isaiah . He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written :
42004018	The Spirit of the Lord is upon me , because the Lord has anointed me . He has sent me to preach good news to the poor , to proclaim release to the prisoners and recovery of sight to the blind , to liberate the oppressed ,
42004019	and to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor .
42004020	He rolled up the scroll , gave it back to the synagogue assistant , and sat down . Every eye in the synagogue was fixed on him .
42004021	He began to explain to them , " Today , this scripture has been fulfilled just as you heard it . "
42004022	Everyone was raving about Jesus , so impressed were they by the gracious words flowing from his lips . They said , " This is Joseph’s son , isn’t it ? "
42004023	Then Jesus said to them , " Undoubtedly , you will quote this saying to me : ‘ Doctor , heal yourself . Do here in your hometown what we’ve heard you did in Capernaum . ’ "
42004024	He said , " I assure you that no prophet is welcome in the prophet’s hometown .
42004025	And I can assure you that there were many widows in Israel during Elijah’s time , when it didn’t rain for three and a half years and there was a great food shortage in the land .
42004026	Yet Elijah was sent to none of them but only to a widow in the city of Zarephath in the region of Sidon .
42004027	There were also many persons with skin diseases in Israel during the time of the prophet Elisha , but none of them were cleansed . Instead , Naaman the Syrian was cleansed . "
42004028	When they heard this , everyone in the synagogue was filled with anger .
42004029	They rose up and ran him out of town . They led him to the crest of the hill on which their town had been built so that they could throw him off the cliff .
42004030	But he passed through the crowd and went on his way .
42004031	Jesus went down to the city of Capernaum in Galilee and taught the people each Sabbath .
42004032	They were amazed by his teaching because he delivered his message with authority .
42004033	A man in the synagogue had the spirit of an unclean demon . He screamed ,
42004034	" Hey ! What have you to do with us , Jesus of Nazareth ? Have you come to destroy us ? I know who you are . You are the holy one from God . "
42004035	" Silence ! " Jesus said , speaking harshly to the demon . " Come out of him ! " The demon threw the man down before them , then came out of him without harming him .
42004036	They were all shaken and said to each other , " What kind of word is this , that he can command unclean spirits with authority and power , and they leave ? "
42004037	Reports about him spread everywhere in the surrounding region .
42004038	After leaving the synagogue , Jesus went home with Simon . Simon’s mother-in-law was sick with a high fever , and the family asked Jesus to help her .
42004039	He bent over her and spoke harshly to the fever , and it left her . She got up at once and served them .
42004040	When the sun was setting , everyone brought to Jesus relatives and acquaintances with all kinds of diseases . Placing his hands on each of them , he healed them .
42004041	Demons also came out of many people . They screamed , " You are God’s Son . " But he spoke harshly to them and wouldn’t allow them to speak because they recognized that he was the Christ .
42004042	When daybreak arrived , Jesus went to a deserted place . The crowds were looking for him . When they found him , they tried to keep him from leaving them .
42004043	But he said to them , " I must preach the good news of God’s kingdom in other cities too , for this is why I was sent . "
42004044	So he continued preaching in the Judean synagogues .
42005001	One day Jesus was standing beside Lake Gennesaret when the crowd pressed in around him to hear God’s word .
42005002	Jesus saw two boats sitting by the lake . The fishermen had gone ashore and were washing their nets .
42005003	Jesus boarded one of the boats , the one that belonged to Simon , then asked him to row out a little distance from the shore . Jesus sat down and taught the crowds from the boat .
42005004	When he finished speaking to the crowds , he said to Simon , " Row out farther , into the deep water , and drop your nets for a catch . "
42005005	Simon replied , " Master , we’ve worked hard all night and caught nothing . But because you say so , I’ll drop the nets . "
42005006	So they dropped the nets and their catch was so huge that their nets were splitting .
42005007	They signaled for their partners in the other boat to come and help them . They filled both boats so full that they were about to sink .
42005008	When Simon Peter saw the catch , he fell at Jesus’ knees and said , " Leave me , Lord , for I’m a sinner ! "
42005009	Peter and those with him were overcome with amazement because of the number of fish they caught .
42005010	James and John , Zebedee’s sons , were Simon’s partners and they were amazed too . Jesus said to Simon , " Don’t be afraid . From now on , you will be fishing for people . "
42005011	As soon as they brought the boats to the shore , they left everything and followed Jesus .
42005012	Jesus was in one of the towns where there was also a man covered with a skin disease . When he saw Jesus , he fell on his face and begged , " Lord , if you want , you can make me clean . "
42005013	Jesus reached out his hand , touched him , and said , " I do want to . Be clean . " Instantly , the skin disease left him .
42005014	Jesus ordered him not to tell anyone . " Instead , " Jesus said , " go and show yourself to the priest and make an offering for your cleansing , as Moses instructed . This will be a testimony to them . "
42005015	News of him spread even more and huge crowds gathered to listen and to be healed from their illnesses .
42005016	But Jesus would withdraw to deserted places for prayer .
42005017	One day when Jesus was teaching , Pharisees and legal experts were sitting nearby . They had come from every village in Galilee and Judea , and from Jerusalem . Now the power of the Lord was with Jesus to heal .
42005018	Some men were bringing a man who was paralyzed , lying on a cot . They wanted to carry him in and place him before Jesus ,
42005019	but they couldn’t reach him because of the crowd . So they took him up on the roof and lowered him — cot and all — through the roof tiles into the crowded room in front of Jesus .
42005020	When Jesus saw their faith , he said , " Friend , your sins are forgiven . "
42005021	The legal experts and Pharisees began to mutter among themselves , " Who is this who insults God ? Only God can forgive sins ! "
42005022	Jesus recognized what they were discussing and responded , " Why do you fill your minds with these questions ?
42005023	Which is easier — to say , ‘ Your sins are forgiven , ’ or to say , ‘ Get up and walk ’ ?
42005024	But so that you will know that the Human One has authority on the earth to forgive sins " — Jesus now spoke to the man who was paralyzed , " I say to you , get up , take your cot , and go home . "
42005025	Right away , the man stood before them , picked up his cot , and went home , praising God .
42005026	All the people were beside themselves with wonder . Filled with awe , they glorified God , saying , " We’ve seen unimaginable things today . "
42005027	Afterward , Jesus went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at a kiosk for collecting taxes . Jesus said to him , " Follow me . "
42005028	Levi got up , left everything behind , and followed him .
42005029	Then Levi threw a great banquet for Jesus in his home . A large number of tax collectors and others sat down to eat with them .
42005030	The Pharisees and their legal experts grumbled against his disciples . They said , " Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners ? "
42005031	Jesus answered , " Healthy people don’t need a doctor , but sick people do .
42005032	I didn’t come to call righteous people but sinners to change their hearts and lives . "
42005033	Some people said to Jesus , " The disciples of John fast often and pray frequently . The disciples of the Pharisees do the same , but your disciples are always eating and drinking . "
42005034	Jesus replied , " You can’t make the wedding guests fast while the groom is with them , can you ?
42005035	The days will come when the groom will be taken from them , and then they will fast . "
42005036	Then he told them a parable . " No one tears a patch from a new garment to patch an old garment . Otherwise , the new garment would be ruined , and the new patch wouldn’t match the old garment .
42005037	Nobody pours new wine into old wineskins . If they did , the new wine would burst the wineskins , the wine would spill , and the wineskins would be ruined .
42005038	Instead , new wine must be put into new wineskins .
42005039	No one who drinks a well-aged wine wants new wine , but says , ‘ The well-aged wine is better . ’ "
42006001	One Sabbath , as Jesus was going through the wheat fields , his disciples were picking the heads of wheat , rubbing them in their hands , and eating them .
42006002	Some Pharisees said , " Why are you breaking the Sabbath law ? "
42006003	Jesus replied , " Haven’t you read what David and his companions did when they were hungry ?
42006004	He broke the Law by going into God’s house and eating the bread of the presence , which only the priests can eat . He also gave some of the bread to his companions . "
42006005	Then he said to them , " The Human One is Lord of the Sabbath . "
42006006	On another Sabbath , Jesus entered a synagogue to teach . A man was there whose right hand was withered .
42006007	The legal experts and the Pharisees were watching him closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath . They were looking for a reason to bring charges against him .
42006008	Jesus knew their thoughts , so he said to the man with the withered hand , " Get up and stand in front of everyone . " He got up and stood there .
42006009	Jesus said to the legal experts and Pharisees , " Here’s a question for you : Is it legal on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil , to save life or to destroy it ? "
42006010	Looking around at them all , he said to the man , " Stretch out your hand . " So he did and his hand was made healthy .
42006011	They were furious and began talking with each other about what to do to Jesus .
42006012	During that time , Jesus went out to the mountain to pray , and he prayed to God all night long .
42006013	At daybreak , he called together his disciples . He chose twelve of them whom he called apostles :
42006014	Simon , whom he named Peter ; his brother Andrew ; James ; John ; Philip ; Bartholomew ;
42006015	Matthew ; Thomas ; James the son of Alphaeus ; Simon , who was called a zealot ;
42006016	Judas the son of James ; and Judas Iscariot , who became a traitor .
42006017	Jesus came down from the mountain with them and stood on a large area of level ground . A great company of his disciples and a huge crowd of people from all around Judea and Jerusalem and the area around Tyre and Sidon joined him there .
42006018	They came to hear him and to be healed from their diseases , and those bothered by unclean spirits were healed .
42006019	The whole crowd wanted to touch him , because power was going out from him and he was healing everyone .
42006020	Jesus raised his eyes to his disciples and said : “ Happy are you who are poor , because God’s kingdom is yours .
42006021	Happy are you who hunger now , because you will be satisfied . Happy are you who weep now , because you will laugh .
42006022	Happy are you when people hate you , reject you , insult you , and condemn your name as evil because of the Human One .
42006023	Rejoice when that happens ! Leap for joy because you have a great reward in heaven . Their ancestors did the same things to the prophets .
42006024	But how terrible for you who are rich , because you have already received your comfort .
42006025	How terrible for you who have plenty now , because you will be hungry . How terrible for you who laugh now , because you will mourn and weep .
42006026	How terrible for you when all speak well of you . Their ancestors did the same things to the false prophets .
42006027	“ But I say to you who are willing to hear : Love your enemies . Do good to those who hate you .
42006028	Bless those who curse you . Pray for those who mistreat you .
42006029	If someone slaps you on the cheek , offer the other one as well . If someone takes your coat , don’t withhold your shirt either .
42006030	Give to everyone who asks and don’t demand your things back from those who take them .
42006031	Treat people in the same way that you want them to treat you .
42006032	“ If you love those who love you , why should you be commended ? Even sinners love those who love them .
42006033	If you do good to those who do good to you , why should you be commended ? Even sinners do that .
42006034	If you lend to those from whom you expect repayment , why should you be commended ? Even sinners lend to sinners expecting to be paid back in full .
42006035	Instead , love your enemies , do good , and lend expecting nothing in return . If you do , you will have a great reward . You will be acting the way children of the Most High act , for he is kind to ungrateful and wicked people .
42006036	Be compassionate just as your Father is compassionate .
42006037	" Don’t judge , and you won’t be judged . Don’t condemn , and you won’t be condemned . Forgive , and you will be forgiven .
42006038	Give , and it will be given to you . A good portion — packed down , firmly shaken , and overflowing — will fall into your lap . The portion you give will determine the portion you receive in return . "
42006039	Jesus also told them a riddle . " A blind person can’t lead another blind person , right ? Won’t they both fall into a ditch ?
42006040	Disciples aren’t greater than their teacher , but whoever is fully prepared will be like their teacher .
42006041	Why do you see the splinter in your brother’s or sister’s eye but don’t notice the log in your own eye ?
42006042	How can you say to your brother or sister , ‘ Brother , Sister , let me take the splinter out of your eye , ’ when you don’t see the log in your own eye ? You deceive yourselves ! First take the log out of your eye , and then you will see clearly to take the splinter out of your brother’s or sister’s eye .
42006043	“ A good tree doesn’t produce bad fruit , nor does a bad tree produce good fruit .
42006044	Each tree is known by its own fruit . People don’t gather figs from thorny plants , nor do they pick grapes from prickly bushes .
42006045	A good person produces good from the good treasury of the inner self , while an evil person produces evil from the evil treasury of the inner self . The inner self overflows with words that are spoken .
42006046	" Why do you call me ‘ Lord , Lord ’ and don’t do what I say ?
42006047	I’ll show what it’s like when someone comes to me , hears my words , and puts them into practice .
42006048	It’s like a person building a house by digging deep and laying the foundation on bedrock . When the flood came , the rising water smashed against that house , but the water couldn’t shake the house because it was well built .
42006049	But those who don’t put into practice what they hear are like a person who built a house without a foundation . The floodwater smashed against it and it collapsed instantly . It was completely destroyed . "
42007001	After Jesus finished presenting all his words among the people , he entered Capernaum .
42007002	A centurion had a servant who was very important to him , but the servant was ill and about to die .
42007003	When the centurion heard about Jesus , he sent some Jewish elders to Jesus to ask him to come and heal his servant .
42007004	When they came to Jesus , they earnestly pleaded with Jesus . " He deserves to have you do this for him , " they said .
42007005	" He loves our people and he built our synagogue for us . "
42007006	Jesus went with them . He had almost reached the house when the centurion sent friends to say to Jesus , " Lord , don’t be bothered . I don’t deserve to have you come under my roof .
42007007	In fact , I didn’t even consider myself worthy to come to you . Just say the word and my servant will be healed .
42007008	I’m also a man appointed under authority , with soldiers under me . I say to one , ‘ Go , ’ and he goes , and to another , ‘ Come , ’ and he comes . I say to my servant , ‘ Do this , ’ and the servant does it . "
42007009	When Jesus heard these words , he was impressed with the centurion . He turned to the crowd following him and said , " I tell you , even in Israel I haven’t found faith like this . "
42007010	When the centurion’s friends returned to his house , they found the servant restored to health .
42007011	A little later Jesus went to a city called Nain . His disciples and a great crowd traveled with him .
42007012	As he approached the city gate , a dead man was being carried out . He was his mother’s only son , and she was a widow . A large crowd from the city was with her .
42007013	When he saw her , the Lord had compassion for her and said , " Don’t cry . "
42007014	He stepped forward and touched the stretcher on which the dead man was being carried . Those carrying him stood still . Jesus said , " Young man , I say to you , get up . "
42007015	The dead man sat up and began to speak , and Jesus gave him to his mother .
42007016	Awestruck , everyone praised God . " A great prophet has appeared among us , " they said . " God has come to help his people . "
42007017	This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding region .
42007018	John’s disciples informed him about all these things . John called two of his disciples
42007019	and sent them to the Lord . They were to ask him , " Are you the one who is coming , or should we look for someone else ? "
42007020	When they reached Jesus , they said , " John the Baptist sent us to you . He asks , ‘ Are you the one who is coming , or should we look for someone else ? ’ "
42007021	Right then , Jesus healed many of their diseases , illnesses , and evil spirits , and he gave sight to a number of blind people .
42007022	Then he replied to John’s disciples , " Go , report to John what you have seen and heard . Those who were blind are able to see . Those who were crippled now walk . People with skin diseases are cleansed . Those who were deaf now hear . Those who were dead are raised up . And good news is preached to the poor .
42007023	Happy is anyone who doesn’t stumble along the way because of me . "
42007024	After John’s messengers were gone , Jesus spoke to the crowds about John . " What did you go out into the wilderness to see ? A stalk blowing in the wind ?
42007025	What did you go out to see ? A man dressed up in refined clothes ? Look , those who dress in fashionable clothes and live in luxury are in royal palaces .
42007026	What did you go out to see ? A prophet ? Yes , I tell you , and more than a prophet .
42007027	He is the one of whom it’s written : Look , I’m sending my messenger before you , who will prepare your way before you .
42007028	I tell you that no greater human being has ever been born than John . Yet whoever is least in God’s kingdom is greater than he . "
42007029	Everyone who heard this , including the tax collectors , acknowledged God’s justice because they had been baptized by John .
42007030	But the Pharisees and legal experts rejected God’s will for themselves because they hadn’t been baptized by John .
42007031	" To what will I compare the people of this generation ? " Jesus asked . " What are they like ?
42007032	They are like children sitting in the marketplace calling out to each other , ‘ We played the flute for you and you didn’t dance . We sang a funeral song and you didn’t cry . ’
42007033	John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine , and you say , ‘ He has a demon . ’
42007034	Yet the Human One came eating and drinking , and you say , ‘ Look , a glutton and a drunk , a friend of tax collectors and sinners . ’
42007035	But wisdom is proved to be right by all her descendants . "
42007036	One of the Pharisees invited Jesus to eat with him . After he entered the Pharisee’s home , he took his place at the table .
42007037	Meanwhile , a woman from the city , a sinner , discovered that Jesus was dining in the Pharisee’s house . She brought perfumed oil in a vase made of alabaster .
42007038	Standing behind him at his feet and crying , she began to wet his feet with her tears . She wiped them with her hair , kissed them , and poured the oil on them .
42007039	When the Pharisee who had invited Jesus saw what was happening , he said to himself , If this man were a prophet , he would know what kind of woman is touching him . He would know that she is a sinner .
42007040	Jesus replied , " Simon , I have something to say to you . " " Teacher , speak , " he said .
42007041	" A certain lender had two debtors . One owed enough money to pay five hundred people for a day’s work . The other owed enough money for fifty .
42007042	When they couldn’t pay , the lender forgave the debts of them both . Which of them will love him more ? "
42007043	Simon replied , " I suppose the one who had the largest debt canceled . " Jesus said , " You have judged correctly . "
42007044	Jesus turned to the woman and said to Simon , " Do you see this woman ? When I entered your home , you didn’t give me water for my feet , but she wet my feet with tears and wiped them with her hair .
42007045	You didn’t greet me with a kiss , but she hasn’t stopped kissing my feet since I came in .
42007046	You didn’t anoint my head with oil , but she has poured perfumed oil on my feet .
42007047	This is why I tell you that her many sins have been forgiven ; so she has shown great love . The one who is forgiven little loves little . "
42007048	Then Jesus said to her , " Your sins are forgiven . "
42007049	The other table guests began to say among themselves , " Who is this person that even forgives sins ? "
42007050	Jesus said to the woman , " Your faith has saved you . Go in peace . "
42008001	Soon afterward , Jesus traveled through the cities and villages , preaching and proclaiming the good news of God’s kingdom . The Twelve were with him ,
42008002	along with some women who had been healed of evil spirits and sicknesses . Among them were Mary Magdalene ( from whom seven demons had been thrown out ) ,
42008003	Joanna ( the wife of Herod’s servant Chuza ) , Susanna , and many others who provided for them out of their resources .
42008004	When a great crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from one city after another , he spoke to them in a parable :
42008005	" A farmer went out to scatter his seed . As he was scattering it , some fell on the path where it was crushed , and the birds in the sky came and ate it .
42008006	Other seed fell on rock . As it grew , it dried up because it had no moisture .
42008007	Other seed fell among thorny plants . The thorns grew with the plants and choked them .
42008008	Still other seed landed on good soil . When it grew , it produced one hundred times more grain than was scattered . " As he said this , he called out , " Everyone who has ears should pay attention . "
42008009	His disciples asked him what this parable meant .
42008010	He said , “ You have been given the mysteries of God’s kingdom , but these mysteries come to everyone else in parables so that when they see , they can’t see , and when they hear , they can’t understand .
42008011	“ The parable means this : The seed is God’s word .
42008012	The seed on the path are those who hear , but then the devil comes and steals the word from their hearts so that they won’t believe and be saved .
42008013	The seed on the rock are those who receive the word joyfully when they hear it , but they have no root . They believe for a while but fall away when they are tempted .
42008014	As for the seed that fell among thorny plants , these are the ones who , as they go about their lives , are choked by the concerns , riches , and pleasures of life , and their fruit never matures .
42008015	The seed that fell on good soil are those who hear the word and commit themselves to it with a good and upright heart . Through their resolve , they bear fruit .
42008016	" No one lights a lamp and then covers it with a bowl or puts it under a bed . Instead , they put it on top of a lampstand so that those who enter can see the light .
42008017	Nothing is hidden that won’t be exposed . Nor is anything concealed that won’t be made known and brought to the light .
42008018	Therefore , listen carefully . Those who have will receive more , but as for those who don’t have , even what they seem to have will be taken away from them . "
42008019	Jesus’ mother and brothers came to him but were unable to reach him because of the crowd .
42008020	Someone told him , " Your mother and brothers are standing outside , wanting to see you . "
42008021	He replied , " My mother and brothers are those who listen to God’s word and do it . "
42008022	One day Jesus and his disciples boarded a boat . He said to them , " Let’s cross over to the other side of the lake . " So they set sail .
42008023	While they were sailing , he fell asleep . Gale-force winds swept down on the lake . The boat was filling up with water and they were in danger .
42008024	So they went and woke Jesus , shouting , " Master , Master , we’re going to drown ! " But he got up and gave orders to the wind and the violent waves . The storm died down and it was calm .
42008025	He said to his disciples , " Where is your faith ? " Filled with awe and wonder , they said to each other , " Who is this ? He commands even the winds and the water , and they obey him ! "
42008026	Jesus and his disciples sailed to the Gerasenes’ land , which is across the lake from Galilee .
42008027	As soon as Jesus got out of the boat , a certain man met him . The man was from the city and was possessed by demons . For a long time , he had lived among the tombs , naked and homeless .
42008028	When he saw Jesus , he shrieked and fell down before him . Then he shouted , " What have you to do with me , Jesus , Son of the Most High God ? I beg you , don’t torture me ! "
42008029	He said this because Jesus had already commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man . Many times it had taken possession of him , so he would be bound with leg irons and chains and placed under guard . But he would break his restraints , and the demon would force him into the wilderness .
42008030	Jesus asked him , " What is your name ? " " Legion , " he replied , because many demons had entered him .
42008031	They pleaded with him not to order them to go back into the abyss .
42008032	A large herd of pigs was feeding on the hillside . The demons begged Jesus to let them go into the pigs . Jesus gave them permission ,
42008033	and the demons left the man and entered the pigs . The herd rushed down the cliff into the lake and drowned .
42008034	When those who tended the pigs saw what happened , they ran away and told the story in the city and in the countryside .
42008035	People came to see what had happened . They came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone . He was sitting at Jesus’ feet , fully dressed and completely sane . They were filled with awe .
42008036	Those people who had actually seen what had happened told them how the demon-possessed man had been delivered .
42008037	Then everyone gathered from the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave their area because they were overcome with fear . So he got into the boat and returned across the lake .
42008038	The man from whom the demons had gone begged to come along with Jesus as one of his disciples . Jesus sent him away , saying ,
42008039	" Return home and tell the story of what God has done for you . " So he went throughout the city proclaiming what Jesus had done for him .
42008040	When Jesus returned , the crowd welcomed him , for they had been waiting for him .
42008041	A man named Jairus , who was a synagogue leader , came and fell at Jesus’ feet . He pleaded with Jesus to come to his house
42008042	because his only daughter , a twelve-year-old , was dying . As Jesus moved forward , he faced smothering crowds .
42008043	A woman was there who had been bleeding for twelve years . She had spent her entire livelihood on doctors , but no one could heal her .
42008044	She came up behind him and touched the hem of his clothes , and at once her bleeding stopped .
42008045	" Who touched me ? " Jesus asked . When everyone denied it , Peter said , " Master , the crowds are surrounding you and pressing in on you ! "
42008046	But Jesus said , " Someone touched me . I know that power has gone out from me . "
42008047	When the woman saw that she couldn’t escape notice , she came trembling and fell before Jesus . In front of everyone , she explained why she had touched him and how she had been immediately healed .
42008048	" Daughter , your faith has healed you , " Jesus said . " Go in peace . "
42008049	While Jesus was still speaking , someone came from the synagogue leader’s house , saying to Jairus , " Your daughter has died . Don’t bother the teacher any longer . "
42008050	When Jesus heard this , he responded , " Don’t be afraid ; just keep trusting , and she will be healed . "
42008051	When he came to the house , he didn’t allow anyone to enter with him except Peter , John , and James , and the child’s father and mother .
42008052	They were all crying and mourning for her , but Jesus said , " Don’t cry . She isn’t dead . She’s only sleeping . "
42008053	They laughed at him because they knew she was dead .
42008054	Taking her hand , Jesus called out , " Child , get up . "
42008055	Her life returned and she got up at once . He directed them to give her something to eat .
42008056	Her parents were beside themselves with joy , but he ordered them to tell no one what had happened .
42009001	Jesus called the Twelve together and he gave them power and authority over all demons and to heal sicknesses .
42009002	He sent them out to proclaim God’s kingdom and to heal the sick .
42009003	He told them , " Take nothing for the journey — no walking stick , no bag , no bread , no money , not even an extra shirt .
42009004	Whatever house you enter , remain there until you leave that place .
42009005	Wherever they don’t welcome you , as you leave that city , shake the dust off your feet as a witness against them . "
42009006	They departed and went through the villages proclaiming the good news and healing people everywhere .
42009007	Herod the ruler heard about everything that was happening . He was confused because some people were saying that John had been raised from the dead ,
42009008	others that Elijah had appeared , and still others that one of the ancient prophets had come back to life .
42009009	Herod said , " I beheaded John , so now who am I hearing about ? " Herod wanted to see him .
42009010	When the apostles returned , they described for Jesus what they had done . Taking them with him , Jesus withdrew privately to a city called Bethsaida .
42009011	When the crowds figured it out , they followed him . He welcomed them , spoke to them about God’s kingdom , and healed those who were sick .
42009012	When the day was almost over , the Twelve came to him and said , " Send the crowd away so that they can go to the nearby villages and countryside and find lodging and food , because we are in a deserted place . "
42009013	He replied , " You give them something to eat . " But they said , " We have no more than five loaves of bread and two fish — unless we go and buy food for all these people . "
42009014	( They said this because about five thousand men were present . ) Jesus said to his disciples , " Seat them in groups of about fifty . "
42009015	They did so , and everyone was seated .
42009016	He took the five loaves and the two fish , looked up to heaven , blessed them , and broke them and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd .
42009017	Everyone ate until they were full , and the disciples filled twelve baskets with the leftovers .
42009018	Once when Jesus was praying by himself , the disciples joined him , and he asked them , " Who do the crowds say that I am ? "
42009019	They answered , " John the Baptist , others Elijah , and still others that one of the ancient prophets has come back to life . "
42009020	He asked them , " And what about you ? Who do you say that I am ? " Peter answered , " The Christ sent from God . "
42009021	Jesus gave them strict orders not to tell this to anyone .
42009022	He said , " The Human One must suffer many things and be rejected — by the elders , chief priests , and the legal experts — and be killed and be raised on the third day . "
42009023	Jesus said to everyone , " All who want to come after me must say no to themselves , take up their cross daily , and follow me .
42009024	All who want to save their lives will lose them . But all who lose their lives because of me will save them .
42009025	What advantage do people have if they gain the whole world for themselves yet perish or lose their lives ?
42009026	Whoever is ashamed of me and my words , the Human One will be ashamed of that person when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels .
42009027	I assure you that some standing here won’t die before they see God’s kingdom . "
42009028	About eight days after Jesus said these things , he took Peter , John , and James , and went up on a mountain to pray .
42009029	As he was praying , the appearance of his face changed and his clothes flashed white like lightning .
42009030	Two men , Moses and Elijah , were talking with him .
42009031	They were clothed with heavenly splendor and spoke about Jesus’ departure , which he would achieve in Jerusalem .
42009032	Peter and those with him were almost overcome by sleep , but they managed to stay awake and saw his glory as well as the two men with him .
42009033	As the two men were about to leave Jesus , Peter said to him , " Master , it’s good that we’re here . We should construct three shrines : one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah " — but he didn’t know what he was saying .
42009034	Peter was still speaking when a cloud overshadowed them . As they entered the cloud , they were overcome with awe .
42009035	Then a voice from the cloud said , " This is my Son , my chosen one . Listen to him ! "
42009036	Even as the voice spoke , Jesus was found alone . They were speechless and at the time told no one what they had seen .
42009037	The next day , when Jesus , Peter , John , and James had come down from the mountain , a large crowd met Jesus .
42009038	A man from the crowd shouted , " Teacher , I beg you to take a look at my son , my only child .
42009039	Look , a spirit seizes him and , without any warning , he screams . It shakes him and causes him to foam at the mouth . It tortures him and rarely leaves him alone .
42009040	I begged your disciples to throw it out , but they couldn’t . "
42009041	Jesus answered , " You faithless and crooked generation , how long will I be with you and put up with you ? Bring your son here . "
42009042	While he was coming , the demon threw him down and shook him violently . Jesus spoke harshly to the unclean spirit , healed the child , and gave him back to his father .
42009043	Everyone was overwhelmed by God’s greatness . While everyone was marveling at everything he was doing , Jesus said to his disciples ,
42009044	" Take these words to heart : the Human One is about to be delivered into human hands . "
42009045	They didn’t understand this statement . Its meaning was hidden from them so they couldn’t grasp it . And they were afraid to ask him about it .
42009046	An argument arose among the disciples about which of them was the greatest .
42009047	Aware of their deepest thoughts , Jesus took a little child and had the child stand beside him .
42009048	Jesus said to his disciples , " Whoever welcomes this child in my name welcomes me . Whoever welcomes me , welcomes the one who sent me . Whoever is least among you all is the greatest . "
42009049	John replied , " Master , we saw someone throwing demons out in your name , and we tried to stop him because he isn’t in our group of followers . "
42009050	But Jesus replied , " Don’t stop him , because whoever isn’t against you is for you . "
42009051	As the time approached when Jesus was to be taken up into heaven , he determined to go to Jerusalem .
42009052	He sent messengers on ahead of him . Along the way , they entered a Samaritan village to prepare for his arrival ,
42009053	but the Samaritan villagers refused to welcome him because he was determined to go to Jerusalem .
42009054	When the disciples James and John saw this , they said , " Lord , do you want us to call fire down from heaven to consume them ? "
42009055	But Jesus turned and spoke sternly to them ,
42009056	and they went on to another village .
42009057	As Jesus and his disciples traveled along the road , someone said to him , " I will follow you wherever you go . "
42009058	Jesus replied , " Foxes have dens and the birds in the sky have nests , but the Human One has no place to lay his head . "
42009059	Then Jesus said to someone else , " Follow me . " He replied , " Lord , first let me go and bury my father . "
42009060	Jesus said to him , " Let the dead bury their own dead . But you go and spread the news of God’s kingdom . "
42009061	Someone else said to Jesus , " I will follow you , Lord , but first let me say good-bye to those in my house . "
42009062	Jesus said to him , " No one who puts a hand on the plow and looks back is fit for God’s kingdom . "
42010001	After these things , the Lord commissioned seventy-two others and sent them on ahead in pairs to every city and place he was about to go .
42010002	He said to them , “ The harvest is bigger than you can imagine , but there are few workers . Therefore , plead with the Lord of the harvest to send out workers for his harvest .
42010003	Go ! Be warned , though , that I’m sending you out as lambs among wolves .
42010004	Carry no wallet , no bag , and no sandals . Don’t even greet anyone along the way .
42010005	Whenever you enter a house , first say , ‘ May peace be on this house . ’
42010006	If anyone there shares God’s peace , then your peace will rest on that person . If not , your blessing will return to you .
42010007	Remain in this house , eating and drinking whatever they set before you , for workers deserve their pay . Don’t move from house to house .
42010008	Whenever you enter a city and its people welcome you , eat what they set before you .
42010009	Heal the sick who are there , and say to them , ‘ God’s kingdom has come upon you . ’
42010010	Whenever you enter a city and the people don’t welcome you , go out into the streets and say ,
42010011	‘ As a complaint against you , we brush off the dust of your city that has collected on our feet . But know this : God’s kingdom has come to you . ’
42010012	I assure you that Sodom will be better off on Judgment Day than that city .
42010013	" How terrible it will be for you , Chorazin . How terrible it will be for you , Bethsaida . If the miracles done among you had been done in Tyre and Sidon , they would have changed their hearts and lives long ago . They would have sat around in funeral clothes and ashes .
42010014	But Tyre and Sidon will be better off at the judgment than you .
42010015	And you , Capernaum , will you be honored by being raised up to heaven ? No , you will be cast down to the place of the dead .
42010016	Whoever listens to you listens to me . Whoever rejects you rejects me . Whoever rejects me rejects the one who sent me . "
42010017	The seventy-two returned joyously , saying , " Lord , even the demons submit themselves to us in your name . "
42010018	Jesus replied , " I saw Satan fall from heaven like lightning .
42010019	Look , I have given you authority to crush snakes and scorpions underfoot . I have given you authority over all the power of the enemy . Nothing will harm you .
42010020	Nevertheless , don’t rejoice because the spirits submit to you . Rejoice instead that your names are written in heaven . "
42010021	At that very moment , Jesus overflowed with joy from the Holy Spirit and said , " I praise you , Father , Lord of heaven and earth , because you’ve hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and shown them to babies . Indeed , Father , this brings you happiness .
42010022	My Father has handed all things over to me . No one knows who the Son is except the Father , or who the Father is except the Son and anyone to whom the Son wants to reveal him . "
42010023	Turning to the disciples , he said privately , " Happy are the eyes that see what you see .
42010024	I assure you that many prophets and kings wanted to see what you see and hear what you hear , but they didn’t . "
42010025	A legal expert stood up to test Jesus . " Teacher , " he said , " what must I do to gain eternal life ? "
42010026	Jesus replied , " What is written in the Law ? How do you interpret it ? "
42010027	He responded , " You must love the Lord your God with all your heart , with all your being , with all your strength , and with all your mind , and love your neighbor as yourself . "
42010028	Jesus said to him , " You have answered correctly . Do this and you will live . "
42010029	But the legal expert wanted to prove that he was right , so he said to Jesus , " And who is my neighbor ? "
42010030	Jesus replied , " A man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho . He encountered thieves , who stripped him naked , beat him up , and left him near death .
42010031	Now it just so happened that a priest was also going down the same road . When he saw the injured man , he crossed over to the other side of the road and went on his way .
42010032	Likewise , a Levite came by that spot , saw the injured man , and crossed over to the other side of the road and went on his way .
42010033	A Samaritan , who was on a journey , came to where the man was . But when he saw him , he was moved with compassion .
42010034	The Samaritan went to him and bandaged his wounds , tending them with oil and wine . Then he placed the wounded man on his own donkey , took him to an inn , and took care of him .
42010035	The next day , he took two full days’ worth of wages and gave them to the innkeeper . He said , ‘ Take care of him , and when I return , I will pay you back for any additional costs . ’
42010036	What do you think ? Which one of these three was a neighbor to the man who encountered thieves ? "
42010037	Then the legal expert said , " The one who demonstrated mercy toward him . " Jesus told him , " Go and do likewise . "
42010038	While Jesus and his disciples were traveling , Jesus entered a village where a woman named Martha welcomed him as a guest .
42010039	She had a sister named Mary , who sat at the Lord’s feet and listened to his message .
42010040	By contrast , Martha was preoccupied with getting everything ready for their meal . So Martha came to him and said , " Lord , don’t you care that my sister has left me to prepare the table all by myself ? Tell her to help me . "
42010041	The Lord answered , " Martha , Martha , you are worried and distracted by many things .
42010042	One thing is necessary . Mary has chosen the better part . It won’t be taken away from her . "
42011001	Jesus was praying in a certain place . When he finished , one of his disciples said , " Lord , teach us to pray , just as John taught his disciples . "
42011002	Jesus told them , " When you pray , say : ‘ Father , uphold the holiness of your name . Bring in your kingdom .
42011003	Give us the bread we need for today .
42011004	Forgive us our sins , for we also forgive everyone who has wronged us . And don’t lead us into temptation . ’ "
42011005	He also said to them , “ Imagine that one of you has a friend and you go to that friend in the middle of the night . Imagine saying , ‘ Friend , loan me three loaves of bread
42011006	because a friend of mine on a journey has arrived and I have nothing to set before him . ’
42011007	Imagine further that he answers from within the house , ‘ Don’t bother me . The door is already locked , and my children and I are in bed . I can’t get up to give you anything . ’
42011008	I assure you , even if he wouldn’t get up and help because of his friendship , he will get up and give his friend whatever he needs because of his friend’s brashness .
42011009	And I tell you : Ask and you will receive . Seek and you will find . Knock and the door will be opened to you .
42011010	Everyone who asks , receives . Whoever seeks , finds . To everyone who knocks , the door is opened .
42011011	" Which father among you would give a snake to your child if the child asked for a fish ?
42011012	If a child asked for an egg , what father would give the child a scorpion ?
42011013	If you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him ? "
42011014	Jesus was throwing out a demon that causes muteness . When the demon was gone , the man who couldn’t speak began to talk . The crowds were amazed .
42011015	But some of them said , " He throws out demons with the authority of Beelzebul , the ruler of demons . "
42011016	Others were testing him , seeking a sign from heaven .
42011017	Because Jesus knew what they were thinking , he said to them , “ Every kingdom involved in civil war becomes a wasteland , and a house torn apart by divisions will collapse .
42011018	If Satan is at war with himself , how will his kingdom endure ? I ask this because you say that I throw out demons by the authority of Beelzebul .
42011019	If I throw out demons by the authority of Beelzebul , then by whose authority do your followers throw them out ? Therefore , they will be your judges .
42011020	But if I throw out demons by the power of God , then God’s kingdom has already overtaken you .
42011021	When a strong man , fully armed , guards his own palace , his possessions are secure .
42011022	But as soon as a stronger one attacks and overpowers him , the stronger one takes away the armor he had trusted and divides the stolen goods .
42011023	" Whoever isn’t with me is against me , and whoever doesn’t gather with me , scatters .
42011024	When an unclean spirit leaves a person , it wanders through dry places looking for a place to rest . But it doesn’t find any . Then it says , ‘ I’ll go back to the house I left . ’
42011025	When it arrives , it finds the house cleaned up and decorated .
42011026	Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself . They go in and make their home there . That person is worse off at the end than at the beginning . "
42011027	While Jesus was saying these things , a certain woman in the crowd spoke up : " Happy is the mother who gave birth to you and who nursed you . "
42011028	But he said , " Happy rather are those who hear God’s word and put it into practice . "
42011029	When the crowds grew , Jesus said , “ This generation is an evil generation . It looks for a sign , but no sign will be given to it except Jonah’s sign .
42011030	Just as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh , so the Human One will be a sign to this generation .
42011031	The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with the people of this generation and condemn them , because she came from a distant land to hear Solomon’s wisdom . And look , someone greater than Solomon is here .
42011032	The people of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it , because they changed their hearts and lives in response to Jonah’s preaching — and one greater than Jonah is here .
42011033	" People don’t light a lamp and then put it in a closet or under a basket . Rather , they place the lamp on a lampstand so that those who enter the house can see the light .
42011034	Your eye is the lamp of your body . When your eye is healthy , your whole body is full of light . But when your eye is bad , your whole body is full of darkness .
42011035	Therefore , see to it that the light in you isn’t darkness .
42011036	If your whole body is full of light — with no part darkened — then it will be as full of light as when a lamp shines brightly on you . "
42011037	While Jesus was speaking , a Pharisee invited him to share a meal with him , so Jesus went and took his place at the table .
42011038	When the Pharisee saw that Jesus didn’t ritually purify his hands by washing before the meal , he was astonished .
42011039	The Lord said to him , “ Now , you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and platter , but your insides are stuffed with greed and wickedness .
42011040	Foolish people ! Didn’t the one who made the outside also make the inside ?
42011041	Therefore , give to those in need from the core of who you are and you will be clean all over .
42011042	“ How terrible for you Pharisees ! You give a tenth of your mint , rue , and garden herbs of all kinds , while neglecting justice and love for God . These you ought to have done without neglecting the others .
42011043	“ How terrible for you Pharisees ! You love the most prominent seats in the synagogues and respectful greetings in the marketplaces .
42011044	" How terrible for you ! You are like unmarked graves , and people walk on them without recognizing it . "
42011045	One of the legal experts responded , " Teacher , when you say these things , you are insulting us too . "
42011046	Jesus said , “ How terrible for you legal experts too ! You load people down with impossible burdens and you refuse to lift a single finger to help them .
42011047	“ How terrible for you ! You built memorials to the prophets , whom your ancestors killed .
42011048	In this way , you testify that you approve of your ancestors’ deeds . They killed the prophets , and you build memorials !
42011049	Therefore , God’s wisdom has said , ‘ I will send prophets and apostles to them and they will harass and kill some of them . ’
42011050	As a result , this generation will be charged with the murder of all the prophets since the beginning of time .
42011051	This includes the murder of every prophet — from Abel to Zechariah — who was killed between the altar and the holy place . Yes , I’m telling you , this generation will be charged with it .
42011052	" How terrible for you legal experts ! You snatched away the key of knowledge . You didn’t enter yourselves , and you stood in the way of those who were entering . "
42011053	As he left there , the legal experts and Pharisees began to resent him deeply and to ask him pointed questions about many things .
42011054	They plotted against him , trying to trap him in his words .
42012001	When a crowd of thousands upon thousands had gathered so that they were crushing each other , Jesus began to speak first to his disciples : “ Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees — I mean , the mismatch between their hearts and lives .
42012002	Nothing is hidden that won’t be revealed , and nothing is secret that won’t be brought out into the open .
42012003	Therefore , whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light , and whatever you have whispered in the rooms deep inside the house will be announced from the rooftops .
42012004	“ I tell you , my friends , don’t be terrified by those who can kill the body but after that can do nothing more .
42012005	I’ll show you whom you should fear : fear the one who , after you have been killed , has the authority to throw you into hell . Indeed , I tell you , that’s the one you should fear .
42012006	Aren’t five sparrows sold for two small coins ? Yet not one of them is overlooked by God .
42012007	Even the hairs on your head are all counted . Don’t be afraid . You are worth more than many sparrows .
42012008	" I tell you , everyone who acknowledges me before humans , the Human One will acknowledge before God’s angels .
42012009	But the one who rejects me before others will be rejected before God’s angels .
42012010	Anyone who speaks a word against the Human One will be forgiven , but whoever insults the Holy Spirit won’t be forgiven .
42012011	When they bring you before the synagogues , rulers , and authorities , don’t worry about how to defend yourself or what you should say .
42012012	The Holy Spirit will tell you at that very moment what you must say . "
42012013	Someone from the crowd said to him , " Teacher , tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me . "
42012014	Jesus said to him , " Man , who appointed me as judge or referee between you and your brother ? "
42012015	Then Jesus said to them , " Watch out ! Guard yourself against all kinds of greed . After all , one’s life isn’t determined by one’s possessions , even when someone is very wealthy . "
42012016	Then he told them a parable : " A certain rich man’s land produced a bountiful crop .
42012017	He said to himself , What will I do ? I have no place to store my harvest !
42012018	Then he thought , Here’s what I’ll do . I’ll tear down my barns and build bigger ones . That’s where I’ll store all my grain and goods .
42012019	I’ll say to myself , You have stored up plenty of goods , enough for several years . Take it easy ! Eat , drink , and enjoy yourself .
42012020	But God said to him , ‘ Fool , tonight you will die . Now who will get the things you have prepared for yourself ? ’
42012021	This is the way it will be for those who hoard things for themselves and aren’t rich toward God . "
42012022	Then Jesus said to his disciples , " Therefore , I say to you , don’t worry about your life , what you will eat , or about your body , what you will wear .
42012023	There is more to life than food and more to the body than clothing .
42012024	Consider the ravens : they neither plant nor harvest , they have no silo or barn , yet God feeds them . You are worth so much more than birds !
42012025	Who among you by worrying can add a single moment to your life ?
42012026	If you can’t do such a small thing , why worry about the rest ?
42012027	Notice how the lilies grow . They don’t wear themselves out with work , and they don’t spin cloth . But I say to you that even Solomon in all his splendor wasn’t dressed like one of these .
42012028	If God dresses grass in the field so beautifully , even though it’s alive today and tomorrow it’s thrown into the furnace , how much more will God do for you , you people of weak faith !
42012029	Don’t chase after what you will eat and what you will drink . Stop worrying .
42012030	All the nations of the world long for these things . Your Father knows that you need them .
42012031	Instead , desire his kingdom and these things will be given to you as well .
42012032	“ Don’t be afraid , little flock , because your Father delights in giving you the kingdom .
42012033	Sell your possessions and give to those in need . Make for yourselves wallets that don’t wear out — a treasure in heaven that never runs out . No thief comes near there , and no moth destroys .
42012034	Where your treasure is , there your heart will be too .
42012035	" Be dressed for service and keep your lamps lit .
42012036	Be like people waiting for their master to come home from a wedding celebration , who can immediately open the door for him when he arrives and knocks on the door .
42012037	Happy are those servants whom the master finds waiting up when he arrives . I assure you that , when he arrives , he will dress himself to serve , seat them at the table as honored guests , and wait on them .
42012038	Happy are those whom he finds alert , even if he comes at midnight or just before dawn .
42012039	But know this , if the homeowner had known what time the thief was coming , he wouldn’t have allowed his home to be broken into .
42012040	You also must be ready , because the Human One is coming at a time when you don’t expect him . "
42012041	Peter said , " Lord , are you telling this parable for us or for everyone ? "
42012042	The Lord replied , “ Who are the faithful and wise managers whom the master will put in charge of his household servants , to give them their food at the proper time ?
42012043	Happy are the servants whom the master finds fulfilling their responsibilities when he comes .
42012044	I assure you that the master will put them in charge of all his possessions .
42012045	“ But suppose that these servants should say to themselves , My master is taking his time about coming . And suppose they began to beat the servants , both men and women , and to eat , drink , and get drunk .
42012046	The master of those servants would come on a day when they weren’t expecting him , at a time they couldn’t predict . The master will cut them into pieces and assign them a place with the unfaithful .
42012047	That servant who knew his master’s will but didn’t prepare for it or act on it will be beaten severely .
42012048	The one who didn’t know the master’s will but who did things deserving punishment will be beaten only a little . Much will be demanded from everyone who has been given much , and from the one who has been entrusted with much , even more will be asked .
42012049	" I came to cast fire upon the earth . How I wish that it was already ablaze !
42012050	I have a baptism I must experience . How I am distressed until it’s completed !
42012051	Do you think that I have come to bring peace to the earth ? No , I tell you , I have come instead to bring division .
42012052	From now on , a household of five will be divided — three against two and two against three .
42012053	Father will square off against son and son against father ; mother against daughter and daughter against mother ; and mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law . "
42012054	Jesus also said to the crowds , " When you see a cloud forming in the west , you immediately say , ‘ It’s going to rain . ’ And indeed it does .
42012055	And when a south wind blows , you say , ‘ A heat wave is coming . ’ And it does .
42012056	Hypocrites ! You know how to interpret conditions on earth and in the sky . How is it that you don’t know how to interpret the present time ?
42012057	And why don’t you judge for yourselves what is right ?
42012058	As you are going to court with your accuser , make your best effort to reach a settlement along the way . Otherwise , your accuser may bring you before the judge , and the judge hand you over to the officer , and the officer throw you into prison .
42012059	I tell you , you won’t get out of there until you have paid the very last cent . "
42013001	Some who were present on that occasion told Jesus about the Galileans whom Pilate had killed while they were offering sacrifices .
42013002	He replied , " Do you think the suffering of these Galileans proves that they were more sinful than all the other Galileans ?
42013003	No , I tell you , but unless you change your hearts and lives , you will die just as they did .
42013004	What about those twelve people who were killed when the tower of Siloam fell on them ? Do you think that they were more guilty of wrongdoing than everyone else who lives in Jerusalem ?
42013005	No , I tell you , but unless you change your hearts and lives , you will die just as they did . "
42013006	Jesus told this parable : " A man owned a fig tree planted in his vineyard . He came looking for fruit on it and found none .
42013007	He said to his gardener , ‘ Look , I’ve come looking for fruit on this fig tree for the past three years , and I’ve never found any . Cut it down ! Why should it continue depleting the soil’s nutrients ? ’
42013008	The gardener responded , ‘ Lord , give it one more year , and I will dig around it and give it fertilizer .
42013009	Maybe it will produce fruit next year ; if not , then you can cut it down . ’ "
42013010	Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath .
42013011	A woman was there who had been disabled by a spirit for eighteen years . She was bent over and couldn’t stand up straight .
42013012	When he saw her , Jesus called her to him and said , " Woman , you are set free from your sickness . "
42013013	He placed his hands on her and she straightened up at once and praised God .
42013014	The synagogue leader , incensed that Jesus had healed on the Sabbath , responded , " There are six days during which work is permitted . Come and be healed on those days , not on the Sabbath day . "
42013015	The Lord replied , " Hypocrites ! Don’t each of you on the Sabbath untie your ox or donkey from its stall and lead it out to get a drink ?
42013016	Then isn’t it necessary that this woman , a daughter of Abraham , bound by Satan for eighteen long years , be set free from her bondage on the Sabbath day ? "
42013017	When he said these things , all his opponents were put to shame , but all those in the crowd rejoiced at all the extraordinary things he was doing .
42013018	Jesus asked , " What is God’s kingdom like ? To what can I compare it ?
42013019	It’s like a mustard seed that someone took and planted in a garden . It grew and developed into a tree and the birds in the sky nested in its branches . "
42013020	Again he said , " To what can I compare God’s kingdom ?
42013021	It’s like yeast , which a woman took and hid in a bushel of wheat flour until the yeast had worked its way through the whole . "
42013022	Jesus traveled through cities and villages , teaching and making his way to Jerusalem .
42013023	Someone said to him , " Lord , will only a few be saved ? " Jesus said to them ,
42013024	" Make every effort to enter through the narrow gate . Many , I tell you , will try to enter and won’t be able to .
42013025	Once the owner of the house gets up and shuts the door , then you will stand outside and knock on the door , saying , ‘ Lord , open the door for us . ’ He will reply , ‘ I don’t know you or where you are from . ’
42013026	Then you will begin to say , ‘ We ate and drank in your presence , and you taught in our streets . ’
42013027	He will respond , ‘ I don’t know you or where you are from . Go away from me , all you evildoers ! ’
42013028	There will be weeping and grinding of teeth when you see Abraham , Isaac , Jacob , and all the prophets in God’s kingdom , but you yourselves will be thrown out .
42013029	People will come from east and west , north and south , and sit down to eat in God’s kingdom .
42013030	Look ! Those who are last will be first and those who are first will be last . "
42013031	At that time , some Pharisees approached Jesus and said , " Go ! Get away from here , because Herod wants to kill you . "
42013032	Jesus said to them , “ Go , tell that fox , ‘ Look , I’m throwing out demons and healing people today and tomorrow , and on the third day I will complete my work .
42013033	However , it’s necessary for me to travel today , tomorrow , and the next day because it’s impossible for a prophet to be killed outside of Jerusalem . ’
42013034	" Jerusalem , Jerusalem , you who kill the prophets and stone those who were sent to you ! How often I have wanted to gather your people just as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings . But you didn’t want that .
42013035	Look , your house is abandoned . I tell you , you won’t see me until the time comes when you say , Blessings on the one who comes in the Lord’s name . "
42014001	One Sabbath , when Jesus went to share a meal in the home of one of the leaders of the Pharisees , they were watching him closely .
42014002	A man suffering from an abnormal swelling of the body was there .
42014003	Jesus asked the lawyers and Pharisees , " Does the Law allow healing on the Sabbath or not ? "
42014004	But they said nothing . Jesus took hold of the sick man , cured him , and then let him go .
42014005	He said to them , " Suppose your child or ox fell into a ditch on the Sabbath day . Wouldn’t you immediately pull it out ? "
42014006	But they had no response .
42014007	When Jesus noticed how the guests sought out the best seats at the table , he told them a parable .
42014008	" When someone invites you to a wedding celebration , don’t take your seat in the place of honor . Someone more highly regarded than you could have been invited by your host .
42014009	The host who invited both of you will come and say to you , ‘ Give your seat to this other person . ’ Embarrassed , you will take your seat in the least important place .
42014010	Instead , when you receive an invitation , go and sit in the least important place . When your host approaches you , he will say , ‘ Friend , move up here to a better seat . ’ Then you will be honored in the presence of all your fellow guests .
42014011	All who lift themselves up will be brought low , and those who make themselves low will be lifted up . "
42014012	Then Jesus said to the person who had invited him , " When you host a lunch or dinner , don’t invite your friends , your brothers and sisters , your relatives , or rich neighbors . If you do , they will invite you in return and that will be your reward .
42014013	Instead , when you give a banquet , invite the poor , crippled , lame , and blind .
42014014	And you will be blessed because they can’t repay you . Instead , you will be repaid when the just are resurrected . "
42014015	When one of the dinner guests heard Jesus’ remarks , he said to Jesus , " Happy are those who will feast in God’s kingdom . "
42014016	Jesus replied , " A certain man hosted a large dinner and invited many people .
42014017	When it was time for the dinner to begin , he sent his servant to tell the invited guests , ‘ Come ! The dinner is now ready . ’
42014018	One by one , they all began to make excuses . The first one told him , ‘ I bought a farm and must go and see it . Please excuse me . ’
42014019	Another said , ‘ I bought five teams of oxen , and I’m going to check on them . Please excuse me . ’
42014020	Another said , ‘ I just got married , so I can’t come . ’
42014021	When he returned , the servant reported these excuses to his master . The master of the house became angry and said to his servant , ‘ Go quickly to the city’s streets , the busy ones and the side streets , and bring the poor , crippled , blind , and lame . ’
42014022	The servant said , ‘ Master , your instructions have been followed and there is still room . ’
42014023	The master said to the servant , ‘ Go to the highways and back alleys and urge people to come in so that my house will be filled .
42014024	I tell you , not one of those who were invited will taste my dinner . ’ "
42014025	Large crowds were traveling with Jesus . Turning to them , he said ,
42014026	“ Whoever comes to me and doesn’t hate father and mother , spouse and children , and brothers and sisters — yes , even one’s own life — cannot be my disciple .
42014027	Whoever doesn’t carry their own cross and follow me cannot be my disciple .
42014028	“ If one of you wanted to build a tower , wouldn’t you first sit down and calculate the cost , to determine whether you have enough money to complete it ?
42014029	Otherwise , when you have laid the foundation but couldn’t finish the tower , all who see it will begin to belittle you .
42014030	They will say , ‘ Here’s the person who began construction and couldn’t complete it ! ’
42014031	Or what king would go to war against another king without first sitting down to consider whether his ten thousand soldiers could go up against the twenty thousand coming against him ?
42014032	And if he didn’t think he could win , he would send a representative to discuss terms of peace while his enemy was still a long way off .
42014033	In the same way , none of you who are unwilling to give up all of your possessions can be my disciple .
42014034	" Salt is good . But if salt loses its flavor , how will it become salty again ?
42014035	It has no value , neither for the soil nor for the manure pile . People throw it away . Whoever has ears to hear should pay attention . "
42015001	All the tax collectors and sinners were gathering around Jesus to listen to him .
42015002	The Pharisees and legal experts were grumbling , saying , " This man welcomes sinners and eats with them . "
42015003	Jesus told them this parable :
42015004	“ Suppose someone among you had one hundred sheep and lost one of them . Wouldn’t he leave the other ninety-nine in the pasture and search for the lost one until he finds it ?
42015005	And when he finds it , he is thrilled and places it on his shoulders .
42015006	When he arrives home , he calls together his friends and neighbors , saying to them , ‘ Celebrate with me because I’ve found my lost sheep . ’
42015007	In the same way , I tell you , there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who changes both heart and life than over ninety-nine righteous people who have no need to change their hearts and lives .
42015008	" Or what woman , if she owns ten silver coins and loses one of them , won’t light a lamp and sweep the house , searching her home carefully until she finds it ?
42015009	When she finds it , she calls together her friends and neighbors , saying , ‘ Celebrate with me because I’ve found my lost coin . ’
42015010	In the same way , I tell you , joy breaks out in the presence of God’s angels over one sinner who changes both heart and life . "
42015011	Jesus said , “ A certain man had two sons .
42015012	The younger son said to his father , ‘ Father , give me my share of the inheritance . ’ Then the father divided his estate between them .
42015013	Soon afterward , the younger son gathered everything together and took a trip to a land far away . There , he wasted his wealth through extravagant living .
42015014	“ When he had used up his resources , a severe food shortage arose in that country and he began to be in need .
42015015	He hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country , who sent him into his fields to feed pigs .
42015016	He longed to eat his fill from what the pigs ate , but no one gave him anything .
42015017	When he came to his senses , he said , ‘ How many of my father’s hired hands have more than enough food , but I’m starving to death !
42015018	I will get up and go to my father , and say to him , " Father , I have sinned against heaven and against you .
42015019	I no longer deserve to be called your son . Take me on as one of your hired hands . " ’
42015020	So he got up and went to his father . “ While he was still a long way off , his father saw him and was moved with compassion . His father ran to him , hugged him , and kissed him .
42015021	Then his son said , ‘ Father , I have sinned against heaven and against you . I no longer deserve to be called your son . ’
42015022	But the father said to his servants , ‘ Quickly , bring out the best robe and put it on him ! Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet !
42015023	Fetch the fattened calf and slaughter it . We must celebrate with feasting
42015024	because this son of mine was dead and has come back to life ! He was lost and is found ! ’ And they began to celebrate .
42015025	" Now his older son was in the field . Coming in from the field , he approached the house and heard music and dancing .
42015026	He called one of the servants and asked what was going on .
42015027	The servant replied , ‘ Your brother has arrived , and your father has slaughtered the fattened calf because he received his son back safe and sound . ’
42015028	Then the older son was furious and didn’t want to enter in , but his father came out and begged him .
42015029	He answered his father , ‘ Look , I’ve served you all these years , and I never disobeyed your instruction . Yet you’ve never given me as much as a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends .
42015030	But when this son of yours returned , after gobbling up your estate on prostitutes , you slaughtered the fattened calf for him . ’
42015031	Then his father said , ‘ Son , you are always with me , and everything I have is yours .
42015032	But we had to celebrate and be glad because this brother of yours was dead and is alive . He was lost and is found . ’ "
42016001	Jesus also said to the disciples , “ A certain rich man heard that his household manager was wasting his estate .
42016002	He called the manager in and said to him , ‘ What is this I hear about you ? Give me a report of your administration because you can no longer serve as my manager . ’
42016003	“ The household manager said to himself , What will I do now that my master is firing me as his manager ? I’m not strong enough to dig and too proud to beg .
42016004	I know what I’ll do so that , when I am removed from my management position , people will welcome me into their houses .
42016005	“ One by one , the manager sent for each person who owed his master money . He said to the first , ‘ How much do you owe my master ? ’
42016006	He said , ‘ Nine hundred gallons of olive oil . ’ The manager said to him , ‘ Take your contract , sit down quickly , and write four hundred fifty gallons . ’
42016007	Then the manager said to another , ‘ How much do you owe ? ’ He said , ‘ One thousand bushels of wheat . ’ He said , ‘ Take your contract and write eight hundred . ’
42016008	“ The master commended the dishonest manager because he acted cleverly . People who belong to this world are more clever in dealing with their peers than are people who belong to the light .
42016009	I tell you , use worldly wealth to make friends for yourselves so that when it’s gone , you will be welcomed into the eternal homes .
42016010	" Whoever is faithful with little is also faithful with much , and the one who is dishonest with little is also dishonest with much .
42016011	If you haven’t been faithful with worldly wealth , who will trust you with true riches ?
42016012	If you haven’t been faithful with someone else’s property , who will give you your own ?
42016013	No household servant can serve two masters . Either you will hate the one and love the other , or you will be loyal to the one and have contempt for the other . You cannot serve God and wealth . "
42016014	The Pharisees , who were money-lovers , heard all this and sneered at Jesus .
42016015	He said to them , “ You are the ones who justify yourselves before other people , but God knows your hearts . What is highly valued by people is deeply offensive to God .
42016016	Until John , there was only the Law and the Prophets . Since then , the good news of God’s kingdom is preached , and everyone is urged to enter it .
42016017	It’s easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for the smallest stroke of a pen in the Law to drop out .
42016018	Any man who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery , and a man who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery .
42016019	“ There was a certain rich man who clothed himself in purple and fine linen , and who feasted luxuriously every day .
42016020	At his gate lay a certain poor man named Lazarus who was covered with sores .
42016021	Lazarus longed to eat the crumbs that fell from the rich man’s table . Instead , dogs would come and lick his sores .
42016022	“ The poor man died and was carried by angels to Abraham’s side . The rich man also died and was buried .
42016023	While being tormented in the place of the dead , he looked up and saw Abraham at a distance with Lazarus at his side .
42016024	He shouted , ‘ Father Abraham , have mercy on me . Send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue , because I’m suffering in this flame . ’
42016025	But Abraham said , ‘ Child , remember that during your lifetime you received good things , whereas Lazarus received terrible things . Now Lazarus is being comforted and you are in great pain .
42016026	Moreover , a great crevasse has been fixed between us and you . Those who wish to cross over from here to you cannot . Neither can anyone cross from there to us . ’
42016027	" The rich man said , ‘ Then I beg you , Father , send Lazarus to my father’s house .
42016028	I have five brothers . He needs to warn them so that they don’t come to this place of agony . ’
42016029	Abraham replied , ‘ They have Moses and the Prophets . They must listen to them . ’
42016030	The rich man said , ‘ No , Father Abraham ! But if someone from the dead goes to them , they will change their hearts and lives . ’
42016031	Abraham said , ‘ If they don’t listen to Moses and the Prophets , then neither will they be persuaded if someone rises from the dead . ’ "
42017001	Jesus said to his disciples , " Things that cause people to trip and fall into sin must happen , but how terrible it is for the person through whom they happen .
42017002	It would be better for them to be thrown into a lake with a large stone hung around their neck than to cause one of these little ones to trip and fall into sin .
42017003	Watch yourselves ! If your brother or sister sins , warn them to stop . If they change their hearts and lives , forgive them .
42017004	Even if someone sins against you seven times in one day and returns to you seven times and says , ‘ I am changing my ways , ’ you must forgive that person . "
42017005	The apostles said to the Lord , " Increase our faith ! "
42017006	The Lord replied , “ If you had faith the size of a mustard seed , you could say to this mulberry tree , ‘ Be uprooted and planted in the sea , ’ and it would obey you .
42017007	" Would any of you say to your servant , who had just come in from the field after plowing or tending sheep , ‘ Come ! Sit down for dinner ’ ?
42017008	Wouldn’t you say instead , ‘ Fix my dinner . Put on the clothes of a table servant and wait on me while I eat and drink . After that , you can eat and drink ’ ?
42017009	You won’t thank the servant because the servant did what you asked , will you ?
42017010	In the same way , when you have done everything required of you , you should say , ‘ We servants deserve no special praise . We have only done our duty . ’ "
42017011	On the way to Jerusalem , Jesus traveled along the border between Samaria and Galilee .
42017012	As he entered a village , ten men with skin diseases approached him . Keeping their distance from him ,
42017013	they raised their voices and said , " Jesus , Master , show us mercy ! "
42017014	When Jesus saw them , he said , " Go , show yourselves to the priests . " As they left , they were cleansed .
42017015	One of them , when he saw that he had been healed , returned and praised God with a loud voice .
42017016	He fell on his face at Jesus’ feet and thanked him . He was a Samaritan .
42017017	Jesus replied , " Weren’t ten cleansed ? Where are the other nine ?
42017018	No one returned to praise God except this foreigner ? "
42017019	Then Jesus said to him , " Get up and go . Your faith has healed you . "
42017020	Pharisees asked Jesus when God’s kingdom was coming . He replied , " God’s kingdom isn’t coming with signs that are easily noticed .
42017021	Nor will people say , ‘ Look , here it is ! ’ or ‘ There it is ! ’ Don’t you see ? God’s kingdom is already among you . "
42017022	Then Jesus said to the disciples , “ The time will come when you will long to see one of the days of the Human One , and you won’t see it .
42017023	People will say to you , ‘ Look there ! ’ or ‘ Look here ! ’ Don’t leave or go chasing after them .
42017024	The Human One will appear on his day in the same way that a flash of lightning lights up the sky from one end to the other .
42017025	However , first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation .
42017026	" As it was in the days of Noah , so it will be during the days of the Human One .
42017027	People were eating , drinking , marrying , and being given in marriage until the day Noah entered the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all .
42017028	Likewise in the days of Lot , people were eating , drinking , buying , selling , planting , and building .
42017029	But on the day Lot left Sodom , fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all .
42017030	That’s the way it will be on the day the Human One is revealed .
42017031	On that day , those on the roof , whose possessions are in the house , shouldn’t come down to grab them . Likewise , those in the field shouldn’t turn back .
42017032	Remember Lot’s wife !
42017033	Whoever tries to preserve their life will lose it , but whoever loses their life will preserve it .
42017034	I tell you , on that night two people will be in the same bed : one will be taken and the other left .
42017035	Two women will be grinding grain together : one will be taken and the other left . "
42017037	The disciples asked , " Where , Lord ? " Jesus said , " The vultures gather wherever there’s a dead body . "
42018001	Jesus was telling them a parable about their need to pray continuously and not to be discouraged .
42018002	He said , " In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor respected people .
42018003	In that city there was a widow who kept coming to him , asking , ‘ Give me justice in this case against my adversary . ’
42018004	For a while he refused but finally said to himself , I don’t fear God or respect people ,
42018005	but I will give this widow justice because she keeps bothering me . Otherwise , there will be no end to her coming here and embarrassing me . "
42018006	The Lord said , " Listen to what the unjust judge says .
42018007	Won’t God provide justice to his chosen people who cry out to him day and night ? Will he be slow to help them ?
42018008	I tell you , he will give them justice quickly . But when the Human One comes , will he find faithfulness on earth ? "
42018009	Jesus told this parable to certain people who had convinced themselves that they were righteous and who looked on everyone else with disgust :
42018010	" Two people went up to the temple to pray . One was a Pharisee and the other a tax collector .
42018011	The Pharisee stood and prayed about himself with these words , ‘ God , I thank you that I’m not like everyone else — crooks , evildoers , adulterers — or even like this tax collector .
42018012	I fast twice a week . I give a tenth of everything I receive . ’
42018013	But the tax collector stood at a distance . He wouldn’t even lift his eyes to look toward heaven . Rather , he struck his chest and said , ‘ God , show mercy to me , a sinner . ’
42018014	I tell you , this person went down to his home justified rather than the Pharisee . All who lift themselves up will be brought low , and those who make themselves low will be lifted up . "
42018015	People were bringing babies to Jesus so that he would bless them . When the disciples saw this , they scolded them .
42018016	Then Jesus called them to him and said , " Allow the children to come to me . Don’t forbid them , because God’s kingdom belongs to people like these children .
42018017	I assure you that whoever doesn’t welcome God’s kingdom like a child will never enter it . "
42018018	A certain ruler asked Jesus , " Good Teacher , what must I do to obtain eternal life ? "
42018019	Jesus replied , " Why do you call me good ? No one is good except the one God .
42018020	You know the commandments : Don’t commit adultery . Don’t murder . Don’t steal . Don’t give false testimony . Honor your father and mother . "
42018021	Then the ruler said , " I’ve kept all of these things since I was a boy . "
42018022	When Jesus heard this , he said , " There’s one more thing . Sell everything you own and distribute the money to the poor . Then you will have treasure in heaven . And come , follow me . "
42018023	When he heard these words , the man became sad because he was extremely rich .
42018024	When Jesus saw this , he said , " It’s very hard for the wealthy to enter God’s kingdom !
42018025	It’s easier for a camel to squeeze through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter God’s kingdom . "
42018026	Those who heard this said , " Then who can be saved ? "
42018027	Jesus replied , " What is impossible for humans is possible for God . "
42018028	Peter said , " Look , we left everything we own and followed you . "
42018029	Jesus said to them , " I assure you that anyone who has left house , husband , wife , brothers , sisters , parents , or children because of God’s kingdom
42018030	will receive many times more in this age and eternal life in the coming age . "
42018031	Jesus took the Twelve aside and said , " Look , we’re going up to Jerusalem , and everything written about the Human One by the prophets will be accomplished .
42018032	He will be handed over to the Gentiles . He will be ridiculed , mistreated , and spit on .
42018033	After torturing him , they will kill him . On the third day , he will rise up . "
42018034	But the Twelve understood none of these words . The meaning of this message was hidden from them and they didn’t grasp what he was saying .
42018035	As Jesus came to Jericho , a certain blind man was sitting beside the road begging .
42018036	When the man heard the crowd passing by , he asked what was happening .
42018037	They told him , " Jesus the Nazarene is passing by . "
42018038	The blind man shouted , " Jesus , Son of David , show me mercy . "
42018039	Those leading the procession scolded him , telling him to be quiet , but he shouted even louder , " Son of David , show me mercy . "
42018040	Jesus stopped and called for the man to be brought to him . When he was present Jesus asked ,
42018041	" What do you want me to do for you ? " He said , " Lord , I want to see . "
42018042	Jesus said to him , " Receive your sight ! Your faith has healed you . "
42018043	At once he was able to see , and he began to follow Jesus , praising God . When all the people saw it , they praised God too .
42019001	Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through town .
42019002	A man there named Zacchaeus , a ruler among tax collectors , was rich .
42019003	He was trying to see who Jesus was , but , being a short man , he couldn’t because of the crowd .
42019004	So he ran ahead and climbed up a sycamore tree so he could see Jesus , who was about to pass that way .
42019005	When Jesus came to that spot , he looked up and said , " Zacchaeus , come down at once . I must stay in your home today . "
42019006	So Zacchaeus came down at once , happy to welcome Jesus .
42019007	Everyone who saw this grumbled , saying , " He has gone to be the guest of a sinner . "
42019008	Zacchaeus stopped and said to the Lord , " Look , Lord , I give half of my possessions to the poor . And if I have cheated anyone , I repay them four times as much . "
42019009	Jesus said to him , " Today , salvation has come to this household because he too is a son of Abraham .
42019010	The Human One came to seek and save the lost . "
42019011	As they listened to this , Jesus told them another parable because he was near Jerusalem and they thought God’s kingdom would appear right away .
42019012	He said , “ A certain man who was born into royalty went to a distant land to receive his kingdom and then return .
42019013	He called together ten servants and gave each of them money worth four months’ wages . He said , ‘ Do business with this until I return . ’
42019014	His citizens hated him , so they sent a representative after him who said , ‘ We don’t want this man to be our king . ’
42019015	After receiving his kingdom , he returned and called the servants to whom he had given the money to find out how much they had earned .
42019016	The first servant came forward and said , ‘ Your money has earned a return of one thousand percent . ’
42019017	The king replied , ‘ Excellent ! You are a good servant . Because you have been faithful in a small matter , you will have authority over ten cities . ’
42019018	“ The second servant came and said , ‘ Master , your money has made a return of five hundred percent . ’
42019019	To this one , the king said , ‘ You will have authority over five cities . ’
42019020	“ Another servant came and said , ‘ Master , here is your money . I wrapped it up in a scarf for safekeeping .
42019021	I was afraid of you because you are a stern man . You withdraw what you haven’t deposited and you harvest what you haven’t planted . ’
42019022	The king replied , ‘ I will judge you by the words of your own mouth , you worthless servant ! You knew , did you , that I’m a stern man , withdrawing what I didn’t deposit , and harvesting what I didn’t plant ?
42019023	Why then didn’t you put my money in the bank ? Then when I arrived , at least I could have gotten it back with interest . ’
42019024	" He said to his attendants , ‘ Take his money and give it to the one who has ten times as much . ’
42019025	‘ But Master , ’ they said , ‘ he already has ten times as much ! ’
42019026	He replied , ‘ I say to you that everyone who has will be given more , but from those who have nothing , even what they have will be taken away .
42019027	As for my enemies who don’t want me as their king , bring them here and slaughter them before me . ’ "
42019028	After Jesus said this , he continued on ahead , going up to Jerusalem .
42019029	As Jesus came to Bethphage and Bethany on the Mount of Olives , he gave two disciples a task .
42019030	He said , " Go into the village over there . When you enter it , you will find tied up there a colt that no one has ever ridden . Untie it and bring it here .
42019031	If someone asks , ‘ Why are you untying it ? ’ just say , ‘ Its master needs it . ’ "
42019032	Those who had been sent found it exactly as he had said .
42019033	As they were untying the colt , its owners said to them , " Why are you untying the colt ? "
42019034	They replied , " Its master needs it . "
42019035	They brought it to Jesus , threw their clothes on the colt , and lifted Jesus onto it .
42019036	As Jesus rode along , they spread their clothes on the road .
42019037	As Jesus approached the road leading down from the Mount of Olives , the whole throng of his disciples began rejoicing . They praised God with a loud voice because of all the mighty things they had seen .
42019038	They said , " Blessings on the king who comes in the name of the Lord . Peace in heaven and glory in the highest heavens . "
42019039	Some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to Jesus , " Teacher , scold your disciples ! Tell them to stop ! "
42019040	He answered , " I tell you , if they were silent , the stones would shout . "
42019041	As Jesus came to the city and observed it , he wept over it .
42019042	He said , " If only you knew on this of all days the things that lead to peace . But now they are hidden from your eyes .
42019043	The time will come when your enemies will build fortifications around you , encircle you , and attack you from all sides .
42019044	They will crush you completely , you and the people within you . They won’t leave one stone on top of another within you , because you didn’t recognize the time of your gracious visit from God . "
42019045	When Jesus entered the temple , he threw out those who were selling things there .
42019046	He said to them , " It’s written , My house will be a house of prayer , but you have made it a hideout for crooks . "
42019047	Jesus was teaching daily in the temple . The chief priests , the legal experts , and the foremost leaders among the people were seeking to kill him .
42019048	However , they couldn’t find a way to do it because all the people were enthralled with what they heard .
42020001	On one of the days when Jesus was teaching the people in the temple and proclaiming the good news , the chief priests , legal experts , and elders approached him .
42020002	They said , " Tell us : What kind of authority do you have for doing these things ? Who gave you this authority ? "
42020003	He replied , " I have a question for you . Tell me :
42020004	Was John’s baptism of heavenly or of human origin ? "
42020005	They discussed among themselves , " If we say , ‘ It’s of heavenly origin , ’ he’ll say , ‘ Why didn’t you believe him ? ’
42020006	But if we say , ‘ It’s of human origin , ’ all the people will stone us to death because they are convinced that John was a prophet . "
42020007	They answered that they didn’t know where it came from .
42020008	Then Jesus replied , " Neither will I tell you what kind of authority I have to do these things . "
42020009	Jesus told the people this parable : " A certain man planted a vineyard , rented it to tenant farmers , and went on a trip for a long time .
42020010	When it was time , he sent a servant to collect from the tenants his share of the fruit of the vineyard . But the tenants sent him away , beaten and empty-handed .
42020011	The man sent another servant . But they beat him , treated him disgracefully , and sent him away empty-handed as well .
42020012	He sent a third servant . They wounded this servant and threw him out .
42020013	The owner of the vineyard said , ‘ What should I do ? I’ll send my son , whom I love dearly . Perhaps they will respect him . ’
42020014	But when they saw him , they said to each other , ‘ This is the heir . Let’s kill him so the inheritance will be ours . ’
42020015	They threw him out of the vineyard and killed him . What will the owner of the vineyard do to them ?
42020016	He will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others . " When the people heard this , they said , " May this never happen ! "
42020017	Staring at them , Jesus said , " Then what is the meaning of this text of scripture : The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone ?
42020018	Everyone who falls on that stone will be crushed . And the stone will crush the person it falls on . "
42020019	The legal experts and chief priests wanted to arrest him right then because they knew he had told this parable against them . But they feared the people .
42020020	The legal experts and chief priests were watching Jesus closely and sent spies who pretended to be sincere . They wanted to trap him in his words so they could hand him over to the jurisdiction and authority of the governor .
42020021	They asked him , " Teacher , we know that you are correct in what you say and teach . You don’t show favoritism but teach God’s way as it really is .
42020022	Does the Law allow people to pay taxes to Caesar or not ? "
42020023	Since Jesus recognized their deception , he said to them ,
42020024	" Show me a coin . Whose image and inscription does it have on it ? " " Caesar’s , " they replied .
42020025	He said to them , " Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar and to God what belongs to God . "
42020026	They couldn’t trap him in his words in front of the people . Astonished by his answer , they were speechless .
42020027	Some Sadducees , who deny that there’s a resurrection , came to Jesus and asked ,
42020028	" Teacher , Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies leaving a widow but no children , the brother must marry the widow and raise up children for his brother .
42020029	Now there were seven brothers . The first man married a woman and then died childless .
42020030	The second
42020031	and then the third brother married her . Eventually all seven married her , and they all died without leaving any children .
42020032	Finally , the woman died too .
42020033	In the resurrection , whose wife will she be ? All seven were married to her . "
42020034	Jesus said to them , " People who belong to this age marry and are given in marriage .
42020035	But those who are considered worthy to participate in that age , that is , in the age of the resurrection from the dead , won’t marry nor will they be given in marriage .
42020036	They can no longer die , because they are like angels and are God’s children since they share in the resurrection .
42020037	Even Moses demonstrated that the dead are raised — in the passage about the burning bush , when he speaks of the Lord as the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob .
42020038	He isn’t the God of the dead but of the living . To him they are all alive . "
42020039	Some of the legal experts responded , " Teacher , you have answered well . "
42020040	No one dared to ask him anything else .
42020041	Jesus said to them , " Why do they say that the Christ is David’s son ?
42020042	David himself says in the scroll of Psalms , The Lord said to my lord , ‘ Sit at my right side
42020043	until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet . ’
42020044	Since David calls him ‘ Lord , ’ how can he be David’s son ? "
42020045	In the presence of all the people , Jesus said to his disciples ,
42020046	" Watch out for the legal experts . They like to walk around in long robes . They love being greeted with honor in the markets . They long for the places of honor in the synagogues and at banquets .
42020047	They are the ones who cheat widows out of their homes , and to show off they say long prayers . They will be judged most harshly . "
42021001	Looking up , Jesus saw rich people throwing their gifts into the collection box for the temple treasury .
42021002	He also saw a poor widow throw in two small copper coins worth a penny .
42021003	He said , " I assure you that this poor widow has put in more than them all .
42021004	All of them are giving out of their spare change . But she from her hopeless poverty has given everything she had to live on . "
42021005	Some people were talking about the temple , how it was decorated with beautiful stones and ornaments dedicated to God . Jesus said ,
42021006	" As for the things you are admiring , the time is coming when not even one stone will be left upon another . All will be demolished . "
42021007	They asked him , " Teacher , when will these things happen ? What sign will show that these things are about to happen ? "
42021008	Jesus said , " Watch out that you aren’t deceived . Many will come in my name , saying , ‘ I’m the one ! ’ and ‘ It’s time ! ’ Don’t follow them .
42021009	When you hear of wars and rebellions , don’t be alarmed . These things must happen first , but the end won’t happen immediately . "
42021010	Then Jesus said to them , “ Nations and kingdoms will fight against each other .
42021011	There will be great earthquakes and wide-scale food shortages and epidemics . There will also be terrifying sights and great signs in the sky .
42021012	But before all this occurs , they will take you into custody and harass you because of your faith . They will hand you over to synagogues and prisons , and you will be brought before kings and governors because of my name .
42021013	This will provide you with an opportunity to testify .
42021014	Make up your minds not to prepare your defense in advance .
42021015	I’ll give you words and wisdom that none of your opponents will be able to counter or contradict .
42021016	You will be betrayed by your parents , brothers and sisters , relatives , and friends . They will execute some of you .
42021017	Everyone will hate you because of my name .
42021018	Still , not a hair on your heads will be lost .
42021019	By holding fast , you will gain your lives .
42021020	“ When you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies , then you will know that its destruction is close at hand .
42021021	At that time , those in Judea must flee to the mountains , those in the city must escape , and those in the countryside must not enter the city .
42021022	These are the days of punishment , when everything written will find its fulfillment .
42021023	How terrible it will be at that time for women who are pregnant or for women who are nursing their children . There will be great agony on the earth and angry judgment on this people .
42021024	They will fall by the edge of the sword and be taken away as captives among all nations . Jerusalem will be plundered by Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are concluded .
42021025	" There will be signs in the sun , moon , and stars . On the earth , there will be dismay among nations in their confusion over the roaring of the sea and surging waves .
42021026	The planets and other heavenly bodies will be shaken , causing people to faint from fear and foreboding of what is coming upon the world .
42021027	Then they will see the Human One coming on a cloud with power and great splendor .
42021028	Now when these things begin to happen , stand up straight and raise your heads , because your redemption is near . "
42021029	Jesus told them a parable : “ Look at the fig tree and all the trees .
42021030	When they sprout leaves , you can see for yourselves and know that summer is near .
42021031	In the same way , when you see these things happening , you know that God’s kingdom is near .
42021032	I assure you that this generation won’t pass away until everything has happened .
42021033	Heaven and earth will pass away , but my words will certainly not pass away .
42021034	" Take care that your hearts aren’t dulled by drinking parties , drunkenness , and the anxieties of day-to-day life . Don’t let that day fall upon you unexpectedly ,
42021035	like a trap . It will come upon everyone who lives on the face of the whole earth .
42021036	Stay alert at all times , praying that you are strong enough to escape everything that is about to happen and to stand before the Human One . "
42021037	Every day Jesus was teaching in the temple , but he spent each night on the Mount of Olives .
42021038	All the people rose early in the morning to hear him in the temple area .
42022001	The Festival of Unleavened Bread , which is called Passover , was approaching .
42022002	The chief priests and the legal experts were looking for a way to kill Jesus , because they were afraid of the people .
42022003	Then Satan entered Judas , called Iscariot , who was one of the Twelve .
42022004	He went out and discussed with the chief priests and the officers of the temple guard how he could hand Jesus over to them .
42022005	They were delighted and arranged payment for him .
42022006	He agreed and began looking for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them — a time when the crowds would be absent .
42022007	The Day of Unleavened Bread arrived , when the Passover had to be sacrificed .
42022008	Jesus sent Peter and John with this task : " Go and prepare for us to eat the Passover meal . "
42022009	They said to him , " Where do you want us to prepare it ? "
42022010	Jesus replied , " When you go into the city , a man carrying a water jar will meet you . Follow him to the house he enters .
42022011	Say to the owner of the house , ‘ The teacher says to you , " Where is the guestroom where I can eat the Passover meal with my disciples ? " ’
42022012	He will show you a large upstairs room , already furnished . Make preparations there . "
42022013	They went and found everything just as he had told them , and they prepared the Passover meal .
42022014	When the time came , Jesus took his place at the table , and the apostles joined him .
42022015	He said to them , " I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer .
42022016	I tell you , I won’t eat it until it is fulfilled in God’s kingdom . "
42022017	After taking a cup and giving thanks , he said , " Take this and share it among yourselves .
42022018	I tell you that from now on I won’t drink from the fruit of the vine until God’s kingdom has come . "
42022019	After taking the bread and giving thanks , he broke it and gave it to them , saying , " This is my body , which is given for you . Do this in remembrance of me . "
42022020	In the same way , he took the cup after the meal and said , “ This cup is the new covenant by my blood , which is poured out for you .
42022021	" But look ! My betrayer is with me ; his hand is on this table .
42022022	The Human One goes just as it has been determined . But how terrible it is for that person who betrays him . "
42022023	They began to argue among themselves about which of them it could possibly be who would do this .
42022024	An argument broke out among the disciples over which one of them should be regarded as the greatest .
42022025	But Jesus said to them , “ The kings of the Gentiles rule over their subjects , and those in authority over them are called ‘ friends of the people . ’
42022026	But that’s not the way it will be with you . Instead , the greatest among you must become like a person of lower status and the leader like a servant .
42022027	So which one is greater , the one who is seated at the table or the one who serves at the table ? Isn’t it the one who is seated at the table ? But I am among you as one who serves .
42022028	“ You are the ones who have continued with me in my trials .
42022029	And I confer royal power on you just as my Father granted royal power to me .
42022030	Thus you will eat and drink at my table in my kingdom , and you will sit on thrones overseeing the twelve tribes of Israel .
42022031	" Simon , Simon , look ! Satan has asserted the right to sift you all like wheat .
42022032	However , I have prayed for you that your faith won’t fail . When you have returned , strengthen your brothers and sisters . "
42022033	Peter responded , " Lord , I’m ready to go with you , both to prison and to death ! "
42022034	Jesus replied , " I tell you , Peter , the rooster won’t crow today before you have denied three times that you know me . "
42022035	Jesus said to them , " When I sent you out without a wallet , bag , or sandals , you didn’t lack anything , did you ? " They said , " Nothing . "
42022036	Then he said to them , " But now , whoever has a wallet must take it , and likewise a bag . And those who don’t own a sword must sell their clothes and buy one .
42022037	I tell you that this scripture must be fulfilled in relation to me : And he was counted among criminals . Indeed , what’s written about me is nearing completion . "
42022038	They said to him , " Lord , look , here are two swords . " He replied , " Enough of that ! "
42022039	Jesus left and made his way to the Mount of Olives , as was his custom , and the disciples followed him .
42022040	When he arrived , he said to them , " Pray that you won’t give in to temptation . "
42022041	He withdrew from them about a stone’s throw , knelt down , and prayed .
42022042	He said , " Father , if it’s your will , take this cup of suffering away from me . However , not my will but your will must be done . "
42022043	Then a heavenly angel appeared to him and strengthened him .
42022044	He was in anguish and prayed even more earnestly . His sweat became like drops of blood falling on the ground .
42022045	When he got up from praying , he went to the disciples . He found them asleep , overcome by grief .
42022046	He said to them , " Why are you sleeping ? Get up and pray so that you won’t give in to temptation . "
42022047	While Jesus was still speaking , a crowd appeared , and the one called Judas , one of the Twelve , was leading them . He approached Jesus to kiss him .
42022048	Jesus said to him , " Judas , would you betray the Human One with a kiss ? "
42022049	When those around him recognized what was about to happen , they said , " Lord , should we fight with our swords ? "
42022050	One of them struck the high priest’s servant , cutting off his right ear .
42022051	Jesus responded , " Stop ! No more of this ! " He touched the slave’s ear and healed him .
42022052	Then Jesus said to the chief priests , the officers of the temple guard , and the elders who had come to get him , " Have you come with swords and clubs to arrest me , as though I were a thief ?
42022053	Day after day I was with you in the temple , but you didn’t arrest me . But this is your time , when darkness rules . "
42022054	After they arrested Jesus , they led him away and brought him to the high priest’s house . Peter followed from a distance .
42022055	When they lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together , Peter sat among them .
42022056	Then a servant woman saw him sitting in the firelight . She stared at him and said , " This man was with him too . "
42022057	But Peter denied it , saying , " Woman , I don’t know him ! "
42022058	A little while later , someone else saw him and said , " You are one of them too . " But Peter said , " Man , I’m not ! "
42022059	An hour or so later , someone else insisted , " This man must have been with him , because he is a Galilean too . "
42022060	Peter responded , " Man , I don’t know what you are talking about ! " At that very moment , while he was still speaking , a rooster crowed .
42022061	The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter , and Peter remembered the Lord’s words : " Before a rooster crows today , you will deny me three times . "
42022062	And Peter went out and cried uncontrollably .
42022063	The men who were holding Jesus in custody taunted him while they beat him .
42022064	They blindfolded him and asked him repeatedly , " Prophesy ! Who hit you ? "
42022065	Insulting him , they said many other horrible things against him .
42022066	As morning came , the elders of the people , both chief priests and legal experts , came together , and Jesus was brought before their council .
42022067	They said , " If you are the Christ , tell us ! " He answered , " If I tell you , you won’t believe .
42022068	And if I ask you a question , you won’t answer .
42022069	But from now on , the Human One will be seated on the right side of the power of God . "
42022070	They all said , " Are you God’s Son , then ? " He replied , " You say that I am . "
42022071	Then they said , " Why do we need further testimony ? We’ve heard it from his own lips . "
42023001	The whole assembly got up and led Jesus to Pilate and
42023002	began to accuse him . They said , " We have found this man misleading our people , opposing the payment of taxes to Caesar , and claiming that he is the Christ , a king . "
42023003	Pilate asked him , " Are you the king of the Jews ? " Jesus replied , " That’s what you say . "
42023004	Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds , " I find no legal basis for action against this man . "
42023005	But they objected strenuously , saying , " He agitates the people with his teaching throughout Judea — starting from Galilee all the way here . "
42023006	Hearing this , Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean .
42023007	When he learned that Jesus was from Herod’s district , Pilate sent him to Herod , who was also in Jerusalem at that time .
42023008	Herod was very glad to see Jesus , for he had heard about Jesus and had wanted to see him for quite some time . He was hoping to see Jesus perform some sign .
42023009	Herod questioned Jesus at length , but Jesus didn’t respond to him .
42023010	The chief priests and the legal experts were there , fiercely accusing Jesus .
42023011	Herod and his soldiers treated Jesus with contempt . Herod mocked him by dressing Jesus in elegant clothes and sent him back to Pilate .
42023012	Pilate and Herod became friends with each other that day . Before this , they had been enemies .
42023013	Then Pilate called together the chief priests , the rulers , and the people .
42023014	He said to them , " You brought this man before me as one who was misleading the people . I have questioned him in your presence and found nothing in this man’s conduct that provides a legal basis for the charges you have brought against him .
42023015	Neither did Herod , because Herod returned him to us . He’s done nothing that deserves death .
42023016	Therefore , I’ll have him whipped , then let him go . "
42023018	But with one voice they shouted , " Away with this man ! Release Barabbas to us . " (
42023019	Barabbas had been thrown into prison because of a riot that had occurred in the city , and for murder . )
42023020	Pilate addressed them again because he wanted to release Jesus .
42023021	They kept shouting out , " Crucify him ! Crucify him ! "
42023022	For the third time , Pilate said to them , " Why ? What wrong has he done ? I’ve found no legal basis for the death penalty in his case . Therefore , I will have him whipped , then let him go . "
42023023	But they were adamant , shouting their demand that Jesus be crucified . Their voices won out .
42023024	Pilate issued his decision to grant their request .
42023025	He released the one they asked for , who had been thrown into prison because of a riot and murder . But he handed Jesus over to their will .
42023026	As they led Jesus away , they grabbed Simon , a man from Cyrene , who was coming in from the countryside . They put the cross on his back and made him carry it behind Jesus .
42023027	A huge crowd of people followed Jesus , including women , who were mourning and wailing for him .
42023028	Jesus turned to the women and said , " Daughters of Jerusalem , don’t cry for me . Rather , cry for yourselves and your children .
42023029	The time will come when they will say , ‘ Happy are those who are unable to become pregnant , the wombs that never gave birth , and the breasts that never nursed a child . ’
42023030	Then they will say to the mountains , ‘ Fall on us , ’ and to the hills , ‘ Cover us . ’
42023031	If they do these things when the tree is green , what will happen when it is dry ? "
42023032	They also led two other criminals to be executed with Jesus .
42023033	When they arrived at the place called The Skull , they crucified him , along with the criminals , one on his right and the other on his left .
42023034	Jesus said , " Father , forgive them , for they don’t know what they’re doing . " They drew lots as a way of dividing up his clothing .
42023035	The people were standing around watching , but the leaders sneered at him , saying , " He saved others . Let him save himself if he really is the Christ sent from God , the chosen one . "
42023036	The soldiers also mocked him . They came up to him , offering him sour wine
42023037	and saying , " If you really are the king of the Jews , save yourself . "
42023038	Above his head was a notice of the formal charge against him . It read " This is the king of the Jews . "
42023039	One of the criminals hanging next to Jesus insulted him : " Aren’t you the Christ ? Save yourself and us ! "
42023040	Responding , the other criminal spoke harshly to him , " Don’t you fear God , seeing that you’ve also been sentenced to die ?
42023041	We are rightly condemned , for we are receiving the appropriate sentence for what we did . But this man has done nothing wrong . "
42023042	Then he said , " Jesus , remember me when you come into your kingdom . "
42023043	Jesus replied , " I assure you that today you will be with me in paradise . "
42023044	It was now about noon , and darkness covered the whole earth until about three o’clock ,
42023045	while the sun stopped shining . Then the curtain in the sanctuary tore down the middle .
42023046	Crying out in a loud voice , Jesus said , " Father , into your hands I entrust my life . " After he said this , he breathed for the last time .
42023047	When the centurion saw what happened , he praised God , saying , " It’s really true : this man was righteous . "
42023048	All the crowds who had come together to see this event returned to their homes beating their chests after seeing what had happened .
42023049	And everyone who knew him , including the women who had followed him from Galilee , stood at a distance observing these things .
42023050	Now there was a man named Joseph who was a member of the council . He was a good and righteous man .
42023051	He hadn’t agreed with the plan and actions of the council . He was from the Jewish city of Arimathea and eagerly anticipated God’s kingdom .
42023052	This man went to Pilate and asked for Jesus’ body .
42023053	Taking it down , he wrapped it in a linen cloth and laid it in a tomb carved out of the rock , in which no one had ever been buried .
42023054	It was the Preparation Day for the Sabbath , and the Sabbath was quickly approaching .
42023055	The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed Joseph . They saw the tomb and how Jesus’ body was laid in it ,
42023056	then they went away and prepared fragrant spices and perfumed oils . They rested on the Sabbath , in keeping with the commandment .
42024001	Very early in the morning on the first day of the week , the women went to the tomb , bringing the fragrant spices they had prepared .
42024002	They found the stone rolled away from the tomb ,
42024003	but when they went in , they didn’t find the body of the Lord Jesus .
42024004	They didn’t know what to make of this . Suddenly , two men were standing beside them in gleaming bright clothing .
42024005	The women were frightened and bowed their faces toward the ground , but the men said to them , " Why do you look for the living among the dead ?
42024006	He isn’t here , but has been raised . Remember what he told you while he was still in Galilee ,
42024007	that the Human One must be handed over to sinners , be crucified , and on the third day rise again . "
42024008	Then they remembered his words .
42024009	When they returned from the tomb , they reported all these things to the eleven and all the others .
42024010	It was Mary Magdalene , Joanna , Mary the mother of James , and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles .
42024011	Their words struck the apostles as nonsense , and they didn’t believe the women .
42024012	But Peter ran to the tomb . When he bent over to look inside , he saw only the linen cloth . Then he returned home , wondering what had happened .
42024013	On that same day , two disciples were traveling to a village called Emmaus , about seven miles from Jerusalem .
42024014	They were talking to each other about everything that had happened .
42024015	While they were discussing these things , Jesus himself arrived and joined them on their journey .
42024016	They were prevented from recognizing him .
42024017	He said to them , " What are you talking about as you walk along ? " They stopped , their faces downcast .
42024018	The one named Cleopas replied , " Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who is unaware of the things that have taken place there over the last few days ? "
42024019	He said to them , " What things ? " They said to him , " The things about Jesus of Nazareth . Because of his powerful deeds and words , he was recognized by God and all the people as a prophet .
42024020	But our chief priests and our leaders handed him over to be sentenced to death , and they crucified him .
42024021	We had hoped he was the one who would redeem Israel . All these things happened three days ago .
42024022	But there’s more : Some women from our group have left us stunned . They went to the tomb early this morning
42024023	and didn’t find his body . They came to us saying that they had even seen a vision of angels who told them he is alive .
42024024	Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found things just as the women said . They didn’t see him . "
42024025	Then Jesus said to them , " You foolish people ! Your dull minds keep you from believing all that the prophets talked about .
42024026	Wasn’t it necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and then enter into his glory ? "
42024027	Then he interpreted for them the things written about himself in all the scriptures , starting with Moses and going through all the Prophets .
42024028	When they came to Emmaus , he acted as if he was going on ahead .
42024029	But they urged him , saying , " Stay with us . It’s nearly evening , and the day is almost over . " So he went in to stay with them .
42024030	After he took his seat at the table with them , he took the bread , blessed and broke it , and gave it to them .
42024031	Their eyes were opened and they recognized him , but he disappeared from their sight .
42024032	They said to each other , " Weren’t our hearts on fire when he spoke to us along the road and when he explained the scriptures for us ? "
42024033	They got up right then and returned to Jerusalem . They found the eleven and their companions gathered together .
42024034	They were saying to each other , " The Lord really has risen ! He appeared to Simon ! "
42024035	Then the two disciples described what had happened along the road and how Jesus was made known to them as he broke the bread .
42024036	While they were saying these things , Jesus himself stood among them and said , " Peace be with you ! "
42024037	They were terrified and afraid . They thought they were seeing a ghost .
42024038	He said to them , " Why are you startled ? Why are doubts arising in your hearts ?
42024039	Look at my hands and my feet . It’s really me ! Touch me and see , for a ghost doesn’t have flesh and bones like you see I have . "
42024040	As he said this , he showed them his hands and feet .
42024041	Because they were wondering and questioning in the midst of their happiness , he said to them , " Do you have anything to eat ? "
42024042	They gave him a piece of baked fish .
42024043	Taking it , he ate it in front of them .
42024044	Jesus said to them , " These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you — that everything written about me in the Law from Moses , the Prophets , and the Psalms must be fulfilled . "
42024045	Then he opened their minds to understand the scriptures .
42024046	He said to them , " This is what is written : the Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day ,
42024047	and a change of heart and life for the forgiveness of sins must be preached in his name to all nations , beginning from Jerusalem .
42024048	You are witnesses of these things .
42024049	Look , I’m sending to you what my Father promised , but you are to stay in the city until you have been furnished with heavenly power . "
42024050	He led them out as far as Bethany , where he lifted his hands and blessed them .
42024051	As he blessed them , he left them and was taken up to heaven .
42024052	They worshipped him and returned to Jerusalem overwhelmed with joy .
42024053	And they were continuously in the temple praising God .
43001001	In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God .
43001002	The Word was with God in the beginning .
43001003	Everything came into being through the Word , and without the Word nothing came into being . What came into being
43001004	through the Word was life , and the life was the light for all people .
43001005	The light shines in the darkness , and the darkness doesn’t extinguish the light .
43001006	A man named John was sent from God .
43001007	He came as a witness to testify concerning the light , so that through him everyone would believe in the light .
43001008	He himself wasn’t the light , but his mission was to testify concerning the light .
43001009	The true light that shines on all people was coming into the world .
43001010	The light was in the world , and the world came into being through the light ,
43001011	The light came to his own people , and his own people didn’t welcome him .
43001012	But those who did welcome him , he authorized to become God’s children ,
43001014	The Word became flesh and made his home among us . We have seen his glory , glory like that of a father’s only son ,
43001015	John testified about him , crying out , " This is the one of whom I said , ‘ He who comes after me is greater than me because he existed before me . ’ "
43001016	From his fullness we have all received grace upon grace ;
43001017	as the Law was given through Moses , so grace and truth came into being through Jesus Christ .
43001018	No one has ever seen God . God the only Son ,
43001019	This is John’s testimony when the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him , " Who are you ? "
43001020	John confessed ( he didn’t deny but confessed ) , " I’m not the Christ . "
43001021	They asked him , " Then who are you ? Are you Elijah ? " John said , " I’m not . " " Are you the prophet ? " John answered , " No . "
43001022	They asked , " Who are you ? We need to give an answer to those who sent us . What do you say about yourself ? "
43001023	John replied , " I am a voice crying out in the wilderness , Make the Lord’s path straight , just as the prophet Isaiah said . "
43001024	Those sent by the Pharisees
43001025	asked , " Why do you baptize if you aren’t the Christ , nor Elijah , nor the prophet ? "
43001026	John answered , " I baptize with water . Someone greater stands among you , whom you don’t recognize .
43001027	He comes after me , but I’m not worthy to untie his sandal straps . "
43001028	This encounter took place across the Jordan in Bethany where John was baptizing .
43001029	The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said , " Look ! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world !
43001030	This is the one about whom I said , ‘ He who comes after me is really greater than me because he existed before me . ’
43001031	Even I didn’t recognize him , but I came baptizing with water so that he might be made known to Israel . "
43001032	John testified , " I saw the Spirit coming down from heaven like a dove , and it rested on him .
43001033	Even I didn’t recognize him , but the one who sent me to baptize with water said to me , ‘ The one on whom you see the Spirit coming down and resting is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit . ’
43001034	I have seen and testified that this one is God’s Son . "
43001035	The next day John was standing again with two of his disciples .
43001036	When he saw Jesus walking along he said , " Look ! The Lamb of God ! "
43001037	The two disciples heard what he said , and they followed Jesus .
43001038	When Jesus turned and saw them following , he asked , " What are you looking for ? " They said , " Rabbi ( which is translated Teacher ) , where are you staying ? "
43001039	He replied , " Come and see . " So they went and saw where he was staying , and they remained with him that day . It was about four o’clock in the afternoon .
43001040	One of the two disciples who heard what John said and followed Jesus was Andrew , the brother of Simon Peter .
43001041	He first found his own brother Simon and said to him , " We have found the Messiah " ( which is translated Christ ) .
43001042	He led him to Jesus . Jesus looked at him and said , " You are Simon , son of John . You will be called Cephas " ( which is translated Peter ) .
43001043	The next day Jesus wanted to go into Galilee , and he found Philip . Jesus said to him , " Follow me . "
43001044	Philip was from Bethsaida , the hometown of Andrew and Peter .
43001045	Philip found Nathanael and said to him , " We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law and the Prophets : Jesus , Joseph’s son , from Nazareth . "
43001046	Nathanael responded , " Can anything from Nazareth be good ? " Philip said , " Come and see . "
43001047	Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said about him , " Here is a genuine Israelite in whom there is no deceit . "
43001048	Nathanael asked him , " How do you know me ? " Jesus answered , " Before Philip called you , I saw you under the fig tree . "
43001049	Nathanael replied , " Rabbi , you are God’s Son . You are the king of Israel . "
43001050	Jesus answered , " Do you believe because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree ? You will see greater things than these !
43001051	I assure you that you will see heaven open and God’s angels going up to heaven and down to earth on the Human One . "
43002001	On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee . Jesus’ mother was there , and
43002002	Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the celebration .
43002003	When the wine ran out , Jesus’ mother said to him , " They don’t have any wine . "
43002004	Jesus replied , " Woman , what does that have to do with me ? My time hasn’t come yet . "
43002005	His mother told the servants , " Do whatever he tells you . "
43002006	Nearby were six stone water jars used for the Jewish cleansing ritual , each able to hold about twenty or thirty gallons .
43002007	Jesus said to the servants , " Fill the jars with water , " and they filled them to the brim .
43002008	Then he told them , " Now draw some from them and take it to the headwaiter , " and they did .
43002009	The headwaiter tasted the water that had become wine . He didn’t know where it came from , though the servants who had drawn the water knew . The headwaiter called the groom
43002010	and said , " Everyone serves the good wine first . They bring out the second-rate wine only when the guests are drinking freely . You kept the good wine until now . "
43002011	This was the first miraculous sign that Jesus did in Cana of Galilee . He revealed his glory , and his disciples believed in him .
43002012	After this , Jesus and his mother , his brothers , and his disciples went down to Capernaum and stayed there for a few days .
43002013	It was nearly time for the Jewish Passover , and Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
43002014	He found in the temple those who were selling cattle , sheep , and doves , as well as those involved in exchanging currency sitting there .
43002015	He made a whip from ropes and chased them all out of the temple , including the cattle and the sheep . He scattered the coins and overturned the tables of those who exchanged currency .
43002016	He said to the dove sellers , " Get these things out of here ! Don’t make my Father’s house a place of business . "
43002017	His disciples remembered that it is written , Passion for your house consumes me .
43002018	Then the Jewish leaders asked him , " By what authority are you doing these things ? What miraculous sign will you show us ? "
43002019	Jesus answered , " Destroy this temple and in three days I’ll raise it up . "
43002020	The Jewish leaders replied , " It took forty-six years to build this temple , and you will raise it up in three days ? "
43002021	But the temple Jesus was talking about was his body .
43002022	After he was raised from the dead , his disciples remembered what he had said , and they believed the scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken .
43002023	While Jesus was in Jerusalem for the Passover Festival , many believed in his name because they saw the miraculous signs that he did .
43002024	But Jesus didn’t trust himself to them because he knew all people .
43002025	He didn’t need anyone to tell him about human nature , for he knew what human nature was .
43003001	There was a Pharisee named Nicodemus , a Jewish leader .
43003002	He came to Jesus at night and said to him , " Rabbi , we know that you are a teacher who has come from God , for no one could do these miraculous signs that you do unless God is with him . "
43003003	Jesus answered , " I assure you , unless someone is born anew , it’s not possible to see God’s kingdom . "
43003004	Nicodemus asked , " How is it possible for an adult to be born ? It’s impossible to enter the mother’s womb for a second time and be born , isn’t it ? "
43003005	Jesus answered , " I assure you , unless someone is born of water and the Spirit , it’s not possible to enter God’s kingdom .
43003006	Whatever is born of the flesh is flesh , and whatever is born of the Spirit is spirit .
43003007	Don’t be surprised that I said to you , ‘ You must be born anew . ’
43003008	God’s Spirit blows wherever it wishes . You hear its sound , but you don’t know where it comes from or where it is going . It’s the same with everyone who is born of the Spirit . "
43003009	Nicodemus said , " How are these things possible ? "
43003010	“ Jesus answered , “ You are a teacher of Israel and you don’t know these things ?
43003011	I assure you that we speak about what we know and testify about what we have seen , but you don’t receive our testimony .
43003012	If I have told you about earthly things and you don’t believe , how will you believe if I tell you about heavenly things ?
43003013	No one has gone up to heaven except the one who came down from heaven , the Human One .
43003014	Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness , so must the Human One be lifted up
43003015	so that everyone who believes in him will have eternal life .
43003016	God so loved the world that he gave his only Son , so that everyone who believes in him won’t perish but will have eternal life .
43003017	God didn’t send his Son into the world to judge the world , but that the world might be saved through him .
43003018	Whoever believes in him isn’t judged ; whoever doesn’t believe in him is already judged , because they don’t believe in the name of God’s only Son .
43003019	" This is the basis for judgment : The light came into the world , and people loved darkness more than the light , for their actions are evil .
43003020	All who do wicked things hate the light and don’t come to the light for fear that their actions will be exposed to the light .
43003021	Whoever does the truth comes to the light so that it can be seen that their actions were done in God . "
43003022	After this Jesus and his disciples went into Judea , where he spent some time with them and was baptizing .
43003023	John was baptizing at Aenon near Salem because there was a lot of water there , and people were coming to him and being baptized . (
43003024	John hadn’t yet been thrown into prison . )
43003025	A debate started between John’s disciples and a certain Jew about cleansing rituals .
43003026	They came to John and said , " Rabbi , look ! The man who was with you across the Jordan , the one about whom you testified , is baptizing and everyone is flocking to him . "
43003027	John replied , " No one can receive anything unless it is given from heaven .
43003028	You yourselves can testify that I said that I’m not the Christ but that I’m the one sent before him .
43003029	The groom is the one who is getting married . The friend of the groom stands close by and , when he hears him , is overjoyed at the groom’s voice . Therefore , my joy is now complete .
43003030	He must increase and I must decrease .
43003031	The one who comes from above is above all things . The one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks as one from the earth . The one who comes from heaven is above all things .
43003032	He testifies to what he has seen and heard , but no one accepts his testimony .
43003033	Whoever accepts his testimony confirms that God is true .
43003034	The one whom God sent speaks God’s words because God gives the Spirit generously .
43003035	The Father loves the Son and gives everything into his hands .
43003036	Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life . Whoever doesn’t believe in the Son won’t see life , but the angry judgment of God remains on them . "
43004001	Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard that he was making more disciples and baptizing more than John (
43004002	although Jesus’ disciples were baptizing , not Jesus himself ) .
43004003	Therefore , he left Judea and went back to Galilee .
43004004	Jesus had to go through Samaria .
43004005	He came to a Samaritan city called Sychar , which was near the land Jacob had given to his son Joseph .
43004006	Jacob’s well was there . Jesus was tired from his journey , so he sat down at the well . It was about noon .
43004007	A Samaritan woman came to the well to draw water . Jesus said to her , " Give me some water to drink . "
43004008	His disciples had gone into the city to buy him some food .
43004009	The Samaritan woman asked , " Why do you , a Jewish man , ask for something to drink from me , a Samaritan woman ? " ( Jews and Samaritans didn’t associate with each other . )
43004010	Jesus responded , " If you recognized God’s gift and who is saying to you , ‘ Give me some water to drink , ’ you would be asking him and he would give you living water . "
43004011	The woman said to him , " Sir , you don’t have a bucket and the well is deep . Where would you get this living water ?
43004012	You aren’t greater than our father Jacob , are you ? He gave this well to us , and he drank from it himself , as did his sons and his livestock . "
43004013	Jesus answered , " Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again ,
43004014	but whoever drinks from the water that I will give will never be thirsty again . The water that I give will become in those who drink it a spring of water that bubbles up into eternal life . "
43004015	The woman said to him , " Sir , give me this water , so that I will never be thirsty and will never need to come here to draw water ! "
43004016	Jesus said to her , " Go , get your husband , and come back here . "
43004017	The woman replied , " I don’t have a husband . " " You are right to say , ‘ I don’t have a husband , ’ " Jesus answered .
43004018	" You’ve had five husbands , and the man you are with now isn’t your husband . You’ve spoken the truth . "
43004019	The woman said , " Sir , I see that you are a prophet .
43004020	Our ancestors worshipped on this mountain , but you and your people say that it is necessary to worship in Jerusalem . "
43004021	Jesus said to her , " Believe me , woman , the time is coming when you and your people will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem .
43004022	You and your people worship what you don’t know ; we worship what we know because salvation is from the Jews .
43004023	But the time is coming — and is here ! — when true worshippers will worship in spirit and truth . The Father looks for those who worship him this way .
43004024	God is spirit , and it is necessary to worship God in spirit and truth . "
43004025	The woman said , " I know that the Messiah is coming , the one who is called the Christ . When he comes , he will teach everything to us . "
43004026	Jesus said to her , " I Am — the one who speaks with you . "
43004027	Just then , Jesus’ disciples arrived and were shocked that he was talking with a woman . But no one asked , " What do you want ? " or " Why are you talking with her ? "
43004028	The woman put down her water jar and went into the city . She said to the people ,
43004029	" Come and see a man who has told me everything I’ve done ! Could this man be the Christ ? "
43004030	They left the city and were on their way to see Jesus .
43004031	In the meantime the disciples spoke to Jesus , saying , " Rabbi , eat . "
43004032	Jesus said to them , " I have food to eat that you don’t know about . "
43004033	The disciples asked each other , " Has someone brought him food ? "
43004034	Jesus said to them , " I am fed by doing the will of the one who sent me and by completing his work .
43004035	Don’t you have a saying , ‘ Four more months and then it’s time for harvest ’ ? Look , I tell you : open your eyes and notice that the fields are already ripe for the harvest .
43004036	Those who harvest are receiving their pay and gathering fruit for eternal life so that those who sow and those who harvest can celebrate together .
43004037	This is a true saying , that one sows and another harvests .
43004038	I have sent you to harvest what you didn’t work hard for ; others worked hard , and you will share in their hard work . "
43004039	Many Samaritans in that city believed in Jesus because of the woman’s word when she testified , " He told me everything I’ve ever done . "
43004040	So when the Samaritans came to Jesus , they asked him to stay with them , and he stayed there two days .
43004041	Many more believed because of his word ,
43004042	and they said to the woman , " We no longer believe because of what you said , for we have heard for ourselves and know that this one is truly the savior of the world . "
43004043	After two days Jesus left for Galilee . (
43004044	Jesus himself had testified that prophets have no honor in their own country . )
43004045	When he came to Galilee , the Galileans welcomed him because they had seen all the things he had done in Jerusalem during the festival , for they also had been at the festival .
43004046	He returned to Cana in Galilee where he had turned the water into wine . In Capernaum there was a certain royal official whose son was sick .
43004047	When he heard that Jesus was coming from Judea to Galilee , he went out to meet him and asked Jesus if he would come and heal his son , for his son was about to die .
43004048	Jesus said to him , " Unless you see miraculous signs and wonders , you won’t believe . "
43004049	The royal official said to him , " Lord , come before my son dies . "
43004050	Jesus replied , " Go home . Your son lives . " The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and set out for his home .
43004051	While he was on his way , his servants were already coming to meet him . They said , " Your son lives ! "
43004052	So he asked them at what time his son had started to get better . And they said , " The fever left him yesterday at about one o’clock in the afternoon . "
43004053	Then the father realized that this was the hour when Jesus had said to him , " Your son lives . " And he and his entire household believed in Jesus .
43004054	This was the second miraculous sign Jesus did while going from Judea to Galilee .
43005001	After this there was a Jewish festival , and Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
43005002	In Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate in the north city wall is a pool with the Aramaic name Bethsaida . It had five covered porches ,
43005003	and a crowd of people who were sick , blind , lame , and paralyzed sat there .
43005005	A certain man was there who had been sick for thirty-eight years .
43005006	When Jesus saw him lying there , knowing that he had already been there a long time , he asked him , " Do you want to get well ? "
43005007	The sick man answered him , " Sir , I don’t have anyone who can put me in the water when it is stirred up . When I’m trying to get to it , someone else has gotten in ahead of me . "
43005008	Jesus said to him , " Get up ! Pick up your mat and walk . "
43005009	Immediately the man was well , and he picked up his mat and walked . Now that day was the Sabbath .
43005010	The Jewish leaders said to the man who had been healed , " It’s the Sabbath ; you aren’t allowed to carry your mat . "
43005011	He answered , " The man who made me well said to me , ‘ Pick up your mat and walk . ’ "
43005012	They inquired , " Who is this man who said to you , ‘ Pick it up and walk ’ ? "
43005013	The man who had been cured didn’t know who it was , because Jesus had slipped away from the crowd gathered there .
43005014	Later Jesus found him in the temple and said , " See ! You have been made well . Don’t sin anymore in case something worse happens to you . "
43005015	The man went and proclaimed to the Jewish leaders that Jesus was the man who had made him well .
43005016	As a result , the Jewish leaders were harassing Jesus , since he had done these things on the Sabbath .
43005017	Jesus replied , " My Father is still working , and I am working too . "
43005018	For this reason the Jewish leaders wanted even more to kill him — not only because he was doing away with the Sabbath but also because he called God his own Father , thereby making himself equal with God .
43005019	Jesus responded to the Jewish leaders , “ I assure you that the Son can’t do anything by himself except what he sees the Father doing . Whatever the Father does , the Son does likewise .
43005020	The Father loves the Son and shows him everything that he does . He will show him greater works than these so that you will marvel .
43005021	As the Father raises the dead and gives life , so too does the Son give life to whomever he wishes .
43005022	The Father doesn’t judge anyone , but he has given all judgment to the Son
43005023	so that everyone will honor the Son just as they honor the Father . Whoever doesn’t honor the Son doesn’t honor the Father who sent him .
43005024	“ I assure you that whoever hears my word and believes in the one who sent me has eternal life and won’t come under judgment but has passed from death into life .
43005025	“ I assure you that the time is coming — and is here ! — when the dead will hear the voice of God’s Son , and those who hear it will live .
43005026	Just as the Father has life in himself , so he has granted the Son to have life in himself .
43005027	He gives the Son authority to judge , because he is the Human One .
43005028	Don’t be surprised by this , because the time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice .
43005029	Those who did good things will come out into the resurrection of life , and those who did wicked things into the resurrection of judgment .
43005030	I can’t do anything by myself . Whatever I hear , I judge , and my judgment is just . I don’t seek my own will but the will of the one who sent me .
43005031	“ If I testify about myself , my testimony isn’t true .
43005032	There is someone else who testifies about me , and I know his testimony about me is true .
43005033	You sent a delegation to John , and he testified to the truth .
43005034	Although I don’t accept human testimony , I say these things so that you can be saved .
43005035	John was a burning and shining lamp , and , at least for a while , you were willing to celebrate in his light .
43005036	“ I have a witness greater than John’s testimony . The Father has given me works to do so that I might complete them . These works I do testify about me that the Father sent me .
43005037	And the Father who sent me testifies about me . You have never even heard his voice or seen his form ,
43005038	and you don’t have his word dwelling with you because you don’t believe the one whom he has sent .
43005039	Examine the scriptures , since you think that in them you have eternal life . They also testify about me ,
43005040	yet you don’t want to come to me so that you can have life .
43005041	“ I don’t accept praise from people ,
43005042	but I know you , that you don’t have God’s love in you .
43005043	I have come in my Father’s name , and you don’t receive me . If others come in their own name , you receive them .
43005044	How can you believe when you receive praise from each other but don’t seek the praise that comes from the only God ?
43005045	" Don’t think that I will accuse you before the Father . Your accuser is Moses , the one in whom your hope rests .
43005046	If you believed Moses , you would believe me , because Moses wrote about me .
43005047	If you don’t believe the writings of Moses , how will you believe my words ? "
43006001	After this Jesus went across the Galilee Sea ( that is , the Tiberius Sea ) .
43006002	A large crowd followed him , because they had seen the miraculous signs he had done among the sick .
43006003	Jesus went up a mountain and sat there with his disciples .
43006004	It was nearly time for Passover , the Jewish festival .
43006005	Jesus looked up and saw the large crowd coming toward him . He asked Philip , " Where will we buy food to feed these people ? "
43006006	Jesus said this to test him , for he already knew what he was going to do .
43006007	Philip replied , " More than a half year’s salary worth of food wouldn’t be enough for each person to have even a little bit . "
43006008	One of his disciples , Andrew , Simon Peter’s brother , said ,
43006009	" A youth here has five barley loaves and two fish . But what good is that for a crowd like this ? "
43006010	Jesus said , " Have the people sit down . " There was plenty of grass there . They sat down , about five thousand of them .
43006011	Then Jesus took the bread . When he had given thanks , he distributed it to those who were sitting there . He did the same with the fish , each getting as much as they wanted .
43006012	When they had plenty to eat , he said to his disciples , " Gather up the leftover pieces , so that nothing will be wasted . "
43006013	So they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves that had been left over by those who had eaten .
43006014	When the people saw that he had done a miraculous sign , they said , " This is truly the prophet who is coming into the world . "
43006015	Jesus understood that they were about to come and force him to be their king , so he took refuge again , alone on a mountain .
43006016	When evening came , Jesus’ disciples went down to the lake .
43006017	They got into a boat and were crossing the lake to Capernaum . It was already getting dark and Jesus hadn’t come to them yet .
43006018	The water was getting rough because a strong wind was blowing .
43006019	When the wind had driven them out for about three or four miles , they saw Jesus walking on the water . He was approaching the boat and they were afraid .
43006020	He said to them , " I Am . Don’t be afraid . "
43006021	Then they wanted to take him into the boat , and just then the boat reached the land where they had been heading .
43006022	The next day the crowd that remained on the other side of the lake realized that only one boat had been there . They knew Jesus hadn’t gone with his disciples , but that the disciples had gone alone .
43006023	Some boats came from Tiberius , near the place where they had eaten the bread over which the Lord had given thanks .
43006024	When the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there , they got into the boats and came to Capernaum looking for Jesus .
43006025	When they found him on the other side of the lake , they asked him , " Rabbi , when did you get here ? "
43006026	Jesus replied , " I assure you that you are looking for me not because you saw miraculous signs but because you ate all the food you wanted .
43006027	Don’t work for the food that doesn’t last but for the food that endures for eternal life , which the Human One will give you . God the Father has confirmed him as his agent to give life . "
43006028	They asked , " What must we do in order to accomplish what God requires ? "
43006029	Jesus replied , " This is what God requires , that you believe in him whom God sent . "
43006030	They asked , " What miraculous sign will you do , that we can see and believe you ? What will you do ?
43006031	Our ancestors ate manna in the wilderness , just as it is written , He gave them bread from heaven to eat . "
43006032	Jesus told them , " I assure you , it wasn’t Moses who gave the bread from heaven to you , but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven .
43006033	The bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world . "
43006034	They said , " Sir , give us this bread all the time ! "
43006035	Jesus replied , " I am the bread of life . Whoever comes to me will never go hungry , and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty .
43006036	But I told you that you have seen me and still don’t believe .
43006037	Everyone whom the Father gives to me will come to me , and I won’t send away anyone who comes to me .
43006038	I have come down from heaven not to do my will , but the will of him who sent me .
43006039	This is the will of the one who sent me , that I won’t lose anything he has given me , but I will raise it up at the last day .
43006040	This is my Father’s will : that all who see the Son and believe in him will have eternal life , and I will raise them up at the last day . "
43006041	The Jewish opposition grumbled about him because he said , " I am the bread that came down from heaven . "
43006042	They asked , " Isn’t this Jesus , Joseph’s son , whose mother and father we know ? How can he now say , ‘ I have come down from heaven ’ ? "
43006043	Jesus responded , " Don’t grumble among yourselves .
43006044	No one can come to me unless they are drawn to me by the Father who sent me , and I will raise them up at the last day .
43006045	It is written in the Prophets , And they will all be taught by God . Everyone who has listened to the Father and learned from him comes to me .
43006046	No one has seen the Father except the one who is from God . He has seen the Father .
43006047	I assure you , whoever believes has eternal life .
43006048	I am the bread of life .
43006049	Your ancestors ate manna in the wilderness and they died .
43006050	This is the bread that comes down from heaven so that whoever eats from it will never die .
43006051	I am the living bread that came down from heaven . Whoever eats this bread will live forever , and the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh . "
43006052	Then the Jews debated among themselves , asking , " How can this man give us his flesh to eat ? "
43006053	Jesus said to them , " I assure you , unless you eat the flesh of the Human One and drink his blood , you have no life in you .
43006054	Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life , and I will raise them up at the last day .
43006055	My flesh is true food and my blood is true drink .
43006056	Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me and I in them .
43006057	As the living Father sent me , and I live because of the Father , so whoever eats me lives because of me .
43006058	This is the bread that came down from heaven . It isn’t like the bread your ancestors ate , and then they died . Whoever eats this bread will live forever . "
43006059	Jesus said these things while he was teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum .
43006060	Many of his disciples who heard this said , " This message is harsh . Who can hear it ? "
43006061	Jesus knew that the disciples were grumbling about this and he said to them , " Does this offend you ?
43006062	What if you were to see the Human One going up where he was before ?
43006063	The Spirit is the one who gives life and the flesh doesn’t help at all . The words I have spoken to you are spirit and life .
43006064	Yet some of you don’t believe . " Jesus knew from the beginning who wouldn’t believe and the one who would betray him .
43006065	He said , " For this reason I said to you that none can come to me unless the Father enables them to do so . "
43006066	At this , many of his disciples turned away and no longer accompanied him .
43006067	Jesus asked the Twelve , " Do you also want to leave ? "
43006068	Simon Peter answered , " Lord , where would we go ? You have the words of eternal life .
43006069	We believe and know that you are God’s holy one . "
43006070	Jesus replied , " Didn’t I choose you twelve ? Yet one of you is a devil . "
43006071	He was speaking of Judas , Simon Iscariot’s son , for he , one of the Twelve , was going to betray him .
43007001	After this Jesus traveled throughout Galilee . He didn’t want to travel in Judea , because the Jewish authorities wanted to kill him .
43007002	When it was almost time for the Jewish Festival of Booths ,
43007003	Jesus’ brothers said to him , " Leave Galilee . Go to Judea so that your disciples can see the amazing works that you do .
43007004	Those who want to be known publicly don’t do things secretly . Since you can do these things , show yourself to the world . "
43007005	His brothers said this because even they didn’t believe in him .
43007006	Jesus replied , " For you , anytime is fine . But my time hasn’t come yet .
43007007	The world can’t hate you . It hates me , though , because I testify that its works are evil .
43007008	You go up to the festival . I’m not going to this one because my time hasn’t yet come . "
43007009	Having said this , he stayed in Galilee .
43007010	However , after his brothers left for the festival , he went too — not openly but in secret .
43007011	The Jewish leaders were looking for Jesus at the festival . They kept asking , " Where is he ? "
43007012	The crowds were murmuring about him . " He’s a good man , " some said , but others were saying , " No , he tricks the people . "
43007013	No one spoke about him publicly , though , for fear of the Jewish authorities .
43007014	Halfway through the festival , Jesus went up to the temple and started to teach .
43007015	Astonished , the Jewish leaders asked , " He’s never been taught ! How has he mastered the Law ? "
43007016	Jesus responded , " My teaching isn’t mine but comes from the one who sent me .
43007017	Whoever wants to do God’s will can tell whether my teaching is from God or whether I speak on my own .
43007018	Those who speak on their own seek glory for themselves . Those who seek the glory of him who sent me are people of truth ; there’s no falsehood in them .
43007019	Didn’t Moses give you the Law ? Yet none of you keep the Law . Why do you want to kill me ? "
43007020	The crowd answered , " You have a demon . Who wants to kill you ? "
43007021	Jesus replied , " I did one work , and you were all astonished .
43007022	Because Moses gave you the commandment about circumcision ( although it wasn’t Moses but the patriarchs ) , you circumcise a man on the Sabbath .
43007023	If a man can be circumcised on the Sabbath without breaking Moses’ Law , why are you angry with me because I made an entire man well on the Sabbath ?
43007024	Don’t judge according to appearances . Judge with right judgment . "
43007025	Some people from Jerusalem said , " Isn’t he the one they want to kill ?
43007026	Here he is , speaking in public , yet they aren’t saying anything to him . Could it be that our leaders actually think he is the Christ ?
43007027	We know where he is from , but when the Christ comes , no one will know where he is from . "
43007028	While Jesus was teaching in the temple , he exclaimed , " You know me and where I am from . I haven’t come on my own . The one who sent me is true , and you don’t know him .
43007029	I know him because I am from him and he sent me . "
43007030	So they wanted to seize Jesus , but they couldn’t because his time hadn’t yet come .
43007031	Many from that crowd believed in Jesus . They said , " When the Christ comes , will he do more miraculous signs than this man does ? "
43007032	The Pharisees heard the crowd whispering such things about Jesus , and the chief priests and Pharisees sent guards to arrest him .
43007033	Therefore , Jesus said , " I’m still with you for a little while before I go to the one who sent me .
43007034	You will look for me , but you won’t find me , and where I am you can’t come . "
43007035	The Jewish opposition asked each other , " Where does he intend to go that we can’t find him ? Surely he doesn’t intend to go where our people have been scattered and are living among the Greeks ! He isn’t going to teach the Greeks , is he ?
43007036	What does he mean when he says , ‘ You will look for me , but you won’t find me , and where I am you can’t come ’ ? "
43007037	On the last and most important day of the festival , Jesus stood up and shouted , " All who are thirsty should come to me !
43007038	All who believe in me should drink ! As the scriptures said concerning me ,
43007039	Jesus said this concerning the Spirit . Those who believed in him would soon receive the Spirit , but they hadn’t experienced the Spirit yet since Jesus hadn’t yet been glorified .
43007040	When some in the crowd heard these words , they said , " This man is truly the prophet . "
43007041	Others said , " He’s the Christ . " But others said , " The Christ can’t come from Galilee , can he ?
43007042	Didn’t the scripture say that the Christ comes from David’s family and from Bethlehem , David’s village ? "
43007043	So the crowd was divided over Jesus .
43007044	Some wanted to arrest him , but no one grabbed him .
43007045	The guards returned to the chief priests and Pharisees , who asked , " Why didn’t you bring him ? "
43007046	The guards answered , " No one has ever spoken the way he does . "
43007047	The Pharisees replied , " Have you too been deceived ?
43007048	Have any of the leaders believed in him ? Has any Pharisee ?
43007049	No , only this crowd , which doesn’t know the Law . And they are under God’s curse ! "
43007050	Nicodemus , who was one of them and had come to Jesus earlier , said ,
43007051	" Our Law doesn’t judge someone without first hearing him and learning what he is doing , does it ? "
43007052	They answered him , " You are not from Galilee too , are you ? Look it up and you will see that the prophet doesn’t come from Galilee . "
43007053	They each went to their own homes ,
43008001	And Jesus went to the Mount of Olives .
43008002	Early in the morning he returned to the temple . All the people gathered around him , and he sat down and taught them .
43008003	The legal experts and Pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery . Placing her in the center of the group ,
43008004	they said to Jesus , " Teacher , this woman was caught in the act of committing adultery .
43008005	In the Law , Moses commanded us to stone women like this . What do you say ? "
43008006	They said this to test him , because they wanted a reason to bring an accusation against him . Jesus bent down and wrote on the ground with his finger .
43008007	They continued to question him , so he stood up and replied , " Whoever hasn’t sinned should throw the first stone . "
43008008	Bending down again , he wrote on the ground .
43008009	Those who heard him went away , one by one , beginning with the elders . Finally , only Jesus and the woman were left in the middle of the crowd .
43008010	Jesus stood up and said to her , " Woman , where are they ? Is there no one to condemn you ? "
43008011	She said , " No one , sir . " Jesus said , " Neither do I condemn you . Go , and from now on , don’t sin anymore . "
43008012	Jesus spoke to the people again , saying , " I am the light of the world . Whoever follows me won’t walk in darkness but will have the light of life . "
43008013	Then the Pharisees said to him , " Because you are testifying about yourself , your testimony isn’t valid . "
43008014	Jesus replied , " Even if I testify about myself , my testimony is true , since I know where I came from and where I’m going . You don’t know where I come from or where I’m going .
43008015	You judge according to human standards , but I judge no one .
43008016	Even if I do judge , my judgment is truthful , because I’m not alone . My judgments come from me and from the Father who sent me .
43008017	In your Law it is written that the witness of two people is true .
43008018	I am one witness concerning myself , and the Father who sent me is the other . "
43008019	They asked him , " Where is your Father ? " Jesus answered , " You don’t know me and you don’t know my Father . If you knew me , you would also know my Father . "
43008020	He spoke these words while he was teaching in the temple area known as the treasury . No one arrested him , because his time hadn’t yet come .
43008021	Jesus continued , " I’m going away . You will look for me , and you will die in your sin . Where I’m going , you can’t come . "
43008022	The Jewish leaders said , " He isn’t going to kill himself , is he ? Is that why he said , ‘ Where I’m going , you can’t come ’ ? "
43008023	He said to them , " You are from below ; I’m from above . You are from this world ; I’m not from this world .
43008024	This is why I told you that you would die in your sins . If you don’t believe that I Am , you will die in your sins . "
43008025	" Who are you ? " they asked . Jesus replied , " I’m exactly who I have claimed to be from the beginning .
43008026	I have many things to say in judgment concerning you . The one who sent me is true , and what I have heard from him I tell the world . "
43008027	They didn’t know he was speaking about his Father .
43008028	So Jesus said to them , " When the Human One is lifted up , then you will know that I Am . Then you will know that I do nothing on my own , but I say just what the Father has taught me .
43008029	He who sent me is with me . He doesn’t leave me by myself , because I always do what makes him happy . "
43008030	While Jesus was saying these things , many people came to believe in him .
43008031	Jesus said to the Jews who believed in him , " You are truly my disciples if you remain faithful to my teaching .
43008032	Then you will know the truth , and the truth will set you free . "
43008033	They responded , " We are Abraham’s children ; we’ve never been anyone’s slaves . How can you say that we will be set free ? "
43008034	Jesus answered , " I assure you that everyone who sins is a slave to sin .
43008035	A slave isn’t a permanent member of the household , but a son is .
43008036	Therefore , if the Son makes you free , you really will be free .
43008037	I know that you are Abraham’s children , yet you want to kill me because you don’t welcome my teaching .
43008038	I’m telling you what I’ve seen when I am with the Father , but you are doing what you’ve heard from your father . "
43008039	They replied , " Our father is Abraham . " Jesus responded , " If you were Abraham’s children , you would do Abraham’s works .
43008040	Instead , you want to kill me , though I am the one who has spoken the truth I heard from God . Abraham didn’t do this .
43008041	You are doing your father’s works . " They said , " Our ancestry isn’t in question ! The only Father we have is God ! "
43008042	Jesus replied , " If God were your Father , you would love me , for I came from God . Here I am . I haven’t come on my own . God sent me .
43008043	Why don’t you understand what I’m saying ? It’s because you can’t really hear my words .
43008044	Your father is the devil . You are his children , and you want to do what your father wants . He was a murderer from the beginning . He has never stood for the truth , because there’s no truth in him . Whenever that liar speaks , he speaks according to his own nature , because he’s a liar and the father of liars .
43008045	Because I speak the truth , you don’t believe me .
43008046	Who among you can show I’m guilty of sin ? Since I speak the truth , why don’t you believe me ?
43008047	God’s children listen to God’s words . You don’t listen to me because you aren’t God’s children . "
43008048	The Jewish opposition answered , " We were right to say that you are a Samaritan and have a demon , weren’t we ? "
43008049	" I don’t have a demon , " Jesus replied . " But I honor my Father and you dishonor me .
43008050	I’m not trying to bring glory to myself . There’s one who is seeking to glorify me , and he’s the judge .
43008051	I assure you that whoever keeps my word will never die . "
43008052	The Jewish opposition said to Jesus , " Now we know that you have a demon . Abraham and the prophets died , yet you say , ‘ Whoever keeps my word will never die . ’
43008053	Are you greater than our father Abraham ? He died and the prophets died , so who do you make yourself out to be ? "
43008054	Jesus answered , " If I glorify myself , my glory is meaningless . My Father , who you say is your God , is the one who glorifies me .
43008055	You don’t know him , but I do . If I said I didn’t know him , I would be like you , a liar . But I do know him , and I keep his word .
43008056	Your father Abraham was overjoyed that he would see my day . He saw it and was happy . "
43008057	" You aren’t even 50 years old ! " the Jewish opposition replied . " How can you say that you have seen Abraham ? "
43008058	" I assure you , " Jesus replied , " before Abraham was , I Am . "
43008059	So they picked up stones to throw at him , but Jesus hid himself and left the temple .
43009001	As Jesus walked along , he saw a man who was blind from birth .
43009002	Jesus’ disciples asked , " Rabbi , who sinned so that he was born blind , this man or his parents ? "
43009003	Jesus answered , " Neither he nor his parents . This happened so that God’s mighty works might be displayed in him .
43009004	While it’s daytime , we must do the works of him who sent me . Night is coming when no one can work .
43009005	While I am in the world , I am the light of the world . "
43009006	After he said this , he spit on the ground , made mud with the saliva , and smeared the mud on the man’s eyes .
43009007	Jesus said to him , " Go , wash in the pool of Siloam " ( this word means sent ) . So the man went away and washed . When he returned , he could see .
43009008	The man’s neighbors and those who used to see him when he was a beggar said , " Isn’t this the man who used to sit and beg ? "
43009009	Some said , " It is , " and others said , " No , it’s someone who looks like him . " But the man said , " Yes , it’s me ! "
43009010	So they asked him , " How are you now able to see ? "
43009011	He answered , " The man they call Jesus made mud , smeared it on my eyes , and said , ‘ Go to the Pool of Siloam and wash . ’ So I went and washed , and then I could see . "
43009012	They asked , " Where is this man ? " He replied , " I don’t know . "
43009013	Then they led the man who had been born blind to the Pharisees .
43009014	Now Jesus made the mud and smeared it on the man’s eyes on a Sabbath day .
43009015	So Pharisees also asked him how he was able to see . The man told them , " He put mud on my eyes , I washed , and now I see . "
43009016	Some Pharisees said , " This man isn’t from God , because he breaks the Sabbath law . " Others said , " How can a sinner do miraculous signs like these ? " So they were divided .
43009017	Some of the Pharisees questioned the man who had been born blind again : " What do you have to say about him , since he healed your eyes ? " He replied , " He’s a prophet . "
43009018	The Jewish leaders didn’t believe the man had been blind and received his sight until they called for his parents .
43009019	The Jewish leaders asked them , " Is this your son ? Are you saying he was born blind ? How can he now see ? "
43009020	His parents answered , " We know he is our son . We know he was born blind .
43009021	But we don’t know how he now sees , and we don’t know who healed his eyes . Ask him . He’s old enough to speak for himself . "
43009022	His parents said this because they feared the Jewish authorities . This is because the Jewish authorities had already decided that whoever confessed Jesus to be the Christ would be expelled from the synagogue .
43009023	That’s why his parents said , " He’s old enough . Ask him . "
43009024	Therefore , they called a second time for the man who had been born blind and said to him , " Give glory to God . We know this man is a sinner . "
43009025	The man answered , " I don’t know whether he’s a sinner . Here’s what I do know : I was blind and now I see . "
43009026	They questioned him : " What did he do to you ? How did he heal your eyes ? "
43009027	He replied , " I already told you , and you didn’t listen . Why do you want to hear it again ? Do you want to become his disciples too ? "
43009028	They insulted him : " You are his disciple , but we are Moses’ disciples .
43009029	We know that God spoke to Moses , but we don’t know where this man is from . "
43009030	The man answered , " This is incredible ! You don’t know where he is from , yet he healed my eyes !
43009031	We know that God doesn’t listen to sinners . God listens to anyone who is devout and does God’s will .
43009032	No one has ever heard of a healing of the eyes of someone born blind .
43009033	If this man wasn’t from God , he couldn’t do this . "
43009034	They responded , " You were born completely in sin ! How is it that you dare to teach us ? " Then they expelled him .
43009035	Jesus heard they had expelled the man born blind . Finding him , Jesus said , " Do you believe in the Human One ? "
43009036	He answered , " Who is he , sir ? I want to believe in him . "
43009037	Jesus said , " You have seen him . In fact , he is the one speaking with you . "
43009038	The man said , " Lord , I believe . " And he worshipped Jesus .
43009039	Jesus said , " I have come into the world to exercise judgment so that those who don’t see can see and those who see will become blind . "
43009040	Some Pharisees who were with him heard what he said and asked , " Surely we aren’t blind , are we ? "
43009041	Jesus said to them , " If you were blind , you wouldn’t have any sin , but now that you say , ‘ We see , ’ your sin remains .
43010001	I assure you that whoever doesn’t enter into the sheep pen through the gate but climbs over the wall is a thief and an outlaw .
43010002	The one who enters through the gate is the shepherd of the sheep .
43010003	The guard at the gate opens the gate for him , and the sheep listen to his voice . He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out .
43010004	Whenever he has gathered all of his sheep , he goes before them and they follow him , because they know his voice .
43010005	They won’t follow a stranger but will run away because they don’t know the stranger’s voice . "
43010006	Those who heard Jesus use this analogy didn’t understand what he was saying .
43010007	So Jesus spoke again , “ I assure you that I am the gate of the sheep .
43010008	All who came before me were thieves and outlaws , but the sheep didn’t listen to them .
43010009	I am the gate . Whoever enters through me will be saved . They will come in and go out and find pasture .
43010010	The thief enters only to steal , kill , and destroy . I came so that they could have life — indeed , so that they could live life to the fullest .
43010011	“ I am the good shepherd . The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep .
43010012	When the hired hand sees the wolf coming , he leaves the sheep and runs away . That’s because he isn’t the shepherd ; the sheep aren’t really his . So the wolf attacks the sheep and scatters them .
43010013	He’s only a hired hand and the sheep don’t matter to him .
43010014	“ I am the good shepherd . I know my own sheep and they know me ,
43010015	just as the Father knows me and I know the Father . I give up my life for the sheep .
43010016	I have other sheep that don’t belong to this sheep pen . I must lead them too . They will listen to my voice and there will be one flock , with one shepherd .
43010017	" This is why the Father loves me : I give up my life so that I can take it up again .
43010018	No one takes it from me , but I give it up because I want to . I have the right to give it up , and I have the right to take it up again . I received this commandment from my Father . "
43010019	There was another division among the Jews because of Jesus’ words .
43010020	Many of them said , " He has a demon and has lost his mind . Why listen to him ? "
43010021	Others said , " These aren’t the words of someone who has a demon . Can a demon heal the eyes of people who are blind ? "
43010022	The time came for the Festival of Dedication in Jerusalem . It was winter ,
43010023	and Jesus was in the temple , walking in the covered porch named for Solomon .
43010024	The Jewish opposition circled around him and asked , " How long will you test our patience ? If you are the Christ , tell us plainly . "
43010025	Jesus answered , " I have told you , but you don’t believe . The works I do in my Father’s name testify about me ,
43010026	but you don’t believe because you don’t belong to my sheep .
43010027	My sheep listen to my voice . I know them and they follow me .
43010028	I give them eternal life . They will never die , and no one will snatch them from my hand .
43010029	My Father , who has given them to me , is greater than all , and no one is able to snatch them from my Father’s hand .
43010030	I and the Father are one . "
43010031	Again the Jewish opposition picked up stones in order to stone him .
43010032	Jesus responded , " I have shown you many good works from the Father . For which of those works do you stone me ? "
43010033	The Jewish opposition answered , " We don’t stone you for a good work but for insulting God . You are human , yet you make yourself out to be God . "
43010034	Jesus replied , " Isn’t it written in your Law , I have said , you are gods ? "
43010035	Scripture calls those to whom God’s word came gods , and scripture can’t be abolished .
43010036	So how can you say that the one whom the Father has made holy and sent into the world insults God because he said , ‘ I am God’s Son ’ ?
43010037	If I don’t do the works of my Father , don’t believe me .
43010038	But if I do them , and you don’t believe me , believe the works so that you can know and recognize that the Father is in me and I am in the Father . ”
43010039	Again , they wanted to arrest him , but he escaped from them .
43010040	Jesus went back across the Jordan to the place where John had baptized at first , and he stayed there .
43010041	Many people came to him . " John didn’t do any miraculous signs , " they said , " but everything John said about this man was true . "
43010042	Many believed in Jesus there .
43011001	A certain man , Lazarus , was ill . He was from Bethany , the village of Mary and her sister Martha . (
43011002	This was the Mary who anointed the Lord with fragrant oil and wiped his feet with her hair . Her brother Lazarus was ill . )
43011003	So the sisters sent word to Jesus , saying , " Lord , the one whom you love is ill . "
43011004	When he heard this , Jesus said , " This illness isn’t fatal . It’s for the glory of God so that God’s Son can be glorified through it . "
43011005	Jesus loved Martha , her sister , and Lazarus .
43011006	When he heard that Lazarus was ill , he stayed where he was . After two days ,
43011007	he said to his disciples , " Let’s return to Judea again . "
43011008	The disciples replied , " Rabbi , the Jewish opposition wants to stone you , but you want to go back ? "
43011009	Jesus answered , " Aren’t there twelve hours in the day ? Whoever walks in the day doesn’t stumble because they see the light of the world .
43011010	But whoever walks in the night does stumble because the light isn’t in them . "
43011011	He continued , " Our friend Lazarus is sleeping , but I am going in order to wake him up . "
43011012	The disciples said , " Lord , if he’s sleeping , he will get well . "
43011013	They thought Jesus meant that Lazarus was in a deep sleep , but Jesus had spoken about Lazarus’ death .
43011014	Jesus told them plainly , " Lazarus has died .
43011015	For your sakes , I’m glad I wasn’t there so that you can believe . Let’s go to him . "
43011016	Then Thomas ( the one called Didymus ) said to the other disciples , " Let us go too so that we may die with Jesus . "
43011017	When Jesus arrived , he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days .
43011018	Bethany was a little less than two miles from Jerusalem .
43011019	Many Jews had come to comfort Martha and Mary after their brother’s death .
43011020	When Martha heard that Jesus was coming , she went to meet him , while Mary remained in the house .
43011021	Martha said to Jesus , " Lord , if you had been here , my brother wouldn’t have died .
43011022	Even now I know that whatever you ask God , God will give you . "
43011023	Jesus told her , " Your brother will rise again . "
43011024	Martha replied , " I know that he will rise in the resurrection on the last day . "
43011025	Jesus said to her , " I am the resurrection and the life . Whoever believes in me will live , even though they die .
43011026	Everyone who lives and believes in me will never die . Do you believe this ? "
43011027	She replied , " Yes , Lord , I believe that you are the Christ , God’s Son , the one who is coming into the world . "
43011028	After she said this , she went and spoke privately to her sister Mary , " The teacher is here and he’s calling for you . "
43011029	When Mary heard this , she got up quickly and went to Jesus .
43011030	He hadn’t entered the village but was still in the place where Martha had met him .
43011031	When the Jews who were comforting Mary in the house saw her get up quickly and leave , they followed her . They assumed she was going to mourn at the tomb .
43011032	When Mary arrived where Jesus was and saw him , she fell at his feet and said , " Lord , if you had been here , my brother wouldn’t have died . "
43011033	When Jesus saw her crying and the Jews who had come with her crying also , he was deeply disturbed and troubled .
43011034	He asked , " Where have you laid him ? " They replied , " Lord , come and see . "
43011035	Jesus began to cry .
43011036	The Jews said , " See how much he loved him ! "
43011037	But some of them said , " He healed the eyes of the man born blind . Couldn’t he have kept Lazarus from dying ? "
43011038	Jesus was deeply disturbed again when he came to the tomb . It was a cave , and a stone covered the entrance .
43011039	Jesus said , " Remove the stone . " Martha , the sister of the dead man , said , " Lord , the smell will be awful ! He’s been dead four days . "
43011040	Jesus replied , " Didn’t I tell you that if you believe , you will see God’s glory ? "
43011041	So they removed the stone . Jesus looked up and said , " Father , thank you for hearing me .
43011042	I know you always hear me . I say this for the benefit of the crowd standing here so that they will believe that you sent me . "
43011043	Having said this , Jesus shouted with a loud voice , " Lazarus , come out ! "
43011044	The dead man came out , his feet bound and his hands tied , and his face covered with a cloth . Jesus said to them , " Untie him and let him go . "
43011045	Therefore , many of the Jews who came with Mary and saw what Jesus did believed in him .
43011046	But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done .
43011047	Then the chief priests and Pharisees called together the council and said , " What are we going to do ? This man is doing many miraculous signs !
43011048	If we let him go on like this , everyone will believe in him . Then the Romans will come and take away both our temple and our people . "
43011049	One of them , Caiaphas , who was high priest that year , told them , " You don’t know anything !
43011050	You don’t see that it is better for you that one man die for the people rather than the whole nation be destroyed . "
43011051	He didn’t say this on his own . As high priest that year , he prophesied that Jesus would soon die for the nation —
43011052	and not only for the nation . Jesus would also die so that God’s children scattered everywhere would be gathered together as one .
43011053	From that day on they plotted to kill him .
43011054	Therefore , Jesus was no longer active in public ministry among the Jewish leaders . Instead , he left Jerusalem and went to a place near the wilderness , to a city called Ephraim , where he stayed with his disciples .
43011055	It was almost time for the Jewish Passover , and many people went from the countryside up to Jerusalem to purify themselves through ritual washing before the Passover .
43011056	They were looking for Jesus . As they spoke to each other in the temple , they said , " What do you think ? He won’t come to the festival , will he ? "
43011057	The chief priests and Pharisees had given orders that anyone who knew where he was should report it , so they could arrest him .
43012001	Six days before Passover , Jesus came to Bethany , home of Lazarus , whom Jesus had raised from the dead .
43012002	Lazarus and his sisters hosted a dinner for him . Martha served and Lazarus was among those who joined him at the table .
43012003	Then Mary took an extraordinary amount , almost three-quarters of a pound , of very expensive perfume made of pure nard . She anointed Jesus’ feet with it , then wiped his feet dry with her hair . The house was filled with the aroma of the perfume .
43012004	Judas Iscariot , one of his disciples ( the one who was about to betray him ) , complained ,
43012005	" This perfume was worth a year’s wages ! Why wasn’t it sold and the money given to the poor ? " (
43012006	He said this not because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief . He carried the money bag and would take what was in it . )
43012007	Then Jesus said , " Leave her alone . This perfume was to be used in preparation for my burial , and this is how she has used it .
43012008	You will always have the poor among you , but you won’t always have me . "
43012009	Many Jews learned that he was there . They came not only because of Jesus but also to see Lazarus , whom he had raised from the dead .
43012010	The chief priests decided that they would kill Lazarus too .
43012011	It was because of Lazarus that many of the Jews had deserted them and come to believe in Jesus .
43012012	The next day the great crowd that had come for the festival heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem .
43012013	They took palm branches and went out to meet him . They shouted , " Hosanna ! Blessings on the one who comes in the name of the Lord ! Blessings on the king of Israel ! "
43012014	Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it , just as it is written ,
43012015	Don’t be afraid , Daughter Zion .
43012016	His disciples didn’t understand these things at first . After he was glorified , they remembered that these things had been written about him and that they had done these things to him .
43012017	The crowd who had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead were testifying about him .
43012018	That’s why the crowd came to meet him , because they had heard about this miraculous sign that he had done .
43012019	Therefore , the Pharisees said to each other , " See ! You’ve accomplished nothing ! Look ! The whole world is following him ! "
43012020	Some Greeks were among those who had come up to worship at the festival .
43012021	They came to Philip , who was from Bethsaida in Galilee , and made a request : " Sir , we want to see Jesus . "
43012022	Philip told Andrew , and Andrew and Philip told Jesus .
43012023	Jesus replied , “ The time has come for the Human One to be glorified .
43012024	I assure you that unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies , it can only be a single seed . But if it dies , it bears much fruit .
43012025	Those who love their lives will lose them , and those who hate their lives in this world will keep them forever .
43012026	Whoever serves me must follow me . Wherever I am , there my servant will also be . My Father will honor whoever serves me .
43012027	" Now I am deeply troubled . What should I say ? ‘ Father , save me from this time ’ ? No , for this is the reason I have come to this time .
43012028	Father , glorify your name ! " Then a voice came from heaven , " I have glorified it , and I will glorify it again . "
43012029	The crowd standing there heard and said , " It’s thunder . " Others said , " An angel spoke to him . "
43012030	Jesus replied , " This voice wasn’t for my benefit but for yours .
43012031	Now is the time for judgment of this world . Now this world’s ruler will be thrown out .
43012032	When I am lifted up from the earth , I will draw everyone to me . " (
43012033	He said this to show how he was going to die . )
43012034	The crowd responded , " We have heard from the Law that the Christ remains forever . How can you say that the Human One must be lifted up ? Who is this Human One ? "
43012035	Jesus replied , " The light is with you for only a little while . Walk while you have the light so that darkness doesn’t overtake you . Those who walk in the darkness don’t know where they are going .
43012036	As long as you have the light , believe in the light so that you might become people whose lives are determined by the light . " After Jesus said these things , he went away and hid from them .
43012037	Jesus had done many miraculous signs before the people , but they didn’t believe in him .
43012038	This was to fulfill the word of the prophet Isaiah : Lord , who has believed through our message ? To whom is the arm of the Lord fully revealed ?
43012039	Isaiah explains why they couldn’t believe :
43012040	He made their eyes blind so that they might not see with their eyes , and I would heal them .
43012041	Isaiah said these things because he saw Jesus’ glory ; he spoke about Jesus .
43012042	Even so , many leaders believed in him , but they wouldn’t acknowledge their faith because they feared that the Pharisees would expel them from the synagogue .
43012043	They believed , but they loved human praise more than God’s glory .
43012044	Jesus shouted , " Whoever believes in me doesn’t believe in me but in the one who sent me .
43012045	Whoever sees me sees the one who sent me .
43012046	I have come as a light into the world so that everyone who believes in me won’t live in darkness .
43012047	If people hear my words and don’t keep them , I don’t judge them . I didn’t come to judge the world but to save it .
43012048	Whoever rejects me and doesn’t receive my words will be judged at the last day by the word I have spoken .
43012049	I don’t speak on my own , but the Father who sent me commanded me regarding what I should speak and say .
43012050	I know that his commandment is eternal life . Therefore , whatever I say is just as the Father has said to me . "
43013001	Before the Festival of Passover , Jesus knew that his time had come to leave this world and go to the Father . Having loved his own who were in the world , he loved them fully .
43013002	Jesus and his disciples were sharing the evening meal . The devil had already provoked Judas , Simon Iscariot’s son , to betray Jesus .
43013003	Jesus knew the Father had given everything into his hands and that he had come from God and was returning to God .
43013004	So he got up from the table and took off his robes . Picking up a linen towel , he tied it around his waist .
43013005	Then he poured water into a washbasin and began to wash the disciples’ feet , drying them with the towel he was wearing .
43013006	When Jesus came to Simon Peter , Peter said to him , " Lord , are you going to wash my feet ? "
43013007	Jesus replied , " You don’t understand what I’m doing now , but you will understand later . "
43013008	" No ! " Peter said . " You will never wash my feet ! " Jesus replied , " Unless I wash you , you won’t have a place with me . "
43013009	Simon Peter said , " Lord , not only my feet but also my hands and my head ! "
43013010	Jesus responded , " Those who have bathed need only to have their feet washed , because they are completely clean . You disciples are clean , but not every one of you . "
43013011	He knew who would betray him . That’s why he said , " Not every one of you is clean . "
43013012	After he washed the disciples’ feet , he put on his robes and returned to his place at the table . He said to them , “ Do you know what I’ve done for you ?
43013013	You call me ‘ Teacher ’ and ‘ Lord , ’ and you speak correctly , because I am .
43013014	If I , your Lord and teacher , have washed your feet , you too must wash each other’s feet .
43013015	I have given you an example : just as I have done , you also must do .
43013016	I assure you , servants aren’t greater than their master , nor are those who are sent greater than the one who sent them .
43013017	Since you know these things , you will be happy if you do them .
43013018	I’m not speaking about all of you . I know those whom I’ve chosen . But this is to fulfill the scripture , The one who eats my bread has turned against me .
43013019	" I’m telling you this now , before it happens , so that when it does happen you will believe that I Am .
43013020	I assure you that whoever receives someone I send receives me , and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me . "
43013021	After he said these things , Jesus was deeply disturbed and testified , " I assure you , one of you will betray me . "
43013022	His disciples looked at each other , confused about which of them he was talking about .
43013023	One of the disciples , the one whom Jesus loved , was at Jesus’ side .
43013024	Simon Peter nodded at him to get him to ask Jesus who he was talking about .
43013025	Leaning back toward Jesus , this disciple asked , " Lord , who is it ? "
43013026	Jesus answered , " It’s the one to whom I will give this piece of bread once I have dipped into the bowl . " Then he dipped the piece of bread and gave it to Judas , Simon Iscariot’s son .
43013027	After Judas took the bread , Satan entered into him . Jesus told him , " What you are about to do , do quickly . "
43013028	No one sitting at the table understood why Jesus said this to him .
43013029	Some thought that , since Judas kept the money bag , Jesus told him , " Go , buy what we need for the feast , " or that he should give something to the poor .
43013030	So when Judas took the bread , he left immediately . And it was night .
43013031	When Judas was gone , Jesus said , “ Now the Human One has been glorified , and God has been glorified in him .
43013032	If God has been glorified in him , God will also glorify the Human One in himself and will glorify him immediately .
43013033	Little children , I’m with you for a little while longer . You will look for me — but , just as I told the Jewish leaders , I also tell you now — ‘ Where I’m going , you can’t come . ’
43013034	" I give you a new commandment : Love each other . Just as I have loved you , so you also must love each other .
43013035	This is how everyone will know that you are my disciples , when you love each other . "
43013036	Simon Peter said to Jesus , " Lord , where are you going ? " Jesus answered , " Where I am going , you can’t follow me now , but you will follow later . "
43013037	Peter asked , " Lord , why can’t I follow you now ? I’ll give up my life for you . "
43013038	Jesus replied , “ Will you give up your life for me ? I assure you that you will deny me three times before the rooster crows .
43014001	" Don’t be troubled . Trust in God . Trust also in me .
43014002	My Father’s house has room to spare . If that weren’t the case , would I have told you that I’m going to prepare a place for you ?
43014003	When I go to prepare a place for you , I will return and take you to be with me so that where I am you will be too .
43014004	You know the way to the place I’m going . "
43014005	Thomas asked , " Lord , we don’t know where you are going . How can we know the way ? "
43014006	Jesus answered , " I am the way , the truth , and the life . No one comes to the Father except through me .
43014007	If you have really known me , you will also know the Father . From now on you know him and have seen him . "
43014008	Philip said , " Lord , show us the Father ; that will be enough for us . "
43014009	Jesus replied , “ Don’t you know me , Philip , even after I have been with you all this time ? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father . How can you say , ‘ Show us the Father ’ ?
43014010	Don’t you believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me ? The words I have spoken to you I don’t speak on my own . The Father who dwells in me does his works .
43014011	Trust me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me , or at least believe on account of the works themselves .
43014012	I assure you that whoever believes in me will do the works that I do . They will do even greater works than these because I am going to the Father .
43014013	I will do whatever you ask for in my name , so that the Father can be glorified in the Son .
43014014	When you ask me for anything in my name , I will do it .
43014015	“ If you love me , you will keep my commandments .
43014016	I will ask the Father , and he will send another Companion , who will be with you forever .
43014017	This Companion is the Spirit of Truth , whom the world can’t receive because it neither sees him nor recognizes him . You know him , because he lives with you and will be with you .
43014018	" I won’t leave you as orphans . I will come to you .
43014019	Soon the world will no longer see me , but you will see me . Because I live , you will live too .
43014020	On that day you will know that I am in my Father , you are in me , and I am in you .
43014021	Whoever has my commandments and keeps them loves me . Whoever loves me will be loved by my Father , and I will love them and reveal myself to them . "
43014022	Judas ( not Judas Iscariot ) asked , " Lord , why are you about to reveal yourself to us and not to the world ? "
43014023	Jesus answered , “ Whoever loves me will keep my word . My Father will love them , and we will come to them and make our home with them .
43014024	Whoever doesn’t love me doesn’t keep my words . The word that you hear isn’t mine . It is the word of the Father who sent me .
43014025	“ I have spoken these things to you while I am with you .
43014026	The Companion , the Holy Spirit , whom the Father will send in my name , will teach you everything and will remind you of everything I told you .
43014027	“ Peace I leave with you . My peace I give you . I give to you not as the world gives . Don’t be troubled or afraid .
43014028	You have heard me tell you , ‘ I’m going away and returning to you . ’ If you loved me , you would be happy that I am going to the Father , because the Father is greater than me .
43014029	I have told you before it happens so that when it happens you will believe .
43014030	I won’t say much more to you because this world’s ruler is coming . He has nothing on me .
43014031	Rather , he comes so that the world will know that I love the Father and do just as the Father has commanded me . Get up . We’re leaving this place .
43015001	“ I am the true vine , and my Father is the vineyard keeper .
43015002	He removes any of my branches that don’t produce fruit , and he trims any branch that produces fruit so that it will produce even more fruit .
43015003	You are already trimmed because of the word I have spoken to you .
43015004	Remain in me , and I will remain in you . A branch can’t produce fruit by itself , but must remain in the vine . Likewise , you can’t produce fruit unless you remain in me .
43015005	I am the vine ; you are the branches . If you remain in me and I in you , then you will produce much fruit . Without me , you can’t do anything .
43015006	If you don’t remain in me , you will be like a branch that is thrown out and dries up . Those branches are gathered up , thrown into a fire , and burned .
43015007	If you remain in me and my words remain in you , ask for whatever you want and it will be done for you .
43015008	My Father is glorified when you produce much fruit and in this way prove that you are my disciples .
43015009	“ As the Father loved me , I too have loved you . Remain in my love .
43015010	If you keep my commandments , you will remain in my love , just as I kept my Father’s commandments and remain in his love .
43015011	I have said these things to you so that my joy will be in you and your joy will be complete .
43015012	This is my commandment : love each other just as I have loved you .
43015013	No one has greater love than to give up one’s life for one’s friends .
43015014	You are my friends if you do what I command you .
43015015	I don’t call you servants any longer , because servants don’t know what their master is doing . Instead , I call you friends , because everything I heard from my Father I have made known to you .
43015016	You didn’t choose me , but I chose you and appointed you so that you could go and produce fruit and so that your fruit could last . As a result , whatever you ask the Father in my name , he will give you .
43015017	I give you these commandments so that you can love each other .
43015018	“ If the world hates you , know that it hated me first .
43015019	If you belonged to the world , the world would love you as its own . However , I have chosen you out of the world , and you don’t belong to the world . This is why the world hates you .
43015020	Remember what I told you , ‘ Servants aren’t greater than their master . ’ If the world harassed me , it will harass you too . If it kept my word , it will also keep yours .
43015021	The world will do all these things to you on account of my name , because it doesn’t know the one who sent me .
43015022	“ If I hadn’t come and spoken to the people of this world , they wouldn’t be sinners . But now they have no excuse for their sin .
43015023	Whoever hates me also hates the Father .
43015024	If I hadn’t done works among them that no one else had done , they wouldn’t be sinners . But now they have seen and hated both me and my Father .
43015025	This fulfills the word written in their Law , They hated me without a reason .
43015026	“ When the Companion comes , whom I will send from the Father — the Spirit of Truth who proceeds from the Father — he will testify about me .
43015027	You will testify too , because you have been with me from the beginning .
43016001	I have said these things to you so that you won’t fall away .
43016002	They will expel you from the synagogue . The time is coming when those who kill you will think that they are doing a service to God .
43016003	They will do these things because they don’t know the Father or me .
43016004	But I have said these things to you so that when their time comes , you will remember that I told you about them . “ I didn’t say these things to you from the beginning , because I was with you .
43016005	But now I go away to the one who sent me . None of you ask me , ‘ Where are you going ? ’
43016006	Yet because I have said these things to you , you are filled with sorrow .
43016007	I assure you that it is better for you that I go away . If I don’t go away , the Companion won’t come to you . But if I go , I will send him to you .
43016008	When he comes , he will show the world it was wrong about sin , righteousness , and judgment .
43016009	He will show the world it was wrong about sin because they don’t believe in me .
43016010	He will show the world it was wrong about righteousness because I’m going to the Father and you won’t see me anymore .
43016011	He will show the world it was wrong about judgment because this world’s ruler stands condemned .
43016012	" I have much more to say to you , but you can’t handle it now .
43016013	However , when the Spirit of Truth comes , he will guide you in all truth . He won’t speak on his own , but will say whatever he hears and will proclaim to you what is to come .
43016014	He will glorify me , because he will take what is mine and proclaim it to you .
43016015	Everything that the Father has is mine . That’s why I said that the Spirit takes what is mine and will proclaim it to you .
43016016	Soon you won’t be able to see me ; soon after that , you will see me . "
43016017	Some of Jesus’ disciples said to each other , " What does he mean : ‘ Soon you won’t see me , and soon after that you will see me ’ and ‘ Because I’m going to the Father ’ ?
43016018	What does he mean by ‘ soon ’ ? We don’t understand what he’s talking about . "
43016019	Jesus knew they wanted to ask him , so he said , “ Are you trying to find out from each other what I meant when I said , ‘ Soon you won’t see me , and soon after that you will see me ’ ?
43016020	I assure you that you will cry and lament , and the world will be happy . You will be sorrowful , but your sorrow will turn into joy .
43016021	When a woman gives birth , she has pain because her time has come . But when the child is born , she no longer remembers her distress because of her joy that a child has been born into the world .
43016022	In the same way , you have sorrow now ; but I will see you again , and you will be overjoyed . No one takes away your joy .
43016023	In that day , you won’t ask me anything . I assure you that the Father will give you whatever you ask in my name .
43016024	Up to now , you have asked nothing in my name . Ask and you will receive so that your joy will be complete .
43016025	" I’ve been using figures of speech with you . The time is coming when I will no longer speak to you in such analogies . Instead , I will tell you plainly about the Father .
43016026	In that day you will ask in my name . I’m not saying that I will ask the Father on your behalf .
43016027	The Father himself loves you , because you have loved me and believed that I came from God .
43016028	I left the Father and came into the world . I tell you again : I am leaving the world and returning to the Father . "
43016029	His disciples said , " See ! Now you speak plainly ; you aren’t using figures of speech .
43016030	Now we know that you know everything and you don’t need anyone to ask you . Because of this we believe you have come from God . "
43016031	Jesus replied , " Now you believe ?
43016032	Look ! A time is coming — and is here ! — when each of you will be scattered to your own homes and you will leave me alone . I’m not really alone , for the Father is with me .
43016033	I’ve said these things to you so that you will have peace in me . In the world you have distress . But be encouraged ! I have conquered the world . "
43017001	When Jesus finished saying these things , he looked up to heaven and said , “ Father , the time has come . Glorify your Son , so that the Son can glorify you .
43017002	You gave him authority over everyone so that he could give eternal life to everyone you gave him .
43017003	This is eternal life : to know you , the only true God , and Jesus Christ whom you sent .
43017004	I have glorified you on earth by finishing the work you gave me to do .
43017005	Now , Father , glorify me in your presence with the glory I shared with you before the world was created .
43017006	“ I have revealed your name to the people you gave me from this world . They were yours and you gave them to me , and they have kept your word .
43017007	Now they know that everything you have given me comes from you .
43017008	This is because I gave them the words that you gave me , and they received them . They truly understood that I came from you , and they believed that you sent me .
43017009	“ I’m praying for them . I’m not praying for the world but for those you gave me , because they are yours .
43017010	Everything that is mine is yours and everything that is yours is mine ; I have been glorified in them .
43017011	I’m no longer in the world , but they are in the world , even as I’m coming to you . Holy Father , watch over them in your name , the name you gave me , that they will be one just as we are one .
43017012	When I was with them , I watched over them in your name , the name you gave to me , and I kept them safe . None of them were lost , except the one who was destined for destruction , so that scripture would be fulfilled .
43017013	Now I’m coming to you and I say these things while I’m in the world so that they can share completely in my joy .
43017014	I gave your word to them and the world hated them , because they don’t belong to this world , just as I don’t belong to this world .
43017015	I’m not asking that you take them out of this world but that you keep them safe from the evil one .
43017016	They don’t belong to this world , just as I don’t belong to this world .
43017017	Make them holy in the truth ; your word is truth .
43017018	As you sent me into the world , so I have sent them into the world .
43017019	I made myself holy on their behalf so that they also would be made holy in the truth .
43017020	“ I’m not praying only for them but also for those who believe in me because of their word .
43017021	I pray they will be one , Father , just as you are in me and I am in you . I pray that they also will be in us , so that the world will believe that you sent me .
43017022	I’ve given them the glory that you gave me so that they can be one just as we are one .
43017023	I’m in them and you are in me so that they will be made perfectly one . Then the world will know that you sent me and that you have loved them just as you loved me .
43017024	“ Father , I want those you gave me to be with me where I am . Then they can see my glory , which you gave me because you loved me before the creation of the world .
43017025	" Righteous Father , even the world didn’t know you , but I’ve known you , and these believers know that you sent me .
43017026	I’ve made your name known to them and will continue to make it known so that your love for me will be in them , and I myself will be in them . "
43018001	After he said these things , Jesus went out with his disciples and crossed over to the other side of the Kidron Valley . He and his disciples entered a garden there .
43018002	Judas , his betrayer , also knew the place because Jesus often gathered there with his disciples .
43018003	Judas brought a company of soldiers and some guards from the chief priests and Pharisees . They came there carrying lanterns , torches , and weapons .
43018004	Jesus knew everything that was to happen to him , so he went out and asked , " Who are you looking for ? "
43018005	They answered , " Jesus the Nazarene . " He said to them , " I Am . " ( Judas , his betrayer , was standing with them . )
43018006	When he said , " I Am , " they shrank back and fell to the ground .
43018007	He asked them again , " Who are you looking for ? " They said , " Jesus the Nazarene . "
43018008	Jesus answered , " I told you , ‘ I Am . ’ If you are looking for me , then let these people go . "
43018009	This was so that the word he had spoken might be fulfilled : " I didn’t lose anyone of those whom you gave me . "
43018010	Then Simon Peter , who had a sword , drew it and struck the high priest’s servant , cutting off his right ear . ( The servant’s name was Malchus . )
43018011	Jesus told Peter , " Put your sword away ! Am I not to drink the cup the Father has given me ? "
43018012	Then the company of soldiers , the commander , and the guards from the Jewish leaders took Jesus into custody . They bound him
43018013	and led him first to Annas . He was the father-in-law of Caiaphas , the high priest that year . (
43018014	Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jewish leaders that it was better for one person to die for the people . )
43018015	Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus . Because this other disciple was known to the high priest , he went with Jesus into the high priest’s courtyard .
43018016	However , Peter stood outside near the gate . Then the other disciple ( the one known to the high priest ) came out and spoke to the woman stationed at the gate , and she brought Peter in .
43018017	The servant woman stationed at the gate asked Peter , " Aren’t you one of this man’s disciples ? " " I’m not , " he replied .
43018018	The servants and the guards had made a fire because it was cold . They were standing around it , warming themselves . Peter joined them there , standing by the fire and warming himself .
43018019	Meanwhile , the chief priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching .
43018020	Jesus answered , " I’ve spoken openly to the world . I’ve always taught in synagogues and in the temple , where all the Jews gather . I’ve said nothing in private .
43018021	Why ask me ? Ask those who heard what I told them . They know what I said . "
43018022	After Jesus spoke , one of the guards standing there slapped Jesus in the face . " Is that how you would answer the high priest ? " he asked .
43018023	Jesus replied , " If I speak wrongly , testify about what was wrong . But if I speak correctly , why do you strike me ? "
43018024	Then Annas sent him , bound , to Caiaphas the high priest .
43018025	Meanwhile , Simon Peter was still standing with the guards , warming himself . They asked , " Aren’t you one of his disciples ? " Peter denied it , saying , " I’m not . "
43018026	A servant of the high priest , a relative of the one whose ear Peter had cut off , said to him , " Didn’t I see you in the garden with him ? "
43018027	Peter denied it again , and immediately a rooster crowed .
43018028	The Jewish leaders led Jesus from Caiaphas to the Roman governor’s palace . It was early in the morning . So that they could eat the Passover , the Jewish leaders wouldn’t enter the palace ; entering the palace would have made them ritually impure .
43018029	So Pilate went out to them and asked , " What charge do you bring against this man ? "
43018030	They answered , " If he had done nothing wrong , we wouldn’t have handed him over to you . "
43018031	Pilate responded , " Take him yourselves and judge him according to your Law . " The Jewish leaders replied , " The Law doesn’t allow us to kill anyone . " (
43018032	This was so that Jesus’ word might be fulfilled when he indicated how he was going to die . )
43018033	Pilate went back into the palace . He summoned Jesus and asked , " Are you the king of the Jews ? "
43018034	Jesus answered , " Do you say this on your own or have others spoken to you about me ? "
43018035	Pilate responded , " I’m not a Jew , am I ? Your nation and its chief priests handed you over to me . What have you done ? "
43018036	Jesus replied , " My kingdom doesn’t originate from this world . If it did , my guards would fight so that I wouldn’t have been arrested by the Jewish leaders . My kingdom isn’t from here . "
43018037	" So you are a king ? " Pilate said . Jesus answered , " You say that I am a king . I was born and came into the world for this reason : to testify to the truth . Whoever accepts the truth listens to my voice . "
43018038	" What is truth ? " Pilate asked . After Pilate said this , he returned to the Jewish leaders and said , " I find no grounds for any charge against him .
43018039	You have a custom that I release one prisoner for you at Passover . Do you want me to release for you the king of the Jews ? "
43018040	They shouted , " Not this man ! Give us Barabbas ! " ( Barabbas was an outlaw . )
43019001	Then Pilate had Jesus taken and whipped .
43019002	The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head , and dressed him in a purple robe .
43019003	Over and over they went up to him and said , " Greetings , king of the Jews ! " And they slapped him in the face .
43019004	Pilate came out of the palace again and said to the Jewish leaders , " Look ! I’m bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no grounds for a charge against him . "
43019005	When Jesus came out , wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe , Pilate said to them , " Here’s the man . "
43019006	When the chief priests and their deputies saw him , they shouted out , " Crucify , crucify ! " Pilate told them , " You take him and crucify him . I don’t find any grounds for a charge against him . "
43019007	The Jewish leaders replied , " We have a Law , and according to this Law he ought to die because he made himself out to be God’s Son . "
43019008	When Pilate heard this word , he was even more afraid .
43019009	He went back into the residence and spoke to Jesus , " Where are you from ? " Jesus didn’t answer .
43019010	So Pilate said , " You won’t speak to me ? Don’t you know that I have authority to release you and also to crucify you ? "
43019011	Jesus replied , " You would have no authority over me if it had not been given to you from above . That’s why the one who handed me over to you has the greater sin . "
43019012	From that moment on , Pilate wanted to release Jesus . However , the Jewish leaders cried out , saying , " If you release this man , you aren’t a friend of the emperor ! Anyone who makes himself out to be a king opposes the emperor ! "
43019013	When Pilate heard these words , he led Jesus out and seated him on the judge’s bench at the place called Stone Pavement ( in Aramaic , Gabbatha ) .
43019014	It was about noon on the Preparation Day for the Passover . Pilate said to the Jewish leaders , " Here’s your king . "
43019015	The Jewish leaders cried out , " Take him away ! Take him away ! Crucify him ! " Pilate responded , " What ? Do you want me to crucify your king ? " " We have no king except the emperor , " the chief priests answered .
43019016	Then Pilate handed Jesus over to be crucified . The soldiers took Jesus prisoner .
43019017	Carrying his cross by himself , he went out to a place called Skull Place ( in Aramaic , Golgotha ) .
43019018	That’s where they crucified him — and two others with him , one on each side and Jesus in the middle .
43019019	Pilate had a public notice written and posted on the cross . It read " Jesus the Nazarene , the king of the Jews . "
43019020	Many of the Jews read this sign , for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city and it was written in Aramaic , Latin , and Greek .
43019021	Therefore , the Jewish chief priests complained to Pilate , " Don’t write , ‘ The king of the Jews ’ but ‘ This man said , " I am the king of the Jews . " ’ "
43019022	Pilate answered , " What I’ve written , I’ve written . "
43019023	When the soldiers crucified Jesus , they took his clothes and his sandals , and divided them into four shares , one for each soldier . His shirt was seamless , woven as one piece from the top to the bottom .
43019024	They said to each other , " Let’s not tear it . Let’s cast lots to see who will get it . " This was to fulfill the scripture , They divided my clothes among themselves , and they cast lots for my clothing .
43019025	Jesus’ mother and his mother’s sister , Mary the wife of Clopas , and Mary Magdalene stood near the cross .
43019026	When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby , he said to his mother , " Woman , here is your son . "
43019027	Then he said to the disciple , " Here is your mother . " And from that time on , this disciple took her into his home .
43019028	After this , knowing that everything was already completed , in order to fulfill the scripture , Jesus said , " I am thirsty . "
43019029	A jar full of sour wine was nearby , so the soldiers soaked a sponge in it , placed it on a hyssop branch , and held it up to his lips .
43019030	When he had received the sour wine , Jesus said , " It is completed . " Bowing his head , he gave up his life .
43019031	It was the Preparation Day and the Jewish leaders didn’t want the bodies to remain on the cross on the Sabbath , especially since that Sabbath was an important day . So they asked Pilate to have the legs of those crucified broken and the bodies taken down .
43019032	Therefore , the soldiers came and broke the legs of the two men who were crucified with Jesus .
43019033	When they came to Jesus , they saw that he was already dead so they didn’t break his legs .
43019034	However , one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear , and immediately blood and water came out .
43019035	The one who saw this has testified , and his testimony is true . He knows that he speaks the truth , and he has testified so that you also can believe .
43019036	These things happened to fulfill the scripture , They won’t break any of his bones .
43019037	And another scripture says , They will look at him whom they have pierced .
43019038	After this Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate if he could take away the body of Jesus . Joseph was a disciple of Jesus , but a secret one because he feared the Jewish authorities . Pilate gave him permission , so he came and took the body away .
43019039	Nicodemus , the one who at first had come to Jesus at night , was there too . He brought a mixture of myrrh and aloe , nearly seventy-five pounds in all .
43019040	Following Jewish burial customs , they took Jesus’ body and wrapped it , with the spices , in linen cloths .
43019041	There was a garden in the place where Jesus was crucified , and in the garden was a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid .
43019042	Because it was the Jewish Preparation Day and the tomb was nearby , they laid Jesus in it .
43020001	Early in the morning of the first day of the week , while it was still dark , Mary Magdalene came to the tomb and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb .
43020002	She ran to Simon Peter and the other disciple , the one whom Jesus loved , and said , " They have taken the Lord from the tomb , and we don’t know where they’ve put him . "
43020003	Peter and the other disciple left to go to the tomb .
43020004	They were running together , but the other disciple ran faster than Peter and was the first to arrive at the tomb .
43020005	Bending down to take a look , he saw the linen cloths lying there , but he didn’t go in .
43020006	Following him , Simon Peter entered the tomb and saw the linen cloths lying there .
43020007	He also saw the face cloth that had been on Jesus’ head . It wasn’t with the other clothes but was folded up in its own place .
43020008	Then the other disciple , the one who arrived at the tomb first , also went inside . He saw and believed .
43020009	They didn’t yet understand the scripture that Jesus must rise from the dead .
43020010	Then the disciples returned to the place where they were staying .
43020011	Mary stood outside near the tomb , crying . As she cried , she bent down to look into the tomb .
43020012	She saw two angels dressed in white , seated where the body of Jesus had been , one at the head and one at the foot .
43020013	The angels asked her , " Woman , why are you crying ? " She replied , " They have taken away my Lord , and I don’t know where they’ve put him . "
43020014	As soon as she had said this , she turned around and saw Jesus standing there , but she didn’t know it was Jesus .
43020015	Jesus said to her , " Woman , why are you crying ? Who are you looking for ? " Thinking he was the gardener , she replied , " Sir , if you have carried him away , tell me where you have put him and I will get him . "
43020016	Jesus said to her , " Mary . " She turned and said to him in Aramaic , " Rabbouni " ( which means Teacher ) .
43020017	Jesus said to her , " Don’t hold on to me , for I haven’t yet gone up to my Father . Go to my brothers and sisters and tell them , ‘ I’m going up to my Father and your Father , to my God and your God . ’ "
43020018	Mary Magdalene left and announced to the disciples , " I’ve seen the Lord . " Then she told them what he said to her .
43020019	It was still the first day of the week . That evening , while the disciples were behind closed doors because they were afraid of the Jewish authorities , Jesus came and stood among them . He said , " Peace be with you . "
43020020	After he said this , he showed them his hands and his side . When the disciples saw the Lord , they were filled with joy .
43020021	Jesus said to them again , " Peace be with you . As the Father sent me , so I am sending you . "
43020022	Then he breathed on them and said , " Receive the Holy Spirit .
43020023	If you forgive anyone’s sins , they are forgiven ; if you don’t forgive them , they aren’t forgiven . "
43020024	Thomas , the one called Didymus , one of the Twelve , wasn’t with the disciples when Jesus came .
43020025	The other disciples told him , " We’ve seen the Lord ! " But he replied , " Unless I see the nail marks in his hands , put my finger in the wounds left by the nails , and put my hand into his side , I won’t believe . "
43020026	After eight days his disciples were again in a house and Thomas was with them . Even though the doors were locked , Jesus entered and stood among them . He said , " Peace be with you . "
43020027	Then he said to Thomas , " Put your finger here . Look at my hands . Put your hand into my side . No more disbelief . Believe ! "
43020028	Thomas responded to Jesus , " My Lord and my God ! "
43020029	Jesus replied , " Do you believe because you see me ? Happy are those who don’t see and yet believe . "
43020030	Then Jesus did many other miraculous signs in his disciples’ presence , signs that aren’t recorded in this scroll .
43020031	But these things are written so that you will believe that Jesus is the Christ , God’s Son , and that believing , you will have life in his name .
43021001	Later , Jesus himself appeared again to his disciples at the Sea of Tiberius . This is how it happened :
43021002	Simon Peter , Thomas ( called Didymus ) , Nathanael from Cana in Galilee , Zebedee’s sons , and two other disciples were together .
43021003	Simon Peter told them , " I’m going fishing . " They said , " We’ll go with you . " They set out in a boat , but throughout the night they caught nothing .
43021004	Early in the morning , Jesus stood on the shore , but the disciples didn’t realize it was Jesus .
43021005	Jesus called to them , " Children , have you caught anything to eat ? " They answered him , " No . "
43021006	He said , " Cast your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some . " So they did , and there were so many fish that they couldn’t haul in the net .
43021007	Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter , " It’s the Lord ! " When Simon Peter heard it was the Lord , he wrapped his coat around himself ( for he was naked ) and jumped into the water .
43021008	The other disciples followed in the boat , dragging the net full of fish , for they weren’t far from shore , only about one hundred yards .
43021009	When they landed , they saw a fire there , with fish on it , and some bread .
43021010	Jesus said to them , " Bring some of the fish that you’ve just caught . "
43021011	Simon Peter got up and pulled the net to shore . It was full of large fish , one hundred fifty-three of them . Yet the net hadn’t torn , even with so many fish .
43021012	Jesus said to them , " Come and have breakfast . " None of the disciples could bring themselves to ask him , " Who are you ? " They knew it was the Lord .
43021013	Jesus came , took the bread , and gave it to them . He did the same with the fish .
43021014	This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead .
43021015	When they finished eating , Jesus asked Simon Peter , " Simon son of John , do you love me more than these ? " Simon replied , " Yes , Lord , you know I love you . " Jesus said to him , " Feed my lambs . "
43021016	Jesus asked a second time , " Simon son of John , do you love me ? " Simon replied , " Yes , Lord , you know I love you . " Jesus said to him , " Take care of my sheep . "
43021017	He asked a third time , " Simon son of John , do you love me ? " Peter was sad that Jesus asked him a third time , " Do you love me ? " He replied , " Lord , you know everything ; you know I love you . " Jesus said to him , " Feed my sheep .
43021018	I assure you that when you were younger you tied your own belt and walked around wherever you wanted . When you grow old , you will stretch out your hands and another will tie your belt and lead you where you don’t want to go . "
43021019	He said this to show the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God . After saying this , Jesus said to Peter , " Follow me . "
43021020	Peter turned around and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them . This was the one who had leaned against Jesus at the meal and asked him , " Lord , who is going to betray you ? "
43021021	When Peter saw this disciple , he said to Jesus , " Lord , what about him ? "
43021022	Jesus replied , " If I want him to remain until I come , what difference does that make to you ? You must follow me . "
43021023	Therefore , the word spread among the brothers and sisters that this disciple wouldn’t die . However , Jesus didn’t say he wouldn’t die , but only , " If I want him to remain until I come , what difference does that make to you ? "
43021024	This is the disciple who testifies concerning these things and who wrote them down . We know that his testimony is true .
43021025	Jesus did many other things as well . If all of them were recorded , I imagine the world itself wouldn’t have enough room for the scrolls that would be written .
44001001	Theophilus , the first scroll I wrote concerned everything Jesus did and taught from the beginning ,
44001002	right up to the day when he was taken up into heaven . Before he was taken up , working in the power of the Holy Spirit , Jesus instructed the apostles he had chosen .
44001003	After his suffering , he showed them that he was alive with many convincing proofs . He appeared to them over a period of forty days , speaking to them about God’s kingdom .
44001004	While they were eating together , he ordered them not to leave Jerusalem but to wait for what the Father had promised . He said , " This is what you heard from me :
44001005	John baptized with water , but in only a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit . "
44001006	As a result , those who had gathered together asked Jesus , " Lord , are you going to restore the kingdom to Israel now ? "
44001007	Jesus replied , " It isn’t for you to know the times or seasons that the Father has set by his own authority .
44001008	Rather , you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you , and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem , in all Judea and Samaria , and to the end of the earth . "
44001009	After Jesus said these things , as they were watching , he was lifted up and a cloud took him out of their sight .
44001010	While he was going away and as they were staring toward heaven , suddenly two men in white robes stood next to them .
44001011	They said , " Galileans , why are you standing here , looking toward heaven ? This Jesus , who was taken up from you into heaven , will come in the same way that you saw him go into heaven . "
44001012	Then they returned to Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives , which is near Jerusalem — a sabbath day’s journey away .
44001013	When they entered the city , they went to the upstairs room where they were staying . Peter , John , James , and Andrew ; Philip and Thomas ; Bartholomew and Matthew ; James , Alphaeus’ son ; Simon the zealot ; and Judas , James’ son —
44001014	all were united in their devotion to prayer , along with some women , including Mary the mother of Jesus , and his brothers .
44001015	During this time , the family of believers was a company of about one hundred twenty persons . Peter stood among them and said ,
44001016	" Brothers and sisters , the scripture that the Holy Spirit announced beforehand through David had to be fulfilled . This was the scripture concerning Judas , who became a guide for those who arrested Jesus .
44001017	This happened even though he was one of us and received a share of this ministry . " (
44001018	In fact , he bought a field with the payment he received for his injustice . Falling headfirst , he burst open in the middle and all his intestines spilled out .
44001019	This became known to everyone living in Jerusalem , so they called that field in their own language Hakeldama , or " Field of Blood . " )
44001020	“ It is written in the Psalms scroll , Let his home become deserted and let there be no one living in it ; and Give his position of leadership to another .
44001021	" Therefore , we must select one of those who have accompanied us during the whole time the Lord Jesus lived among us ,
44001022	beginning from the baptism of John until the day when Jesus was taken from us . This person must become along with us a witness to his resurrection . "
44001023	So they nominated two : Joseph called Barsabbas , who was also known as Justus , and Matthias .
44001024	They prayed , " Lord , you know everyone’s deepest thoughts and desires . Show us clearly which one you have chosen from among these two
44001025	to take the place of this ministry and apostleship , from which Judas turned away to go to his own place . "
44001026	When they cast lots , the lot fell on Matthias . He was added to the eleven apostles .
44002001	When Pentecost Day arrived , they were all together in one place .
44002002	Suddenly a sound from heaven like the howling of a fierce wind filled the entire house where they were sitting .
44002003	They saw what seemed to be individual flames of fire alighting on each one of them .
44002004	They were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages as the Spirit enabled them to speak .
44002005	There were pious Jews from every nation under heaven living in Jerusalem .
44002006	When they heard this sound , a crowd gathered . They were mystified because everyone heard them speaking in their native languages .
44002007	They were surprised and amazed , saying , " Look , aren’t all the people who are speaking Galileans , every one of them ?
44002008	How then can each of us hear them speaking in our native language ?
44002009	Parthians , Medes , and Elamites ; as well as residents of Mesopotamia , Judea , and Cappadocia , Pontus and Asia ,
44002010	Phrygia and Pamphylia , Egypt and the regions of Libya bordering Cyrene ; and visitors from Rome ( both Jews and converts to Judaism ) ,
44002011	Cretans and Arabs — we hear them declaring the mighty works of God in our own languages ! "
44002012	They were all surprised and bewildered . Some asked each other , " What does this mean ? "
44002013	Others jeered at them , saying , " They’re full of new wine ! "
44002014	Peter stood with the other eleven apostles . He raised his voice and declared , “ Judeans and everyone living in Jerusalem ! Know this ! Listen carefully to my words !
44002015	These people aren’t drunk , as you suspect ; after all , it’s only nine o’clock in the morning !
44002016	Rather , this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel :
44002017	In the last days , God says , I will pour out my Spirit on all people . Your sons and daughters will prophesy . Your young will see visions . Your elders will dream dreams .
44002018	Even upon my servants , men and women ,
44002019	I will cause wonders to occur in the heavens above and signs on the earth below ,
44002020	The sun will be changed into darkness , and the moon will be changed into blood ,
44002021	And everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved .
44002022	“ Fellow Israelites , listen to these words ! Jesus the Nazarene was a man whose credentials God proved to you through miracles , wonders , and signs , which God performed through him among you . You yourselves know this .
44002023	In accordance with God’s established plan and foreknowledge , he was betrayed . You , with the help of wicked men , had Jesus killed by nailing him to a cross .
44002024	God raised him up ! God freed him from death’s dreadful grip , since it was impossible for death to hang on to him .
44002025	David says about him , I foresaw that the Lord was always with me ; because he is at my right hand I won’t be shaken .
44002026	Therefore , my heart was glad and my tongue rejoiced . Moreover , my body will live in hope , nor permit your holy one to experience decay .
44002028	You have shown me the paths of life ; your presence will fill me with happiness .
44002029	“ Brothers and sisters , I can speak confidently about the patriarch David . He died and was buried , and his tomb is with us to this very day .
44002030	Because he was a prophet , he knew that God promised him with a solemn pledge to seat one of his descendants on his throne .
44002031	Having seen this beforehand , David spoke about the resurrection of Christ , that he wasn’t abandoned to the grave , nor did his body experience decay .
44002032	This Jesus , God raised up . We are all witnesses to that fact .
44002033	He was exalted to God’s right side and received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit . He poured out this Spirit , and you are seeing and hearing the results of his having done so .
44002034	David didn’t ascend into heaven . Yet he says , The Lord said to my Lord , ‘ Sit at my right side ,
44002035	until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet . ’
44002036	" Therefore , let all Israel know beyond question that God has made this Jesus , whom you crucified , both Lord and Christ . "
44002037	When the crowd heard this , they were deeply troubled . They said to Peter and the other apostles , " Brothers , what should we do ? "
44002038	Peter replied , " Change your hearts and lives . Each of you must be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins . Then you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit .
44002039	This promise is for you , your children , and for all who are far away — as many as the Lord our God invites . "
44002040	With many other words he testified to them and encouraged them , saying , " Be saved from this perverse generation . "
44002041	Those who accepted Peter’s message were baptized . God brought about three thousand people into the community on that day .
44002042	The believers devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching , to the community , to their shared meals , and to their prayers .
44002043	A sense of awe came over everyone . God performed many wonders and signs through the apostles .
44002044	All the believers were united and shared everything .
44002045	They would sell pieces of property and possessions and distribute the proceeds to everyone who needed them .
44002046	Every day , they met together in the temple and ate in their homes . They shared food with gladness and simplicity .
44002047	They praised God and demonstrated God’s goodness to everyone . The Lord added daily to the community those who were being saved .
44003001	Peter and John were going up to the temple at three o’clock in the afternoon , the established prayer time .
44003002	Meanwhile , a man crippled since birth was being carried in . Every day , people would place him at the temple gate known as the Beautiful Gate so he could ask for money from those entering the temple .
44003003	When he saw Peter and John about to enter , he began to ask them for a gift .
44003004	Peter and John stared at him . Peter said , " Look at us ! "
44003005	So the man gazed at them , expecting to receive something from them .
44003006	Peter said , " I don’t have any money , but I will give you what I do have . In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene , rise up and walk ! "
44003007	Then he grasped the man’s right hand and raised him up . At once his feet and ankles became strong .
44003008	Jumping up , he began to walk around . He entered the temple with them , walking , leaping , and praising God .
44003009	All the people saw him walking and praising God .
44003010	They recognized him as the same one who used to sit at the temple’s Beautiful Gate asking for money . They were filled with amazement and surprise at what had happened to him .
44003011	While the healed man clung to Peter and John , all the people rushed toward them at Solomon’s Porch , completely amazed .
44003012	Seeing this , Peter addressed the people : “ You Israelites , why are you amazed at this ? Why are you staring at us as if we made him walk by our own power or piety ?
44003013	The God of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob — the God of our ancestors — has glorified his servant Jesus . This is the one you handed over and denied in Pilate’s presence , even though he had already decided to release him .
44003014	You rejected the holy and righteous one , and asked that a murderer be released to you instead .
44003015	You killed the author of life , the very one whom God raised from the dead . We are witnesses of this .
44003016	His name itself has made this man strong . That is , because of faith in Jesus’ name , God has strengthened this man whom you see and know . The faith that comes through Jesus gave him complete health right before your eyes .
44003017	" Brothers and sisters , I know you acted in ignorance . So did your rulers .
44003018	But this is how God fulfilled what he foretold through all the prophets : that his Christ would suffer .
44003019	Change your hearts and lives ! Turn back to God so that your sins may be wiped away .
44003020	Then the Lord will provide a season of relief from the distress of this age and he will send Jesus , whom he handpicked to be your Christ .
44003021	Jesus must remain in heaven until the restoration of all things , about which God spoke long ago through his holy prophets .
44003022	Moses said , The Lord your God will raise up from your own people a prophet like me . Listen to whatever he tells you .
44003023	Whoever doesn’t listen to that prophet will be totally cut off from the people .
44003024	All the prophets who spoke — from Samuel forward — announced these days .
44003025	You are the heirs of the prophets and the covenant that God made with your ancestors when he told Abraham , Through your descendants , all the families on earth will be blessed .
44003026	After God raised his servant , he sent him to you first — to bless you by enabling each of you to turn from your evil ways . "
44004001	While Peter and John were speaking to the people , the priests , the captain of the temple guard , and the Sadducees confronted them .
44004002	They were incensed that the apostles were teaching the people and announcing that the resurrection of the dead was happening because of Jesus .
44004003	They seized Peter and John and put them in prison until the next day . ( It was already evening . )
44004004	Many who heard the word became believers , and their number grew to about five thousand .
44004005	The next day the leaders , elders , and legal experts gathered in Jerusalem ,
44004006	along with Annas the high priest , Caiaphas , John , Alexander , and others from the high priest’s family .
44004007	They had Peter and John brought before them and asked , " By what power or in what name did you do this ? "
44004008	Then Peter , inspired by the Holy Spirit , answered , " Leaders of the people and elders ,
44004009	are we being examined today because something good was done for a sick person , a good deed that healed him ?
44004010	If so , then you and all the people of Israel need to know that this man stands healthy before you because of the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene — whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead .
44004011	This Jesus is the stone you builders rejected ; he has become the cornerstone !
44004012	Salvation can be found in no one else . Throughout the whole world , no other name has been given among humans through which we must be saved . "
44004013	The council was caught by surprise by the confidence with which Peter and John spoke . After all , they understood that these apostles were uneducated and inexperienced . They also recognized that they had been followers of Jesus .
44004014	However , since the healed man was standing with Peter and John before their own eyes , they had no rebuttal .
44004015	After ordering them to wait outside , the council members began to confer with each other .
44004016	" What should we do with these men ? Everyone living in Jerusalem is aware of the sign performed through them . It’s obvious to everyone and we can’t deny it .
44004017	To keep it from spreading further among the people , we need to warn them not to speak to anyone in this name . "
44004018	When they called Peter and John back , they demanded that they stop all speaking and teaching in the name of Jesus .
44004019	Peter and John responded , " It’s up to you to determine whether it’s right before God to obey you rather than God .
44004020	As for us , we can’t stop speaking about what we have seen and heard . "
44004021	They threatened them further , then released them . Because of public support for Peter and John , they couldn’t find a way to punish them . Everyone was praising God for what had happened ,
44004022	because the man who had experienced this sign of healing was over 40 years old .
44004023	After their release , Peter and John returned to the brothers and sisters and reported everything the chief priests and elders had said .
44004024	They listened , then lifted their voices in unison to God , " Master , you are the one who created the heaven , the earth , the sea , and everything in them .
44004025	You are the one who spoke by the Holy Spirit through our ancestor David , your servant : Why did the Gentiles rage , and the peoples plot in vain ?
44004026	The kings of the earth took their stand and the rulers gathered together as one against the Lord and against his Christ .
44004027	Indeed , both Herod and Pontius Pilate , with Gentiles and Israelites , did gather in this city against your holy servant Jesus , whom you anointed .
44004028	They did what your power and plan had already determined would happen .
44004029	Now , Lord , take note of their threats and enable your servants to speak your word with complete confidence .
44004030	Stretch out your hand to bring healing and enable signs and wonders to be performed through the name of Jesus , your holy servant . "
44004031	After they prayed , the place where they were gathered was shaken . They were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began speaking God’s word with confidence .
44004032	The community of believers was one in heart and mind . None of them would say , " This is mine ! " about any of their possessions , but held everything in common .
44004033	The apostles continued to bear powerful witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus , and an abundance of grace was at work among them all .
44004034	There were no needy persons among them . Those who owned properties or houses would sell them , bring the proceeds from the sales ,
44004035	and place them in the care and under the authority of the apostles . Then it was distributed to anyone who was in need .
44004036	Joseph , whom the apostles nicknamed Barnabas ( that is , " one who encourages " ) , was a Levite from Cyprus .
44004037	He owned a field , sold it , brought the money , and placed it in the care and under the authority of the apostles .
44005001	However , a man named Ananias , along with his wife Sapphira , sold a piece of property .
44005002	With his wife’s knowledge , he withheld some of the proceeds from the sale . He brought the rest and placed it in the care and under the authority of the apostles .
44005003	Peter asked , " Ananias , how is it that Satan has influenced you to lie to the Holy Spirit by withholding some of the proceeds from the sale of your land ?
44005004	Wasn’t that property yours to keep ? After you sold it , wasn’t the money yours to do with whatever you wanted ? What made you think of such a thing ? You haven’t lied to other people but to God ! "
44005005	When Ananias heard these words , he dropped dead . Everyone who heard this conversation was terrified .
44005006	Some young men stood up , wrapped up his body , carried him out , and buried him .
44005007	About three hours later , his wife entered , but she didn’t know what had happened to her husband .
44005008	Peter asked her , " Tell me , did you and your husband receive this price for the field ? " She responded , " Yes , that’s the amount . "
44005009	He replied , " How could you scheme with each other to challenge the Lord’s Spirit ? Look ! The feet of those who buried your husband are at the door . They will carry you out too . "
44005010	At that very moment , she dropped dead at his feet . When the young men entered and found her dead , they carried her out and buried her with her husband .
44005011	Trepidation and dread seized the whole church and all who heard what had happened .
44005012	The apostles performed many signs and wonders among the people . They would come together regularly at Solomon’s Porch .
44005013	No one from outside the church dared to join them , even though the people spoke highly of them .
44005014	Indeed , more and more believers in the Lord , large numbers of both men and women , were added to the church .
44005015	As a result , they would even bring the sick out into the main streets and lay them on cots and mats so that at least Peter’s shadow could fall on some of them as he passed by .
44005016	Even large numbers of persons from towns around Jerusalem would gather , bringing the sick and those harassed by unclean spirits . Everyone was healed .
44005017	The high priest , together with his allies , the Sadducees , was overcome with jealousy .
44005018	They seized the apostles and made a public show of putting them in prison .
44005019	An angel from the Lord opened the prison doors during the night and led them out . The angel told them ,
44005020	" Go , take your place in the temple , and tell the people everything about this new life . "
44005021	Early in the morning , they went into the temple as they had been told and began to teach . When the high priest and his colleagues gathered , they convened the Jerusalem Council , that is , the full assembly of Israel’s elders . They sent word to the prison to have the apostles brought before them .
44005022	However , the guards didn’t find them in the prison . They returned and reported ,
44005023	" We found the prison locked and well-secured , with guards standing at the doors , but when we opened the doors we found no one inside ! "
44005024	When they received this news , the captain of the temple guard and the chief priests were baffled and wondered what might be happening .
44005025	Just then , someone arrived and announced , " Look ! The people you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people ! "
44005026	Then the captain left with his guards and brought the apostles back . They didn’t use force because they were afraid the people would stone them .
44005027	The apostles were brought before the council where the high priest confronted them :
44005028	" In no uncertain terms , we demanded that you not teach in this name . And look at you ! You have filled Jerusalem with your teaching . And you are determined to hold us responsible for this man’s death . "
44005029	Peter and the apostles replied , " We must obey God rather than humans !
44005030	The God of our ancestors raised Jesus from the dead — whom you killed by hanging him on a tree .
44005031	God has exalted Jesus to his right side as leader and savior so that he could enable Israel to change its heart and life and to find forgiveness for sins .
44005032	We are witnesses of such things , as is the Holy Spirit , whom God has given to those who obey him . "
44005033	When the council members heard this , they became furious and wanted to kill the apostles .
44005034	One council member , a Pharisee and teacher of the Law named Gamaliel , well-respected by all the people , stood up and ordered that the men be taken outside for a few moments .
44005035	He said , " Fellow Israelites , consider carefully what you intend to do to these people .
44005036	Some time ago , Theudas appeared , claiming to be somebody , and some four hundred men joined him . After he was killed , all of his followers scattered , and nothing came of that .
44005037	Afterward , at the time of the census , Judas the Galilean appeared and got some people to follow him in a revolt . He was killed too , and all his followers scattered far and wide .
44005038	Here’s my recommendation in this case : Distance yourselves from these men . Let them go ! If their plan or activity is of human origin , it will end in ruin .
44005039	If it originates with God , you won’t be able to stop them . Instead , you would actually find yourselves fighting God ! " The council was convinced by his reasoning .
44005040	After calling the apostles back , they had them beaten . They ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus , then let them go .
44005041	The apostles left the council rejoicing because they had been regarded as worthy to suffer disgrace for the sake of the name .
44005042	Every day they continued to teach and proclaim the good news that Jesus is the Christ , both in the temple and in houses .
44006001	About that time , while the number of disciples continued to increase , a complaint arose . Greek-speaking disciples accused the Aramaic-speaking disciples because their widows were being overlooked in the daily food service .
44006002	The Twelve called a meeting of all the disciples and said , " It isn’t right for us to set aside proclamation of God’s word in order to serve tables .
44006003	Brothers and sisters , carefully choose seven well-respected men from among you . They must be well-respected and endowed by the Spirit with exceptional wisdom . We will put them in charge of this concern .
44006004	As for us , we will devote ourselves to prayer and the service of proclaiming the word . "
44006005	This proposal pleased the entire community . They selected Stephen , a man endowed by the Holy Spirit with exceptional faith , Philip , Prochorus , Nicanor , Timon , Parmenas , and Nicolaus from Antioch , a convert to Judaism .
44006006	The community presented these seven to the apostles , who prayed and laid their hands on them .
44006007	God’s word continued to grow . The number of disciples in Jerusalem increased significantly . Even a large group of priests embraced the faith .
44006008	Stephen , who stood out among the believers for the way God’s grace was at work in his life and for his exceptional endowment with divine power , was doing great wonders and signs among the people .
44006009	Opposition arose from some who belonged to the so-called Synagogue of Former Slaves . Members from Cyrene , Alexandria , Cilicia , and Asia entered into debate with Stephen .
44006010	However , they couldn’t resist the wisdom the Spirit gave him as he spoke .
44006011	Then they secretly enticed some people to claim , " We heard him insult Moses and God . "
44006012	They stirred up the people , the elders , and the legal experts . They caught Stephen , dragged him away , and brought him before the Jerusalem Council .
44006013	Before the council , they presented false witnesses who testified , " This man never stops speaking against this holy place and the Law .
44006014	In fact , we heard him say that this man Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and alter the customary practices Moses gave us . "
44006015	Everyone seated in the council stared at Stephen , and they saw that his face was radiant , just like an angel’s .
44007001	The high priest asked , " Are these accusations true ? "
44007002	Stephen responded , “ Brothers and fathers , listen to me . Our glorious God appeared to our ancestor Abraham while he was still in Mesopotamia , before he settled in Haran .
44007003	God told him , ‘ Leave your homeland and kin , and go to the land that I will show you . ’
44007004	So Abraham left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran . After Abraham’s father died , God had him resettle in this land where you now live .
44007005	God didn’t give him an inheritance here , not even a square foot of land . However , God did promise to give the land as his possession to him and to his descendants , even though Abraham had no child .
44007006	God put it this way : His descendants will be strangers in a land that belongs to others , who will enslave them and abuse them for four hundred years .
44007007	And I will condemn the nation they serve as slaves , God said , and afterward they will leave that land and serve me in this place .
44007008	God gave him the covenant confirmed through circumcision . Accordingly , eight days after Isaac’s birth , Abraham circumcised him . Isaac did the same with Jacob , and Jacob with the twelve patriarchs .
44007009	“ Because the patriarchs were jealous of Joseph , they sold him into slavery in Egypt . God was with him , however ,
44007010	and rescued him from all his troubles . The grace and wisdom he gave Joseph were recognized by Pharaoh , king of Egypt , who appointed him ruler over Egypt and over his whole palace .
44007011	A famine came upon all Egypt and Canaan , and great hardship came with it . Our ancestors had nothing to eat .
44007012	When Jacob heard there was grain in Egypt , he sent our ancestors there for the first time .
44007013	During their second visit , Joseph told his brothers who he was , and Pharaoh learned about Joseph’s family .
44007014	Joseph sent for his father Jacob and all his relatives — seventy-five in all — and invited them to live with him .
44007015	So Jacob went down to Egypt , where he and our ancestors died .
44007016	Their bodies were brought back to Shechem and placed in the tomb that Abraham had purchased for a certain sum of money from Hamor’s children , who lived in Shechem .
44007017	“ When it was time for God to keep the promise he made to Abraham , the number of our people in Egypt had greatly expanded .
44007018	But then another king rose to power over Egypt who didn’t know anything about Joseph .
44007019	He exploited our people and abused our ancestors . He even forced them to abandon their newly born babies so they would die .
44007020	That’s when Moses was born . He was highly favored by God , and for three months his parents cared for him in their home .
44007021	After he was abandoned , Pharaoh’s daughter adopted and cared for him as though he were her own son .
44007022	Moses learned everything Egyptian wisdom had to offer , and he was a man of powerful words and deeds .
44007023	“ When Moses was 40 years old , he decided to visit his family , the Israelites .
44007024	He saw one of them being wronged so he came to his rescue and evened the score by killing the Egyptian .
44007025	He expected his own kin to understand that God was using him to rescue them , but they didn’t .
44007026	The next day he came upon some Israelites who were caught up in an argument . He tried to make peace between them by saying , ‘ You are brothers ! Why are you harming each other ? ’
44007027	The one who started the fight against his neighbor pushed Moses aside and said , ‘ Who appointed you as our leader and judge ?
44007028	Are you planning to kill me like you killed that Egyptian yesterday ? ’
44007029	When Moses heard this , he fled to Midian , where he lived as an immigrant and had two sons .
44007030	“ Forty years later , an angel appeared to Moses in the flame of a burning bush in the wilderness near Mount Sinai .
44007031	Enthralled by the sight , Moses approached to get a closer look and he heard the Lord’s voice :
44007032	‘ I am the God of your ancestors , the God of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . ’ Trembling with fear , Moses didn’t dare to investigate any further .
44007033	The Lord continued , ‘ Remove the sandals from your feet , for the place where you are standing is holy ground .
44007034	I have clearly seen the oppression my people have experienced in Egypt , and I have heard their groaning . I have come down to rescue them . Come ! I am sending you to Egypt . ’
44007035	“ This is the same Moses whom they rejected when they asked , ‘ Who appointed you as our leader and judge ? ’ This is the Moses whom God sent as leader and deliverer . God did this with the help of the angel who appeared before him in the bush .
44007036	This man led them out after he performed wonders and signs in Egypt at the Red Sea and for forty years in the wilderness .
44007037	This is the Moses who told the Israelites , ‘ God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your own people . ’
44007038	This is the one who was in the assembly in the wilderness with our ancestors and with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai . He is the one who received life-giving words to give to us .
44007039	He’s also the one whom our ancestors refused to obey . Instead , they pushed him aside and , in their thoughts and desires , returned to Egypt .
44007040	They told Aaron , ‘ Make us gods that will lead us . As for this Moses who led us out of Egypt , we don’t know what’s happened to him ! ’
44007041	That’s when they made an idol in the shape of a calf , offered a sacrifice to it , and began to celebrate what they had made with their own hands .
44007042	So God turned away from them and handed them over to worship the stars in the sky , just as it is written in the scroll of the Prophets : Did you bring sacrifices and offerings to me for forty years in the wilderness , house of Israel ?
44007043	No ! Instead , you took the tent of Moloch with you , and the star of your god Rephan , the images that you made in order to worship them .
44007044	“ The tent of testimony was with our ancestors in the wilderness . Moses built it just as he had been instructed by the one who spoke to him and according to the pattern he had seen .
44007045	In time , when they had received the tent , our ancestors carried it with them when , under Joshua’s leadership , they took possession of the land from the nations whom God expelled . This tent remained in the land until the time of David .
44007046	God approved of David , who asked that he might provide a dwelling place for the God of Jacob .
44007047	But it was Solomon who actually built a house for God .
44007048	However , the Most High doesn’t live in houses built by human hands . As the prophet says ,
44007049	Heaven is my throne , and the earth is my footstool . ‘ What kind of house will you build for me , ’ says the Lord , ‘ or where is my resting place ?
44007050	Didn’t I make all these things with my own hand ? ’
44007051	" You stubborn people ! In your thoughts and hearing , you are like those who have had no part in God’s covenant ! You continuously set yourself against the Holy Spirit , just like your ancestors did .
44007052	Was there a single prophet your ancestors didn’t harass ? They even killed those who predicted the coming of the righteous one , and you’ve betrayed and murdered him !
44007053	You received the Law given by angels , but you haven’t kept it . "
44007054	Once the council members heard these words , they were enraged and began to grind their teeth at Stephen .
44007055	But Stephen , enabled by the Holy Spirit , stared into heaven and saw God’s majesty and Jesus standing at God’s right side .
44007056	He exclaimed , " Look ! I can see heaven on display and the Human One standing at God’s right side ! "
44007057	At this , they shrieked and covered their ears . Together , they charged at him ,
44007058	threw him out of the city , and began to stone him . The witnesses placed their coats in the care of a young man named Saul .
44007059	As they battered him with stones , Stephen prayed , " Lord Jesus , accept my life ! "
44007060	Falling to his knees , he shouted , " Lord , don’t hold this sin against them ! " Then he died .
44008001	Saul was in full agreement with Stephen’s murder . At that time , the church in Jerusalem began to be subjected to vicious harassment . Everyone except the apostles was scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria .
44008002	Some pious men buried Stephen and deeply grieved over him .
44008003	Saul began to wreak havoc against the church . Entering one house after another , he would drag off both men and women and throw them into prison .
44008004	Those who had been scattered moved on , preaching the good news along the way .
44008005	Philip went down to a city in Samaria and began to preach Christ to them .
44008006	The crowds were united by what they heard Philip say and the signs they saw him perform , and they gave him their undivided attention .
44008007	With loud shrieks , unclean spirits came out of many people , and many who were paralyzed or crippled were healed .
44008008	There was great rejoicing in that city .
44008009	Before Philip’s arrival , a certain man named Simon had practiced sorcery in that city and baffled the people of Samaria . He claimed to be a great person .
44008010	Everyone , from the least to the greatest , gave him their undivided attention and referred to him as " the power of God called Great . "
44008011	He had their attention because he had baffled them with sorcery for a long time .
44008012	After they came to believe Philip , who preached the good news about God’s kingdom and the name of Jesus Christ , both men and women were baptized .
44008013	Even Simon himself came to believe and was baptized . Afterward , he became one of Philip’s supporters . As he saw firsthand the signs and great miracles that were happening , he was astonished .
44008014	When word reached the apostles in Jerusalem that Samaria had accepted God’s word , they commissioned Peter and John to go to Samaria .
44008015	Peter and John went down to Samaria where they prayed that the new believers would receive the Holy Spirit . (
44008016	This was because the Holy Spirit had not yet fallen on any of them ; they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus . )
44008017	So Peter and John laid their hands on them , and they received the Holy Spirit .
44008018	When Simon perceived that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles’ hands , he offered them money .
44008019	He said , " Give me this authority too so that anyone on whom I lay my hands will receive the Holy Spirit . "
44008020	Peter responded , " May your money be condemned to hell along with you because you believed you could buy God’s gift with money !
44008021	You can have no part or share in God’s word because your heart isn’t right with God .
44008022	Therefore , change your heart and life ! Turn from your wickedness ! Plead with the Lord in the hope that your wicked intent can be forgiven ,
44008023	for I see that your bitterness has poisoned you and evil has you in chains . "
44008024	Simon replied , " All of you , please , plead to the Lord for me so that nothing of what you have said will happen to me ! "
44008025	After the apostles had testified and proclaimed the Lord’s word , they returned to Jerusalem , preaching the good news to many Samaritan villages along the way .
44008026	An angel from the Lord spoke to Philip , " At noon , take the road that leads from Jerusalem to Gaza . " ( This is a desert road . )
44008027	So he did . Meanwhile , an Ethiopian man was on his way home from Jerusalem , where he had come to worship . He was a eunuch and an official responsible for the entire treasury of Candace . ( Candace is the title given to the Ethiopian queen . )
44008028	He was reading the prophet Isaiah while sitting in his carriage .
44008029	The Spirit told Philip , " Approach this carriage and stay with it . "
44008030	Running up to the carriage , Philip heard the man reading the prophet Isaiah . He asked , " Do you really understand what you are reading ? "
44008031	The man replied , " Without someone to guide me , how could I ? " Then he invited Philip to climb up and sit with him .
44008032	This was the passage of scripture he was reading : Like a sheep he was led to the slaughter and like a lamb before its shearer is silent so he didn’t open his mouth .
44008033	In his humiliation justice was taken away from him . Who can tell the story of his descendants
44008034	The eunuch asked Philip , " Tell me , about whom does the prophet say this ? Is he talking about himself or someone else ? "
44008035	Starting with that passage , Philip proclaimed the good news about Jesus to him .
44008036	As they went down the road , they came to some water . The eunuch said , " Look ! Water ! What would keep me from being baptized ? "
44008038	He ordered that the carriage halt . Both Philip and the eunuch went down to the water , where Philip baptized him .
44008039	When they came up out of the water , the Lord’s Spirit suddenly took Philip away . The eunuch never saw him again but went on his way rejoicing .
44008040	Philip found himself in Azotus . He traveled through that area , preaching the good news in all the cities until he reached Caesarea .
44009001	Meanwhile , Saul was still spewing out murderous threats against the Lord’s disciples . He went to the high priest ,
44009002	seeking letters to the synagogues in Damascus . If he found persons who belonged to the Way , whether men or women , these letters would authorize him to take them as prisoners to Jerusalem .
44009003	During the journey , as he approached Damascus , suddenly a light from heaven encircled him .
44009004	He fell to the ground and heard a voice asking him , " Saul , Saul , why are you harassing me ? "
44009005	Saul asked , " Who are you , Lord ? " " I am Jesus , whom you are harassing , " came the reply .
44009006	" Now get up and enter the city . You will be told what you must do . "
44009007	Those traveling with him stood there speechless ; they heard the voice but saw no one .
44009008	After they picked Saul up from the ground , he opened his eyes but he couldn’t see . So they led him by the hand into Damascus .
44009009	For three days he was blind and neither ate nor drank anything .
44009010	In Damascus there was a certain disciple named Ananias . The Lord spoke to him in a vision , " Ananias ! " He answered , " Yes , Lord . "
44009011	The Lord instructed him , " Go to Judas’ house on Straight Street and ask for a man from Tarsus named Saul . He is praying .
44009012	In a vision he has seen a man named Ananias enter and put his hands on him to restore his sight . "
44009013	Ananias countered , " Lord , I have heard many reports about this man . People say he has done horrible things to your holy people in Jerusalem .
44009014	He’s here with authority from the chief priests to arrest everyone who calls on your name . "
44009015	The Lord replied , " Go ! This man is the agent I have chosen to carry my name before Gentiles , kings , and Israelites .
44009016	I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name . "
44009017	Ananias went to the house . He placed his hands on Saul and said , " Brother Saul , the Lord sent me — Jesus , who appeared to you on the way as you were coming here . He sent me so that you could see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit . "
44009018	Instantly , flakes fell from Saul’s eyes and he could see again . He got up and was baptized .
44009019	After eating , he regained his strength . He stayed with the disciples in Damascus for several days .
44009020	Right away , he began to preach about Jesus in the synagogues . " He is God’s Son , " he declared .
44009021	Everyone who heard him was baffled . They questioned each other , " Isn’t he the one who was wreaking havoc among those in Jerusalem who called on this name ? Hadn’t he come here to take those same people as prisoners to the chief priests ? "
44009022	But Saul grew stronger and stronger . He confused the Jews who lived in Damascus by proving that Jesus is the Christ .
44009023	After this had gone on for some time , the Jews hatched a plot to kill Saul .
44009024	However , he found out about their scheme . They were keeping watch at the city gates around the clock so they could assassinate him .
44009025	But his disciples took him by night and lowered him in a basket through an opening in the city wall .
44009026	When Saul arrived in Jerusalem , he tried to join the disciples , but they were all afraid of him . They didn’t believe he was really a disciple .
44009027	Then Barnabas brought Saul to the apostles and told them the story about how Saul saw the Lord on the way and that the Lord had spoken to Saul . He also told them about the confidence with which Saul had preached in the name of Jesus in Damascus .
44009028	After this , Saul moved freely among the disciples in Jerusalem and was speaking with confidence in the name of the Lord .
44009029	He got into debates with the Greek-speaking Jews as well , but they tried to kill him .
44009030	When the family of believers learned about this , they escorted him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus .
44009031	Then the church throughout Judea , Galilee , and Samaria enjoyed a time of peace . God strengthened the church , and its life was marked by reverence for the Lord . Encouraged by the Holy Spirit , the church continued to grow in numbers .
44009032	As Peter toured the whole region , he went to visit God’s holy people in Lydda .
44009033	There he found a man named Aeneas who was paralyzed and had been confined to his bed for eight years .
44009034	Peter said to him , " Aeneas , Jesus Christ heals you ! Get up and make your bed . " At once he got up .
44009035	Everyone who lived in Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord .
44009036	In Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha ( in Greek her name is Dorcas ) . Her life overflowed with good works and compassionate acts on behalf of those in need .
44009037	About that time , though , she became so ill that she died . After they washed her body , they laid her in an upstairs room .
44009038	Since Lydda was near Joppa , when the disciples heard that Peter was there , they sent two people to Peter . They urged , " Please come right away ! "
44009039	Peter went with them . Upon his arrival , he was taken to the upstairs room . All the widows stood beside him , crying as they showed the tunics and other clothing Dorcas made when she was alive .
44009040	Peter sent everyone out of the room , then knelt and prayed . He turned to the body and said , " Tabitha , get up ! " She opened her eyes , saw Peter , and sat up .
44009041	He gave her his hand and raised her up . Then he called God’s holy people , including the widows , and presented her alive to them .
44009042	The news spread throughout Joppa , and many put their faith in the Lord .
44009043	Peter stayed for some time in Joppa with a certain tanner named Simon .
44010001	There was a man in Caesarea named Cornelius , a centurion in the Italian Company .
44010002	He and his whole household were pious , Gentile God-worshippers . He gave generously to those in need among the Jewish people and prayed to God constantly .
44010003	One day at nearly three o’clock in the afternoon , he clearly saw an angel from God in a vision . The angel came to him and said , " Cornelius ! "
44010004	Startled , he stared at the angel and replied , " What is it , Lord ? " The angel said , " Your prayers and your compassionate acts are like a memorial offering to God .
44010005	Send messengers to Joppa at once and summon a certain Simon , the one known as Peter .
44010006	He is a guest of Simon the tanner , whose house is near the seacoast . "
44010007	When the angel who was speaking to him had gone , Cornelius summoned two of his household servants along with a pious soldier from his personal staff .
44010008	He explained everything to them , then sent them to Joppa .
44010009	At noon on the following day , as their journey brought them close to the city , Peter went up on the roof to pray .
44010010	He became hungry and wanted to eat . While others were preparing the meal , he had a visionary experience .
44010011	He saw heaven opened up and something like a large linen sheet being lowered to the earth by its four corners .
44010012	Inside the sheet were all kinds of four-legged animals , reptiles , and wild birds .
44010013	A voice told him , " Get up , Peter ! Kill and eat ! "
44010014	Peter exclaimed , " Absolutely not , Lord ! I have never eaten anything impure or unclean . "
44010015	The voice spoke a second time , " Never consider unclean what God has made pure . "
44010016	This happened three times , then the object was suddenly pulled back into heaven .
44010017	Peter was bewildered about the meaning of the vision . Just then , the messengers sent by Cornelius discovered the whereabouts of Simon’s house and arrived at the gate .
44010018	Calling out , they inquired whether the Simon known as Peter was a guest there .
44010019	While Peter was brooding over the vision , the Spirit interrupted him , " Look ! Three people are looking for you .
44010020	Go downstairs . Don’t ask questions ; just go with them because I have sent them . "
44010021	So Peter went downstairs and told them , " I’m the one you are looking for . Why have you come ? "
44010022	They replied , " We’ve come on behalf of Cornelius , a centurion and righteous man , a God-worshipper who is well-respected by all Jewish people . A holy angel directed him to summon you to his house and to hear what you have to say . "
44010023	Peter invited them into the house as his guests . The next day he got up and went with them , together with some of the believers from Joppa .
44010024	They arrived in Caesarea the following day . Anticipating their arrival , Cornelius had gathered his relatives and close friends .
44010025	As Peter entered the house , Cornelius met him and fell at his feet in order to honor him .
44010026	But Peter lifted him up , saying , " Get up ! Like you , I’m just a human . "
44010027	As they continued to talk , Peter went inside and found a large gathering of people .
44010028	He said to them , " You all realize that it is forbidden for a Jew to associate or visit with outsiders . However , God has shown me that I should never call a person impure or unclean .
44010029	For this reason , when you sent for me , I came without objection . I want to know , then , why you sent for me . "
44010030	Cornelius answered , " Four days ago at this same time , three o’clock in the afternoon , I was praying at home . Suddenly a man in radiant clothing stood before me .
44010031	He said , ‘ Cornelius , God has heard your prayers , and your compassionate acts are like a memorial offering to him .
44010032	Therefore , send someone to Joppa and summon Simon , who is known as Peter . He is a guest in the home of Simon the tanner , located near the seacoast . ’
44010033	I sent for you right away , and you were kind enough to come . Now , here we are , gathered in the presence of God to listen to everything the Lord has directed you to say . "
44010034	Peter said , " I really am learning that God doesn’t show partiality to one group of people over another .
44010035	Rather , in every nation , whoever worships him and does what is right is acceptable to him .
44010036	This is the message of peace he sent to the Israelites by proclaiming the good news through Jesus Christ : He is Lord of all !
44010037	You know what happened throughout Judea , beginning in Galilee after the baptism John preached .
44010038	You know about Jesus of Nazareth , whom God anointed with the Holy Spirit and endowed with power . Jesus traveled around doing good and healing everyone oppressed by the devil because God was with him .
44010039	We are witnesses of everything he did , both in Judea and in Jerusalem . They killed him by hanging him on a tree ,
44010040	but God raised him up on the third day and allowed him to be seen ,
44010041	not by everyone but by us . We are witnesses whom God chose beforehand , who ate and drank with him after God raised him from the dead .
44010042	He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead .
44010043	All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name . "
44010044	While Peter was still speaking , the Holy Spirit fell on everyone who heard the word .
44010045	The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles .
44010046	They heard them speaking in other languages and praising God . Peter asked ,
44010047	" These people have received the Holy Spirit just as we have . Surely no one can stop them from being baptized with water , can they ? "
44010048	He directed that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ . Then they invited Peter to stay for several days .
44011001	The apostles and the brothers and sisters throughout Judea heard that even the Gentiles had welcomed God’s word .
44011002	When Peter went up to Jerusalem , the circumcised believers criticized him .
44011003	They accused him , " You went into the home of the uncircumcised and ate with them ! "
44011004	Step-by-step , Peter explained what had happened .
44011005	" I was in the city of Joppa praying when I had a visionary experience . In my vision , I saw something like a large linen sheet being lowered from heaven by its four corners . It came all the way down to me .
44011006	As I stared at it , wondering what it was , I saw four-legged animals — including wild beasts — as well as reptiles and wild birds .
44011007	I heard a voice say , ‘ Get up , Peter ! Kill and eat ! ’
44011008	I responded , ‘ Absolutely not , Lord ! Nothing impure or unclean has ever entered my mouth . ’
44011009	The voice from heaven spoke a second time , ‘ Never consider unclean what God has made pure . ’
44011010	This happened three times , then everything was pulled back into heaven .
44011011	At that moment three men who had been sent to me from Caesarea arrived at the house where we were staying .
44011012	The Spirit told me to go with them even though they were Gentiles . These six brothers also went with me , and we entered that man’s house .
44011013	He reported to us how he had seen an angel standing in his house and saying , ‘ Send to Joppa and summon Simon , who is known as Peter .
44011014	He will tell you how you and your entire household can be saved . ’
44011015	When I began to speak , the Holy Spirit fell on them , just as the Spirit fell on us in the beginning .
44011016	I remembered the Lord’s words : ‘ John will baptize with water , but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit . ’
44011017	If God gave them the same gift he gave us who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ , then who am I ? Could I stand in God’s way ? "
44011018	Once the apostles and other believers heard this , they calmed down . They praised God and concluded , " So then God has enabled Gentiles to change their hearts and lives so that they might have new life . "
44011019	Now those who were scattered as a result of the trouble that occurred because of Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia , Cyprus , and Antioch . They proclaimed the word only to Jews .
44011020	Among them were some people from Cyprus and Cyrene . They entered Antioch and began to proclaim the good news about the Lord Jesus also to Jews who spoke Greek .
44011021	The Lord’s power was with them , and a large number came to believe and turned to the Lord .
44011022	When the church in Jerusalem heard about this , they sent Barnabas to Antioch .
44011023	When he arrived and saw evidence of God’s grace , he was overjoyed and encouraged everyone to remain fully committed to the Lord .
44011024	Barnabas responded in this way because he was a good man , whom the Holy Spirit had endowed with exceptional faith . A considerable number of people were added to the Lord .
44011025	Barnabas went to Tarsus in search of Saul .
44011026	When he found him , he brought him to Antioch . They were there for a whole year , meeting with the church and teaching large numbers of people . It was in Antioch where the disciples were first labeled " Christians . "
44011027	About that time , some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch .
44011028	One of them , Agabus , stood up and , inspired by the Spirit , predicted that a severe famine would overtake the entire Roman world . ( This occurred during Claudius’ rule . )
44011029	The disciples decided they would send support to the brothers and sisters in Judea , with everyone contributing to this ministry according to each person’s abundance .
44011030	They sent Barnabas and Saul to take this gift to the elders .
44012001	About that time King Herod began to harass some who belonged to the church .
44012002	He had James , John’s brother , killed with a sword .
44012003	When he saw that this pleased the Jews , he arrested Peter as well . This happened during the Festival of Unleavened Bread .
44012004	He put Peter in prison , handing him over to four squads of soldiers , sixteen in all , who guarded him . He planned to charge him publicly after the Passover .
44012005	While Peter was held in prison , the church offered earnest prayer to God for him .
44012006	The night before Herod was going to bring Peter’s case forward , Peter was asleep between two soldiers and bound with two chains , with soldiers guarding the prison entrance .
44012007	Suddenly an angel from the Lord appeared and a light shone in the prison cell . After nudging Peter on his side to awaken him , the angel raised him up and said , " Quick ! Get up ! " The chains fell from his wrists .
44012008	The angel continued , " Get dressed . Put on your sandals . " Peter did as he was told . The angel said , " Put on your coat and follow me . "
44012009	Following the angel , Peter left the prison . However , he didn’t realize the angel had actually done all this . He thought he was seeing a vision .
44012010	They passed the first and second guards and came to the iron gate leading to the city . It opened for them by itself . After leaving the prison , they proceeded the length of one street , when abruptly the angel was gone .
44012011	At that , Peter came to his senses and remarked , " Now I’m certain that the Lord sent his angel and rescued me from Herod and from everything the Jewish people expected . "
44012012	Realizing this , he made his way to Mary’s house . ( Mary was John’s mother ; he was also known as Mark . ) Many believers had gathered there and were praying .
44012013	When Peter knocked at the outer gate , a female servant named Rhoda went to answer .
44012014	She was so overcome with joy when she recognized Peter’s voice that she didn’t open the gate . Instead , she ran back in and announced that Peter was standing at the gate .
44012015	" You’ve lost your mind ! " they responded . She stuck by her story with such determination that they began to say , " It must be his guardian angel . "
44012016	Meanwhile , Peter remained outside , knocking at the gate . They finally opened the gate and saw him there , and they were astounded .
44012017	He gestured with his hand to quiet them down , then recounted how the Lord led him out of prison . He said , " Tell this to James and the brothers and sisters . " Then he left for another place .
44012018	The next morning the soldiers were flustered about what had happened to Peter .
44012019	Herod called for a thorough search . When Peter didn’t turn up , Herod interrogated the guards and had them executed . Afterward , Herod left Judea in order to spend some time in Caesarea .
44012020	Herod had been furious with the people of Tyre and Sidon for some time . They made a pact to approach him together , since their region depended on the king’s realm for its food supply . They persuaded Blastus , the king’s personal attendant , to join their cause , then appealed for an end to hostilities .
44012021	On the scheduled day Herod dressed himself in royal attire , seated himself on the throne , and gave a speech to the people .
44012022	Those assembled kept shouting , over and over , " This is a god’s voice , not the voice of a mere human ! "
44012023	Immediately an angel from the Lord struck Herod down , because he didn’t give the honor to God . He was eaten by worms and died .
44012024	God’s word continued to grow and increase .
44012025	Barnabas and Saul returned to Antioch from Jerusalem after completing their mission , bringing with them John , who was also known as Mark .
44013001	The church at Antioch included prophets and teachers : Barnabas , Simeon ( nicknamed Niger ) , Lucius from Cyrene , Manaen ( a childhood friend of Herod the ruler ) , and Saul .
44013002	As they were worshipping the Lord and fasting , the Holy Spirit said , " Appoint Barnabas and Saul to the work I have called them to undertake . "
44013003	After they fasted and prayed , they laid their hands on these two and sent them off .
44013004	After the Holy Spirit sent them on their way , they went down to Seleucia . From there they sailed to Cyprus .
44013005	In Salamis they proclaimed God’s word in the Jewish synagogues . John was with them as their assistant .
44013006	They traveled throughout the island until they arrived at Paphos . There they found a certain man named Bar-Jesus , a Jew who was a false prophet and practiced sorcery .
44013007	He kept company with the governor of that province , an intelligent man named Sergius Paulus . The governor sent for Barnabas and Saul since he wanted to hear God’s word .
44013008	But Elymas the sorcerer ( for that’s what people understood his name meant ) opposed them , trying to steer the governor away from the faith .
44013009	Empowered by the Holy Spirit , Saul , also known as Paul , glared at Bar-Jesus and
44013010	said , " You are a deceiver and trickster ! You devil ! You attack anything that is right ! Will you never stop twisting the straight ways of the Lord into crooked paths ?
44013011	Listen ! The Lord’s power is set against you . You will be blind for a while , unable even to see the daylight . " At once , Bar-Jesus’ eyes were darkened , and he began to grope about for someone to lead him around by the hand .
44013012	When the governor saw what had taken place , he came to believe , for he was astonished by the teaching about the Lord .
44013013	Paul and his companions sailed from Paphos to Perga in Pamphylia . John deserted them there and returned to Jerusalem .
44013014	They went on from Perga and arrived at Antioch in Pisidia . On the Sabbath , they entered and found seats in the synagogue there .
44013015	After the reading of the Law and the Prophets , the synagogue leaders invited them , " Brothers , if one of you has a sermon for the people , please speak . "
44013016	Standing up , Paul gestured with his hand and said , “ Fellow Israelites and Gentile God-worshippers , please listen to me .
44013017	The God of this people Israel chose our ancestors . God made them a great people while they lived as strangers in the land of Egypt . With his great power , he led them out of that country .
44013018	For about forty years , God put up with them in the wilderness .
44013019	God conquered seven nations in the land of Canaan and gave the Israelites their land as an inheritance .
44013020	This happened over a period of about four hundred fifty years . “ After this , he gave them judges until the time of the prophet Samuel .
44013021	The Israelites requested a king , so God gave them Saul , Kish’s son , from the tribe of Benjamin , and he served as their king for forty years .
44013022	After God removed him , he raised up David to be their king . God testified concerning him , ‘ I have found David , Jesse’s son , a man who shares my desires . Whatever my will is , he will do . ’
44013023	From this man’s descendants , God brought to Israel a savior , Jesus , just as he promised .
44013024	Before Jesus’ appearance , John proclaimed to all the Israelites a baptism to show they were changing their hearts and lives .
44013025	As John was completing his mission , he said , ‘ Who do you think I am ? I’m not the one you think I am , but he is coming after me . I’m not worthy to loosen his sandals . ’
44013026	“ Brothers , children of Abraham’s family , and you Gentile God-worshippers , the message about this salvation has been sent to us .
44013027	The people in Jerusalem and their leaders didn’t recognize Jesus . By condemning him they fulfilled the words of the prophets that are read every Sabbath .
44013028	Even though they didn’t find a single legal basis for the death penalty , they asked Pilate to have him executed .
44013029	When they finished doing everything that had been written about him , they took him down from the cross and laid him in a tomb .
44013030	But God raised him from the dead !
44013031	He appeared over many days to those who had traveled with him from Galilee to Jerusalem . They are now his witnesses to the people .
44013032	“ We proclaim to you the good news . What God promised to our ancestors ,
44013033	he has fulfilled for us , their children , by raising up Jesus . As it was written in the second psalm , You are my son ; today I have become your father .
44013034	“ God raised Jesus from the dead , never again to be subjected to death’s decay . Therefore , God said , I will give to you the holy and firm promises I made to David .
44013035	In another place it is said , You will not let your holy one experience death’s decay .
44013036	David served God’s purpose in his own generation , then he died and was buried with his ancestors . He experienced death’s decay ,
44013037	but the one whom God has raised up didn’t experience death’s decay .
44013038	" Therefore , brothers and sisters , know this : Through Jesus we proclaim forgiveness of sins to you . From all those sins from which you couldn’t be put in right relationship with God through Moses’ Law ,
44013039	through Jesus everyone who believes is put in right relationship with God .
44013040	Take care that the prophets’ words don’t apply to you :
44013041	Look , you scoffers , marvel and die . I’m going to do work in your day — a work you won’t believe even if someone told you . "
44013042	As Paul and Barnabas were leaving the synagogue , the people urged them to speak about these things again on the next Sabbath .
44013043	When the people in the synagogue were dismissed , many Jews and devout converts to Judaism accompanied Paul and Barnabas , who urged them to remain faithful to the message of God’s grace .
44013044	On the next Sabbath , almost everyone in the city gathered to hear the Lord’s word .
44013045	When the Jews saw the crowds , they were overcome with jealousy . They argued against what Paul was saying by slandering him .
44013046	Speaking courageously , Paul and Barnabas said , " We had to speak God’s word to you first . Since you reject it and show that you are unworthy to receive eternal life , we will turn to the Gentiles .
44013047	This is what the Lord commanded us : I have made you a light for the Gentiles , so that you could bring salvation to the end of the earth . "
44013048	When the Gentiles heard this , they rejoiced and honored the Lord’s word . Everyone who was appointed for eternal life believed ,
44013049	and the Lord’s word was broadcast throughout the entire region .
44013050	However , the Jews provoked the prominent women among the Gentile God-worshippers , as well as the city’s leaders . They instigated others to harass Paul and Barnabas , and threw them out of their district .
44013051	Paul and Barnabas shook the dust from their feet and went to Iconium .
44013052	Because of the abundant presence of the Holy Spirit in their lives , the disciples were overflowing with happiness .
44014001	The same thing happened in Iconium . Paul and Barnabas entered the Jewish synagogue and spoke as they had before . As a result , a huge number of Jews and Greeks believed .
44014002	However , the Jews who rejected the faith stirred up the Gentiles , poisoning their minds against the brothers .
44014003	Nevertheless , Paul and Barnabas stayed there for quite some time , confidently speaking about the Lord . And the Lord confirmed the word about his grace by the signs and wonders he enabled them to perform .
44014004	The people of the city were divided — some siding with the Jews , others with the Lord’s messengers .
44014005	Then some Gentiles and Jews , including their leaders , hatched a plot to mistreat and stone Paul and Barnabas .
44014006	When they learned of it , these two messengers fled to the Lycaonian cities of Lystra and Derbe and the surrounding area ,
44014007	where they continued to proclaim the good news .
44014008	In Lystra there was a certain man who lacked strength in his legs . He had been crippled since birth and had never walked . Sitting there , he
44014009	heard Paul speaking . Paul stared at him and saw that he believed he could be healed .
44014010	Raising his voice , Paul said , " Stand up straight on your feet ! " He jumped up and began to walk .
44014011	Seeing what Paul had done , the crowd shouted in the Lycaonian language , " The gods have taken human form and come down to visit us ! "
44014012	They referred to Barnabas as Zeus and to Paul as Hermes , since Paul was the main speaker .
44014013	The priest of Zeus , whose temple was located just outside the city , brought bulls and wreaths to the city gates . Along with the crowds , he wanted to offer sacrifices to them .
44014014	When the Lord’s messengers Barnabas and Paul found out about this , they tore their clothes in protest and rushed out into the crowd . They shouted ,
44014015	" People , what are you doing ? We are humans too , just like you ! We are proclaiming the good news to you : turn to the living God and away from such worthless things . He made the heaven , the earth , the sea , and everything in them .
44014016	In the past , he permitted every nation to go its own way .
44014017	Nevertheless , he hasn’t left himself without a witness . He has blessed you by giving you rain from above as well as seasonal harvests , and satisfying you with food and happiness . "
44014018	Even with these words , they barely kept the crowds from sacrificing to them .
44014019	Jews from Antioch and Iconium arrived and won the crowds over . They stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city , supposing he was dead .
44014020	When the disciples surrounded him , he got up and entered the city again . The following day he left with Barnabas for Derbe .
44014021	Paul and Barnabas proclaimed the good news to the people in Derbe and made many disciples . Then they returned to Lystra , Iconium , and Antioch , where
44014022	they strengthened the disciples and urged them to remain firm in the faith . They told them , " If we are to enter God’s kingdom , we must pass through many troubles . "
44014023	They appointed elders for each church . With prayer and fasting , they committed these elders to the Lord , in whom they had placed their trust .
44014024	After Paul and Barnabas traveled through Pisidia , they came to Pamphylia .
44014025	They proclaimed the word in Perga , then went down to Attalia .
44014026	From there they sailed to Antioch , where they had been entrusted by God’s grace to the work they had now completed .
44014027	On their arrival , they gathered the church together and reported everything that God had accomplished through their activity , and how God had opened a door of faith for the Gentiles .
44014028	They stayed with the disciples a long time .
44015001	Some people came down from Judea teaching the family of believers , " Unless you are circumcised according to the custom we’ve received from Moses , you can’t be saved . "
44015002	Paul and Barnabas took sides against these Judeans and argued strongly against their position . The church at Antioch appointed Paul , Barnabas , and several others from Antioch to go up to Jerusalem to set this question before the apostles and the elders .
44015003	The church sent this delegation on their way . They traveled through Phoenicia and Samaria , telling stories about the conversion of the Gentiles to everyone . Their reports thrilled the brothers and sisters .
44015004	When they arrived in Jerusalem , the church , the apostles , and the elders all welcomed them . They gave a full report of what God had accomplished through their activity .
44015005	Some believers from among the Pharisees stood up and claimed , " The Gentiles must be circumcised . They must be required to keep the Law from Moses . "
44015006	The apostles and the elders gathered to consider this matter .
44015007	After much debate , Peter stood and addressed them , " Fellow believers , you know that , early on , God chose me from among you as the one through whom the Gentiles would hear the word of the gospel and come to believe .
44015008	God , who knows people’s deepest thoughts and desires , confirmed this by giving them the Holy Spirit , just as he did to us .
44015009	He made no distinction between us and them , but purified their deepest thoughts and desires through faith .
44015010	Why then are you now challenging God by placing a burden on the shoulders of these disciples that neither we nor our ancestors could bear ?
44015011	On the contrary , we believe that we and they are saved in the same way , by the grace of the Lord Jesus . "
44015012	The entire assembly fell quiet as they listened to Barnabas and Paul describe all the signs and wonders God did among the Gentiles through their activity .
44015013	When Barnabas and Paul also fell silent , James responded , “ Fellow believers , listen to me .
44015014	Simon reported how , in his kindness , God came to the Gentiles in the first place , to raise up from them a people of God .
44015015	The prophets’ words agree with this ; as it is written ,
44015016	After this I will return , The Lord says this , the one who does these things
44015018	known from earliest times .
44015019	" Therefore , I conclude that we shouldn’t create problems for Gentiles who turn to God .
44015020	Instead , we should write a letter , telling them to avoid the pollution associated with idols , sexual immorality , eating meat from strangled animals , and consuming blood .
44015021	After all , Moses has been proclaimed in every city for a long time , and is read aloud every Sabbath in every synagogue . "
44015022	The apostles and the elders , along with the entire church , agreed to send some delegates chosen from among themselves to Antioch , together with Paul and Barnabas . They selected Judas Barsabbas and Silas , who were leaders among the brothers and sisters .
44015023	They were to carry this letter : The apostles and the elders , to the Gentile brothers and sisters in Antioch , Syria , and Cilicia . Greetings !
44015024	We’ve heard that some of our number have disturbed you with unsettling words we didn’t authorize .
44015025	We reached a united decision to select some delegates and send them to you along with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul .
44015026	These people have devoted their lives to the name of our Lord Jesus Christ .
44015027	Therefore , we are sending Judas and Silas . They will confirm what we have written .
44015028	The Holy Spirit has led us to the decision that no burden should be placed on you other than these essentials :
44015029	refuse food offered to idols , blood , the meat from strangled animals , and sexual immorality . You will do well to avoid such things . Farewell .
44015030	When Barnabas , Paul , and the delegates were sent on their way , they went down to Antioch . They gathered the believers and delivered the letter .
44015031	The people read it , delighted with its encouraging message .
44015032	Judas and Silas were prophets , and they said many things that encouraged and strengthened the brothers and sisters .
44015033	Judas and Silas stayed there awhile , then were sent back with a blessing of peace from the brothers and sisters to those who first sent them .
44015035	Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch , where , together with many others , they taught and proclaimed the good news of the Lord’s word .
44015036	Some time later , Paul said to Barnabas , " Let’s go back and visit all the brothers and sisters in every city where we preached the Lord’s word . Let’s see how they are doing . "
44015037	Barnabas wanted to take John Mark with them .
44015038	Paul insisted that they shouldn’t take him along , since he had deserted them in Pamphylia and hadn’t continued with them in their work .
44015039	Their argument became so intense that they went their separate ways . Barnabas took Mark and sailed to Cyprus .
44015040	Paul chose Silas and left , entrusted by the brothers and sisters to the Lord’s grace .
44015041	He traveled through Syria and Cilicia , strengthening the churches .
44016001	Paul reached Derbe , and then Lystra , where there was a disciple named Timothy . He was the son of a believing Jewish woman and a Greek father .
44016002	The brothers and sisters in Lystra and Iconium spoke well of him .
44016003	Paul wanted to take Timothy with him , so he circumcised him . This was because of the Jews who lived in those areas , for they all knew Timothy’s father was Greek .
44016004	As Paul and his companions traveled through the cities , they instructed Gentile believers to keep the regulations put in place by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem .
44016005	So the churches were strengthened in the faith and every day their numbers flourished .
44016006	Paul and his companions traveled throughout the regions of Phrygia and Galatia because the Holy Spirit kept them from speaking the word in the province of Asia .
44016007	When they approached the province of Mysia , they tried to enter the province of Bithynia , but the Spirit of Jesus wouldn’t let them .
44016008	Passing by Mysia , they went down to Troas instead .
44016009	A vision of a man from Macedonia came to Paul during the night . He stood urging Paul , " Come over to Macedonia and help us ! "
44016010	Immediately after he saw the vision , we prepared to leave for the province of Macedonia , concluding that God had called us to proclaim the good news to them .
44016011	We sailed from Troas straight for Samothrace and came to Neapolis the following day .
44016012	From there we went to Philippi , a city of Macedonia’s first district and a Roman colony . We stayed in that city several days .
44016013	On the Sabbath we went outside the city gate to the riverbank , where we thought there might be a place for prayer . We sat down and began to talk with the women who had gathered .
44016014	One of those women was Lydia , a Gentile God-worshipper from the city of Thyatira , a dealer in purple cloth . As she listened , the Lord enabled her to embrace Paul’s message .
44016015	Once she and her household were baptized , she urged , " Now that you have decided that I am a believer in the Lord , come and stay in my house . " And she persuaded us .
44016016	One day , when we were on the way to the place for prayer , we met a slave woman . She had a spirit that enabled her to predict the future . She made a lot of money for her owners through fortune-telling .
44016017	She began following Paul and us , shouting , " These people are servants of the Most High God ! They are proclaiming a way of salvation to you ! "
44016018	She did this for many days . This annoyed Paul so much that he finally turned and said to the spirit , " In the name of Jesus Christ , I command you to leave her ! " It left her at that very moment .
44016019	Her owners realized that their hope for making money was gone . They grabbed Paul and Silas and dragged them before the officials in the city center .
44016020	When her owners approached the legal authorities , they said , " These people are causing an uproar in our city . They are Jews
44016021	who promote customs that we Romans can’t accept or practice . "
44016022	The crowd joined in the attacks against Paul and Silas , so the authorities ordered that they be stripped of their clothes and beaten with a rod .
44016023	When Paul and Silas had been severely beaten , the authorities threw them into prison and ordered the jailer to secure them with great care .
44016024	When he received these instructions , he threw them into the innermost cell and secured their feet in stocks .
44016025	Around midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God , and the other prisoners were listening to them .
44016026	All at once there was such a violent earthquake that it shook the prison’s foundations . The doors flew open and everyone’s chains came loose .
44016027	When the jailer awoke and saw the open doors of the prison , he thought the prisoners had escaped , so he drew his sword and was about to kill himself .
44016028	But Paul shouted loudly , " Don’t harm yourself ! We’re all here ! "
44016029	The jailer called for some lights , rushed in , and fell trembling before Paul and Silas .
44016030	He led them outside and asked , " Honorable masters , what must I do to be rescued ? "
44016031	They replied , " Believe in the Lord Jesus , and you will be saved — you and your entire household . "
44016032	They spoke the Lord’s word to him and everyone else in his house .
44016033	Right then , in the middle of the night , the jailer welcomed them and washed their wounds . He and everyone in his household were immediately baptized .
44016034	He brought them into his home and gave them a meal . He was overjoyed because he and everyone in his household had come to believe in God .
44016035	The next morning the legal authorities sent the police to the jailer with the order " Release those people . "
44016036	So the jailer reported this to Paul , informing him , " The authorities sent word that you both are to be released . You can leave now . Go in peace . "
44016037	Paul told the police , " Even though we are Roman citizens , they beat us publicly without first finding us guilty of a crime , and they threw us into prison . And now they want to send us away secretly ? No way ! They themselves will have to come and escort us out . "
44016038	The police reported this to the legal authorities , who were alarmed to learn that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens .
44016039	They came and consoled Paul and Silas , escorting them out of prison and begging them to leave the city .
44016040	Paul and Silas left the prison and made their way to Lydia’s house where they encouraged the brothers and sisters . Then they left Philippi .
44017001	Paul and Silas journeyed through Amphipolis and Apollonia , then came to Thessalonica , where there was a Jewish synagogue .
44017002	As was Paul’s custom , he entered the synagogue and for three Sabbaths interacted with them on the basis of the scriptures .
44017003	Through his interpretation of the scriptures , he demonstrated that the Christ had to suffer and rise from the dead . He declared , " This Jesus whom I proclaim to you is the Christ . "
44017004	Some were convinced and joined Paul and Silas , including a larger number of Greek God-worshippers and quite a few prominent women .
44017005	But the Jews became jealous and brought along some thugs who were hanging out in the marketplace . They formed a mob and started a riot in the city . They attacked Jason’s house , intending to bring Paul and Silas before the people .
44017006	When they didn’t find them , they dragged Jason and some believers before the city officials . They were shouting , " These people who have been disturbing the peace throughout the empire have also come here .
44017007	What is more , Jason has welcomed them into his home . Every one of them does what is contrary to Caesar’s decrees by naming someone else as king : Jesus . "
44017008	This provoked the crowd and the city officials even more .
44017009	After Jason and the others posted bail , they released them .
44017010	As soon as it was dark , the brothers and sisters sent Paul and Silas on to Beroea . When they arrived , they went to the Jewish synagogue .
44017011	The Beroean Jews were more honorable than those in Thessalonica . This was evident in the great eagerness with which they accepted the word and examined the scriptures each day to see whether Paul and Silas’ teaching was true .
44017012	Many came to believe , including a number of reputable Greek women and many Greek men .
44017013	The Jews from Thessalonica learned that Paul also proclaimed God’s word in Beroea , so they went there too and were upsetting and disturbing the crowds .
44017014	The brothers and sisters sent Paul away to the seacoast at once , but Silas and Timothy remained at Beroea .
44017015	Those who escorted Paul led him as far as Athens , then returned with instructions for Silas and Timothy to come to him as quickly as possible .
44017016	While Paul waited for them in Athens , he was deeply distressed to find that the city was flooded with idols .
44017017	He began to interact with the Jews and Gentile God-worshippers in the synagogue . He also addressed whoever happened to be in the marketplace each day .
44017018	Certain Epicurean and Stoic philosophers engaged him in discussion too . Some said , " What an amateur ! What’s he trying to say ? " Others remarked , " He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign gods . " ( They said this because he was preaching the good news about Jesus and the resurrection . )
44017019	They took him into custody and brought him to the council on Mars Hill . " What is this new teaching ? Can we learn what you are talking about ?
44017020	You’ve told us some strange things and we want to know what they mean . " (
44017021	They said this because all Athenians as well as the foreigners who live in Athens used to spend their time doing nothing but talking about or listening to the newest thing . )
44017022	Paul stood up in the middle of the council on Mars Hill and said , “ People of Athens , I see that you are very religious in every way .
44017023	As I was walking through town and carefully observing your objects of worship , I even found an altar with this inscription : ‘ To an unknown God . ’ What you worship as unknown , I now proclaim to you .
44017024	God , who made the world and everything in it , is Lord of heaven and earth . He doesn’t live in temples made with human hands .
44017025	Nor is God served by human hands , as though he needed something , since he is the one who gives life , breath , and everything else .
44017026	From one person God created every human nation to live on the whole earth , having determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their lands .
44017027	God made the nations so they would seek him , perhaps even reach out to him and find him . In fact , God isn’t far away from any of us .
44017028	In God we live , move , and exist . As some of your own poets said , ‘ We are his offspring . ’
44017029	" Therefore , as God’s offspring , we have no need to imagine that the divine being is like a gold , silver , or stone image made by human skill and thought .
44017030	God overlooks ignorance of these things in times past , but now directs everyone everywhere to change their hearts and lives .
44017031	This is because God has set a day when he intends to judge the world justly by a man he has appointed . God has given proof of this to everyone by raising him from the dead . "
44017032	When they heard about the resurrection from the dead , some began to ridicule Paul . However , others said , " We’ll hear from you about this again . "
44017033	At that , Paul left the council .
44017034	Some people joined him and came to believe , including Dionysius , a member of the council on Mars Hill , a woman named Damaris , and several others .
44018001	After this , Paul left Athens and went to Corinth .
44018002	There he found a Jew named Aquila , a native of Pontus . He had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla because Claudius had ordered all Jews to leave Rome . Paul visited with them .
44018003	Because they practiced the same trade , he stayed and worked with them . They all worked with leather .
44018004	Every Sabbath he interacted with people in the synagogue , trying to convince both Jews and Greeks .
44018005	Once Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia , Paul devoted himself fully to the word , testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ .
44018006	When they opposed and slandered him , he shook the dust from his clothes in protest and said to them , " You are responsible for your own fates ! I’m innocent ! From now on I’ll go to the Gentiles ! "
44018007	He left the synagogue and went next door to the home of Titius Justus , a Gentile God-worshipper .
44018008	Crispus , the synagogue leader , and his entire household came to believe in the Lord . Many Corinthians believed and were baptized after listening to Paul .
44018009	One night the Lord said to Paul in a vision , " Don’t be afraid . Continue speaking . Don’t be silent .
44018010	I’m with you and no one who attacks you will harm you , for I have many people in this city . "
44018011	So he stayed there for eighteen months , teaching God’s word among them .
44018012	Now when Gallio was the governor of the province of Achaia , the Jews united in their opposition against Paul and brought him before the court .
44018013	" This man is persuading others to worship God unlawfully , " they declared .
44018014	Just as Paul was about to speak , Gallio said to the Jews , " If there had been some sort of injury or criminal behavior , I would have reason to accept your complaint .
44018015	However , since these are squabbles about a message , names , and your own Law , deal with them yourselves . I have no desire to sit in judgment over such things . "
44018016	He expelled them from the court ,
44018017	but everyone seized Sosthenes , the synagogue leader , and gave him a beating in the presence of the governor . None of this mattered to Gallio .
44018018	After Paul stayed in Corinth for some time , he said good-bye to the brothers and sisters . At the Corinthian seaport of Cenchreae he had his head shaved , since he had made a solemn promise . Then , accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila , he sailed away to Syria .
44018019	After they arrived in Ephesus , he left Priscilla and Aquila and entered the synagogue and interacted with the Jews .
44018020	They asked him to stay longer , but he declined .
44018021	As he said farewell to them , though , he added , " God willing , I will return . " Then he sailed off from Ephesus .
44018022	He arrived in Caesarea , went up to Jerusalem and greeted the church , and then went down to Antioch .
44018023	After some time there he left and traveled from place to place in the region of Galatia and the district of Phrygia , strengthening all the disciples .
44018024	Meanwhile , a certain Jew named Apollos arrived in Ephesus . He was a native of Alexandria and was well-educated and effective in his use of the scriptures .
44018025	He had been instructed in the way of the Lord and spoke as one stirred up by the Spirit . He taught accurately the things about Jesus , even though he was aware only of the baptism John proclaimed and practiced .
44018026	He began speaking with confidence in the synagogue . When Priscilla and Aquila heard him , they received him into their circle of friends and explained to him God’s way more accurately .
44018027	When he wanted to travel to Achaia , the brothers and sisters encouraged him and wrote to the disciples so they would open their homes to him . Once he arrived , he was of great help to those who had come to believe through grace .
44018028	He would vigorously defeat Jewish arguments in public debate , using the scriptures to prove that Jesus was the Christ .
44019001	While Apollos was in Corinth , Paul took a route through the interior and came to Ephesus , where he found some disciples .
44019002	He asked them , " Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you came to believe ? " They replied , " We’ve not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit . "
44019003	Then he said , " What baptism did you receive , then ? " They answered , " John’s baptism . "
44019004	Paul explained , " John baptized with a baptism by which people showed they were changing their hearts and lives . It was a baptism that told people about the one who was coming after him . This is the one in whom they were to believe . This one is Jesus . "
44019005	After they listened to Paul , they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus .
44019006	When Paul placed his hands on them , the Holy Spirit came on them , and they began speaking in other languages and prophesying .
44019007	Altogether , there were about twelve people .
44019008	Paul went to the synagogue and spoke confidently for the next three months . He interacted with those present and offered convincing arguments concerning the nature of God’s kingdom .
44019009	Some people had closed their minds , though . They refused to believe and publicly slandered the Way . As a result , Paul left them , took the disciples with him , and continued his daily interactions in Tyrannus’ lecture hall .
44019010	This went on for two years , so that everyone living in the province of Asia — both Jews and Greeks — heard the Lord’s word .
44019011	God was doing unusual miracles through Paul .
44019012	Even the small towels and aprons that had touched his skin were taken to the sick , and their diseases were cured and the evil spirits left them .
44019013	There were some Jews who traveled around throwing out evil spirits . They tried to use the power of the name of the Lord Jesus against some people with evil spirits . They said , " In the name of the Jesus whom Paul preaches , I command you ! "
44019014	The seven sons of Sceva , a Jewish chief priest , were doing this .
44019015	The evil spirit replied , " I know Jesus and I’m familiar with Paul , but who are you ? "
44019016	The person who had an evil spirit jumped on them and overpowered them all with such force that they ran out of that house naked and wounded .
44019017	This became known to the Jews and Greeks living in Ephesus . Everyone was seized with fear and they held the name of the Lord Jesus in the highest regard .
44019018	Many of those who had come to believe came , confessing their past practices .
44019019	This included a number of people who practiced sorcery . They collected their sorcery texts and burned them publicly . The value of those materials was calculated at more than someone might make if they worked for one hundred sixty-five years .
44019020	In this way the Lord’s word grew abundantly and strengthened powerfully .
44019021	Once these things had come to an end , Paul , guided by the Spirit , decided to return to Jerusalem , taking a route that would carry him through the provinces of Macedonia and Achaia . He said , " After I have been there , I must visit Rome as well . "
44019022	He sent two of his assistants , Timothy and Erastus , to Macedonia , while he remained awhile in the province of Asia .
44019023	At that time a great disturbance erupted about the Way .
44019024	There was a silversmith named Demetrius . He made silver models of Artemis’ temple , and his business generated a lot of profit for the craftspeople .
44019025	He called a meeting with these craftspeople and others working in related trades and said , " Friends , you know that we make an easy living from this business .
44019026	And you can see and hear that this Paul has convinced and misled a lot of people , not only in Ephesus but also throughout most of the province of Asia . He says that gods made by human hands aren’t really gods .
44019027	This poses a danger not only by discrediting our trade but also by completely dishonoring the great goddess Artemis . The whole province of Asia — indeed , the entire civilized world — worships her , but her splendor will soon be extinguished . "
44019028	Once they heard this , they were beside themselves with anger and began to shout , " Great is Artemis of the Ephesians ! "
44019029	The city was thrown into turmoil . They rushed as one into the theater . They seized Gaius and Aristarchus , Paul’s traveling companions from the province of Macedonia .
44019030	Paul wanted to appear before the assembly , but the disciples wouldn’t allow him .
44019031	Even some officials of the province of Asia , who were Paul’s friends , sent word to him , urging him not to risk going into the theater .
44019032	Meanwhile , the assembly was in a state of confusion . Some shouted one thing , others shouted something else , and most of the crowd didn’t know why they had gathered .
44019033	The Jews sent Alexander to the front , and some of the crowd directed their words toward him . He gestured that he wanted to offer a defense before the assembly ,
44019034	but when they realized he was a Jew , they all shouted in unison , " Great is Artemis of the Ephesians ! " This continued for about two hours .
44019035	The city manager brought order to the crowd and said , " People of Ephesus , doesn’t everyone know that the city of Ephesus is guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of her image , which fell from heaven ?
44019036	Therefore , since these facts are undeniable , you must calm down . Don’t be reckless .
44019037	The men you brought here have neither robbed the temple nor slandered our goddess .
44019038	Therefore , if Demetrius and the craftspeople with him have a charge against anyone , the courts are in session and governors are available . They can press charges against each other there .
44019039	Additional disputes can be resolved in a legal assembly .
44019040	As for us , we are in danger of being charged with rioting today , since we can’t justify this unruly gathering . "
44019041	After he said this , he dismissed the assembly .
44020001	When the riot was over , Paul sent for the disciples , encouraged them , said good-bye , and left for the province of Macedonia .
44020002	He traveled through that region with a message of encouragement . When he came to Greece ,
44020003	he stayed for three months . Because the Jews hatched a plot against Paul as he was about to sail for Syria , he decided instead to return through Macedonia .
44020004	He was accompanied by Sopater , Pyrrhus’ son from Beroea , Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica , Gaius from Derbe , Timothy , and Tychicus and Trophimus from the province of Asia .
44020005	They went on ahead and waited for us in Troas .
44020006	We sailed from Philippi after the Festival of Unleavened Bread and met them five days later in Troas , where we stayed for a week .
44020007	On the first day of the week , as we gathered together for a meal , Paul was holding a discussion with them . Since he was leaving the next day , he continued talking until midnight .
44020008	There were many lamps in the upstairs room where we had gathered .
44020009	A young man named Eutychus was sitting in the window . He was sinking into a deep sleep as Paul talked on and on . When he was sound asleep , he fell from the third floor and died .
44020010	Paul went down , fell on him and embraced him , then said , " Don’t be alarmed . He’s alive ! "
44020011	Then Paul went back upstairs and ate . He talked for a long time — right up until daybreak — then he left .
44020012	They took the young man away alive , and they were greatly comforted .
44020013	We went on to the ship and sailed for Assos , where we intended to take Paul on board . Paul had arranged this , since he intended to make his way there by land .
44020014	When he met us at Assos , we took him aboard and went on to Mitylene .
44020015	The next day we sailed from there and arrived opposite Chios . On the day after , we sailed to Samos , and on the following day we came to Miletus .
44020016	Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus so that he wouldn’t need to spend too much time in the province of Asia . He was hurrying to reach Jerusalem , if possible , by Pentecost Day .
44020017	From Miletus he sent a message to Ephesus calling for the church’s elders to meet him .
44020018	When they arrived , he said to them , “ You know how I lived among you the whole time I was with you , beginning with the first day I arrived in the province of Asia .
44020019	I served the Lord with great humility and with tears in the midst of trials that came upon me because of the Jews’ schemes .
44020020	You know I held back nothing that would be helpful so that I could proclaim to you and teach you both publicly and privately in your homes .
44020021	You know I have testified to both Jews and Greeks that they must change their hearts and lives as they turn to God and have faith in our Lord Jesus .
44020022	Now , compelled by the Spirit , I’m going to Jerusalem . I don’t know what will happen to me there .
44020023	What I do know is that the Holy Spirit testifies to me from city to city that prisons and troubles await me .
44020024	But nothing , not even my life , is more important than my completing my mission . This is nothing other than the ministry I received from the Lord Jesus : to testify about the good news of God’s grace .
44020025	" I know that none of you will see me again — you among whom I traveled and proclaimed the kingdom .
44020026	Therefore , today I testify to you that I’m not responsible for anyone’s fate .
44020027	I haven’t avoided proclaiming the entire plan of God to you .
44020028	Watch yourselves and the whole flock , in which the Holy Spirit has placed you as supervisors , to shepherd God’s church , which he obtained with the death of his own Son .
44020029	I know that , after my departure , savage wolves will come in among you and won’t spare the flock .
44020030	Some of your own people will distort the word in order to lure followers after them .
44020031	Stay alert ! Remember that for three years I constantly and tearfully warned each one of you . I never stopped warning you !
44020032	Now I entrust you to God and the message of his grace , which is able to build you up and give you an inheritance among all whom God has made holy .
44020033	I haven’t craved anyone’s silver , gold , or clothing .
44020034	You yourselves know that I have provided for my own needs and for those of my companions with my own hands .
44020035	In everything I have shown you that , by working hard , we must help the weak . In this way we remember the Lord Jesus’ words : ‘ It is more blessed to give than to receive . ’ "
44020036	After he said these things , he knelt down with all of them to pray .
44020037	They cried uncontrollably as everyone embraced and kissed Paul .
44020038	They were especially grieved by his statement that they would never see him again . Then they accompanied him to the ship .
44021001	After we tore ourselves away from them , we set sail on a straight course to Cos , reaching Rhodes the next day , and then Patara .
44021002	We found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia , boarded , and put out to sea .
44021003	We spotted Cyprus , but passed by it on our left . We sailed on to the province of Syria and landed in Tyre , where the ship was to unload its cargo .
44021004	We found the disciples there and stayed with them for a week . Compelled by the Spirit , they kept telling Paul not to go to Jerusalem .
44021005	When our time had come to an end , we departed . All of them , including women and children , accompanied us out of town where we knelt on the beach and prayed .
44021006	We said good-bye to each other , then we boarded the ship and they returned to their homes .
44021007	Continuing our voyage , we sailed from Tyre and arrived in Ptolemais . We greeted the brothers and sisters there and spent a day with them .
44021008	The next day we left and came to Caesarea . We went to the house of Philip the evangelist , one of the Seven , and stayed with him .
44021009	He had four unmarried daughters who were involved in the work of prophecy .
44021010	After staying there for several days , a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea .
44021011	He came to us , took Paul’s belt , tied his own feet and hands , and said , " This is what the Holy Spirit says : ‘ In Jerusalem the Jews will bind the man who owns this belt , and they will hand him over to the Gentiles . ’ "
44021012	When we heard this , we and the local believers urged Paul not to go up to Jerusalem .
44021013	Paul replied , " Why are you doing this ? Why are you weeping and breaking my heart ? I’m ready not only to be arrested but even to die in Jerusalem for the sake of the name of the Lord Jesus . "
44021014	Since we couldn’t talk him out of it , the only thing we could say was , " The Lord’s will be done . "
44021015	After this , we got ready and made our way up to Jerusalem .
44021016	Some of the disciples from Caesarea accompanied us and led us to Mnason’s home , where we were guests . He was from Cyprus and had been a disciple a long time .
44021017	When we arrived in Jerusalem , the brothers and sisters welcomed us warmly .
44021018	On the next day Paul and the rest of us went to see James . All of the elders were present .
44021019	After greeting them , he gave them a detailed report of what God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry .
44021020	Those who heard this praised God . Then they said to him , " Brother , you see how many thousands of Jews have become believers , and all of them keep the Law passionately .
44021021	They have been informed that you teach all the Jews who live among the Gentiles to reject Moses , telling them not to circumcise their children nor to live according to our customs .
44021022	What about this ? Without a doubt , they will hear that you have arrived .
44021023	You must therefore do what we tell you . Four men among us have made a solemn promise .
44021024	Take them with you , go through the purification ritual with them , and pay the cost of having their heads shaved . Everyone will know there is nothing to those reports about you but that you too live a life in keeping with the Law .
44021025	As for the Gentile believers , we wrote a letter about what we decided , that they avoid food offered to idols , blood , the meat from strangled animals , and sexual immorality . "
44021026	The following day Paul took the men with him and went through the purification ritual with them . He entered the temple and publicly announced the completion of the days of purification , when the offering would be presented for each one of them .
44021027	When the seven days of purification were almost over , the Jews from the province of Asia saw Paul in the temple . Grabbing him , they threw the whole crowd into confusion by shouting ,
44021028	" Fellow Israelites ! Help ! This is the man who teaches everyone everywhere against our people , the Law , and this place . Not only that , he has even brought Greeks into the temple and defiled this holy place . " (
44021029	They said this because they had seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him earlier , and they assumed Paul had brought him into the temple . )
44021030	The entire city was stirred up . The people came rushing , seized Paul , and dragged him out of the temple . Immediately the gates were closed .
44021031	While they were trying to kill him , a report reached the commander of a company of soldiers that all Jerusalem was in a state of confusion .
44021032	Without a moment’s hesitation , he took some soldiers and officers and ran down to the mob . When the mob saw the commander and his soldiers , they stopped beating Paul .
44021033	When the commander arrived , he arrested Paul and ordered him to be bound with two chains . Only then did he begin to ask who Paul was and what he had done .
44021034	Some in the crowd shouted one thing , others shouted something else . Because of the commotion , he couldn’t learn the truth , so he ordered that Paul be taken to the military headquarters .
44021035	When Paul reached the steps , he had to be carried by the soldiers in order to protect him from the violence of the crowd .
44021036	The mob that followed kept screaming , " Away with him ! "
44021037	As Paul was about to be taken into the military headquarters , he asked the commander , " May I speak with you ? " He answered , " Do you know Greek ?
44021038	Aren’t you the Egyptian who started a revolt and led four thousand terrorists into the desert some time ago ? "
44021039	Paul replied , " I’m a Jew from Tarsus in Cilicia , a citizen of an important city . Please , let me speak to the people . "
44021040	With the commander’s permission , Paul stood on the steps and gestured to the people . When they were quiet , he addressed them in Aramaic .
44022001	" Brothers and fathers , listen now to my defense . "
44022002	When they heard him address them in Aramaic , they became even more quiet .
44022003	Paul continued , “ I’m a Jew , born in Tarsus in Cilicia but raised in this city . Under Gamaliel’s instruction , I was trained in the strict interpretation of our ancestral Law . I am passionately loyal to God , just like you who are gathered here today .
44022004	I harassed those who followed this Way to their death , arresting and delivering both men and women into prison .
44022005	The high priest and the whole Jerusalem Council can testify about me . I received letters from them , addressed to our associates in Damascus , then went there to bring those who were arrested to Jerusalem so they could be punished .
44022006	“ During that journey , about noon , as I approached Damascus , suddenly a bright light from heaven encircled me .
44022007	I fell to the ground and heard a voice asking me , ‘ Saul , Saul , why are you harassing me ? ’
44022008	I answered , ‘ Who are you , Lord ? ’ ‘ I am Jesus the Nazarene , whom you are harassing , ’ he replied .
44022009	My traveling companions saw the light , but they didn’t hear the voice of the one who spoke to me .
44022010	I asked , ‘ What should I do , Lord ? ’ ‘ Get up , ’ the Lord replied , ‘ and go into Damascus . There you will be told everything you have been appointed to do . ’
44022011	I couldn’t see because of the brightness of that light , so my companions led me by the hand into Damascus .
44022012	“ There was a certain man named Ananias . According to the standards of the Law , he was a pious man who enjoyed the respect of all the Jews living there .
44022013	He came and stood beside me . ‘ Brother Saul , receive your sight ! ’ he said . Instantly , I regained my sight and I could see him .
44022014	He said , ‘ The God of our ancestors has selected you to know his will , to see the righteous one , and to hear his voice .
44022015	You will be his witness to everyone concerning what you have seen and heard .
44022016	What are you waiting for ? Get up , be baptized , and wash away your sins as you call on his name . ’
44022017	" When I returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple , I had a visionary experience .
44022018	I saw the Lord speaking to me . ‘ Hurry ! ’ he said . ‘ Leave Jerusalem at once because they won’t accept your testimony about me . ’
44022019	I responded , ‘ Lord , these people know I used to go from one synagogue to the next , beating those who believe in you and throwing them into prison .
44022020	When Stephen your witness was being killed , I stood there giving my approval , even watching the clothes that belonged to those who were killing him . ’
44022021	Then the Lord said to me , ‘ Go ! I will send you far away to the Gentiles . ’ "
44022022	The crowd listened to Paul until he said this . Then they shouted , " Away with this man ! He’s not fit to live ! "
44022023	As they were screaming , throwing off their garments , and flinging dust into the air ,
44022024	the commander directed that Paul be taken into the military headquarters . He ordered that Paul be questioned under the whip so that he could find out why they were shouting at him like this .
44022025	As they were stretching him out and tying him down with straps , Paul said to the centurion standing there , " Can you legally whip a Roman citizen who hasn’t been found guilty in court ? "
44022026	When the centurion heard this , he went to the commander and reported it . He asked , " What are you about to do ? This man is a Roman citizen ! "
44022027	The commander went to Paul and demanded , " Tell me ! Are you a Roman citizen ? " He said , " Yes . "
44022028	The commander replied , " It cost me a lot of money to buy my citizenship . " Paul said , " I’m a citizen by birth . "
44022029	At once those who were about to examine him stepped away . The commander was alarmed when he realized he had bound a Roman citizen .
44022030	The commander still wanted to know the truth about why Paul was being accused by the Jews . Therefore , the next day he ordered the chief priests and the entire Jerusalem Council to assemble . Then he took Paul out of prison and had him stand before them .
44023001	Paul stared at the council and said , " Brothers , I have lived my life with an altogether clear conscience right up to this very day . "
44023002	The high priest Ananias ordered those standing beside Paul to strike him in the mouth .
44023003	Then Paul said to him , " God is about to strike you , you whitewashed wall ! You sit and judge me according to the Law , yet disobey the Law by ordering that I be struck . "
44023004	Those standing near him asked , " You dare to insult God’s high priest ? "
44023005	Paul replied , " Brothers , I wasn’t aware that he was the high priest . It is written , You will not speak evil about a ruler of your people . "
44023006	Knowing that some of them were Sadducees and the others Pharisees , Paul exclaimed in the council , " Brothers , I’m a Pharisee and a descendant of Pharisees . I am on trial because of my hope in the resurrection of the dead ! "
44023007	These words aroused a dispute between the Pharisees and Sadducees , and the assembly was divided .
44023008	This is because Sadducees say that there’s no resurrection , angel , or spirit , but Pharisees affirm them all .
44023009	Council members were shouting loudly . Some Pharisees who were legal experts stood up and insisted forcefully , " We find nothing wrong with this man ! What if a spirit or angel has spoken to him ? "
44023010	The dispute became so heated that the commander feared they might tear Paul to pieces . He ordered soldiers to go down and remove him by force from their midst . Then they took him back to the military headquarters .
44023011	The following night the Lord stood near Paul and said , " Be encouraged ! Just as you have testified about me in Jerusalem , so too you must testify in Rome . "
44023012	The next morning some Jewish leaders formulated a plot and solemnly promised that they wouldn’t eat or drink until they had killed Paul .
44023013	More than forty people were involved in the conspiracy .
44023014	They went to the chief priests and elders and said , " We have solemnly promised to eat nothing until we have killed Paul .
44023015	You and the council must explain to the commander that you need Paul brought down to you . Pretend that you want to examine his case more closely . We’re prepared to kill him before he arrives . "
44023016	Paul’s sister had a son who heard about the ambush and he came to the military headquarters and reported it to Paul .
44023017	Paul called for one of the centurions and said , " Take this young man to the commander because he has something to report to him . "
44023018	He took him to the commander and said , " The prisoner Paul asked me to bring this young man to you . He has something to tell you . "
44023019	The commander took him by the hand and withdrew to a place where they could speak privately . He asked , " What do you have to report to me ? "
44023020	He replied , " The Jewish leaders have conspired to ask that you bring Paul down to the council tomorrow . They will pretend that they want to investigate his case more closely .
44023021	Don’t fall for it ! More than forty of them are waiting to ambush him . They have solemnly promised not to eat or drink until they have killed him . They are ready now , awaiting your consent . "
44023022	The commander dismissed the young man , ordering him , " Don’t tell anyone that you brought this to my attention . "
44023023	The commander called two centurions and said , " Prepare two hundred soldiers , seventy horsemen , and two hundred spearmen to leave for Caesarea at nine o’clock tonight .
44023024	Have horses ready for Paul to ride , so they may take him safely to Governor Felix . "
44023025	He wrote the following letter :
44023026	Claudius Lysias , to the most honorable Governor Felix : Greetings .
44023027	This man was seized by the Jews and was almost killed by them . I was nearby with a unit of soldiers , and I rescued him when I discovered that he was a Roman citizen .
44023028	I wanted to find out why they were accusing him , so I brought him to their council .
44023029	I discovered that they were accusing him about questions related to their Law . I found no charge deserving of death or imprisonment .
44023030	When I was informed of a conspiracy against his life , I sent him to you at once and ordered his accusers to bring their case against him before you .
44023031	Following their orders , the soldiers took Paul during the night and brought him to Antipatris .
44023032	The following day they let the horsemen continue on with Paul while they returned to the military headquarters in Jerusalem .
44023033	The horsemen entered Caesarea , delivered the letter to the governor , and brought Paul before him .
44023034	After he read the letter , he asked Paul about his home province . When he learned that he was from Cilicia ,
44023035	the governor said , " I will hear your case when your accusers arrive . " Then he ordered that Paul be kept in custody in Herod’s palace .
44024001	Five days later the high priest Ananias came down with some elders and a lawyer named Tertullus . They pressed charges against Paul before the governor .
44024002	After the governor summoned Paul , Tertullus began to make his case against him . He declared , " Under your leadership , we have experienced substantial peace , and your administration has brought reforms to our nation .
44024003	Always and everywhere , most honorable Felix , we acknowledge this with deep gratitude .
44024004	I don’t want to take too much of your time , so I ask that you listen with your usual courtesy to our brief statement of the facts .
44024005	We have found this man to be a troublemaker who stirs up riots among all the Jews throughout the empire . He’s a ringleader of the Nazarene faction
44024006	and even tried to defile the temple . That’s when we arrested him .
44024008	By examining him yourself , you will be able to verify the allegations we are bringing against him . "
44024009	The Jews reinforced the action against Paul , affirming the truth of these accusations .
44024010	The governor nodded at Paul , giving him permission to speak . He responded , " I know that you have been judge over this nation for many years , so I gladly offer my own defense .
44024011	You can verify that I went up to worship in Jerusalem no more than twelve days ago .
44024012	They didn’t find me arguing with anyone in the temple or stirring up a crowd , whether in the synagogue or anywhere else in the city .
44024013	Nor can they prove to you the allegations they are now bringing against me .
44024014	I do admit this to you , that I am a follower of the Way , which they call a faction . Accordingly , I worship the God of our ancestors and believe everything set out in the Law and written in the Prophets .
44024015	The hope I have in God I also share with my accusers , that there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous .
44024016	On account of this , I have committed myself to maintaining a clear conscience before God and with all people .
44024017	After an absence of several years , I came to Jerusalem to bring gifts for the poor of my nation and to offer sacrifices .
44024018	When they found me in the temple , I was ritually pure . There was no crowd and no disturbance .
44024019	But there were some Jews from the province of Asia . They should be here making their accusations , if indeed they have something against me .
44024020	In their absence , have these people who are here declare what crime they found when I stood before the Jerusalem Council .
44024021	Perhaps it concerns this one statement that I blurted out when I was with them : ‘ I am on trial before you today because of the resurrection of the dead . ’ "
44024022	Felix , who had an accurate understanding of the Way , adjourned the meeting . He said , " When Lysias the commander arrives from Jerusalem , I will decide this case . "
44024023	He arranged for a centurion to guard Paul . He was to give Paul some freedom , and his friends were not to be hindered in their efforts to provide for him .
44024024	After several days , Felix came with his wife Drusilla , who was Jewish , and summoned Paul . He listened to him talk about faith in Christ Jesus .
44024025	When he spoke about upright behavior , self-control , and the coming judgment , Felix became fearful and said , " Go away for now ! When I have time , I’ll send for you . "
44024026	At the same time , he was hoping that Paul would offer him some money , so he often sent for him and talked with him .
44024027	When two years had passed , Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus . Since Felix wanted to grant a favor to the Jews , he left Paul in prison .
44025001	Three days after arriving in the province , Festus went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea .
44025002	The chief priests and Jewish leaders presented their case against Paul . Appealing to him ,
44025003	they asked as a favor from Festus that he summon Paul to Jerusalem . They were planning to ambush and kill him along the way .
44025004	But Festus responded by keeping Paul in Caesarea , since he was to return there very soon himself .
44025005	" Some of your leaders can come down with me , " he said . " If he’s done anything wrong , they can bring charges against him . "
44025006	He stayed with them for no more than eight or ten days , then went down to Caesarea . The following day he took his seat in the court and ordered that Paul be brought in .
44025007	When he arrived , many Jews who had come down from Jerusalem surrounded him . They brought serious charges against him , but they couldn’t prove them .
44025008	In his own defense , Paul said , " I’ve done nothing wrong against the Jewish Law , against the temple , or against Caesar . "
44025009	Festus , wanting to put the Jews in his debt , asked Paul , " Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem to stand trial before me concerning these things ? "
44025010	Paul replied , " I’m standing before Caesar’s court . I ought to be tried here . I have done nothing wrong to the Jews , as you well know .
44025011	If I’m guilty and have done something that deserves death , then I won’t try to avoid death . But if there is nothing to their accusations against me , no one has the authority to hand me over to them . I appeal to Caesar ! "
44025012	After Festus conferred with his advisors , he responded , " You have appealed to Caesar . To Caesar you will go . "
44025013	After several days had passed , King Agrippa and Bernice arrived in Caesarea to welcome Festus .
44025014	Since they were staying there for many days , Festus discussed the case against Paul with the king . He said , " There is a man whom Felix left in prison .
44025015	When I was in Jerusalem , the Jewish chief priests and elders brought charges against him and requested a guilty verdict in his case .
44025016	I told them it is contrary to Roman practice to hand someone over before they have faced their accusers and had opportunity to offer a defense against the charges .
44025017	When they came here , I didn’t put them off . The very next day I took my seat in the court and ordered that the man be brought before me .
44025018	When the accusers took the floor , they didn’t charge him with any of the crimes I had expected .
44025019	Instead , they quibbled with him about their own religion and about some dead man named Jesus , who Paul claimed was alive .
44025020	Since I had no idea how to investigate these matters , I asked if he would be willing to go to Jerusalem to stand trial there on these issues .
44025021	However , Paul appealed that he be held in custody pending a decision from His Majesty the emperor , so I ordered that he be held until I could send him to Caesar . "
44025022	Agrippa said to Festus , " I want to hear the man myself . " " Tomorrow , " Festus replied , " you will hear him . "
44025023	The next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great fanfare . They entered the auditorium with the military commanders and the city’s most prominent men . Festus then ordered that Paul be brought in .
44025024	Festus said , " King Agrippa and everyone present with us : You see this man ! The entire Jewish community , both here and in Jerusalem , has appealed to me concerning him . They’ve been calling for his immediate death .
44025025	I’ve found that he has done nothing deserving death . When he appealed to His Majesty , I decided to send him to Rome .
44025026	I have nothing definite to write to our lord emperor . Therefore , I’ve brought him before all of you , and especially before you , King Agrippa , so that after this investigation , I might have something to write .
44025027	After all , it would be foolish to send a prisoner without specifying the charges against him . "
44026001	Agrippa said to Paul , " You may speak for yourself . " So Paul gestured with his hand and began his defense .
44026002	“ King Agrippa , I consider myself especially fortunate that I stand before you today as I offer my defense concerning all the accusations the Jews have brought against me .
44026003	This is because you understand well all the Jewish customs and controversies . Therefore , I ask you to listen to me patiently .
44026004	Every Jew knows the way of life I have followed since my youth because , from the beginning , I was among my people and in Jerusalem .
44026005	They have known me for a long time . If they wanted to , they could testify that I followed the way of life set out by the most exacting group of our religion . I am a Pharisee .
44026006	Today I am standing trial because of the hope in the promise God gave our ancestors .
44026007	This is the promise our twelve tribes hope to receive as they earnestly worship night and day . The Jews are accusing me , King Agrippa , because of this hope !
44026008	Why is it inconceivable to you that God raises the dead ?
44026009	“ I really thought that I ought to oppose the name of Jesus the Nazarene in every way possible .
44026010	And that’s exactly what I did in Jerusalem . I locked up many of God’s holy people in prison under the authority of the chief priests . When they were condemned to death , I voted against them .
44026011	In one synagogue after another — indeed , in all the synagogues — I would often torture them , compelling them to slander God . My rage bordered on the hysterical as I pursued them , even to foreign cities .
44026012	“ On one such journey , I was going to Damascus with the full authority of the chief priests .
44026013	While on the road at midday , King Agrippa , I saw a light from heaven shining around me and my traveling companions . That light was brighter than the sun .
44026014	We all fell to the ground , and I heard a voice that said to me in Aramaic , ‘ Saul , Saul , why are you harassing me ? It’s hard for you to kick against a spear . ’
44026015	Then I said , ‘ Who are you , Lord ? ’ The Lord replied , ‘ I am Jesus , whom you are harassing .
44026016	Get up ! Stand on your feet ! I have appeared to you for this purpose : to appoint you as my servant and witness of what you have seen and what I will show you .
44026017	I will rescue you from your own people and from the Gentiles . I am sending you
44026018	to open their eyes . Then they can turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God , and receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are made holy by faith in me . ’
44026019	" So , King Agrippa , I wasn’t disobedient to that heavenly vision .
44026020	Instead , I proclaimed first to those in Damascus and Jerusalem , then to the whole region of Judea and to the Gentiles . My message was that they should change their hearts and lives and turn to God , and that they should demonstrate this change in their behavior .
44026021	Because of this , some Jews seized me in the temple and tried to murder me .
44026022	God has helped me up to this very day . Therefore , I stand here and bear witness to the lowly and the great . I’m saying nothing more than what the Prophets and Moses declared would happen :
44026023	that the Christ would suffer and that , as the first to rise from the dead , he would proclaim light both to my people and to the Gentiles . "
44026024	At this point in Paul’s defense , Festus declared with a loud voice , " You’ve lost your mind , Paul ! Too much learning is driving you mad ! "
44026025	But Paul replied , " I’m not mad , most honorable Festus ! I’m speaking what is sound and true .
44026026	King Agrippa knows about these things , and I have been speaking openly to him . I’m certain that none of these things have escaped his attention . This didn’t happen secretly or in some out-of-the-way place .
44026027	King Agrippa , do you believe the prophets ? I know you do . "
44026028	Agrippa said to Paul , " Are you trying to convince me that , in such a short time , you’ve made me a Christian ? "
44026029	Paul responded , " Whether it is a short or a long time , I pray to God that not only you but also all who are listening to me today will become like me , except for these chains . "
44026030	The king stood up , as did the governor , Bernice , and those sitting with them .
44026031	As they left , they were saying to each other , " This man is doing nothing that deserves death or imprisonment . "
44026032	Agrippa said to Festus , " This man could have been released if he hadn’t appealed to Caesar . "
44027001	When it was determined that we were to sail to Italy , Paul and some other prisoners were placed in the custody of a centurion named Julius of the Imperial Company .
44027002	We boarded a ship from Adramyttium that was about to sail for ports along the coast of the province of Asia . So we put out to sea . Aristarchus , a Macedonian from Thessalonica , came with us .
44027003	The next day we landed in Sidon . Julius treated Paul kindly and permitted him to go to some friends so they could take care of him .
44027004	From there we sailed off . We passed Cyprus , using the island to shelter us from the headwinds .
44027005	We sailed across the open sea off the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia , and landed in Myra in Lycia .
44027006	There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship headed for Italy and put us on board .
44027007	After many days of slow and difficult sailing , we arrived off the coast of Cnidus . The wind wouldn’t allow us to go farther , so we sailed under the shelter of Crete off Salmone .
44027008	We sailed along the coast only with difficulty until we came to a place called Good Harbors , near the city of Lasea .
44027009	Much time had been lost , and the voyage was now dangerous since the Day of Reconciliation had already passed . Paul warned them ,
44027010	" Men , I see that our voyage will suffer damage and great loss , not only for the cargo and ship but also for our lives . "
44027011	But the centurion was persuaded more by the ship’s pilot and captain than by Paul’s advice .
44027012	Since the harbor was unsuitable for spending the winter , the majority supported a plan to put out to sea from there . They thought they might reach Phoenix in Crete and spend the winter in its harbor , which faced southwest and northwest .
44027013	When a gentle south wind began to blow , they thought they could carry out their plan . They pulled up anchor and sailed closely along the coast of Crete .
44027014	Before long , a hurricane-strength wind known as a northeaster swept down from Crete .
44027015	The ship was caught in the storm and couldn’t be turned into the wind . So we gave in to it , and it carried us along .
44027016	After sailing under the shelter of an island called Cauda , we were able to control the lifeboat only with difficulty .
44027017	They brought the lifeboat aboard , then began to wrap the ship with cables to hold it together . Fearing they might run aground on the sandbars of the Gulf of Syrtis , they lowered the anchor and let the ship be carried along .
44027018	We were so battered by the violent storm that the next day the men began throwing cargo overboard .
44027019	On the third day , they picked up the ship’s gear and hurled it into the sea .
44027020	When neither the sun nor the moon appeared for many days and the raging storm continued to pound us , all hope of our being saved from this peril faded .
44027021	For a long time no one had eaten . Paul stood up among them and said , " Men , you should have complied with my instructions not to sail from Crete . Then we would have avoided this damage and loss .
44027022	Now I urge you to be encouraged . Not one of your lives will be lost , though we will lose the ship .
44027023	Last night an angel from the God to whom I belong and whom I worship stood beside me .
44027024	The angel said , ‘ Don’t be afraid , Paul ! You must stand before Caesar ! Indeed , God has also graciously given you everyone sailing with you . ’
44027025	Be encouraged , men ! I have faith in God that it will be exactly as he told me .
44027026	However , we must run aground on some island . "
44027027	On the fourteenth night , we were being carried across the Adriatic Sea . Around midnight the sailors began to suspect that land was near .
44027028	They dropped a weighted line to take soundings and found the water to be about one hundred twenty feet deep . After proceeding a little farther , we took soundings again and found the water to be about ninety feet deep .
44027029	Afraid that we might run aground somewhere on the rocks , they hurled out four anchors from the stern and began to pray for daylight .
44027030	The sailors tried to abandon the ship by lowering the lifeboat into the sea , pretending they were going to lower anchors from the bow .
44027031	Paul said to the centurion and his soldiers , " Unless they stay in the ship , you can’t be saved from peril . "
44027032	The soldiers then cut the ropes to the lifeboat and let it drift away .
44027033	Just before daybreak , Paul urged everyone to eat . He said , " This is the fourteenth day you’ve lived in suspense , and you’ve not had even a bite to eat .
44027034	I urge you to take some food . Your health depends on it . None of you will lose a single hair from his head . "
44027035	After he said these things , he took bread , gave thanks to God in front of them all , then broke it and began to eat .
44027036	Everyone was encouraged and took some food . (
44027037	In all , there were two hundred seventy-six of us on the ship . )
44027038	When they had eaten as much as they wanted , they lightened the ship by throwing the grain into the sea .
44027039	In the morning light they saw a bay with a sandy beach . They didn’t know what land it was , but they thought they might possibly be able to run the ship aground .
44027040	They cut the anchors loose and left them in the sea . At the same time , they untied the ropes that ran back to the rudders . They raised the foresail to catch the wind and made for the beach .
44027041	But they struck a sandbar and the ship ran aground . The bow was stuck and wouldn’t move , and the stern was broken into pieces by the force of the waves .
44027042	The soldiers decided to kill the prisoners to keep them from swimming to shore and escaping .
44027043	However , the centurion wanted to save Paul , so he stopped them from carrying out their plan . He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and head for land .
44027044	He ordered the rest to grab hold of planks or debris from the ship . In this way , everyone reached land safely .
44028001	After reaching land safely , we learned that the island was called Malta .
44028002	The islanders showed us extraordinary kindness . Because it was rainy and cold , they built a fire and welcomed all of us .
44028003	Paul gathered a bunch of dry sticks and put them on the fire . As he did , a poisonous snake , driven out by the heat , latched on to his hand .
44028004	When the islanders saw the snake hanging from his hand , they said to each other , " This man must be a murderer ! He was rescued from the sea , but the goddess Justice hasn’t let him live ! "
44028005	Paul shook the snake into the fire and suffered no harm .
44028006	They expected him to swell up with fever or suddenly drop dead . After waiting a long time and seeing nothing unusual happen to him , they changed their minds and began to claim that he was a god .
44028007	Publius , the island’s most prominent person , owned a large estate in that area . He welcomed us warmly into his home as his guests for three days .
44028008	Publius’ father was bedridden , sick with a fever and dysentery . Paul went to see him and prayed . He placed his hand on him and healed him .
44028009	Once this happened , the rest of the sick on the island came to him and were healed .
44028010	They honored us in many ways . When we were getting ready to sail again , they supplied us with what we needed .
44028011	After three months we put out to sea in a ship that had spent the winter at the island . It was an Alexandrian ship with carvings of the twin gods Castor and Pollux as its figurehead .
44028012	We landed in Syracuse where we stayed three days .
44028013	From there we sailed to Rhegium . After one day a south wind came up , and we arrived on the second day in Puteoli .
44028014	There we found brothers and sisters who urged us to stay with them for a week . In this way we came to Rome .
44028015	When the brothers and sisters there heard about us , they came as far as the Forum of Appius and the Three Taverns to meet us . When Paul saw them , he gave thanks to God and was encouraged .
44028016	When we entered Rome , Paul was permitted to live by himself , with a soldier guarding him .
44028017	Three days later , Paul called the Jewish leaders together . When they gathered , he said , " Brothers , although I have done nothing against our people or the customs of our ancestors , I’m a prisoner from Jerusalem . They handed me over to the Romans ,
44028018	who intended to release me after they examined me , because they couldn’t find any reason for putting me to death .
44028019	When the Jews objected , I was forced to appeal to Caesar . Don’t think I appealed to Caesar because I had any reason to bring charges against my nation .
44028020	This is why I asked to see you and speak with you : it’s because of the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain . "
44028021	They responded , " We haven’t received any letters about you from Judea , nor have any of our brothers come and reported or said anything bad about you .
44028022	But we think it’s important to hear what you think , for we know that people everywhere are speaking against this faction . "
44028023	On the day scheduled for this purpose , many people came to the place where he was staying . From morning until evening , he explained and testified concerning God’s kingdom and tried to convince them about Jesus through appealing to the Law from Moses and the Prophets .
44028024	Some were persuaded by what he said , but others refused to believe .
44028025	They disagreed with each other and were starting to leave when Paul made one more statement : “ The Holy Spirit spoke correctly when he said to your ancestors through Isaiah the prophet ,
44028026	Go to this people and say : You will hear , to be sure , but never understand ; and you will certainly see but never recognize what you are seeing .
44028027	This people’s senses have become calloused , and they’ve become hard of hearing , and they’ve shut their eyes
44028028	" Therefore , be certain of this : God’s salvation has been sent to the Gentiles . They will listen ! "
44028030	Paul lived in his own rented quarters for two full years and welcomed everyone who came to see him .
44028031	Unhindered and with complete confidence , he continued to preach God’s kingdom and to teach about the Lord Jesus Christ .
45001001	From Paul , a slave of Christ Jesus , called to be an apostle and set apart for God’s good news .
45001002	
45001003	God promised this good news about his Son ahead of time through his prophets in the holy scriptures . His Son was descended from David .
45001004	He was publicly identified as God’s Son with power through his resurrection from the dead , which was based on the Spirit of holiness . This Son is Jesus Christ our Lord .
45001005	Through him we have received God’s grace and our appointment to be apostles . This was to bring all Gentiles to faithful obedience for his name’s sake .
45001006	You who are called by Jesus Christ are also included among these Gentiles .
45001007	To those in Rome who are dearly loved by God and called to be God’s people . Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
45001008	First of all , I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you , because the news about your faithfulness is being spread throughout the whole world .
45001009	I serve God in my spirit by preaching the good news about God’s Son , and God is my witness that I continually mention you
45001010	in all my prayers . I’m always asking that somehow , by God’s will , I might succeed in visiting you at last .
45001011	I really want to see you to pass along some spiritual gift to you so that you can be strengthened .
45001012	What I mean is that we can mutually encourage each other while I am with you . We can be encouraged by the faithfulness we find in each other , both your faithfulness and mine .
45001013	I want you to know , brothers and sisters , that I planned to visit you many times , although I have been prevented from coming until now . I want to harvest some fruit among you , just as I have done among the other Gentiles .
45001014	I have a responsibility both to Greeks and to those who don’t speak Greek , both to the wise and to the foolish .
45001015	That’s why I’m ready to preach the gospel also to you who are in Rome .
45001016	I’m not ashamed of the gospel : it is God’s own power for salvation to all who have faith in God , to the Jew first and also to the Greek .
45001017	God’s righteousness is being revealed in the gospel , from faithfulness for faith , as it is written , The righteous person will live by faith .
45001018	God’s wrath is being revealed from heaven against all the ungodly behavior and the injustice of human beings who silence the truth with injustice .
45001019	This is because what is known about God should be plain to them because God made it plain to them .
45001020	Ever since the creation of the world , God’s invisible qualities — God’s eternal power and divine nature — have been clearly seen , because they are understood through the things God has made . So humans are without excuse .
45001021	Although they knew God , they didn’t honor God as God or thank him . Instead , their reasoning became pointless , and their foolish hearts were darkened .
45001022	While they were claiming to be wise , they made fools of themselves .
45001023	They exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images that look like mortal humans : birds , animals , and reptiles .
45001024	So God abandoned them to their hearts’ desires , which led to the moral corruption of degrading their own bodies with each other .
45001025	They traded God’s truth for a lie , and they worshipped and served the creation instead of the creator , who is blessed forever . Amen .
45001026	That’s why God abandoned them to degrading lust . Their females traded natural sexual relations for unnatural sexual relations .
45001027	Also , in the same way , the males traded natural sexual relations with females , and burned with lust for each other . Males performed shameful actions with males , and they were paid back with the penalty they deserved for their mistake in their own bodies .
45001028	Since they didn’t think it was worthwhile to acknowledge God , God abandoned them to a defective mind to do inappropriate things .
45001029	So they were filled with all injustice , wicked behavior , greed , and evil behavior . They are full of jealousy , murder , fighting , deception , and malice . They are gossips ,
45001030	they slander people , and they hate God . They are rude and proud , and they brag . They invent ways to be evil , and they are disobedient to their parents .
45001031	They are without understanding , disloyal , without affection , and without mercy .
45001032	Though they know God’s decision that those who persist in such practices deserve death , they not only keep doing these things but also approve others who practice them .
45002001	So every single one of you who judge others is without any excuse . You condemn yourself when you judge another person because the one who is judging is doing the same things .
45002002	We know that God’s judgment agrees with the truth , and his judgment is against those who do these kinds of things .
45002003	If you judge those who do these kinds of things while you do the same things yourself , think about this : Do you believe that you will escape God’s judgment ?
45002004	Or do you have contempt for the riches of God’s generosity , tolerance , and patience ? Don’t you realize that God’s kindness is supposed to lead you to change your heart and life ?
45002005	You are storing up wrath for yourself because of your stubbornness and your heart that refuses to change . God’s just judgment will be revealed on the day of wrath .
45002006	God will repay everyone based on their works .
45002007	On the one hand , he will give eternal life to those who look for glory , honor , and immortality based on their patient good work .
45002008	But on the other hand , there will be wrath and anger for those who obey wickedness instead of the truth because they are acting out of selfishness and disobedience .
45002009	There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil , for the Jew first and also for the Greek .
45002010	But there will be glory , honor , and peace for everyone who does what is good , for the Jew first and also for the Greek .
45002011	God does not have favorites .
45002012	Those who have sinned outside the Law will also die outside the Law , and those who have sinned under the Law will be judged by the Law .
45002013	It isn’t the ones who hear the Law who are righteous in God’s eyes . It is the ones who do what the Law says who will be treated as righteous .
45002014	Gentiles don’t have the Law . But when they instinctively do what the Law requires they are a Law in themselves , though they don’t have the Law .
45002015	They show the proof of the Law written on their hearts , and their consciences affirm it . Their conflicting thoughts will accuse them , or even make a defense for them ,
45002016	on the day when , according to my gospel , God will judge the hidden truth about human beings through Christ Jesus .
45002017	But , if you call yourself a Jew ; if you rely on the Law ; if you brag about your relationship to God ;
45002018	if you know the will of God ; if you are taught by the Law so that you can figure out the things that really matter ;
45002019	if you have persuaded yourself that you are :
45002021	then why don’t you who are teaching others teach yourself ? If you preach , " No stealing , " do you steal ?
45002022	If you say , " No adultery , " do you commit adultery ? If you hate idols , do you rob temples ?
45002023	If you brag about the Law , do you shame God by breaking the Law ?
45002024	As it is written : The name of God is discredited by the Gentiles because of you .
45002025	Circumcision is an advantage if you do what the Law says . But if you are a person who breaks the Law , your status of being circumcised has changed into not being circumcised .
45002026	So if the person who isn’t circumcised keeps the Law , won’t his status of not being circumcised be counted as if he were circumcised ?
45002027	The one who isn’t physically circumcised but keeps the Law will judge you . You became a lawbreaker after you had the written Law and circumcision .
45002028	It isn’t the Jew who maintains outward appearances who will receive praise from God , and it isn’t people who are outwardly circumcised on their bodies .
45002029	Instead , it is the person who is a Jew inside , who is circumcised in spirit , not literally . That person’s praise doesn’t come from people but from God .
45003001	So what’s the advantage of being a Jew ? Or what’s the benefit of circumcision ?
45003002	Plenty in every way . First of all , the Jews were trusted with God’s revelations .
45003003	What does it matter , then , if some weren’t faithful ? Their lack of faith won’t cancel God’s faithfulness , will it ?
45003004	Absolutely not ! God must be true , even if every human being is a liar , as it is written : So that it can show that you are right in your words ; and you will triumph when you are judged .
45003005	But if our lack of righteousness confirms God’s justice , what will we say ? That God , who brings wrath upon us , isn’t just ( I’m speaking rhetorically ) ?
45003006	Absolutely not ! If God weren’t just , how could he judge the world ?
45003007	But if God’s truth is demonstrated by my lie and it increases his glory , why am I still judged as a sinner ?
45003008	Why not say , " Let’s do evil things so that good things will come out of it " ? ( Some people who slander us accuse us of saying that , but these people deserve criticism . )
45003009	So what are we saying ? Are we better off ? Not at all . We have already stated the charge : both Jews and Greeks are all under the power of sin .
45003010	As it is written , There is no righteous person , not even one .
45003011	There is no one who understands . There is no one who looks for God .
45003012	They all turned away . They have become worthless together . There is no one who shows kindness . There is not even one .
45003013	Their throat is a grave that has been opened . They are deceitful with their tongues ,
45003014	Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness .
45003015	Their feet are quick to shed blood ;
45003018	There is no fear of God in their view of the world .
45003019	Now we know that whatever the Law says , it speaks to those who are under the Law , in order to shut every mouth and make it so the whole world has to answer to God .
45003020	It follows that no human being will be treated as righteous in his presence by doing what the Law says , because the knowledge of sin comes through the Law .
45003021	But now God’s righteousness has been revealed apart from the Law , which is confirmed by the Law and the Prophets .
45003022	God’s righteousness comes through the faithfulness of Jesus Christ for all who have faith in him . There’s no distinction .
45003023	All have sinned and fall short of God’s glory ,
45003024	but all are treated as righteous freely by his grace because of a ransom that was paid by Christ Jesus .
45003025	Through his faithfulness , God displayed Jesus as the place of sacrifice where mercy is found by means of his blood . He did this to demonstrate his righteousness in passing over sins that happened before ,
45003026	during the time of God’s patient tolerance . He also did this to demonstrate that he is righteous in the present time , and to treat the one who has faith in Jesus as righteous .
45003027	What happens to our bragging ? It’s thrown out . With which law ? With what we have accomplished under the Law ?
45003028	No , not at all , but through the law of faith . We consider that a person is treated as righteous by faith , apart from what is accomplished under the Law .
45003029	Or is God the God of Jews only ? Isn’t God the God of Gentiles also ? Yes , God is also the God of Gentiles .
45003030	Since God is one , then the one who makes the circumcised righteous by faith will also make the one who isn’t circumcised righteous through faith .
45003031	Do we then cancel the Law through this faith ? Absolutely not ! Instead , we confirm the Law .
45004001	So what are we going to say ? Are we going to find that Abraham is our ancestor on the basis of genealogy ?
45004002	Because if Abraham was made righteous because of his actions , he would have had a reason to brag , but not in front of God .
45004003	What does the scripture say ? Abraham had faith in God , and it was credited to him as righteousness .
45004004	Workers’ salaries aren’t credited to them on the basis of an employer’s grace but rather on the basis of what they deserve .
45004005	But faith is credited as righteousness to those who don’t work , because they have faith in God who makes the ungodly righteous .
45004006	In the same way , David also pronounces a blessing on the person to whom God credits righteousness apart from actions :
45004007	Happy are those whose actions outside the Law are forgiven ,
45004008	Happy are those whose sin isn’t counted against them by the Lord .
45004009	Is this state of happiness only for the circumcised or is it also for those who aren’t circumcised ? We say , " Faith was credited to Abraham as righteousness . "
45004010	So how was it credited ? When he was circumcised , or when he wasn’t circumcised ? In fact , it was credited while he still wasn’t circumcised , not after he was circumcised .
45004011	He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that comes from the faith he had while he still wasn’t circumcised . It happened this way so that Abraham could be the ancestor of all those people who aren’t circumcised , who have faith in God , and so are counted as righteous .
45004012	He could also be the ancestor of those circumcised people , who aren’t only circumcised but who also walk in the path of faith , like our ancestor Abraham did while he wasn’t circumcised .
45004013	The promise to Abraham and to his descendants , that he would inherit the world , didn’t come through the Law but through the righteousness that comes from faith .
45004014	If they inherit because of the Law , then faith has no effect and the promise has been canceled .
45004015	The Law brings about wrath . But when there isn’t any law , there isn’t any violation of the law .
45004016	That’s why the inheritance comes through faith , so that it will be on the basis of God’s grace . In that way , the promise is secure for all of Abraham’s descendants , not just for those who are related by Law but also for those who are related by the faith of Abraham , who is the father of all of us .
45004017	As it is written : I have appointed you to be the father of many nations . So Abraham is our father in the eyes of God in whom he had faith , the God who gives life to the dead and calls things that don’t exist into existence .
45004018	When it was beyond hope , he had faith in the hope that he would become the father of many nations , in keeping with the promise God spoke to him : That’s how many descendants you will have .
45004019	Without losing faith , Abraham , who was nearly 100 years old , took into account his own body , which was as good as dead , and Sarah’s womb , which was dead .
45004020	He didn’t hesitate with a lack of faith in God’s promise , but he grew strong in faith and gave glory to God .
45004021	He was fully convinced that God was able to do what he promised .
45004022	Therefore , it was credited to him as righteousness .
45004023	But the scripture that says it was credited to him wasn’t written only for Abraham’s sake .
45004024	It was written also for our sake , because it is going to be credited to us too . It will be credited to those of us who have faith in the one who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead .
45004025	He was handed over because of our mistakes , and he was raised to meet the requirements of righteousness for us .
45005001	Therefore , since we have been made righteous through his faithfulness combined with our faith , we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ .
45005002	We have access by faith into this grace in which we stand through him , and we boast in the hope of God’s glory .
45005003	But not only that ! We even take pride in our problems , because we know that trouble produces endurance ,
45005004	endurance produces character , and character produces hope .
45005005	This hope doesn’t put us to shame , because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit , who has been given to us .
45005006	While we were still weak , at the right moment , Christ died for ungodly people .
45005007	It isn’t often that someone will die for a righteous person , though maybe someone might dare to die for a good person .
45005008	But God shows his love for us , because while we were still sinners Christ died for us .
45005009	So , now that we have been made righteous by his blood , we can be even more certain that we will be saved from God’s wrath through him .
45005010	If we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son while we were still enemies , now that we have been reconciled , how much more certain is it that we will be saved by his life ?
45005011	And not only that : we even take pride in God through our Lord Jesus Christ , the one through whom we now have a restored relationship with God .
45005012	So , in the same way that sin entered the world through one person , and death came through sin , so death spread to all human beings with the result that all sinned .
45005013	Although sin was in the world , since there was no Law , it wasn’t taken into account until the Law came .
45005014	But death ruled from Adam until Moses , even over those who didn’t sin in the same way Adam did — Adam was a type of the one who was coming .
45005015	But the free gift of Christ isn’t like Adam’s failure . If many people died through what one person did wrong , God’s grace is multiplied even more for many people with the gift — of the one person Jesus Christ — that comes through grace .
45005016	The gift isn’t like the consequences of one person’s sin . The judgment that came from one person’s sin led to punishment , but the free gift that came out of many failures led to the verdict of acquittal .
45005017	If death ruled because of one person’s failure , those who receive the multiplied grace and the gift of righteousness will even more certainly rule in life through the one person Jesus Christ .
45005018	So now the righteous requirements necessary for life are met for everyone through the righteous act of one person , just as judgment fell on everyone through the failure of one person .
45005019	Many people were made righteous through the obedience of one person , just as many people were made sinners through the disobedience of one person .
45005020	The Law stepped in to amplify the failure , but where sin increased , grace multiplied even more .
45005021	The result is that grace will rule through God’s righteousness , leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord , just as sin ruled in death .
45006001	So what are we going to say ? Should we continue sinning so grace will multiply ?
45006002	Absolutely not ! All of us died to sin . How can we still live in it ?
45006003	Or don’t you know that all who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death ?
45006004	Therefore , we were buried together with him through baptism into his death , so that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father , we too can walk in newness of life .
45006005	If we were united together in a death like his , we will also be united together in a resurrection like his .
45006006	This is what we know : the person that we used to be was crucified with him in order to get rid of the corpse that had been controlled by sin . That way we wouldn’t be slaves to sin anymore ,
45006007	because a person who has died has been freed from sin’s power .
45006008	But if we died with Christ , we have faith that we will also live with him .
45006009	We know that Christ has been raised from the dead and he will never die again . Death no longer has power over him .
45006010	He died to sin once and for all with his death , but he lives for God with his life .
45006011	In the same way , you also should consider yourselves dead to sin but alive for God in Christ Jesus .
45006012	So then , don’t let sin rule your body , so that you do what it wants .
45006013	Don’t offer parts of your body to sin , to be used as weapons to do wrong . Instead , present yourselves to God as people who have been brought back to life from the dead , and offer all the parts of your body to God to be used as weapons to do right .
45006014	Sin will have no power over you , because you aren’t under Law but under grace .
45006015	So what ? Should we sin because we aren’t under Law but under grace ? Absolutely not !
45006016	Don’t you know that if you offer yourselves to someone as obedient slaves , that you are slaves of the one whom you obey ? That’s true whether you serve as slaves of sin , which leads to death , or as slaves of the kind of obedience that leads to righteousness .
45006017	But thank God that although you used to be slaves of sin , you gave wholehearted obedience to the teaching that was handed down to you , which provides a pattern .
45006018	Now that you have been set free from sin , you have become slaves of righteousness .
45006019	( I’m speaking with ordinary metaphors because of your limitations . ) Once , you offered the parts of your body to be used as slaves to impurity and to lawless behavior that leads to still more lawless behavior . Now , you should present the parts of your body as slaves to righteousness , which makes your lives holy .
45006020	When you were slaves of sin , you were free from the control of righteousness .
45006021	What consequences did you get from doing things that you are now ashamed of ? The outcome of those things is death .
45006022	But now that you have been set free from sin and become slaves to God , you have the consequence of a holy life , and the outcome is eternal life .
45006023	The wages that sin pays are death , but God’s gift is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord .
45007001	Brothers and sisters , I’m talking to you as people who know the Law . Don’t you know that the Law has power over someone only as long as he or she lives ?
45007002	A married woman is united with her husband under the Law while he is alive . But if her husband dies , she is released from the Law concerning her husband .
45007003	So then , if she lives with another man while her husband is alive , she’s committing adultery . But if her husband dies , she’s free from the Law , so she won’t be committing adultery if she marries someone else .
45007004	Therefore , my brothers and sisters , you also died with respect to the Law through the body of Christ , so that you could be united with someone else . You are united with the one who was raised from the dead so that we can bear fruit for God .
45007005	When we were self-centered , the sinful passions aroused through the Law were at work in all the parts of our body , so that we bore fruit for death .
45007006	But now we have been released from the Law . We have died with respect to the thing that controlled us , so that we can be slaves in the new life under the Spirit , not in the old life under the written Law .
45007007	So what are we going to say ? That the Law is sin ? Absolutely not ! But I wouldn’t have known sin except through the Law . I wouldn’t have known the desire for what others have if the Law had not said , Don’t desire what others have .
45007008	But sin seized the opportunity and used this commandment to produce all kinds of desires in me . Sin is dead without the Law .
45007009	I used to be alive without the Law , but when the commandment came , sin sprang to life ,
45007010	and I died . So the commandment that was intended to give life brought death .
45007011	Sin seized the opportunity through the commandment , deceived me , and killed me .
45007012	So the Law itself is holy , and the commandment is holy , righteous , and good .
45007013	So did something good bring death to me ? Absolutely not ! But sin caused my death through something good so that sin would be exposed as sin . That way sin would become even more thoroughly sinful through the commandment .
45007014	We know that the Law is spiritual , but I’m made of flesh and blood , and I’m sold as a slave to sin .
45007015	I don’t know what I’m doing , because I don’t do what I want to do . Instead , I do the thing that I hate .
45007016	But if I’m doing the thing that I don’t want to do , I’m agreeing that the Law is right .
45007017	But now I’m not the one doing it anymore . Instead , it’s sin that lives in me .
45007018	I know that good doesn’t live in me — that is , in my body . The desire to do good is inside of me , but I can’t do it .
45007019	I don’t do the good that I want to do , but I do the evil that I don’t want to do .
45007020	But if I do the very thing that I don’t want to do , then I’m not the one doing it anymore . Instead , it is sin that lives in me that is doing it .
45007021	So I find that , as a rule , when I want to do what is good , evil is right there with me .
45007022	I gladly agree with the Law on the inside ,
45007023	but I see a different law at work in my body . It wages a war against the law of my mind and takes me prisoner with the law of sin that is in my body .
45007024	I’m a miserable human being . Who will deliver me from this dead corpse ?
45007025	Thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord ! So then I’m a slave to God’s Law in my mind , but I’m a slave to sin’s law in my body .
45008001	So now there isn’t any condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus .
45008002	The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and death .
45008003	God has done what was impossible for the Law , since it was weak because of selfishness . God condemned sin in the body by sending his own Son to deal with sin in the same body as humans , who are controlled by sin .
45008004	He did this so that the righteous requirement of the Law might be fulfilled in us . Now the way we live is based on the Spirit , not based on selfishness .
45008005	People whose lives are based on selfishness think about selfish things , but people whose lives are based on the Spirit think about things that are related to the Spirit .
45008006	The attitude that comes from selfishness leads to death , but the attitude that comes from the Spirit leads to life and peace .
45008007	So the attitude that comes from selfishness is hostile to God . It doesn’t submit to God’s Law , because it can’t .
45008008	People who are self-centered aren’t able to please God .
45008009	But you aren’t self-centered . Instead you are in the Spirit , if in fact God’s Spirit lives in you . If anyone doesn’t have the Spirit of Christ , they don’t belong to him .
45008010	If Christ is in you , the Spirit is your life because of God’s righteousness , but the body is dead because of sin .
45008011	If the Spirit of the one who raised Jesus from the dead lives in you , the one who raised Christ from the dead will give life to your human bodies also , through his Spirit that lives in you .
45008012	So then , brothers and sisters , we have an obligation , but it isn’t an obligation to ourselves to live our lives on the basis of selfishness .
45008013	If you live on the basis of selfishness , you are going to die . But if you put to death the actions of the body with the Spirit , you will live .
45008014	All who are led by God’s Spirit are God’s sons and daughters .
45008015	You didn’t receive a spirit of slavery to lead you back again into fear , but you received a Spirit that shows you are adopted as his children . With this Spirit , we cry , " Abba , Father . "
45008016	The same Spirit agrees with our spirit , that we are God’s children .
45008017	But if we are children , we are also heirs . We are God’s heirs and fellow heirs with Christ , if we really suffer with him so that we can also be glorified with him .
45008018	I believe that the present suffering is nothing compared to the coming glory that is going to be revealed to us .
45008019	The whole creation waits breathless with anticipation for the revelation of God’s sons and daughters .
45008020	Creation was subjected to frustration , not by its own choice — it was the choice of the one who subjected it — but in the hope
45008021	that the creation itself will be set free from slavery to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of God’s children .
45008022	We know that the whole creation is groaning together and suffering labor pains up until now .
45008023	And it’s not only the creation . We ourselves who have the Spirit as the first crop of the harvest also groan inside as we wait to be adopted and for our bodies to be set free .
45008024	We were saved in hope . If we see what we hope for , that isn’t hope . Who hopes for what they already see ?
45008025	But if we hope for what we don’t see , we wait for it with patience .
45008026	In the same way , the Spirit comes to help our weakness . We don’t know what we should pray , but the Spirit himself pleads our case with unexpressed groans .
45008027	The one who searches hearts knows how the Spirit thinks , because he pleads for the saints , consistent with God’s will .
45008028	We know that God works all things together for good for the ones who love God , for those who are called according to his purpose .
45008029	We know this because God knew them in advance , and he decided in advance that they would be conformed to the image of his Son . That way his Son would be the first of many brothers and sisters .
45008030	Those who God decided in advance would be conformed to his Son , he also called . Those whom he called , he also made righteous . Those whom he made righteous , he also glorified .
45008031	So what are we going to say about these things ? If God is for us , who is against us ?
45008032	He didn’t spare his own Son but gave him up for us all . Won’t he also freely give us all things with him ?
45008033	Who will bring a charge against God’s elect people ? It is God who acquits them .
45008034	Who is going to convict them ? It is Christ Jesus who died , even more , who was raised , and who also is at God’s right side . It is Christ Jesus who also pleads our case for us .
45008035	Who will separate us from Christ’s love ? Will we be separated by trouble , or distress , or harassment , or famine , or nakedness , or danger , or sword ?
45008036	As it is written , We are being put to death all day long for your sake . We are treated like sheep for slaughter .
45008037	But in all these things we win a sweeping victory through the one who loved us .
45008038	I’m convinced that nothing can separate us from God’s love in Christ Jesus our Lord : not death or life , not angels or rulers , not present things or future things , not powers
45008039	or height or depth , or any other thing that is created .
45009001	I’m speaking the truth in Christ — I’m not lying , as my conscience assures me with the Holy Spirit :
45009002	I have great sadness and constant pain in my heart .
45009003	I wish I could be cursed , cut off from Christ if it helped my brothers and sisters , who are my flesh-and-blood relatives .
45009004	They are Israelites . The adoption as God’s children , the glory , the covenants , the giving of the Law , the worship , and the promises belong to them .
45009005	The Jewish ancestors are theirs , and the Christ descended from those ancestors . He is the one who rules over all things , who is God , and who is blessed forever . Amen .
45009006	But it’s not as though God’s word has failed . Not all who are descended from Israel are part of Israel .
45009007	Not all of Abraham’s children are called Abraham’s descendants , but instead your descendants will be named through Isaac .
45009008	That means it isn’t the natural children who are God’s children , but it is the children from the promise who are counted as descendants .
45009009	The words in the promise were : A year from now I will return , and Sarah will have a son .
45009010	Not only that , but also Rebecca conceived children with one man , our ancestor Isaac .
45009011	When they hadn’t been born yet and when they hadn’t yet done anything good or bad , it was shown that God’s purpose would continue because it was based on his choice .
45009012	It wasn’t because of what was done but because of God’s call . This was said to her : The older child will be a slave to the younger one .
45009013	As it is written , I loved Jacob , but I hated Esau .
45009014	So what are we going to say ? Isn’t this unfair on God’s part ? Absolutely not !
45009015	He says to Moses , I’ll have mercy on whomever I choose to have mercy , and I’ll show compassion to whomever I choose to show compassion .
45009016	So then , it doesn’t depend on a person’s desire or effort . It depends entirely on God , who shows mercy .
45009017	Scripture says to Pharaoh , I have put you in this position for this very thing : so I can show my power in you and so that my name can be spread through the entire earth .
45009018	So then , God has mercy on whomever he wants to , but he makes resistant whomever he wants to .
45009019	So you are going to say to me , " Then why does he still blame people ? Who has ever resisted his will ? "
45009020	You are only a human being . Who do you think you are to talk back to God ? Does the clay say to the potter , " Why did you make me like this ? "
45009021	Doesn’t the potter have the power over the clay to make one pot for special purposes and another for garbage from the same lump of clay ?
45009022	What if God very patiently puts up with pots made for wrath that were designed for destruction , because he wanted to show his wrath and to make his power known ?
45009023	What if he did this to make the wealth of his glory known toward pots made for mercy , which he prepared in advance for glory ?
45009024	We are the ones God has called . We don’t come only from the Jews but we also come from the Gentiles .
45009025	As it says also in Hosea , I will call “ my people ” those who aren’t my people , and the one who isn’t well loved , I will call “ loved one . ”
45009026	And in the place where it was said to them , " You aren’t my people , " there they will be called " the living God’s children . "
45009027	But Isaiah cries out for Israel , Though the number of Israel’s children will be like the sand of the sea , only a remaining part will be saved ,
45009029	As Isaiah prophesied , If the Lord of the heavenly forces had not left descendants for us , we would have been like Sodom , and we would have become like Gomorrah .
45009030	So what are we going to say ? Gentiles who weren’t striving for righteousness achieved righteousness , the righteousness that comes from faith .
45009031	But though Israel was striving for a Law of righteousness , they didn’t arrive .
45009032	Why ? It’s because they didn’t go for it by faith but they went for it as if it could be reached by doing something . They have tripped over a stumbling block .
45009033	As it is written : Look ! I’m putting a stumbling block in Zion , which is a rock that offends people . And the one who has faith in him will not be put to shame .
45010001	Brothers and sisters , my heart’s desire is for Israel’s salvation . That’s my prayer to God for them .
45010002	I can vouch for them : they are enthusiastic about God . However , it isn’t informed by knowledge .
45010003	They don’t submit to God’s righteousness because they don’t understand his righteousness , and they try to establish their own righteousness .
45010004	Christ is the goal of the Law , which leads to righteousness for all who have faith in God .
45010005	Moses writes about the righteousness that comes from the Law : The person who does these things will live by them .
45010006	But the righteousness that comes from faith talks like this : Don’t say in your heart , " Who will go up into heaven ? " ( that is , to bring Christ down )
45010007	or " Who will go down into the region below ? " ( that is , to bring Christ up from the dead ) .
45010008	But what does it say ? The word is near you , in your mouth and in your heart ( that is , the message of faith that we preach ) .
45010009	Because if you confess with your mouth " Jesus is Lord " and in your heart you have faith that God raised him from the dead , you will be saved .
45010010	Trusting with the heart leads to righteousness , and confessing with the mouth leads to salvation .
45010011	The scripture says , All who have faith in him won’t be put to shame .
45010012	There is no distinction between Jew and Greek , because the same Lord is Lord of all , who gives richly to all who call on him .
45010013	All who call on the Lord’s name will be saved .
45010014	So how can they call on someone they don’t have faith in ? And how can they have faith in someone they haven’t heard of ? And how can they hear without a preacher ?
45010015	And how can they preach unless they are sent ? As it is written , How beautiful are the feet of those who announce the good news .
45010016	But everyone hasn’t obeyed the good news . As Isaiah says , Lord , who has had faith in our message ?
45010017	So , faith comes from listening , but it’s listening by means of Christ’s message .
45010018	But I ask you , didn’t they hear it ? Definitely ! Their voice has gone out into the entire earth , and their message has gone out to the corners of the inhabited world .
45010019	But I ask you again , didn’t Israel understand ? First , Moses says , I will make you jealous of those who aren’t a people , of a people without understanding .
45010020	And Isaiah even dares to say , I was found by those who didn’t look for me ; I revealed myself to those who didn’t ask for me .
45010021	But he says about Israel , All day long I stretched out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people .
45011001	So I ask you , has God rejected his people ? Absolutely not ! I’m an Israelite , a descendant of Abraham , from the tribe of Benjamin .
45011002	God hasn’t rejected his people , whom he knew in advance . Or don’t you know what the scripture says in the case of Elijah , when he pleads with God against Israel ?
45011003	Lord , they have killed your prophets , and they have torn down your altars . I’m the only one left , and they are trying to take my life .
45011004	But what is God’s reply to him ? I have kept for myself seven thousand people who haven’t bowed their knees to Baal .
45011005	So also in the present time there is a remaining group by the choice of God’s grace .
45011006	But if it is by grace , it isn’t by what’s done anymore . If it were , God’s grace wouldn’t be grace .
45011007	So what ? Israel didn’t find what it was looking for . Those who were chosen found it , but the others were resistant .
45011008	As it is written , God gave them a dull spirit , so that their eyes would not see and their ears not hear , right up until the present day .
45011009	And David says , Their table should become a pitfall and a trap , a stumbling block and payback to them for what they have done .
45011010	Their eyes should be darkened so they can’t see , and their backs always bent .
45011011	So I’m asking you : They haven’t stumbled so that they’ve fallen permanently , have they ? Absolutely not ! But salvation has come to the Gentiles by their failure , in order to make Israel jealous .
45011012	But if their failure brings riches to the world , and their defeat brings riches to the Gentiles , how much more will come from the completion of their number !
45011013	I’m speaking to you Gentiles . Considering that I’m an apostle to the Gentiles , I publicize my own ministry
45011014	in the hope that somehow I might make my own people jealous and save some of them .
45011015	If their rejection has brought about a close relationship between God and the world , how can their acceptance mean anything less than life from the dead ?
45011016	But if part of a batch of dough is offered to God as holy , the whole batch of dough is holy too . If a root is holy , the branches will be holy too .
45011017	If some of the branches were broken off , and you were a wild olive branch , and you were grafted in among the other branches and shared the root that produces the rich oil of the olive tree ,
45011018	then don’t brag like you’re better than the other branches . If you do brag , be careful : it’s not you that sustains the root , but it’s the root that sustains you .
45011019	You will say then , " Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in . "
45011020	Fine . They were broken off because they weren’t faithful , but you stand only by your faithfulness . So don’t think in a proud way ; instead be afraid .
45011021	If God didn’t spare the natural branches , he won’t spare you either .
45011022	So look at God’s kindness and harshness . It’s harshness toward those who fell , but it’s God’s kindness for you , provided you continue in his kindness ; otherwise , you could be cut off too .
45011023	And even those who were cut off will be grafted back in if they don’t continue to be unfaithful , because God is able to graft them in again .
45011024	If you were naturally part of a wild olive tree and you were cut off from it , and then , contrary to nature , you were grafted into the cultivated olive tree , won’t these natural branches stand an even better chance of being grafted back onto their own olive tree ?
45011025	I don’t want you to be unaware of this secret , brothers and sisters . That way you won’t think too highly of yourselves . A part of Israel has become resistant until the full number of the Gentiles comes in .
45011026	In this way , all Israel will be saved , as it is written : The deliverer will come from Zion . He will remove ungodly behavior from Jacob .
45011027	This is my covenant with them , when I take away their sins .
45011028	According to the gospel , they are enemies for your sake , but according to God’s choice , they are loved for the sake of their ancestors .
45011029	God’s gifts and calling can’t be taken back .
45011030	Once you were disobedient to God , but now you have mercy because they were disobedient .
45011031	In the same way , they have also been disobedient because of the mercy that you received , so now they can receive mercy too .
45011032	God has locked up all people in disobedience , in order to have mercy on all of them .
45011033	God’s riches , wisdom , and knowledge are so deep ! They are as mysterious as his judgments , and they are as hard to track as his paths !
45011034	Who has known the Lord’s mind ? Or who has been his mentor ?
45011035	Or who has given him a gift and has been paid back by him ?
45011036	All things are from him and through him and for him . May the glory be to him forever . Amen .
45012001	So , brothers and sisters , because of God’s mercies , I encourage you to present your bodies as a living sacrifice that is holy and pleasing to God . This is your appropriate priestly service .
45012002	Don’t be conformed to the patterns of this world , but be transformed by the renewing of your minds so that you can figure out what God’s will is — what is good and pleasing and mature .
45012003	Because of the grace that God gave me , I can say to each one of you : don’t think of yourself more highly than you ought to think . Instead , be reasonable since God has measured out a portion of faith to each one of you .
45012004	We have many parts in one body , but the parts don’t all have the same function .
45012005	In the same way , though there are many of us , we are one body in Christ , and individually we belong to each other .
45012006	We have different gifts that are consistent with God’s grace that has been given to us . If your gift is prophecy , you should prophesy in proportion to your faith .
45012007	If your gift is service , devote yourself to serving . If your gift is teaching , devote yourself to teaching .
45012008	If your gift is encouragement , devote yourself to encouraging . The one giving should do it with no strings attached . The leader should lead with passion . The one showing mercy should be cheerful .
45012009	Love should be shown without pretending . Hate evil , and hold on to what is good .
45012010	Love each other like the members of your family . Be the best at showing honor to each other .
45012011	Don’t hesitate to be enthusiastic — be on fire in the Spirit as you serve the Lord !
45012012	Be happy in your hope , stand your ground when you’re in trouble , and devote yourselves to prayer .
45012013	Contribute to the needs of God’s people , and welcome strangers into your home .
45012014	Bless people who harass you — bless and don’t curse them .
45012015	Be happy with those who are happy , and cry with those who are crying .
45012016	Consider everyone as equal , and don’t think that you’re better than anyone else . Instead , associate with people who have no status . Don’t think that you’re so smart .
45012017	Don’t pay back anyone for their evil actions with evil actions , but show respect for what everyone else believes is good .
45012018	If possible , to the best of your ability , live at peace with all people .
45012019	Don’t try to get revenge for yourselves , my dear friends , but leave room for God’s wrath . It is written , Revenge belongs to me ; I will pay it back , says the Lord .
45012020	Instead , If your enemy is hungry , feed him ; if he is thirsty , give him a drink . By doing this , you will pile burning coals of fire upon his head .
45012021	Don’t be defeated by evil , but defeat evil with good .
45013001	Every person should place themselves under the authority of the government . There isn’t any authority unless it comes from God , and the authorities that are there have been put in place by God .
45013002	So anyone who opposes the authority is standing against what God has established . People who take this kind of stand will get punished .
45013003	The authorities don’t frighten people who are doing the right thing . Rather , they frighten people who are doing wrong . Would you rather not be afraid of authority ? Do what’s right , and you will receive its approval .
45013004	It is God’s servant given for your benefit . But if you do what’s wrong , be afraid because it doesn’t have weapons to enforce the law for nothing . It is God’s servant put in place to carry out his punishment on those who do what is wrong .
45013005	That is why it is necessary to place yourself under the government’s authority , not only to avoid God’s punishment but also for the sake of your conscience .
45013006	You should also pay taxes for the same reason , because the authorities are God’s assistants , concerned with this very thing .
45013007	So pay everyone what you owe them . Pay the taxes you owe , pay the duties you are charged , give respect to those you should respect , and honor those you should honor .
45013008	Don’t be in debt to anyone , except for the obligation to love each other . Whoever loves another person has fulfilled the Law .
45013009	The commandments , Don’t commit adultery , don’t murder , don’t steal , don’t desire what others have , and any other commandments , are all summed up in one word : You must love your neighbor as yourself .
45013010	Love doesn’t do anything wrong to a neighbor ; therefore , love is what fulfills the Law .
45013011	As you do all this , you know what time it is . The hour has already come for you to wake up from your sleep . Now our salvation is nearer than when we first had faith .
45013012	The night is almost over , and the day is near . So let’s get rid of the actions that belong to the darkness and put on the weapons of light .
45013013	Let’s behave appropriately as people who live in the day , not in partying and getting drunk , not in sleeping around and obscene behavior , not in fighting and obsession .
45013014	Instead , dress yourself with the Lord Jesus Christ , and don’t plan to indulge your selfish desires .
45014001	Welcome the person who is weak in faith — but not in order to argue about differences of opinion .
45014002	One person believes in eating everything , while the weak person eats only vegetables .
45014003	Those who eat must not look down on the ones who don’t , and the ones who don’t eat must not judge the ones who do , because God has accepted them .
45014004	Who are you to judge someone else’s servants ? They stand or fall before their own Lord ( and they will stand , because the Lord has the power to make them stand ) .
45014005	One person considers some days to be more sacred than others , while another person considers all days to be the same . Each person must have their own convictions .
45014006	Someone who thinks that a day is sacred , thinks that way for the Lord . Those who eat , eat for the Lord , because they thank God . And those who don’t eat , don’t eat for the Lord , and they thank the Lord too .
45014007	We don’t live for ourselves and we don’t die for ourselves .
45014008	If we live , we live for the Lord , and if we die , we die for the Lord . Therefore , whether we live or die , we belong to God .
45014009	This is why Christ died and lived : so that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living .
45014010	But why do you judge your brother or sister ? Or why do you look down on your brother or sister ? We all will stand in front of the judgment seat of God .
45014011	Because it is written , As I live , says the Lord , every knee will bow to me , and every tongue will give praise to God .
45014012	So then , each of us will give an account of ourselves to God .
45014013	So stop judging each other . Instead , this is what you should decide : never put a stumbling block or obstacle in the way of your brother or sister .
45014014	I know and I’m convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing is wrong to eat in itself . But if someone thinks something is wrong to eat , it becomes wrong for that person .
45014015	If your brother or sister is upset by your food , you are no longer walking in love . Don’t let your food destroy someone for whom Christ died .
45014016	And don’t let something you consider to be good be criticized as wrong .
45014017	God’s kingdom isn’t about eating food and drinking but about righteousness , peace , and joy in the Holy Spirit .
45014018	Whoever serves Christ this way pleases God and gets human approval .
45014019	So let’s strive for the things that bring peace and the things that build each other up .
45014020	Don’t destroy what God has done because of food . All food is acceptable , but it’s a bad thing if it trips someone else .
45014021	It’s a good thing not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything that trips your brother or sister .
45014022	Keep the belief that you have to yourself — it’s between you and God . People are blessed who don’t convict themselves by the things they approve .
45014023	But those who have doubts are convicted if they go ahead and eat , because they aren’t acting on the basis of faith . Everything that isn’t based on faith is sin .
45015001	We who are powerful need to be patient with the weakness of those who don’t have power , and not please ourselves .
45015002	Each of us should please our neighbors for their good in order to build them up .
45015003	Christ didn’t please himself , but , as it is written , The insults of those who insulted you fell on me .
45015004	Whatever was written in the past was written for our instruction so that we could have hope through endurance and through the encouragement of the scriptures .
45015005	May the God of endurance and encouragement give you the same attitude toward each other , similar to Christ Jesus’ attitude .
45015006	That way you can glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ together with one voice .
45015007	So welcome each other , in the same way that Christ also welcomed you , for God’s glory .
45015008	I’m saying that Christ became a servant of those who are circumcised for the sake of God’s truth , in order to confirm the promises given to the ancestors ,
45015009	and so that the Gentiles could glorify God for his mercy . As it is written , Because of this I will confess you among the Gentiles , and I will sing praises to your name .
45015010	And again , it says , Rejoice , Gentiles , with his people .
45015011	And again , Praise the Lord , all you Gentiles , and all the people should sing his praises .
45015012	And again , Isaiah says , There will be a root of Jesse , who will also rise to rule the Gentiles .
45015013	May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in faith so that you overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit .
45015014	My brothers and sisters , I myself am convinced that you yourselves are full of goodness , filled with all knowledge , and are able to teach each other .
45015015	But I’ve written to you in a sort of daring way , partly to remind you of what you already know . I’m writing to you in this way because of the grace that was given to me by God .
45015016	It helps me to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles . I’m working as a priest of God’s gospel so that the offering of the Gentiles can be acceptable and made holy by the Holy Spirit .
45015017	So in Christ Jesus I brag about things that have to do with God .
45015018	I don’t dare speak about anything except what Christ has done through me to bring about the obedience of the Gentiles . He did it by what I’ve said and what I’ve done ,
45015019	by the power of signs and wonders , and by the power of God’s Spirit . So I’ve completed the circuit of preaching Christ’s gospel from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum .
45015020	In this way , I have a goal to preach the gospel where they haven’t heard of Christ yet , so that I won’t be building on someone else’s foundation .
45015021	Instead , as it’s written , Those who hadn’t been told about him will see , and those who hadn’t heard will understand .
45015022	That’s why I’ve been stopped so many times from coming to see you .
45015023	But now , since I don’t have any place to work in these regions anymore , and since I’ve wanted to come to see you for many years ,
45015024	I’ll visit you when I go to Spain . I hope to see you while I’m passing through . And I hope you will send me on my way there , after I have first been reenergized by some time in your company .
45015025	But now I’m going to Jerusalem , to serve God’s people .
45015026	Macedonia and Achaia have been happy to make a contribution for the poor among God’s people in Jerusalem .
45015027	They were happy to do this , and they are actually in debt to God’s people in Jerusalem . If the Gentiles got a share of the Jewish people’s spiritual resources , they ought to minister to them with material resources .
45015028	So then after I have finished this job and have safely delivered the final amount of the Gentiles’ offering to them , I will leave for Spain , visiting you on the way .
45015029	And I know that when I come to you I will come with the fullest blessing of Christ .
45015030	Brothers and sisters , I urge you , through our Lord Jesus Christ and through the love of the Spirit , to join me in my struggles in your prayers to God for me .
45015031	Pray that I will be rescued from the people in Judea who don’t believe . Also , pray that my service for Jerusalem will be acceptable to God’s people there
45015032	so that I can come to you with joy by God’s will and be reenergized with your company .
45015033	May the God of peace be with you all . Amen .
45016001	I’m introducing our sister Phoebe to you , who is a servant of the church in Cenchreae .
45016002	Welcome her in the Lord in a way that is worthy of God’s people , and give her whatever she needs from you , because she herself has been a sponsor of many people , myself included .
45016003	Say hello to Prisca and Aquila , my coworkers in Christ Jesus ,
45016004	who risked their own necks for my life . I’m not the only one who thanks God for them , but all the churches of the Gentiles do the same .
45016005	Also say hello to the church that meets in their house . Say hello to Epaenetus , my dear friend , who was the first convert in Asia for Christ .
45016006	Say hello to Mary , who has worked very hard for you .
45016007	Say hello to Andronicus and Junia , my relatives and my fellow prisoners . They are prominent among the apostles , and they were in Christ before me .
45016008	Say hello to Ampliatus , my dear friend in the Lord .
45016009	Say hello to Urbanus , our coworker in Christ , and my dear friend Stachys .
45016010	Say hello to Apelles , who is tried and true in Christ . Say hello to the members of the household of Aristobulus .
45016011	Say hello to my relative Herodion . Say hello to the members of the household of Narcissus who are in the Lord .
45016012	Say hello to Tryphaena and Tryphosa , who are workers for the Lord . Say hello to my dear friend Persis , who has worked hard in the Lord .
45016013	Say hello to Rufus , who is an outstanding believer , along with his mother and mine .
45016014	Say hello to Asyncritus , Phlegon , Hermes , Patrobas , Hermas , and the brothers and sisters who are with them .
45016015	Say hello to Philologus and Julia , Nereus and his sister , and Olympas , and all the saints who are with them .
45016016	Say hello to each other with a holy kiss . All the churches of Christ say hello to you .
45016017	Brothers and sisters , I urge you to watch out for people who create divisions and problems against the teaching that you learned . Keep away from them .
45016018	People like that aren’t serving the Lord . They are serving their own feelings . They deceive the hearts of innocent people with smooth talk and flattery .
45016019	The news of your obedience has reached everybody , so I’m happy for you . But I want you to be wise about what’s good , and innocent about what’s evil .
45016020	The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet . The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you .
45016021	Timothy my coworker says hello to you , and Lucius , Jason , and Sosipater , my relatives .
45016022	I’m Tertius , and I’m writing this letter to you in the Lord — hello !
45016023	Gaius , who is host to me and to the whole church , says hello to you . Erastus the city treasurer says hello to you , along with our brother Quartus .
45016025	May the glory be to God who can strengthen you with my good news and the message that I preach about Jesus Christ . He can strengthen you with the announcement of the secret that was kept quiet for a long time .
45016026	Now that secret is revealed through what the prophets wrote . It is made known to the Gentiles in order to lead to their faithful obedience based on the command of the eternal God .
45016027	May the glory be to God , who alone is wise ! May the glory be to him through Jesus Christ forever ! Amen .
46001001	From Paul , called by God’s will to be an apostle of Jesus Christ , and from Sosthenes our brother .
46001002	To God’s church that is in Corinth : To those who have been made holy to God in Christ Jesus , who are called to be God’s people . Together with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place — he’s their Lord and ours !
46001003	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
46001004	I thank my God always for you , because of God’s grace that was given to you in Christ Jesus .
46001005	That is , you were made rich through him in everything : in all your communication and every kind of knowledge ,
46001006	in the same way that the testimony about Christ was confirmed with you .
46001007	The result is that you aren’t missing any spiritual gift while you wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed .
46001008	He will also confirm your testimony about Christ until the end so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ .
46001009	God is faithful , and you were called by him to partnership with his Son , Jesus Christ our Lord .
46001010	Now I encourage you , brothers and sisters , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ : Agree with each other and don’t be divided into rival groups . Instead , be restored with the same mind and the same purpose .
46001011	My brothers and sisters , Chloe’s people gave me some information about you , that you’re fighting with each other .
46001012	What I mean is this : that each one of you says , " I belong to Paul , " " I belong to Apollos , " " I belong to Cephas , " " I belong to Christ . "
46001013	Has Christ been divided ? Was Paul crucified for you , or were you baptized in Paul’s name ?
46001014	Thank God that I didn’t baptize any of you , except Crispus and Gaius ,
46001015	so that nobody can say that you were baptized in my name !
46001016	Oh , I baptized the house of Stephanas too . Otherwise , I don’t know if I baptized anyone else .
46001017	Christ didn’t send me to baptize but to preach the good news . And Christ didn’t send me to preach the good news with clever words so that Christ’s cross won’t be emptied of its meaning .
46001018	The message of the cross is foolishness to those who are being destroyed . But it is the power of God for those of us who are being saved .
46001019	It is written in scripture : I will destroy the wisdom of the wise , and I will reject the intelligence of the intelligent .
46001020	Where are the wise ? Where are the legal experts ? Where are today’s debaters ? Hasn’t God made the wisdom of the world foolish ?
46001021	In God’s wisdom , he determined that the world wouldn’t come to know him through its wisdom . Instead , God was pleased to save those who believe through the foolishness of preaching .
46001022	Jews ask for signs , and Greeks look for wisdom ,
46001023	but we preach Christ crucified , which is a scandal to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles .
46001024	But to those who are called — both Jews and Greeks — Christ is God’s power and God’s wisdom .
46001025	This is because the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom , and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength .
46001026	Look at your situation when you were called , brothers and sisters ! By ordinary human standards not many were wise , not many were powerful , not many were from the upper class .
46001027	But God chose what the world considers foolish to shame the wise . God chose what the world considers weak to shame the strong .
46001028	And God chose what the world considers low-class and low-life — what is considered to be nothing — to reduce what is considered to be something to nothing .
46001029	So no human being can brag in God’s presence .
46001030	It is because of God that you are in Christ Jesus . He became wisdom from God for us . This means that he made us righteous and holy , and he delivered us .
46001031	This is consistent with what was written : The one who brags should brag in the Lord !
46002001	When I came to you , brothers and sisters , I didn’t come preaching God’s secrets to you like I was an expert in speech or wisdom .
46002002	I had made up my mind not to think about anything while I was with you except Jesus Christ , and to preach him as crucified .
46002003	I stood in front of you with weakness , fear , and a lot of shaking .
46002004	My message and my preaching weren’t presented with convincing wise words but with a demonstration of the Spirit and of power .
46002005	I did this so that your faith might not depend on the wisdom of people but on the power of God .
46002006	What we say is wisdom to people who are mature . It isn’t a wisdom that comes from the present day or from today’s leaders who are being reduced to nothing .
46002007	We talk about God’s wisdom , which has been hidden as a secret . God determined this wisdom in advance , before time began , for our glory .
46002008	It is a wisdom that none of the present-day rulers have understood , because if they did understand it , they would never have crucified the Lord of glory !
46002009	But this is precisely what is written : God has prepared things for those who love him that no eye has seen , or ear has heard , or that haven’t crossed the mind of any human being .
46002010	God has revealed these things to us through the Spirit . The Spirit searches everything , including the depths of God .
46002011	Who knows a person’s depths except their own spirit that lives in them ? In the same way , no one has known the depths of God except God’s Spirit .
46002012	We haven’t received the world’s spirit but God’s Spirit so that we can know the things given to us by God .
46002013	These are the things we are talking about — not with words taught by human wisdom but with words taught by the Spirit — we are interpreting spiritual things to spiritual people .
46002014	But people who are unspiritual don’t accept the things from God’s Spirit . They are foolishness to them and can’t be understood , because they can only be comprehended in a spiritual way .
46002015	Spiritual people comprehend everything , but they themselves aren’t understood by anyone .
46002016	Who has known the mind of the Lord , who will advise him ? But we have the mind of Christ .
46003001	Brothers and sisters , I couldn’t talk to you like spiritual people but like unspiritual people , like babies in Christ .
46003002	I gave you milk to drink instead of solid food , because you weren’t up to it yet .
46003003	Now you are still not up to it because you are still unspiritual . When jealousy and fighting exist between you , aren’t you unspiritual and living by human standards ?
46003004	When someone says , " I belong to Paul , " and someone else says , " I belong to Apollos , " aren’t you acting like people without the Spirit ?
46003005	After all , what is Apollos ? What is Paul ? They are servants who helped you to believe . Each one had a role given to them by the Lord :
46003006	I planted , Apollos watered , but God made it grow .
46003007	Because of this , neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything , but the only one who is anything is God who makes it grow .
46003008	The one who plants and the one who waters work together , but each one will receive their own reward for their own labor .
46003009	We are God’s coworkers , and you are God’s field , God’s building .
46003010	I laid a foundation like a wise master builder according to God’s grace that was given to me , but someone else is building on top of it . Each person needs to pay attention to the way they build on it .
46003011	No one can lay any other foundation besides the one that is already laid , which is Jesus Christ .
46003012	So , whether someone builds on top of the foundation with gold , silver , precious stones , wood , grass , or hay ,
46003013	each one’s work will be clearly shown . The day will make it clear , because it will be revealed with fire — the fire will test the quality of each one’s work .
46003014	If anyone’s work survives , they’ll get a reward .
46003015	But if anyone’s work goes up in flames , they’ll lose it . However , they themselves will be saved as if they had gone through a fire .
46003016	Don’t you know that you are God’s temple and God’s Spirit lives in you ?
46003017	If someone destroys God’s temple , God will destroy that person , because God’s temple is holy , which is what you are .
46003018	Don’t fool yourself . If some of you think they are worldly-wise , then they should become foolish so that they can become wise .
46003019	This world’s wisdom is foolishness to God . As it’s written , He catches the wise in their cleverness .
46003020	And also , The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are silly .
46003021	So then , no one should brag about human beings . Everything belongs to you —
46003022	Paul , Apollos , Cephas , the world , life , death , things in the present , things in the future — everything belongs to you ,
46003023	but you belong to Christ , and Christ belongs to God .
46004001	So a person should think about us this way — as servants of Christ and managers of God’s secrets .
46004002	In this kind of situation , what is expected of a manager is that they prove to be faithful .
46004003	I couldn’t care less if I’m judged by you or by any human court ; I don’t even judge myself .
46004004	I’m not aware of anything against me , but that doesn’t make me innocent , because the Lord is the one who judges me .
46004005	So don’t judge anything before the right time — wait until the Lord comes . He will bring things that are hidden in the dark to light , and he will make people’s motivations public . Then there will be recognition for each person from God .
46004006	Brothers and sisters , I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit . I’ve done this so that you can learn what it means not to go beyond what has been written and so none of you will become arrogant by supporting one of us against the other .
46004007	Who says that you are better than anyone else ? What do you have that you didn’t receive ? And if you received it , then why are you bragging as if you didn’t receive it ?
46004008	You’ve been filled already ! You’ve become rich already ! You rule like kings without us ! I wish you did rule so that we could be kings with you !
46004009	I suppose that God has shown that we apostles are at the end of the line . We are like prisoners sentenced to death , because we have become a spectacle in the world , both to angels and to humans .
46004010	We are fools for Christ , but you are wise through Christ ! We are weak , but you are strong ! You are honored , but we are dishonored !
46004011	Up to this very moment we are hungry , thirsty , wearing rags , abused , and homeless .
46004012	We work hard with our own hands . When we are insulted , we respond with a blessing ; when we are harassed , we put up with it ;
46004013	when our reputation is attacked , we are encouraging . We have become the scum of the earth , the waste that runs off everything , up to the present time .
46004014	I’m not writing these things to make you ashamed but to warn you , since you are my loved children .
46004015	You may have ten thousand mentors in Christ , but you don’t have many fathers . I gave birth to you in Christ Jesus through the gospel ,
46004016	so I encourage you to follow my example .
46004017	This is why I’ve sent Timothy to you ; he’s my loved and trusted child in the Lord ; he’ll remind you about my way of life in Christ Jesus . He’ll teach the same way as I teach everywhere in every church .
46004018	Some have become arrogant as if I’m not coming to see you .
46004019	But , if the Lord is willing , I’ll come to you soon . Then I won’t focus on what these arrogant people say , but I’ll find out what power they possess .
46004020	God’s kingdom isn’t about words but about power .
46004021	Which do you want ? Should I come to you with a big stick to punish you , or with love and a gentle spirit ?
46005001	Everyone has heard that there is sexual immorality among you . This is a type of immorality that isn’t even heard of among the Gentiles — a man is having sex with his father’s wife !
46005002	And you’re proud of yourselves instead of being so upset that the one who did this thing is expelled from your community .
46005003	Though I’m absent physically , I’m present in the spirit and I’ve already judged the man who did this as if I were present .
46005004	When you meet together in the name of our Lord Jesus , I’ll be present in spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus .
46005005	At that time we need to hand this man over to Satan to destroy his human weakness so that his spirit might be saved on the day of the Lord .
46005006	Your bragging isn’t good ! Don’t you know that a tiny grain of yeast makes a whole batch of dough rise ?
46005007	Clean out the old yeast so you can be a new batch of dough , given that you’re supposed to be unleavened bread . Christ our Passover lamb has been sacrificed ,
46005008	so let’s celebrate the feast with the unleavened bread of honesty and truth , not with old yeast or with the yeast of evil and wickedness .
46005009	I wrote to you in my earlier letter not to associate with sexually immoral people .
46005010	But I wasn’t talking about the sexually immoral people in the outside world by any means — or the greedy , or the swindlers , or people who worship false gods — otherwise , you would have to leave the world entirely !
46005011	But now I’m writing to you not to associate with anyone who calls themselves " brother " or " sister " who is sexually immoral , greedy , someone who worships false gods , an abusive person , a drunk , or a swindler . Don’t even eat with anyone like this .
46005012	What do I care about judging outsiders ? Isn’t it your job to judge insiders ?
46005013	God will judge outsiders . Expel the evil one from among you !
46006001	When someone in your assembly has a legal case against another member , do they dare to take it to court to be judged by people who aren’t just , instead of by God’s people ?
46006002	Or don’t you know that God’s people will judge the world ? If the world is to be judged by you , are you incompetent to judge trivial cases ?
46006003	Don’t you know that we will judge angels ? Why not ordinary things ?
46006004	So then if you have ordinary lawsuits , do you appoint people as judges who aren’t respected by the church ?
46006005	I’m saying this because you should be ashamed of yourselves ! Isn’t there one person among you who is wise enough to pass judgment between believers ?
46006006	But instead , does a brother or sister have a lawsuit against another brother or sister , and do they do this in front of unbelievers ?
46006007	The fact that you have lawsuits against each other means that you’ve already lost your case . Why not be wronged instead ? Why not be cheated ?
46006008	But instead you are doing wrong and cheating — and you’re doing it to your own brothers and sisters .
46006009	Don’t you know that people who are unjust won’t inherit God’s kingdom ? Don’t be deceived . Those who are sexually immoral , those who worship false gods , adulterers , both participants in same-sex intercourse ,
46006010	thieves , the greedy , drunks , abusive people , and swindlers won’t inherit God’s kingdom .
46006011	That is what some of you used to be ! But you were washed clean , you were made holy to God , and you were made right with God in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God .
46006012	I have the freedom to do anything , but not everything is helpful . I have the freedom to do anything , but I won’t be controlled by anything .
46006013	Food is for the stomach and the stomach is for food , and yet God will do away with both . The body isn’t for sexual immorality but for the Lord , and the Lord is for the body .
46006014	God has raised the Lord and will raise us through his power .
46006015	Don’t you know that your bodies are parts of Christ ? So then , should I take parts of Christ and make them a part of someone who is sleeping around ? No way !
46006016	Don’t you know that anyone who is joined to someone who is sleeping around is one body with that person ? The scripture says , The two will become one flesh .
46006017	The one who is joined to the Lord is one spirit with him .
46006018	Avoid sexual immorality ! Every sin that a person can do is committed outside the body , except those who engage in sexual immorality commit sin against their own bodies .
46006019	Or don’t you know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you ? Don’t you know that you have the Holy Spirit from God , and you don’t belong to yourselves ?
46006020	You have been bought and paid for , so honor God with your body .
46007001	Now , about what you wrote : " It’s good for a man not to have sex with a woman . "
46007002	Each man should have his own wife , and each woman should have her own husband because of sexual immorality .
46007003	The husband should meet his wife’s sexual needs , and the wife should do the same for her husband .
46007004	The wife doesn’t have authority over her own body , but the husband does . Likewise , the husband doesn’t have authority over his own body , but the wife does .
46007005	Don’t refuse to meet each other’s needs unless you both agree for a short period of time to devote yourselves to prayer . Then come back together again so that Satan might not tempt you because of your lack of self-control .
46007006	I’m saying this to give you permission ; it’s not a command .
46007007	I wish all people were like me , but each has a particular gift from God : one has this gift , and another has that one .
46007008	I’m telling those who are single and widows that it’s good for them to stay single like me .
46007009	But if they can’t control themselves , they should get married , because it’s better to marry than to burn with passion .
46007010	I’m passing on the Lord’s command to those who are married : A wife shouldn’t leave her husband ,
46007011	but if she does leave him , then she should stay single or be reconciled to her husband . And a man shouldn’t divorce his wife .
46007012	I’m telling everyone else ( the Lord didn’t say this specifically ) : If a believer has a wife who doesn’t believe , and she agrees to live with him , then he shouldn’t divorce her .
46007013	If a woman has a husband who doesn’t believe and he agrees to live with her , then she shouldn’t divorce him .
46007014	The husband who doesn’t believe belongs to God because of his wife , and the wife who doesn’t believe belongs to God because of her husband . Otherwise , your children would be contaminated by the world , but now they are spiritually set apart .
46007015	But if a spouse who doesn’t believe chooses to leave , then let them leave . The brother or sister isn’t tied down in these circumstances . God has called you to peace .
46007016	How do you know as a wife if you will save your husband ? Or how do you know as a husband if you will save your wife ?
46007017	Nevertheless , each person should live the kind of life that the Lord assigned when he called each one . This is what I teach in all the churches .
46007018	If someone was circumcised when called , he shouldn’t try to reverse it . If someone wasn’t circumcised when he was called , he shouldn’t be circumcised .
46007019	Circumcision is nothing ; not being circumcised is nothing . What matters is keeping God’s commandments .
46007020	Each person should stay in the situation they were in when they were called .
46007021	If you were a slave when you were called , don’t let it bother you . But if you are actually able to be free , take advantage of the opportunity .
46007022	Anyone who was a slave when they were called by the Lord has the status of being the Lord’s free person . In the same way , anyone who was a free person when they were called is Christ’s slave .
46007023	You were bought and paid for . Don’t become slaves of people .
46007024	So then , brothers and sisters , each of you should stay with God in the situation you were in when you were called .
46007025	I don’t have a command from the Lord about people who have never been married , but I’ll give you my opinion as someone you can trust because of the Lord’s mercy .
46007026	So I think this advice is good because of the present crisis : Stay as you are .
46007027	If you are married , don’t get a divorce . If you are divorced , don’t try to find a spouse .
46007028	But if you do marry , you haven’t sinned ; and if someone who hasn’t been married gets married , they haven’t sinned . But married people will have a hard time , and I’m trying to spare you that .
46007029	This is what I’m saying , brothers and sisters : The time has drawn short . From now on , those who have wives should be like people who don’t have them .
46007030	Those who are sad should be like people who aren’t crying . Those who are happy should be like people who aren’t happy . Those who buy something should be like people who don’t have possessions .
46007031	Those who use the world should be like people who aren’t preoccupied with it , because this world in its present form is passing away .
46007032	I want you to be free from concerns . A man who isn’t married is concerned about the Lord’s concerns — how he can please the Lord .
46007033	But a married man is concerned about the world’s concerns — how he can please his wife .
46007034	His attention is divided . A woman who isn’t married or who is a virgin is concerned about the Lord’s concerns so that she can be dedicated to God in both body and spirit . But a married woman is concerned about the world’s concerns — how she can please her husband .
46007035	I’m saying this for your own advantage . It’s not to restrict you but rather to promote effective and consistent service to the Lord without distraction .
46007036	If someone thinks he is acting inappropriately toward an unmarried woman whom he knows , and if he has strong feelings and it seems like the right thing to do , he should do what he wants — he’s not sinning — they should get married .
46007037	But if a man stands firm in his decision , and doesn’t feel the pressure , but has his own will under control , he does right if he decides in his own heart not to marry the woman .
46007038	Therefore , the one who marries the unmarried woman does right , and the one who doesn’t get married will do even better .
46007039	A woman is obligated to stay in her marriage as long as her husband is alive . But if her husband dies , she is free to marry whomever she wants , only it should be a believer in the Lord .
46007040	But in my opinion , she will be happier if she stays the way she is . And I think that I have God’s Spirit too .
46008001	Now concerning meat that has been sacrificed to a false god : We know that we all have knowledge . Knowledge makes people arrogant , but love builds people up .
46008002	If anyone thinks they know something , they don’t yet know as much as they should know .
46008003	But if someone loves God , then they are known by God .
46008004	So concerning the actual food involved in these sacrifices to false gods , we know that a false god isn’t anything in this world , and that there is no God except for the one God .
46008005	Granted , there are so-called " gods , " in heaven and on the earth , as there are many gods and many lords .
46008006	However , for us believers , There is one God the Father . And there is one Lord Jesus Christ .
46008007	But not everybody knows this . Some are eating this food as though it really is food sacrificed to a real idol , because they were used to idol worship until now . Their conscience is weak because it has been damaged .
46008008	Food won’t bring us close to God . We’re not missing out if we don’t eat , and we don’t have any advantage if we do eat .
46008009	But watch out or else this freedom of yours might be a problem for those who are weak .
46008010	Suppose someone sees you ( the person who has knowledge ) eating in an idol’s temple . Won’t the person with a weak conscience be encouraged to eat the meat sacrificed to false gods ?
46008011	The weak brother or sister for whom Christ died is destroyed by your knowledge .
46008012	You sin against Christ if you sin against your brothers and sisters and hurt their weak consciences this way .
46008013	This is why , if food causes the downfall of my brother or sister , I won’t eat meat ever again , or else I may cause my brother or sister to fall .
46009001	Am I not free ? Am I not an apostle ? Haven’t I seen Jesus our Lord ? Aren’t you my work in the Lord ?
46009002	If I’m not an apostle to others , at least I am to you ! You are the seal that shows I’m an apostle .
46009003	This is my defense against those who criticize me .
46009004	Don’t we have the right to eat and drink ?
46009005	Don’t we have the right to travel with a wife who believes like the rest of the apostles , the Lord’s brothers , and Cephas ?
46009006	Or is it only I and Barnabas who don’t have the right to not work for our living ?
46009007	Who joins the army and pays their own way ? Who plants a vineyard and doesn’t eat its fruit ? Who shepherds a flock and doesn’t drink its milk ?
46009008	I’m not saying these things just based on common sense , am I ? Doesn’t the Law itself say these things ?
46009009	In Moses’ Law it’s written : You will not muzzle the ox when it is threshing . Is God worried about oxen ,
46009010	or did he say this entirely for our sake ? It was written for our sake because the one who plows and the one who threshes should each do so with the hope of sharing the produce .
46009011	If we sowed spiritual things in you , is it so much to ask to harvest some material things from you ?
46009012	If others have these rights over you , don’t we deserve them all the more ? However , we haven’t made use of this right , but we put up with everything so we don’t put any obstacle in the way of the gospel of Christ .
46009013	Don’t you know that those who serve in the temple get to eat food from the temple , and those who serve at the altar share part of what is sacrificed on the altar ?
46009014	In the same way , the Lord commanded that those who preach the gospel should get their living from the gospel .
46009015	But I haven’t taken advantage of this . And I’m not writing this so that it will be done for me . It’s better for me to die than to lose my right to brag about this !
46009016	If I preach the gospel , I have no reason to brag , since I’m obligated to do it . I’m in trouble if I don’t preach the gospel .
46009017	If I do this voluntarily , I get rewarded for it . But if I’m forced to do it , then I’ve been charged with a responsibility .
46009018	What reward do I get ? That when I preach , I offer the good news free of charge . That’s why I don’t use the rights to which I’m entitled through the gospel .
46009019	Although I’m free from all people , I make myself a slave to all people , to recruit more of them .
46009020	I act like a Jew to the Jews , so I can recruit Jews . I act like I’m under the Law to those under the Law , so I can recruit those who are under the Law ( though I myself am not under the Law ) .
46009021	I act like I’m outside the Law to those who are outside the Law , so I can recruit those outside the Law ( though I’m not outside the law of God but rather under the law of Christ ) .
46009022	I act weak to the weak , so I can recruit the weak . I have become all things to all people , so I could save some by all possible means .
46009023	All the things I do are for the sake of the gospel , so I can be a partner with it .
46009024	Don’t you know that all the runners in the stadium run , but only one gets the prize ? So run to win .
46009025	Everyone who competes practices self-discipline in everything . The runners do this to get a crown of leaves that shrivel up and die , but we do it to receive a crown that never dies .
46009026	So now this is how I run — not without a clear goal in sight . I fight like a boxer in the ring , not like someone who is shadowboxing .
46009027	Rather , I’m landing punches on my own body and subduing it like a slave . I do this to be sure that I myself won’t be disqualified after preaching to others .
46010001	Brothers and sisters , I want you to be sure of the fact that our ancestors were all under the cloud and they all went through the sea .
46010002	All were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea .
46010003	All ate the same spiritual food ,
46010004	and all drank the same spiritual drink . They drank from a spiritual rock that followed them , and the rock was Christ .
46010005	However , God was unhappy with most of them , and they were struck down in the wilderness .
46010006	These things were examples for us , so we won’t crave evil things like they did .
46010007	Don’t worship false gods like some of them did , as it is written , The people sat down to eat and drink and they got up to play .
46010008	Let’s not practice sexual immorality , like some of them did , and twenty-three thousand died in one day .
46010009	Let’s not test Christ , like some of them did , and were killed by the snakes .
46010010	Let’s not grumble , like some of them did , and were killed by the destroyer .
46010011	These things happened to them as an example and were written as a warning for us to whom the end of time has come .
46010012	So those who think they are standing need to watch out or else they may fall .
46010013	No temptation has seized you that isn’t common for people . But God is faithful . He won’t allow you to be tempted beyond your abilities . Instead , with the temptation , God will also supply a way out so that you will be able to endure it .
46010014	So then , my dear friends , run away from the worship of false gods !
46010015	I’m talking to you like you are sensible people . Think about what I’m saying .
46010016	Isn’t the cup of blessing that we bless a sharing in the blood of Christ ? Isn’t the loaf of bread that we break a sharing in the body of Christ ?
46010017	Since there is one loaf of bread , we who are many are one body , because we all share the one loaf of bread .
46010018	Look at the people of Israel . Don’t those who eat the sacrifices share from the altar ?
46010019	What am I saying then ? That food sacrificed to a false god is anything , or that a false god is anything ?
46010020	No , but this kind of sacrifice is sacrificed to demons and not to God . I don’t want you to be sharing in demons .
46010021	You can’t drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons ; you can’t participate in the table of the Lord and the table of demons .
46010022	Or should we make the Lord jealous ? We aren’t stronger than he is , are we ?
46010023	Everything is permitted , but everything isn’t beneficial . Everything is permitted , but everything doesn’t build others up .
46010024	No one should look out for their own advantage , but they should look out for each other .
46010025	Eat everything that is sold in the marketplace , without asking questions about it because of your conscience .
46010026	The earth and all that is in it belong to the Lord .
46010027	If an unbeliever invites you to eat with them and you want to go , eat whatever is served , without asking questions because of your conscience .
46010028	But if someone says to you , " This meat was sacrificed in a temple , " then don’t eat it for the sake of the one who told you and for the sake of conscience .
46010029	Now when I say " conscience " I don’t mean yours but the other person’s . Why should my freedom be judged by someone else’s conscience ?
46010030	If I participate with gratitude , why should I be blamed for food I thank God for ?
46010031	So , whether you eat or drink or whatever you do , you should do it all for God’s glory .
46010032	Don’t offend either Jews or Greeks , or God’s church .
46010033	This is the same thing that I do . I please everyone in everything I do . I don’t look out for my own advantage , but I look out for many people so that they can be saved .
46011001	Follow my example , just like I follow Christ’s .
46011002	I praise you because you remember all my instructions , and you hold on to the traditions exactly as I handed them on to you .
46011003	Now I want you to know that the head of every man is Christ , and the head of the woman is the man , and the head of Christ is God .
46011004	Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered shames his head .
46011005	Every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered disgraces her head . It is the same thing as having her head shaved .
46011006	If a woman doesn’t cover her head , then she should have her hair cut off . If it is disgraceful for a woman to have short hair or to be shaved , then she should keep her head covered .
46011007	A man shouldn’t have his head covered , because he is the image and glory of God ; but the woman is man’s glory .
46011008	Man didn’t have his origin from woman , but woman from man ;
46011009	and man wasn’t created for the sake of the woman , but the woman for the sake of the man .
46011010	Because of this a woman should have authority over her head , because of the angels .
46011011	However , woman isn’t independent from man , and man isn’t independent from woman in the Lord .
46011012	As woman came from man so also man comes from woman . But everything comes from God .
46011013	Judge for yourselves : Is it appropriate for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered ?
46011014	Doesn’t nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair , it is a disgrace to him ;
46011015	but if a woman has long hair , it is her glory ? This is because her long hair is given to her for a covering .
46011016	But if someone wants to argue about this , we don’t have such a custom , nor do God’s churches .
46011017	Now I don’t praise you as I give the following instruction because when you meet together , it does more harm than good .
46011018	First of all , when you meet together as a church , I hear that there are divisions among you , and I partly believe it .
46011019	It’s necessary that there are groups among you , to make it clear who is genuine .
46011020	So when you get together in one place , it isn’t to eat the Lord’s meal .
46011021	Each of you goes ahead and eats a private meal . One person goes hungry while another is drunk .
46011022	Don’t you have houses to eat and drink in ? Or do you look down on God’s churches and humiliate those who have nothing ? What can I say to you ? Will I praise you ? No , I don’t praise you in this .
46011023	I received a tradition from the Lord , which I also handed on to you : on the night on which he was betrayed , the Lord Jesus took bread .
46011024	After giving thanks , he broke it and said , " This is my body , which is for you ; do this to remember me . "
46011025	He did the same thing with the cup , after they had eaten , saying , " This cup is the new covenant in my blood . Every time you drink it , do this to remember me . "
46011026	Every time you eat this bread and drink this cup , you broadcast the death of the Lord until he comes .
46011027	This is why those who eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord inappropriately will be guilty of the Lord’s body and blood .
46011028	Each individual should test himself or herself , and eat from the bread and drink from the cup in that way .
46011029	Those who eat and drink without correctly understanding the body are eating and drinking their own judgment .
46011030	Because of this , many of you are weak and sick , and quite a few have died .
46011031	But if we had judged ourselves , we wouldn’t be judged .
46011032	However , we are disciplined by the Lord when we are judged so that we won’t be judged and condemned along with the whole world .
46011033	For these reasons , my brothers and sisters , when you get together to eat , wait for each other .
46011034	If some of you are hungry , they should eat at home so that getting together doesn’t lead to judgment . I will give directions about the other things when I come .
46012001	Brothers and sisters , I don’t want you to be ignorant about spiritual gifts .
46012002	You know that when you were Gentiles you were often misled by false gods that can’t even speak .
46012003	So I want to make it clear to you that no one says , " Jesus is cursed ! " when speaking by God’s Spirit , and no one can say , " Jesus is Lord , " except by the Holy Spirit .
46012004	There are different spiritual gifts but the same Spirit ;
46012005	and there are different ministries and the same Lord ;
46012006	and there are different activities but the same God who produces all of them in everyone .
46012007	A demonstration of the Spirit is given to each person for the common good .
46012008	A word of wisdom is given by the Spirit to one person , a word of knowledge to another according to the same Spirit ,
46012009	faith to still another by the same Spirit , gifts of healing to another in the one Spirit ,
46012010	performance of miracles to another , prophecy to another , the ability to tell spirits apart to another , different kinds of tongues to another , and the interpretation of the tongues to another .
46012011	All these things are produced by the one and same Spirit who gives what he wants to each person .
46012012	Christ is just like the human body — a body is a unit and has many parts ; and all the parts of the body are one body , even though there are many .
46012013	We were all baptized by one Spirit into one body , whether Jew or Greek , or slave or free , and we all were given one Spirit to drink .
46012014	Certainly the body isn’t one part but many .
46012015	If the foot says , " I’m not part of the body because I’m not a hand , " does that mean it’s not part of the body ?
46012016	If the ear says , " I’m not part of the body because I’m not an eye , " does that mean it’s not part of the body ?
46012017	If the whole body were an eye , what would happen to the hearing ? And if the whole body were an ear , what would happen to the sense of smell ?
46012018	But as it is , God has placed each one of the parts in the body just like he wanted .
46012019	If all were one and the same body part , what would happen to the body ?
46012020	But as it is , there are many parts but one body .
46012021	So the eye can’t say to the hand , " I don’t need you , " or in turn , the head can’t say to the feet , " I don’t need you . "
46012022	Instead , the parts of the body that people think are the weakest are the most necessary .
46012023	The parts of the body that we think are less honorable are the ones we honor the most . The private parts of our body that aren’t presentable are the ones that are given the most dignity .
46012024	The parts of our body that are presentable don’t need this . But God has put the body together , giving greater honor to the part with less honor
46012025	so that there won’t be division in the body and so the parts might have mutual concern for each other .
46012026	If one part suffers , all the parts suffer with it ; if one part gets the glory , all the parts celebrate with it .
46012027	You are the body of Christ and parts of each other .
46012028	In the church , God has appointed first apostles , second prophets , third teachers , then miracles , then gifts of healing , the ability to help others , leadership skills , different kinds of tongues .
46012029	All aren’t apostles , are they ? All aren’t prophets , are they ? All aren’t teachers , are they ? All don’t perform miracles , do they ?
46012030	All don’t have gifts of healing , do they ? All don’t speak in different tongues , do they ? All don’t interpret , do they ?
46012031	Use your ambition to try to get the greater gifts . And I’m going to show you an even better way .
46013001	If I speak in tongues of human beings and of angels but I don’t have love , I’m a clanging gong or a clashing cymbal .
46013002	If I have the gift of prophecy and I know all the mysteries and everything else , and if I have such complete faith that I can move mountains but I don’t have love , I’m nothing .
46013003	If I give away everything that I have and hand over my own body to feel good about what I’ve done but I don’t have love , I receive no benefit whatsoever .
46013004	Love is patient , love is kind , it isn’t jealous , it doesn’t brag , it isn’t arrogant ,
46013005	it isn’t rude , it doesn’t seek its own advantage , it isn’t irritable , it doesn’t keep a record of complaints ,
46013006	it isn’t happy with injustice , but it is happy with the truth .
46013007	Love puts up with all things , trusts in all things , hopes for all things , endures all things .
46013008	Love never fails . As for prophecies , they will be brought to an end . As for tongues , they will stop . As for knowledge , it will be brought to an end .
46013009	We know in part and we prophesy in part ;
46013010	but when the perfect comes , what is partial will be brought to an end .
46013011	When I was a child , I used to speak like a child , reason like a child , think like a child . But now that I have become a man , I’ve put an end to childish things .
46013012	Now we see a reflection in a mirror ; then we will see face-to-face . Now I know partially , but then I will know completely in the same way that I have been completely known .
46013013	Now faith , hope , and love remain — these three things — and the greatest of these is love .
46014001	Pursue love , and use your ambition to try to get spiritual gifts but especially so that you might prophesy .
46014002	This is because those who speak in a tongue don’t speak to people but to God ; no one understands it — they speak mysteries by the Spirit .
46014003	Those who prophesy speak to people , building them up , and giving them encouragement and comfort .
46014004	People who speak in a tongue build up themselves ; those who prophesy build up the church .
46014005	I wish that all of you spoke in tongues , but I’d rather you could prophesy . Those who prophesy are more important than those who speak in tongues , unless they are able to interpret them so that the church might be built up .
46014006	After all , brothers and sisters , if I come to you speaking in tongues , how will I help you unless I speak to you with a revelation , some knowledge , a prophecy , or a teaching ?
46014007	Likewise , things that aren’t alive like a harp or a lyre can make a sound , but if there aren’t different notes in the sounds they make , how will the tune from the harp or the lyre be recognized ?
46014008	And if a trumpet call is unrecognizable , then who will prepare for battle ?
46014009	It’s the same way with you : If you don’t use language that is easy to understand when you speak in a tongue , then how will anyone understand what is said ?
46014010	It will be as if you are speaking into the air ! There are probably many language families in the world , and none of them are without meaning .
46014011	So if I don’t know the meaning of the language , then I will be like a foreigner to those who speak it , and they will be like foreigners to me .
46014012	The same holds true for you : since you are ambitious for spiritual gifts , use your ambition to try to work toward being the best at building up the church .
46014013	Therefore , those who speak in a tongue should pray to be able to interpret .
46014014	If I pray in a tongue , my spirit prays but my mind isn’t productive .
46014015	What should I do ? I’ll pray in the Spirit , but I’ll pray with my mind too ; I’ll sing a psalm in the Spirit , but I’ll sing the psalm with my mind too .
46014016	After all , if you praise God in the Spirit , how will the people who aren’t trained in that language say " Amen ! " to your thanksgiving , when they don’t know what you are saying ?
46014017	You may offer a beautiful prayer of thanksgiving , but the other person is not being built up .
46014018	I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you .
46014019	But in the church I’d rather speak five words in my right mind than speak thousands of words in a tongue so that I can teach others .
46014020	Brothers and sisters , don’t be like children in the way you think . Well , be babies when it comes to evil , but be adults in your thinking .
46014021	In the Law it is written : I will speak to this people with foreign languages and foreigners’ lips , but they will not even listen to me this way , says the Lord .
46014022	So then , tongues are a sign for those who don’t believe , not for those who believe . But prophecy is a sign for believers , not for those who don’t believe .
46014023	So suppose that the whole church is meeting and everyone is speaking in tongues . If people come in who are outsiders or unbelievers , won’t they say that you are out of your minds ?
46014024	But if everyone is prophesying when an unbeliever or outsider comes in , they are tested by all and called to account by all .
46014025	The secrets of their hearts are brought to light . When that happens , they will fall on their faces and worship God , proclaiming out loud that truly God is among you !
46014026	What is the outcome of this , brothers and sisters ? When you meet together , each one has a psalm , a teaching , a revelation , a tongue , or an interpretation . All these things must be done to build up the church .
46014027	If some speak in a tongue , then let two or at most three speak , one at a time , and someone must interpret .
46014028	However , if there is no interpreter , then they should keep quiet in the meeting . They should speak privately to themselves and to God .
46014029	In the case of prophets , let two or three speak and have the rest evaluate what is said .
46014030	And if some revelation comes to someone else who is sitting down , the first one should be quiet .
46014031	You can all prophesy one at a time so that everyone can learn and be encouraged .
46014032	The spirits of prophets are under the control of the prophets .
46014033	God isn’t a God of disorder but of peace . Like in all the churches of God’s people ,
46014034	the women should be quiet during the meeting . They are not allowed to talk . Instead , they need to get under control , just as the Law says .
46014035	If they want to learn something , they should ask their husbands at home . It is disgraceful for a woman to talk during the meeting .
46014036	Did the word of God originate with you ? Has it come only to you ?
46014037	If anyone thinks that they are prophets or " spiritual people , " then let them recognize that what I’m writing to you is the Lord’s command .
46014038	If someone doesn’t recognize this , they aren’t recognized .
46014039	So then , brothers and sisters , use your ambition to try to get the gift of prophecy , but don’t prevent speaking in tongues .
46014040	Everything should be done with dignity and in proper order .
46015001	Brothers and sisters , I want to call your attention to the good news that I preached to you , which you also received and in which you stand .
46015002	You are being saved through it if you hold on to the message I preached to you , unless somehow you believed it for nothing .
46015003	I passed on to you as most important what I also received : Christ died for our sins in line with the scriptures ,
46015004	he was buried , and he rose on the third day in line with the scriptures .
46015005	He appeared to Cephas , then to the Twelve ,
46015006	and then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers and sisters at once — most of them are still alive to this day , though some have died .
46015007	Then he appeared to James , then to all the apostles ,
46015008	and last of all he appeared to me , as if I were born at the wrong time .
46015009	I’m the least important of the apostles . I don’t deserve to be called an apostle , because I harassed God’s church .
46015010	I am what I am by God’s grace , and God’s grace hasn’t been for nothing . In fact , I have worked harder than all the others — that is , it wasn’t me but the grace of God that is with me .
46015011	So then , whether you heard the message from me or them , this is what we preach and this is what you have believed .
46015012	So if the message that is preached says that Christ has been raised from the dead , then how can some of you say , " There’s no resurrection of the dead " ?
46015013	If there’s no resurrection of the dead , then Christ hasn’t been raised either .
46015014	If Christ hasn’t been raised , then our preaching is useless and your faith is useless .
46015015	We are found to be false witnesses about God , because we testified against God that he raised Christ , when he didn’t raise him if it’s the case that the dead aren’t raised .
46015016	If the dead aren’t raised , then Christ hasn’t been raised either .
46015017	If Christ hasn’t been raised , then your faith is worthless ; you are still in your sins ,
46015018	and what’s more , those who have died in Christ are gone forever .
46015019	If we have a hope in Christ only in this life , then we deserve to be pitied more than anyone else .
46015020	But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead . He’s the first crop of the harvest of those who have died .
46015021	Since death came through a human being , the resurrection of the dead came through one too .
46015022	In the same way that everyone dies in Adam , so also everyone will be given life in Christ .
46015023	Each event will happen in the right order : Christ , the first crop of the harvest , then those who belong to Christ at his coming ,
46015024	and then the end , when Christ hands over the kingdom to God the Father , when he brings every form of rule , every authority and power to an end .
46015025	It is necessary for him to rule until he puts all enemies under his feet .
46015026	Death is the last enemy to be brought to an end ,
46015027	since he has brought everything under control under his feet . When it says that everything has been brought under his control , this clearly means everything except for the one who placed everything under his control .
46015028	But when all things have been brought under his control , then the Son himself will also be under the control of the one who gave him control over everything so that God may be all in all .
46015029	Otherwise , what are those who are getting baptized for the dead doing ? If the dead aren’t raised , then why are they being baptized for them ?
46015030	And what about us ? Why are we in danger all day every day ?
46015031	Brothers and sisters , I swear by the pride I have in you in Christ Jesus our Lord , I’m facing death every day .
46015032	From a human point of view , what good does it do me if I fought wild animals in Ephesus ? If the dead aren’t raised , let’s eat and drink because tomorrow we’ll die .
46015033	Don’t be deceived , bad company corrupts good character .
46015034	Sober up by acting like you should and don’t sin . Some of you are ignorant about God — I say this because you should be ashamed of yourselves !
46015035	But someone will say , " How are the dead raised ? What kind of body will they have when they come back ? "
46015036	Look , fool ! When you put a seed into the ground , it doesn’t come back to life unless it dies .
46015037	What you put in the ground doesn’t have the shape that it will have , but it’s a bare grain of wheat or some other seed .
46015038	God gives it the sort of shape that he chooses , and he gives each of the seeds its own shape .
46015039	All flesh isn’t alike . Humans have one kind of flesh , animals have another kind of flesh , birds have another kind of flesh , and fish have another kind .
46015040	There are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies . The heavenly bodies have one kind of glory , and the earthly bodies have another kind of glory .
46015041	The sun has one kind of glory , the moon has another kind of glory , and the stars have another kind of glory ( but one star is different from another star in its glory ) .
46015042	It’s the same with the resurrection of the dead : a rotting body is put into the ground , but what is raised won’t ever decay .
46015043	It’s degraded when it’s put into the ground , but it’s raised in glory . It’s weak when it’s put into the ground , but it’s raised in power .
46015044	It’s a physical body when it’s put into the ground , but it’s raised as a spiritual body . If there’s a physical body , there’s also a spiritual body .
46015045	So it is also written , The first human , Adam , became a living person , and the last Adam became a spirit that gives life .
46015046	But the physical body comes first , not the spiritual one — the spiritual body comes afterward .
46015047	The first human was from the earth made from dust ; the second human is from heaven .
46015048	The nature of the person made of dust is shared by people who are made of dust , and the nature of the heavenly person is shared by heavenly people .
46015049	We will look like the heavenly person in the same way as we have looked like the person made from dust .
46015050	This is what I’m saying , brothers and sisters : Flesh and blood can’t inherit the kingdom of heaven . Something that rots can’t inherit something that doesn’t decay .
46015051	Listen , I’m telling you a secret : All of us won’t die , but we will all be changed —
46015052	in an instant , in the blink of an eye , at the final trumpet . The trumpet will blast , and the dead will be raised with bodies that won’t decay , and we will be changed .
46015053	It’s necessary for this rotting body to be clothed with what can’t decay , and for the body that is dying to be clothed in what can’t die .
46015054	And when the rotting body has been clothed in what can’t decay , and the dying body has been clothed in what can’t die , then this statement in scripture will happen : Death has been swallowed up by a victory . (
46015056	Death’s sting is sin , and the power of sin is the Law . )
46015057	Thanks be to God , who gives us this victory through our Lord Jesus Christ !
46015058	As a result of all this , my loved brothers and sisters , you must stand firm , unshakable , excelling in the work of the Lord as always , because you know that your labor isn’t going to be for nothing in the Lord .
46016001	Concerning the collection of money for God’s people : You should do what I have directed the churches in Galatia to do .
46016002	On the first day of the week , each of you should set aside whatever you can afford from what you earn so that the collection won’t be delayed until I come .
46016003	Then when I get there , I’ll send whomever you approve to Jerusalem with letters of recommendation to bring your gift .
46016004	If it seems right for me to go too , they’ll travel with me .
46016005	I’ll come to you after I go through Macedonia , and because I’m going through Macedonia ,
46016006	I may stay with you or even spend the winter there in Corinth so that you can send me on my way to wherever I’m off to next .
46016007	I don’t want to make a quick visit to you , since I hope to spend some time with you if the Lord lets it happen .
46016008	I’ll stay here in Ephesus until the Festival of Pentecost .
46016009	In spite of the fact that there are many opponents , a big and productive opportunity has opened up for my mission here .
46016010	If Timothy comes to you , be sure that he has no reason to be afraid while he’s with you , because he does the work of the Lord just like I do .
46016011	So don’t let anyone disrespect him , but send him on in peace so he can join me . I’m waiting for him along with the brothers and sisters .
46016012	Concerning Apollos our brother : I strongly encouraged him to visit you with the brothers and sisters , but he didn’t want to go now . He’ll come when he has an opportunity .
46016013	Stay awake , stand firm in your faith , be brave , be strong .
46016014	Everything should be done in love .
46016015	Brothers and sisters , I encourage you to do something else . You know that the people in Stephanas’ household were the first crop of the harvest to come from the mission to Achaia . They have dedicated themselves to the service of God’s people .
46016016	So accept the authority of people like them and of anyone who cooperates and works hard .
46016017	I’m so happy that Stephanas , Fortunatus , and Achaicus have arrived ; they’ve made up for my missing you .
46016018	Indeed they’ve provided my spirit and yours with a much-needed rest . Therefore , give them proper recognition .
46016019	The churches in the province of Asia greet you . Aquila and Prisca greet you warmly in the Lord , together with the church that meets in their house .
46016020	All the brothers and sisters greet you . You in turn should greet each other with a holy kiss .
46016021	Here is my greeting in my own handwriting — Paul .
46016022	A curse on anyone who doesn’t love the Lord . Come , Lord !
46016023	The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you .
46016024	My love is with all of you in Christ Jesus .
47001001	From Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus by God’s will , and Timothy our brother . To God’s church that is in Corinth , along with all of God’s people throughout Achaia .
47001002	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and from our Lord Jesus Christ .
47001003	May the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ be blessed ! He is the compassionate Father and God of all comfort .
47001004	He’s the one who comforts us in all our trouble so that we can comfort other people who are in every kind of trouble . We offer the same comfort that we ourselves received from God .
47001005	That is because we receive so much comfort through Christ in the same way that we share so many of Christ’s sufferings .
47001006	So if we have trouble , it is to bring you comfort and salvation . If we are comforted , it is to bring you comfort from the experience of endurance while you go through the same sufferings that we also suffer .
47001007	Our hope for you is certain , because we know that as you are partners in suffering , so also you are partners in comfort .
47001008	Brothers and sisters , we don’t want you to be unaware of the troubles that we went through in Asia . We were weighed down with a load of suffering that was so far beyond our strength that we were afraid we might not survive .
47001009	It certainly seemed to us as if we had gotten the death penalty . This was so that we would have confidence in God , who raises the dead , instead of ourselves .
47001010	God rescued us from a terrible death , and he will rescue us . We have set our hope on him that he will rescue us again ,
47001011	since you are helping with your prayer for us . Then many people can thank God on our behalf for the gift that was given to us through the prayers of many people .
47001012	We have conducted ourselves with godly sincerity and pure motives in the world , and especially toward you . This is why we are confident , and our conscience confirms this . We didn’t act with human wisdom but we relied on the grace of God .
47001013	We don’t write anything to you except what you can read and also understand . I hope that you will understand totally
47001014	since you have already understood us partly . Understand that in the day of our Lord Jesus , we will make you proud as you will also make us proud .
47001015	Because I was sure of this , I wanted to visit you first so that you could have a second opportunity to see me .
47001016	I wanted to visit you on my way to Macedonia , and then come to you again on my way back from Macedonia , at which point I was hoping you would help me on my way to Judea .
47001017	So I wasn’t unreliable when I planned to do this , was I ? Or do I make decisions with a substandard human process so that I say " Yes , yes " and " No , no " at the same time ?
47001018	But as God is faithful , our message to you isn’t both yes and no .
47001019	God’s Son , Jesus Christ , is the one who was preached among you by us — through me , Silvanus , and Timothy — he wasn’t yes and no . In him it is always yes .
47001020	All of God’s promises have their yes in him . That is why we say Amen through him to the glory of God .
47001021	God is the one who establishes us with you in Christ and who anointed us .
47001022	God also sealed us and gave the Spirit as a down payment in our hearts .
47001023	I call on God as my witness — I didn’t come again to Corinth because I wanted to spare you .
47001024	It isn’t that we are trying to control your faith , but we are working with you for your happiness , because you stand firm in your faith .
47002001	So I decided that , for my own sake , I wouldn’t visit you again while I was upset .
47002002	If I make you sad , who will be there to make me glad when you are sad because of me ?
47002003	That’s why I wrote this very thing to you , so that when I came I wouldn’t be made sad by the ones who ought to make me happy . I have confidence in you , that my happiness means your happiness .
47002004	I wrote to you in tears , with a very troubled and anxious heart . I didn’t write to make you sad but so you would know the overwhelming love that I have for you .
47002005	But if someone has made anyone sad , that person hasn’t hurt me but all of you to some degree ( not to exaggerate ) .
47002006	The punishment handed out by the majority is enough for this person .
47002007	This is why you should try your best to forgive and to comfort this person now instead , so that this person isn’t overwhelmed by too much sorrow .
47002008	So I encourage you to show your love for this person .
47002009	This is another reason why I wrote you . I wanted to test you and see if you are obedient in everything .
47002010	If you forgive anyone for anything , I do too . And whatever I’ve forgiven ( if I’ve forgiven anything ) , I did it for you in the presence of Christ .
47002011	This is so that we won’t be taken advantage of by Satan , because we are well aware of his schemes .
47002012	When I came to Troas to preach Christ’s gospel , the Lord gave me an opportunity to preach .
47002013	But I was worried because I couldn’t find my brother Titus there . So I said good-bye to them and went on to Macedonia .
47002014	But thank God , who is always leading us around through Christ as if we were in a parade . He releases the fragrance of the knowledge of him everywhere through us .
47002015	We smell like the aroma of Christ’s offering to God , both to those who are being saved and to those who are on the road to destruction .
47002016	We smell like a contagious dead person to those who are dying , but we smell like the fountain of life to those who are being saved . Who is qualified for this kind of ministry ?
47002017	We aren’t like so many people who hustle the word of God to make a profit . We are speaking through Christ in the presence of God , as those who are sincere and as those who are sent from God .
47003001	Are we starting to commend ourselves again ? We don’t need letters of introduction to you or from you like other people , do we ?
47003002	You are our letter , written on our hearts , known and read by everyone .
47003003	You show that you are Christ’s letter , delivered by us . You weren’t written with ink but with the Spirit of the living God . You weren’t written on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts .
47003004	This is the confidence that we have through Christ in the presence of God .
47003005	It isn’t that we ourselves are qualified to claim that anything came from us . No , our qualification is from God .
47003006	He has qualified us as ministers of a new covenant , not based on what is written but on the Spirit , because what is written kills , but the Spirit gives life .
47003007	The ministry that brought death was carved in letters on stone tablets . It came with such glory that the Israelites couldn’t look for long at Moses’ face because his face was shining with glory , even though it was a fading glory .
47003008	Won’t the ministry of the Spirit be much more glorious ?
47003009	If the ministry that brought condemnation has glory , how much more glorious is the ministry that brings righteousness ?
47003010	In fact , what was glorious isn’t glorious now , because of the glory that is brighter .
47003011	If the glory that fades away was glorious , how much more glorious is the one that lasts !
47003012	So , since we have such a hope , we act with great confidence .
47003013	We aren’t like Moses , who used to put a veil over his face so that the Israelites couldn’t watch the end of what was fading away .
47003014	But their minds were closed . Right up to the present day the same veil remains when the old covenant is read . The veil is not removed because it is taken away by Christ .
47003015	Even today , whenever Moses is read , a veil lies over their hearts .
47003016	But whenever someone turns back to the Lord , the veil is removed .
47003017	The Lord is the Spirit , and where the Lord’s Spirit is , there is freedom .
47003018	All of us are looking with unveiled faces at the glory of the Lord as if we were looking in a mirror . We are being transformed into that same image from one degree of glory to the next degree of glory . This comes from the Lord , who is the Spirit .
47004001	This is why we don’t get discouraged , given that we received this ministry in the same way that we received God’s mercy .
47004002	Instead , we reject secrecy and shameful actions . We don’t use deception , and we don’t tamper with God’s word . Instead , we commend ourselves to everyone’s conscience in the sight of God by the public announcement of the truth .
47004003	And even if our gospel is veiled , it is veiled to those who are on the road to destruction .
47004004	The god of this age has blinded the minds of those who don’t have faith so they couldn’t see the light of the gospel that reveals Christ’s glory . Christ is the image of God .
47004005	We don’t preach about ourselves . Instead , we preach about Jesus Christ as Lord , and we describe ourselves as your slaves for Jesus’ sake .
47004006	God said that light should shine out of the darkness . He is the same one who shone in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of God’s glory in the face of Jesus Christ .
47004007	But we have this treasure in clay pots so that the awesome power belongs to God and doesn’t come from us .
47004008	We are experiencing all kinds of trouble , but we aren’t crushed . We are confused , but we aren’t depressed .
47004009	We are harassed , but we aren’t abandoned . We are knocked down , but we aren’t knocked out .
47004010	We always carry Jesus’ death around in our bodies so that Jesus’ life can also be seen in our bodies .
47004011	We who are alive are always being handed over to death for Jesus’ sake so that Jesus’ life can also be seen in our bodies that are dying .
47004012	So death is at work in us , but life is at work in you .
47004013	We have the same faithful spirit as what is written in scripture : I had faith , and so I spoke . We also have faith , and so we also speak .
47004014	We do this because we know that the one who raised the Lord Jesus will also raise us with Jesus , and he will bring us into his presence along with you .
47004015	All these things are for your benefit . As grace increases to benefit more and more people , it will cause gratitude to increase , which results in God’s glory .
47004016	So we aren’t depressed . But even if our bodies are breaking down on the outside , the person that we are on the inside is being renewed every day .
47004017	Our temporary minor problems are producing an eternal stockpile of glory for us that is beyond all comparison .
47004018	We don’t focus on the things that can be seen but on the things that can’t be seen . The things that can be seen don’t last , but the things that can’t be seen are eternal .
47005001	We know that if the tent that we live in on earth is torn down , we have a building from God . It’s a house that isn’t handmade , which is eternal and located in heaven .
47005002	We groan while we live in this residence . We really want to dress ourselves with our building from heaven —
47005003	since we assume that when we take off this tent , we won’t find out that we are naked .
47005004	Yes , while we are in this tent we groan , because we are weighed down . We want to be dressed not undressed , so that what is dying can be swallowed up by life .
47005005	Now the one who prepared us for this very thing is God , and God gave us the Spirit as a down payment for our home .
47005006	So we are always confident , because we know that while we are living in the body , we are away from our home with the Lord .
47005007	We live by faith and not by sight .
47005008	We are confident , and we would prefer to leave the body and to be at home with the Lord .
47005009	So our goal is to be acceptable to him , whether we are at home or away from home .
47005010	We all must appear before Christ in court so that each person can be paid back for the things that were done while in the body , whether they were good or bad .
47005011	So we try to persuade people , since we know what it means to fear the Lord . We are well known by God , and I hope that in your heart we are well known by you as well .
47005012	We aren’t trying to commend ourselves to you again . Instead , we are giving you an opportunity to be proud of us so that you could answer those who take pride in superficial appearance , and not in what is in the heart .
47005013	If we are crazy , it’s for God’s sake . If we are rational , it’s for your sake .
47005014	The love of Christ controls us , because we have concluded this : one died for the sake of all ; therefore , all died .
47005015	He died for the sake of all so that those who are alive should live not for themselves but for the one who died for them and was raised .
47005016	So then , from this point on we won’t recognize people by human standards . Even though we used to know Christ by human standards , that isn’t how we know him now .
47005017	So then , if anyone is in Christ , that person is part of the new creation . The old things have gone away , and look , new things have arrived !
47005018	All of these new things are from God , who reconciled us to himself through Christ and who gave us the ministry of reconciliation .
47005019	In other words , God was reconciling the world to himself through Christ , by not counting people’s sins against them . He has trusted us with this message of reconciliation .
47005020	So we are ambassadors who represent Christ . God is negotiating with you through us . We beg you as Christ’s representatives , " Be reconciled to God ! "
47005021	God caused the one who didn’t know sin to be sin for our sake so that through him we could become the righteousness of God .
47006001	Since we work together with him , we are also begging you not to receive the grace of God in vain .
47006002	He says , I listened to you at the right time , and I helped you on the day of salvation . Look , now is the right time ! Look , now is the day of salvation !
47006003	We don’t give anyone any reason to be offended about anything so that our ministry won’t be criticized .
47006004	Instead , we commend ourselves as ministers of God in every way . We did this with our great endurance through problems , disasters , and stressful situations .
47006005	We went through beatings , imprisonments , and riots . We experienced hard work , sleepless nights , and hunger .
47006006	We displayed purity , knowledge , patience , and generosity . We served with the Holy Spirit , genuine love ,
47006007	telling the truth , and God’s power . We carried the weapons of righteousness in our right hand and our left hand .
47006008	We were treated with honor and dishonor and with verbal abuse and good evaluation . We were seen as both fake and real ,
47006009	as unknown and well known , as dying — and look , we are alive ! We were seen as punished but not killed ,
47006010	as going through pain but always happy , as poor but making many rich , and as having nothing but owning everything .
47006011	Corinthians , we have spoken openly to you , and our hearts are wide open .
47006012	There are no limits to the affection that we feel for you . You are the ones who placed boundaries on your affection for us .
47006013	But as a fair trade — I’m talking to you like you are children — open your hearts wide too .
47006014	Don’t be tied up as equal partners with people who don’t believe . What does righteousness share with that which is outside the Law ? What relationship does light have with darkness ?
47006015	What harmony does Christ have with Satan ? What does a believer have in common with someone who doesn’t believe ?
47006016	What agreement can there be between God’s temple and idols ? Because we are the temple of the living God . Just as God said , I live with them , and I will move among them . I will be their God , and they will be my people .
47006017	Therefore , come out from among them and be separated , says the Lord . Don’t touch what is unclean . Then I will welcome you .
47006018	I will be a father to you , and you will be my sons and daughters , says the Lord Almighty .
47007001	My dear friends , since we have these promises , let’s cleanse ourselves from anything that contaminates our body or spirit so that we make our holiness complete in the fear of God .
47007002	Make room in your hearts for us . We didn’t do anything wrong to anyone . We didn’t ruin anyone . We didn’t take advantage of anyone .
47007003	I’m not saying this to make you feel guilty . I’ve already said that you are in our hearts so that we die and live together with you .
47007004	I have every confidence in you . I’m terribly proud of you . I’m filled with encouragement . I’m overwhelmed with happiness while in the middle of our problems .
47007005	Even after we arrived in Macedonia , we couldn’t rest physically . We were surrounded by problems . There was external conflict , and there were internal fears .
47007006	However , God comforts people who are discouraged , and he comforted us by Titus’ arrival .
47007007	We weren’t comforted only by his arrival but also by the comfort he had received from you . He told us about your desire to see me , how you were sorry , and about your concern for me , so that I was even happier .
47007008	Even though my letter hurt you , I don’t regret it . Well — I did regret it just a bit because I see that that letter made you sad , though only for a short time .
47007009	Now I’m glad — not because you were sad but because you were made sad enough to change your hearts and lives . You felt godly sadness so that no one was harmed by us in any way .
47007010	Godly sadness produces a changed heart and life that leads to salvation and leaves no regrets , but sorrow under the influence of the world produces death .
47007011	Look at what this very experience of godly sadness has produced in you : such enthusiasm , what a desire to clear yourselves of blame , such indignation , what fear , what purpose , such concern , what justice ! In everything you have shown yourselves to be innocent in the matter .
47007012	So although I wrote to you , it wasn’t for the sake of the one who did wrong , or for the sake of the one who was wronged , but to show you your own enthusiasm for us in the sight of God .
47007013	Because of this we have been encouraged . And in addition to our own encouragement , we were even more pleased at how happy Titus was . His mind has been put at rest by all of you .
47007014	If I’ve bragged about you to him in any way , I haven’t been embarrassed . Instead , our bragging to Titus has also been proven to be true , just like everything we said to you was true .
47007015	His devotion to you is growing even more as he remembers how all of you were obedient when you welcomed him with fear and trembling .
47007016	I’m happy , because I can completely depend on you .
47008001	Brothers and sisters , we want to let you know about the grace of God that was given to the churches of Macedonia .
47008002	While they were being tested by many problems , their extra amount of happiness and their extreme poverty resulted in a surplus of rich generosity .
47008003	I assure you that they gave what they could afford and even more than they could afford , and they did it voluntarily .
47008004	They urgently begged us for the privilege of sharing in this service for the saints .
47008005	They even exceeded our expectations , because they gave themselves to the Lord first and to us , consistent with God’s will .
47008006	As a result , we challenged Titus to finish this work of grace with you the way he had started it .
47008007	Be the best in this work of grace in the same way that you are the best in everything , such as faith , speech , knowledge , total commitment , and the love we inspired in you .
47008008	I’m not giving an order , but by mentioning the commitment of others , I’m trying to prove the authenticity of your love also .
47008009	You know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ . Although he was rich , he became poor for our sakes , so that you could become rich through his poverty .
47008010	I’m giving you my opinion about this . It’s to your advantage to do this , since you not only started to do it last year but you wanted to do it too .
47008011	Now finish the job as well so that you finish it with as much enthusiasm as you started , given what you can afford .
47008012	A gift is appreciated because of what a person can afford , not because of what that person can’t afford , if it’s apparent that it’s done willingly .
47008013	It isn’t that we want others to have financial ease and you financial difficulties , but it’s a matter of equality .
47008014	At the present moment , your surplus can fill their deficit so that in the future their surplus can fill your deficit . In this way there is equality .
47008015	As it is written , The one who gathered more didn’t have too much , and the one who gathered less didn’t have too little .
47008016	But thank God , who put the same commitment that I have for you in Titus’ heart .
47008017	Not only has he accepted our challenge but he’s on his way to see you voluntarily , and he’s excited .
47008018	We are sending the brother who is famous in all the churches because of his work for the gospel along with him .
47008019	In addition to this , he is chosen by the churches to be our traveling companion in this work of grace , which we are taking care of for the sake of the glory of the Lord himself , and to show our desire to help .
47008020	We are trying to avoid being blamed by anyone for the way we take care of this large amount of money .
47008021	We care about doing the right thing , not only in the Lord’s eyes but also in the eyes of other people .
47008022	We are sending our brother with them . We have tested his commitment in many ways and many times . Now he’s even more committed , because he has so much confidence in you .
47008023	If there is any question about Titus , he is my partner and coworker among you . If there is any question about our brothers , they are the churches’ apostles and an honor to Christ .
47008024	So show them the proof of your love and the reason we are so proud of you , in such a way that the churches can see it .
47009001	It’s unnecessary for me to write to you about this service for God’s people .
47009002	I know about your willingness to help . I brag about you to the Macedonians , saying , " Greece has been ready since last year , " and your enthusiasm has motivated most of them .
47009003	But I’m sending the brothers so that our bragging about you in this case won’t be empty words , and so that you can be prepared , just as I keep telling them you will be .
47009004	If some Macedonians should come with me and find out that you aren’t ready , we ( not to mention you ) would be embarrassed as far as this project goes .
47009005	This is why I thought it was necessary to encourage the brothers to go to you ahead of time and arrange in advance the generous gift you have already promised . I want it to be a real gift from you . I don’t want you to feel like you are being forced to give anything .
47009006	What I mean is this : the one who sows a small number of seeds will also reap a small crop , and the one who sows a generous amount of seeds will also reap a generous crop .
47009007	Everyone should give whatever they have decided in their heart . They shouldn’t give with hesitation or because of pressure . God loves a cheerful giver .
47009008	God has the power to provide you with more than enough of every kind of grace . That way , you will have everything you need always and in everything to provide more than enough for every kind of good work .
47009009	As it is written , He scattered everywhere ; he gave to the needy ; his righteousness remains forever .
47009010	The one who supplies seed for planting and bread for eating will supply and multiply your seed and will increase your crop , which is righteousness .
47009011	You will be made rich in every way so that you can be generous in every way . Such generosity produces thanksgiving to God through us .
47009012	Your ministry of this service to God’s people isn’t only fully meeting their needs but it is also multiplying in many expressions of thanksgiving to God .
47009013	They will give honor to God for your obedience to your confession of Christ’s gospel . They will do this because this service provides evidence of your obedience , and because of your generosity in sharing with them and with everyone .
47009014	They will also pray for you , and they will care deeply for you because of the outstanding grace that God has given to you .
47009015	Thank God for his gift that words can’t describe !
47010001	I , Paul , make a personal request to you with the gentleness and kindness of Christ . I’m shy when I’m with you , but I’m bossy when I’m away from you !
47010002	I beg you that when I’m with you in person , I won’t have to boss you around . I’m afraid that I may have to use that kind of behavior with those people who think we live by human standards .
47010003	Although we live in the world , we don’t fight our battles with human methods .
47010004	Our weapons that we fight with aren’t human , but instead they are powered by God for the destruction of fortresses . They destroy arguments ,
47010005	and every defense that is raised up to oppose the knowledge of God . They capture every thought to make it obedient to Christ .
47010006	Once your obedience is complete , we are ready to punish any disobedience .
47010007	Look at what is right in front of you ! If anyone is sure about belonging to Christ , that person should think again . We belong to Christ just like that person .
47010008	Even if I went on to brag about our authority , I wouldn’t be ashamed of it . The Lord gave us that authority to build you up and not to destroy you .
47010009	I don’t want it to seem like I’m trying to intimidate you with my letters .
47010010	I know what some people are saying : " His letters are severe and powerful , but in person he is weak and his speech is worth nothing . "
47010011	These people need to think about this — that when we are with you , our actions will show that we are the same as the words we wrote when we were away from you .
47010012	We won’t dare to place ourselves in the same league or to compare ourselves with some of those who are promoting themselves . When they measure themselves by themselves , and compare themselves with themselves , they have no understanding .
47010013	We won’t take pride in anything more than what is appropriate . Let’s look at the boundaries of our work area that God has assigned to us . It’s an area that includes you .
47010014	We aren’t going out of bounds , as if our work area doesn’t extend as far as you . We were the first ones to travel as far as Corinth with the gospel of Christ .
47010015	We don’t take pride in what other people do outside of our boundaries . We hope that our work will be extended even more by you as your faith grows , until it expands fully ( within the boundaries , of course ) .
47010016	We hope that our work grows even to the point of the gospel being preached in places beyond Corinth , without bragging about what has already been done in another person’s work area .
47010017	But , the one who brags should brag in the Lord .
47010018	It isn’t the person who promotes himself or herself who is approved but the person whom the Lord commends .
47011001	I hope that you will put up with me while I act like a fool . Well , in fact , you are putting up with me !
47011002	I’m deeply concerned about you with the same concern that God has . As your father , I promised you in marriage to one husband . I promised to present you as an innocent virgin to Christ himself .
47011003	But I’m afraid that your minds might be seduced in the same way as the snake deceived Eve with his devious tricks . You might be unable to focus completely on a genuine and innocent commitment to Christ .
47011004	If a person comes and preaches some other Jesus than the one we preached , or if you receive a different Spirit than the one you had received , or a different gospel than the one you embraced , you put up with it so easily !
47011005	I don’t consider myself as second-rate in any way compared to the " super-apostles . "
47011006	But even if I’m uneducated in public speaking , I’m not uneducated in knowledge . We have shown this to you in every way and in everything we have done .
47011007	Did I commit a sin by humbling myself to give you an advantage because I preached the gospel of God to you free of charge ?
47011008	I robbed other churches by taking a salary from them in order to serve you !
47011009	While I was with you , I didn’t burden any of you even though I needed things . The believers who came from Macedonia gave me everything I needed . I kept myself from being a financial drain on you in any way , and I will continue to keep myself from being a burden .
47011010	Since Christ’s truth is in me , I won’t stop telling the entire area of Greece that I’m proud of what I did .
47011011	Why ? Is it because I don’t love you ? God knows that I do !
47011012	But I’m going to continue to do what I’m doing . I want to contradict the claims of the people who want to be treated like they are the same as us because of what they brag about .
47011013	Such people are false apostles and dishonest workers who disguise themselves as apostles of Christ .
47011014	And no wonder ! Even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light .
47011015	It is no great surprise then that his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness . Their end will be what their actions deserve .
47011016	I repeat , no one should take me for a fool . But if you do , then allow me to be a fool so that I can brag like a fool for a bit .
47011017	I’m not saying what I’m saying because the Lord tells me to . I’m saying it like I’m a fool . I’m putting my confidence in this business of bragging .
47011018	Since so many people are bragging based on human standards , that is how I’m going to brag too .
47011019	Because you , who are so wise , are happy to put up with fools .
47011020	You put up with it if someone enslaves you , if someone exploits you , if someone takes advantage of you , if someone places themselves over you , or if someone hits you in the face .
47011021	I’m ashamed to say that we have been weak in comparison ! But in whatever they challenge me , I challenge them ( I’m speaking foolishly ) .
47011022	Are they Hebrews ? So am I . Are they Israelites ? So am I . Are they descendants of Abraham ? So am I .
47011023	Are they ministers of Christ ? I’m speaking like a crazy person . What I’ve done goes well beyond what they’ve done . I’ve worked much harder . I’ve been imprisoned much more often . I’ve been beaten more times than I can count . I’ve faced death many times .
47011024	I received the " forty lashes minus one " from the Jews five times .
47011025	I was beaten with rods three times . I was stoned once . I was shipwrecked three times . I spent a day and a night on the open sea .
47011026	I’ve been on many journeys . I faced dangers from rivers , robbers , my people , and Gentiles . I faced dangers in the city , in the desert , on the sea , and from false brothers and sisters .
47011027	I faced these dangers with hard work and heavy labor , many sleepless nights , hunger and thirst , often without food , and in the cold without enough clothes .
47011028	Besides all the other things I could mention , there’s my daily stress because I’m concerned about all the churches .
47011029	Who is weak without me being weak ? Who is led astray without me being furious about it ?
47011030	If it’s necessary to brag , I’ll brag about my weaknesses .
47011031	The God and Father of the Lord Jesus , the one who is blessed forever , knows that I’m not lying .
47011032	At Damascus the governor under King Aretas was guarding the city of Damascus in order to capture me ,
47011033	but I got away from him by being lowered in a basket through a window in the city wall .
47012001	It is necessary to brag , not that it does any good . I’ll move on to visions and revelations from the Lord .
47012002	I know a man in Christ who was caught up into the third heaven fourteen years ago . I don’t know whether it was in the body or out of the body . God knows .
47012003	
47012004	I know that this man was caught up into paradise and that he heard unspeakable words that were things no one is allowed to repeat . I don’t know whether it was in the body or apart from the body . God knows .
47012005	I’ll brag about this man , but I won’t brag about myself , except to brag about my weaknesses .
47012006	If I did want to brag , I wouldn’t make a fool of myself because I’d tell the truth . I’m holding back from bragging so that no one will give me any more credit than what anyone sees or hears about me .
47012007	I was given a thorn in my body because of the outstanding revelations I’ve received so that I wouldn’t be conceited . It’s a messenger from Satan sent to torment me so that I wouldn’t be conceited .
47012008	I pleaded with the Lord three times for it to leave me alone .
47012009	He said to me , " My grace is enough for you , because power is made perfect in weakness . " So I’ll gladly spend my time bragging about my weaknesses so that Christ’s power can rest on me .
47012010	Therefore , I’m all right with weaknesses , insults , disasters , harassments , and stressful situations for the sake of Christ , because when I’m weak , then I’m strong .
47012011	I’ve become a fool ! You made me do it . Actually , I should have been commended by you . I’m not inferior to the super-apostles in any way , even though I’m a nonentity .
47012012	The signs of an apostle were performed among you with continuous endurance through signs , wonders , and miracles .
47012013	How were you treated worse than the other churches , except that I myself wasn’t a financial burden on you ? Forgive me for this wrong !
47012014	Look , I’m ready to visit you a third time , and I won’t be a burden on you . I don’t want your things ; I want you . It isn’t the children’s responsibility to save up for their parents but parents for children .
47012015	I will very gladly spend and be spent for your sake . If I love you more , will you love me less ?
47012016	We all know that I didn’t place a burden on you , but in spite of that you think I’m a con artist who fooled you with a trick .
47012017	I haven’t taken advantage of you through any of the people I sent to you , have I ?
47012018	I strongly encouraged Titus to go to you and sent the brother with him . Titus didn’t take advantage of you , did he ? Didn’t we live by the same Spirit ? Didn’t we walk in the same footsteps ?
47012019	Have you been thinking up to now that we are defending ourselves to you ? Actually , we are speaking in the sight of God and in Christ . Dear friends , everything is meant to build you up .
47012020	I’m afraid that maybe when I come you will be different from the way I want you to be , and that I’ll be different from the way you want me to be . I’m afraid that there might be fighting , obsession , losing your temper , competitive opposition , backstabbing , gossip , conceit , and disorderly conduct .
47012021	I’m afraid that when I come again , my God may embarrass me in front of you . I might have to go into mourning over all the people who have sinned before and haven’t changed their hearts and lives from what they used to practice : moral corruption , sexual immorality , and doing whatever feels good .
47013001	This is the third time that I’m coming to visit you . Every matter is settled on the evidence of two or three witnesses .
47013002	When I was with you on my second visit , I already warned those who continued to sin . Now I’m repeating that warning to all the rest of you while I’m at a safe distance : if I come again , I won’t spare anyone .
47013003	Since you are demanding proof that Christ speaks through me , Christ isn’t weak in dealing with you but shows his power among you .
47013004	Certainly he was crucified because of weakness , but he lives by the power of God . Certainly we also are weak in him , but we will live together with him , because of God’s power that is directed toward you .
47013005	Examine yourselves to see if you are in the faith . Test yourselves . Don’t you understand that Jesus Christ is in you ? Unless , of course , you fail the test .
47013006	But I hope that you will realize that we don’t fail the test .
47013007	We pray to God that you don’t do anything wrong , not because we want to appear to pass the test but so that you might do the right thing , even if we appear to fail .
47013008	We can’t do anything against the truth but only to help the truth .
47013009	We are happy when we are weak but you are strong . We pray for this : that you will be made complete .
47013010	This is why I’m writing these things while I’m away . I’m writing so that I won’t need to act harshly when I’m with you by using the authority that the Lord gave me . He gave it to me so that I could build you up , not tear you down .
47013011	Finally , brothers and sisters , good-bye . Put things in order , respond to my encouragement , be in harmony with each other , and live in peace — and the God of love and peace will be with you .
47013012	Say hello to each other with a holy kiss . All of God’s people say hello to you .
47013013	
47013014	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ , the love of God , and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all .
48001001	From Paul , an apostle who is not sent from human authority or commissioned through human agency , but sent through Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead ;
48001002	and from all the brothers and sisters with me . To the churches in Galatia .
48001003	Grace and peace to you from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
48001004	He gave himself for our sins , so he could deliver us from this present evil age , according to the will of our God and Father .
48001005	To God be the glory forever and always ! Amen .
48001006	I’m amazed that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ to follow another gospel .
48001007	It’s not really another gospel , but certain people are confusing you and they want to change the gospel of Christ .
48001008	However , even if we ourselves or a heavenly angel should ever preach anything different from what we preached to you , they should be under a curse .
48001009	I’m repeating what we’ve said before : if anyone preaches something different from what you received , they should be under a curse !
48001010	Am I trying to win over human beings or God ? Or am I trying to please people ? If I were still trying to please people , I wouldn’t be Christ’s slave .
48001011	Brothers and sisters , I want you to know that the gospel I preached isn’t human in origin .
48001012	I didn’t receive it or learn it from a human . It came through a revelation from Jesus Christ .
48001013	You heard about my previous life in Judaism , how severely I harassed God’s church and tried to destroy it .
48001014	I advanced in Judaism beyond many of my peers , because I was much more militant about the traditions of my ancestors .
48001015	But God had set me apart from birth and called me through his grace . He was pleased
48001016	to reveal his Son to me , so that I might preach about him to the Gentiles . I didn’t immediately consult with any human being .
48001017	I didn’t go up to Jerusalem to see the men who were apostles before me either , but I went away into Arabia and I returned again to Damascus .
48001018	Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and stayed with him fifteen days .
48001019	But I didn’t see any other of the apostles except James the brother of the Lord .
48001020	Before God , I’m not lying about the things that I’m writing to you !
48001021	Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia ,
48001022	but I wasn’t known personally by the Christian churches in Judea .
48001023	They only heard a report about me : " The man who used to harass us now preaches the faith that he once tried to destroy . "
48001024	So they were glorifying God because of me .
48002001	Then after fourteen years I went up to Jerusalem again with Barnabas , and I took Titus along also .
48002002	I went there because of a revelation , and I laid out the gospel that I preach to the Gentiles for them . But I did it privately with the influential leaders to make sure that I wouldn’t be working or that I hadn’t worked for nothing .
48002003	However , not even Titus , who was with me and who was a Greek , was required to be circumcised .
48002004	But false brothers and sisters , who were brought in secretly , slipped in to spy on our freedom , which we have in Christ Jesus , and to make us slaves .
48002005	We didn’t give in and submit to them for a single moment , so that the truth of the gospel would continue to be with you .
48002006	The influential leaders didn’t add anything to what I was preaching — and whatever they were makes no difference to me , because God doesn’t show favoritism .
48002007	But on the contrary , they saw that I had been given the responsibility to preach the gospel to the people who aren’t circumcised , just as Peter had been to the circumcised .
48002008	The one who empowered Peter to become an apostle to the circumcised empowered me also to be one to the Gentiles .
48002009	James , Cephas , and John , who are considered to be key leaders , shook hands with me and Barnabas as equals when they recognized the grace that was given to me . So it was agreed that we would go to the Gentiles , while they continue to go to the people who were circumcised .
48002010	They asked only that we would remember the poor , which was certainly something I was willing to do .
48002011	But when Cephas came to Antioch , I opposed him to his face , because he was wrong .
48002012	He had been eating with the Gentiles before certain people came from James . But when they came , he began to back out and separate himself , because he was afraid of the people who promoted circumcision .
48002013	And the rest of the Jews also joined him in this hypocrisy so that even Barnabas got carried away with them in their hypocrisy .
48002014	But when I saw that they weren’t acting consistently with the truth of the gospel , I said to Cephas in front of everyone , " If you , though you’re a Jew , live like a Gentile and not like a Jew , how can you require the Gentiles to live like Jews ? "
48002015	We are born Jews — we’re not Gentile sinners .
48002016	However , we know that a person isn’t made righteous by the works of the Law but rather through the faithfulness of Jesus Christ . We ourselves believed in Christ Jesus so that we could be made righteous by the faithfulness of Christ and not by the works of the Law — because no one will be made righteous by the works of the Law .
48002017	But if it is discovered that we ourselves are sinners while we are trying to be made righteous in Christ , then is Christ a servant of sin ? Absolutely not !
48002018	If I rebuild the very things that I tore down , I show that I myself am breaking the Law .
48002019	I died to the Law through the Law , so that I could live for God .
48002020	I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live , but Christ lives in me . And the life that I now live in my body , I live by faith , indeed , by the faithfulness of God’s Son , who loved me and gave himself for me .
48002021	I don’t ignore the grace of God , because if we become righteous through the Law , then Christ died for no purpose .
48003001	You irrational Galatians ! Who put a spell on you ? Jesus Christ was put on display as crucified before your eyes !
48003002	I just want to know this from you : Did you receive the Spirit by doing the works of the Law or by believing what you heard ?
48003003	Are you so irrational ? After you started with the Spirit , are you now finishing up with your own human effort ?
48003004	Did you experience so much for nothing ? I wonder if it really was for nothing .
48003005	So does the one providing you with the Spirit and working miracles among you do this by you doing the works of the Law or by you believing what you heard ?
48003006	Understand that in the same way that Abraham believed God and it was credited to him as righteousness ,
48003007	those who believe are the children of Abraham .
48003008	But when it saw ahead of time that God would make the Gentiles righteous on the basis of faith , scripture preached the gospel in advance to Abraham : All the Gentiles will be blessed in you .
48003009	Therefore , those who believe are blessed together with Abraham who believed .
48003010	All those who rely on the works of the Law are under a curse , because it is written , Everyone is cursed who does not keep on doing all the things that have been written in the Law scroll .
48003011	But since no one is made righteous by the Law as far as God is concerned , it is clear that the righteous one will live on the basis of faith .
48003012	The Law isn’t based on faith ; rather , the one doing these things will live by them .
48003013	Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law by becoming a curse for us — because it is written , Everyone who is hung on a tree is cursed .
48003014	He redeemed us so that the blessing of Abraham would come to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus , and that we would receive the promise of the Spirit through faith .
48003015	Brothers and sisters , I’ll use an example from human experience . No one ignores or makes additions to a validated will .
48003016	The promises were made to Abraham and to his descendant . It doesn’t say , " and to the descendants , " as if referring to many rather than just one . It says , " and to your descendant , " who is Christ .
48003017	I’m saying this : the Law , which came four hundred thirty years later , doesn’t invalidate the agreement that was previously validated by God so that it cancels the promise .
48003018	If the inheritance were based upon the Law , it would no longer be from the promise . But God has given it graciously to Abraham through a promise .
48003019	So why was the Law given ? It was added because of offenses , until the descendant would come to whom the promise had been made . It was put in place through angels by the hand of a mediator .
48003020	Now the mediator does not take one side ; but God is one .
48003021	So , is the Law against the promises of God ? Absolutely not ! If a Law had been given that was able to give life , then righteousness would in fact have come from the Law .
48003022	But scripture locked up all things under sin , so that the promise based on the faithfulness of Jesus Christ might be given to those who have faith .
48003023	Before faith came , we were guarded under the Law , locked up until faith that was coming would be revealed ,
48003024	so that the Law became our custodian until Christ so that we might be made righteous by faith .
48003025	But now that faith has come , we are no longer under a custodian .
48003026	You are all God’s children through faith in Christ Jesus .
48003027	All of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ .
48003028	There is neither Jew nor Greek ; there is neither slave nor free ; nor is there male and female , for you are all one in Christ Jesus .
48003029	Now if you belong to Christ , then indeed you are Abraham’s descendants , heirs according to the promise .
48004001	I’m saying that as long as the heirs are minors , they are no different from slaves , though they really are the owners of everything .
48004002	However , they are placed under trustees and guardians until the date set by the parents .
48004003	In the same way , when we were minors , we were also enslaved by this world’s system .
48004004	But when the fulfillment of the time came , God sent his Son , born through a woman , and born under the Law .
48004005	This was so he could redeem those under the Law so that we could be adopted .
48004006	Because you are sons and daughters , God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts , crying , " Abba , Father ! "
48004007	Therefore , you are no longer a slave but a son or daughter , and if you are his child , then you are also an heir through God .
48004008	At the time , when you didn’t know God , you were enslaved by things that aren’t gods by nature .
48004009	But now , after knowing God ( or rather , being known by God ) , how can you turn back again to the weak and worthless world system ? Do you want to be slaves to it again ?
48004010	You observe religious days and months and seasons and years .
48004011	I’m afraid for you ! Perhaps my hard work for you has been for nothing .
48004012	I beg you to be like me , brothers and sisters , because I have become like you ! You haven’t wronged me .
48004013	You know that I first preached the gospel to you because of an illness .
48004014	Though my poor health burdened you , you didn’t look down on me or reject me , but you welcomed me as if I were an angel from God , or as if I were Christ Jesus !
48004015	Where then is the great attitude that you had ? I swear that , if possible , you would have dug out your eyes and given them to me .
48004016	So then , have I become your enemy by telling you the truth ?
48004017	They are so concerned about you , though not with good intentions . Rather , they want to shut you out so that you would run after them .
48004018	However , it’s always good to have people concerned about you with good intentions , and not just when I’m there with you .
48004019	My little children , I’m going through labor pains again until Christ is formed in you .
48004020	But I wish I could be with you now and change how I sound , because I’m at a loss about you .
48004021	Tell me — those of you who want to be under the Law — don’t you listen to the Law ?
48004022	It’s written that Abraham had two sons , one by the slave woman and one by the free woman .
48004023	The son by the slave woman was conceived the normal way , but the son by the free woman was conceived through a promise .
48004024	These things are an allegory : the women are two covenants . One is from Mount Sinai , which gives birth to slave children ; this is Hagar .
48004025	Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia , and she corresponds to the present-day Jerusalem , because the city is in slavery with her children .
48004026	But the Jerusalem that is above is free , and she is our mother .
48004027	It’s written : Rejoice , barren woman , you who have not given birth . because the woman who has been deserted will have many more children
48004028	Brothers and sisters , you are children of the promise like Isaac .
48004029	But just as it was then , so it is now also : the one who was conceived the normal way harassed the one who was conceived by the Spirit .
48004030	But what does the scripture say ? Throw out the slave woman and her son , because the slave woman’s son won’t share the inheritance with the free woman’s son .
48004031	Therefore , brothers and sisters , we aren’t the slave woman’s children , but we are the free woman’s children .
48005001	Christ has set us free for freedom . Therefore , stand firm and don’t submit to the bondage of slavery again .
48005002	Look , I , Paul , am telling you that if you have yourselves circumcised , having Christ won’t help you .
48005003	Again I swear to every man who has himself circumcised that he is required to do the whole Law .
48005004	You people who are trying to be made righteous by the Law have been estranged from Christ . You have fallen away from grace !
48005005	We eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness through the Spirit by faith .
48005006	Being circumcised or not being circumcised doesn’t matter in Christ Jesus , but faith working through love does matter .
48005007	You were running well — who stopped you from obeying the truth ?
48005008	This line of reasoning doesn’t come from the one who calls you .
48005009	A little yeast works through the whole lump of dough .
48005010	I’m convinced about you in the Lord that you won’t think any other way . But the one who is confusing you will pay the penalty , whoever that may be .
48005011	Brothers and sisters , if I’m still preaching circumcision , why am I still being harassed ? In that case , the offense of the cross would be canceled .
48005012	I wish that the ones who are upsetting you would castrate themselves !
48005013	You were called to freedom , brothers and sisters ; only don’t let this freedom be an opportunity to indulge your selfish impulses , but serve each other through love .
48005014	All the Law has been fulfilled in a single statement : Love your neighbor as yourself .
48005015	But if you bite and devour each other , be careful that you don’t get eaten up by each other !
48005016	I say be guided by the Spirit and you won’t carry out your selfish desires .
48005017	A person’s selfish desires are set against the Spirit , and the Spirit is set against one’s selfish desires . They are opposed to each other , so you shouldn’t do whatever you want to do .
48005018	But if you are being led by the Spirit , you aren’t under the Law .
48005019	The actions that are produced by selfish motives are obvious , since they include sexual immorality , moral corruption , doing whatever feels good ,
48005020	idolatry , drug use and casting spells , hate , fighting , obsession , losing your temper , competitive opposition , conflict , selfishness , group rivalry ,
48005021	jealousy , drunkenness , partying , and other things like that . I warn you as I have already warned you , that those who do these kinds of things won’t inherit God’s kingdom .
48005022	But the fruit of the Spirit is love , joy , peace , patience , kindness , goodness , faithfulness ,
48005023	gentleness , and self-control . There is no law against things like this .
48005024	Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified self with its passions and its desires .
48005025	If we live by the Spirit , let’s follow the Spirit .
48005026	Let’s not become arrogant , make each other angry , or be jealous of each other .
48006001	Brothers and sisters , if a person is caught doing something wrong , you who are spiritual should restore someone like this with a spirit of gentleness . Watch out for yourselves so you won’t be tempted too .
48006002	Carry each other’s burdens and so you will fulfill the law of Christ .
48006003	If anyone thinks they are important when they aren’t , they’re fooling themselves .
48006004	Each person should test their own work and be happy with doing a good job and not compare themselves with others .
48006005	Each person will have to carry their own load .
48006006	Those who are taught the word should share all good things with their teacher .
48006007	Make no mistake , God is not mocked . A person will harvest what they plant .
48006008	Those who plant only for their own benefit will harvest devastation from their selfishness , but those who plant for the benefit of the Spirit will harvest eternal life from the Spirit .
48006009	Let’s not get tired of doing good , because in time we’ll have a harvest if we don’t give up .
48006010	So then , let’s work for the good of all whenever we have an opportunity , and especially for those in the household of faith .
48006011	Look at the large letters I’m making with my own handwriting !
48006012	Whoever wants to look good by human standards will try to get you to be circumcised , but only so they won’t be harassed for the cross of Christ .
48006013	Those who are circumcised don’t observe the Law themselves , but they want you to be circumcised , so they can boast about your physical body .
48006014	But as for me , God forbid that I should boast about anything except for the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ . The world has been crucified to me through him , and I have been crucified to the world .
48006015	Being circumcised or not being circumcised doesn’t mean anything . What matters is a new creation .
48006016	May peace and mercy be on whoever follows this rule and on God’s Israel .
48006017	From now on , no one should bother me because I bear the marks of Jesus on my body .
48006018	Brothers and sisters , may the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit . Amen .
49001001	From Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus by God’s will . To the holy and faithful people in Christ Jesus in Ephesus .
49001002	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ .
49001003	Bless the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ! He has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing that comes from heaven .
49001004	God chose us in Christ to be holy and blameless in God’s presence before the creation of the world .
49001005	God destined us to be his adopted children through Jesus Christ because of his love . This was according to his goodwill and plan
49001006	and to honor his glorious grace that he has given to us freely through the Son whom he loves .
49001007	We have been ransomed through his Son’s blood , and we have forgiveness for our failures based on his overflowing grace ,
49001008	which he poured over us with wisdom and understanding .
49001009	God revealed his hidden design to us , which is according to his goodwill and the plan that he intended to accomplish through his Son .
49001010	This is what God planned for the climax of all times : to bring all things together in Christ , the things in heaven along with the things on earth .
49001011	We have also received an inheritance in Christ . We were destined by the plan of God , who accomplishes everything according to his design .
49001012	We are called to be an honor to God’s glory because we were the first to hope in Christ .
49001013	You too heard the word of truth in Christ , which is the good news of your salvation . You were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit because you believed in Christ .
49001014	The Holy Spirit is the down payment on our inheritance , which is applied toward our redemption as God’s own people , resulting in the honor of God’s glory .
49001015	Since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all God’s people , this is the reason that
49001016	I don’t stop giving thanks to God for you when I remember you in my prayers .
49001017	I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of glory , will give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation that makes God known to you .
49001018	I pray that the eyes of your heart will have enough light to see what is the hope of God’s call , what is the richness of God’s glorious inheritance among believers ,
49001019	and what is the overwhelming greatness of God’s power that is working among us believers . This power is conferred by the energy of God’s powerful strength .
49001020	God’s power was at work in Christ when God raised him from the dead and sat him at God’s right side in the heavens ,
49001021	far above every ruler and authority and power and angelic power , any power that might be named not only now but in the future .
49001022	God put everything under Christ’s feet and made him head of everything in the church ,
49001023	which is his body . His body , the church , is the fullness of Christ , who fills everything in every way .
49002001	At one time you were like a dead person because of the things you did wrong and your offenses against God .
49002002	You used to act like most people in our world do . You followed the rule of a destructive spiritual power . This is the spirit of disobedience to God’s will that is now at work in persons whose lives are characterized by disobedience .
49002003	At one time you were like those persons . All of you used to do whatever felt good and whatever you thought you wanted so that you were children headed for punishment just like everyone else .
49002004	
49002005	However , God is rich in mercy . He brought us to life with Christ while we were dead as a result of those things that we did wrong . He did this because of the great love that he has for us . You are saved by God’s grace !
49002006	And God raised us up and seated us in the heavens with Christ Jesus .
49002007	God did this to show future generations the greatness of his grace by the goodness that God has shown us in Christ Jesus .
49002008	You are saved by God’s grace because of your faith . This salvation is God’s gift . It’s not something you possessed .
49002009	It’s not something you did that you can be proud of .
49002010	Instead , we are God’s accomplishment , created in Christ Jesus to do good things . God planned for these good things to be the way that we live our lives .
49002011	So remember that once you were Gentiles by physical descent , who were called " uncircumcised " by Jews who are physically circumcised .
49002012	At that time you were without Christ . You were aliens rather than citizens of Israel , and strangers to the covenants of God’s promise . In this world you had no hope and no God .
49002013	But now , thanks to Christ Jesus , you who once were so far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ .
49002014	Christ is our peace . He made both Jews and Gentiles into one group . With his body , he broke down the barrier of hatred that divided us .
49002015	He canceled the detailed rules of the Law so that he could create one new person out of the two groups , making peace .
49002016	He reconciled them both as one body to God by the cross , which ended the hostility to God .
49002017	When he came , he announced the good news of peace to you who were far away from God and to those who were near .
49002018	We both have access to the Father through Christ by the one Spirit .
49002019	So now you are no longer strangers and aliens . Rather , you are fellow citizens with God’s people , and you belong to God’s household .
49002020	As God’s household , you are built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets with Christ Jesus himself as the cornerstone .
49002021	The whole building is joined together in him , and it grows up into a temple that is dedicated to the Lord .
49002022	Christ is building you into a place where God lives through the Spirit .
49003001	This is why I , Paul , am a prisoner of Christ for you Gentiles .
49003002	You’ve heard , of course , about the responsibility to distribute God’s grace , which God gave to me for you , right ?
49003003	God showed me his secret plan in a revelation , as I mentioned briefly before (
49003004	when you read this , you’ll understand my insight into the secret plan about Christ ) .
49003005	Earlier generations didn’t know this hidden plan that God has now revealed to his holy apostles and prophets through the Spirit .
49003006	This plan is that the Gentiles would be coheirs and parts of the same body , and that they would share with the Jews in the promises of God in Christ Jesus through the gospel .
49003007	I became a servant of the gospel because of the grace that God showed me through the exercise of his power .
49003008	God gave his grace to me , the least of all God’s people , to preach the good news about the immeasurable riches of Christ to the Gentiles .
49003009	God sent me to reveal the secret plan that had been hidden since the beginning of time by God , who created everything .
49003010	God’s purpose is now to show the rulers and powers in the heavens the many different varieties of his wisdom through the church .
49003011	This was consistent with the plan he had from the beginning of time that he accomplished through Christ Jesus our Lord .
49003012	In Christ we have bold and confident access to God through faith in him .
49003013	So then , I ask you not to become discouraged by what I’m suffering for you , which is your glory .
49003014	This is why I kneel before the Father .
49003015	Every ethnic group in heaven or on earth is recognized by him .
49003016	I ask that he will strengthen you in your inner selves from the riches of his glory through the Spirit .
49003017	I ask that Christ will live in your hearts through faith . As a result of having strong roots in love ,
49003018	I ask that you’ll have the power to grasp love’s width and length , height and depth , together with all believers .
49003019	I ask that you’ll know the love of Christ that is beyond knowledge so that you will be filled entirely with the fullness of God .
49003020	Glory to God , who is able to do far beyond all that we could ask or imagine by his power at work within us ;
49003021	glory to him in the church and in Christ Jesus for all generations , forever and always . Amen .
49004001	Therefore , as a prisoner for the Lord , I encourage you to live as people worthy of the call you received from God .
49004002	Conduct yourselves with all humility , gentleness , and patience . Accept each other with love ,
49004003	and make an effort to preserve the unity of the Spirit with the peace that ties you together .
49004004	You are one body and one spirit , just as God also called you in one hope .
49004005	There is one Lord , one faith , one baptism ,
49004006	and one God and Father of all , who is over all , through all , and in all .
49004007	God has given his grace to each one of us measured out by the gift that is given by Christ .
49004008	That’s why scripture says , When he climbed up to the heights , he captured prisoners , and he gave gifts to people .
49004009	What does the phrase " he climbed up " mean if it doesn’t mean that he had first gone down into the lower regions , the earth ?
49004010	The one who went down is the same one who climbed up above all the heavens so that he might fill everything .
49004011	He gave some apostles , some prophets , some evangelists , and some pastors and teachers .
49004012	His purpose was to equip God’s people for the work of serving and building up the body of Christ
49004013	until we all reach the unity of faith and knowledge of God’s Son . God’s goal is for us to become mature adults — to be fully grown , measured by the standard of the fullness of Christ .
49004014	As a result , we aren’t supposed to be infants any longer who can be tossed and blown around by every wind that comes from teaching with deceitful scheming and the tricks people play to deliberately mislead others .
49004015	Instead , by speaking the truth with love , let’s grow in every way into Christ ,
49004016	who is the head . The whole body grows from him , as it is joined and held together by all the supporting ligaments . The body makes itself grow in that it builds itself up with love as each one does their part .
49004017	So I’m telling you this , and I insist on it in the Lord : you shouldn’t live your life like the Gentiles anymore . They base their lives on pointless thinking ,
49004018	and they are in the dark in their reasoning . They are disconnected from God’s life because of their ignorance and their closed hearts .
49004019	They are people who lack all sense of right and wrong , and who have turned themselves over to doing whatever feels good and to practicing every sort of corruption along with greed .
49004020	But you didn’t learn that sort of thing from Christ .
49004021	Since you really listened to him and you were taught how the truth is in Jesus ,
49004022	change the former way of life that was part of the person you once were , corrupted by deceitful desires .
49004023	Instead , renew the thinking in your mind by the Spirit
49004024	and clothe yourself with the new person created according to God’s image in justice and true holiness .
49004025	Therefore , after you have gotten rid of lying , Each of you must tell the truth to your neighbor because we are parts of each other in the same body .
49004026	Be angry without sinning . Don’t let the sun set on your anger .
49004027	Don’t provide an opportunity for the devil .
49004028	Thieves should no longer steal . Instead , they should go to work , using their hands to do good so that they will have something to share with whoever is in need .
49004029	Don’t let any foul words come out of your mouth . Only say what is helpful when it is needed for building up the community so that it benefits those who hear what you say .
49004030	Don’t make the Holy Spirit of God unhappy — you were sealed by him for the day of redemption .
49004031	Put aside all bitterness , losing your temper , anger , shouting , and slander , along with every other evil .
49004032	Be kind , compassionate , and forgiving to each other , in the same way God forgave you in Christ .
49005001	Therefore , imitate God like dearly loved children .
49005002	Live your life with love , following the example of Christ , who loved us and gave himself for us . He was a sacrificial offering that smelled sweet to God .
49005003	Sexual immorality , and any kind of impurity or greed , shouldn’t even be mentioned among you , which is right for holy persons .
49005004	Obscene language , silly talk , or vulgar jokes aren’t acceptable for believers . Instead , there should be thanksgiving .
49005005	Because you know for sure that persons who are sexually immoral , impure , or greedy — which happens when things become gods — those persons won’t inherit the kingdom of Christ and God .
49005006	Nobody should deceive you with stupid ideas . God’s anger comes down on those who are disobedient because of this kind of thing .
49005007	So you shouldn’t have anything to do with them .
49005008	You were once darkness , but now you are light in the Lord , so live your life as children of light .
49005009	Light produces fruit that consists of every sort of goodness , justice , and truth .
49005010	Therefore , test everything to see what’s pleasing to the Lord ,
49005011	and don’t participate in the unfruitful actions of darkness . Instead , you should reveal the truth about them .
49005012	It’s embarrassing to even talk about what certain persons do in secret .
49005013	But everything exposed to the light is revealed by the light .
49005014	Everything that is revealed by the light is light . Therefore , it says , Wake up , sleeper ! Get up from the dead , and Christ will shine on you .
49005015	So be careful to live your life wisely , not foolishly .
49005016	Take advantage of every opportunity because these are evil times .
49005017	Because of this , don’t be ignorant , but understand the Lord’s will .
49005018	Don’t get drunk on wine , which produces depravity . Instead , be filled with the Spirit in the following ways :
49005019	speak to each other with psalms , hymns , and spiritual songs ; sing and make music to the Lord in your hearts ;
49005020	always give thanks to God the Father for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ ;
49005021	and submit to each other out of respect for Christ .
49005022	For example , wives should submit to their husbands as if to the Lord .
49005023	A husband is the head of his wife like Christ is head of the church , that is , the savior of the body .
49005024	So wives submit to their husbands in everything like the church submits to Christ .
49005025	As for husbands , love your wives just like Christ loved the church and gave himself for her .
49005026	He did this to make her holy by washing her in a bath of water with the word .
49005027	He did this to present himself with a splendid church , one without any sort of stain or wrinkle on her clothes , but rather one that is holy and blameless .
49005028	That’s how husbands ought to love their wives — in the same way as they do their own bodies . Anyone who loves his wife loves himself .
49005029	No one ever hates his own body , but feeds it and takes care of it just like Christ does for the church
49005030	because we are parts of his body .
49005031	This is why a man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife , and the two of them will be one body .
49005032	Marriage is a significant allegory , and I’m applying it to Christ and the church .
49005033	In any case , as for you individually , each one of you should love his wife as himself , and wives should respect their husbands .
49006001	As for children , obey your parents in the Lord , because it is right .
49006002	The commandment Honor your father and mother is the first one with a promise attached :
49006003	so that things will go well for you , and you will live for a long time in the land .
49006004	As for parents , don’t provoke your children to anger , but raise them with discipline and instruction about the Lord .
49006005	As for slaves , obey your human masters with fear and trembling and with sincere devotion to Christ .
49006006	Don’t work to make yourself look good and try to flatter people , but act like slaves of Christ carrying out God’s will from the heart .
49006007	Serve your owners enthusiastically , as though you were serving the Lord and not human beings .
49006008	You know that the Lord will reward every person who does what is right , whether that person is a slave or a free person .
49006009	As for masters , treat your slaves in the same way . Stop threatening them , because you know that both you and your slaves have a master in heaven . He doesn’t distinguish between people on the basis of status .
49006010	Finally , be strengthened by the Lord and his powerful strength .
49006011	Put on God’s armor so that you can make a stand against the tricks of the devil .
49006012	We aren’t fighting against human enemies but against rulers , authorities , forces of cosmic darkness , and spiritual powers of evil in the heavens .
49006013	Therefore , pick up the full armor of God so that you can stand your ground on the evil day and after you have done everything possible to still stand .
49006014	So stand with the belt of truth around your waist , justice as your breastplate ,
49006015	and put shoes on your feet so that you are ready to spread the good news of peace .
49006016	Above all , carry the shield of faith so that you can extinguish the flaming arrows of the evil one .
49006017	Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit , which is God’s word .
49006018	Offer prayers and petitions in the Spirit all the time . Stay alert by hanging in there and praying for all believers .
49006019	As for me , pray that when I open my mouth , I’ll get a message that confidently makes this secret plan of the gospel known .
49006020	I’m an ambassador in chains for the sake of the gospel . Pray so that the Lord will give me the confidence to say what I have to say .
49006021	Tychicus , my loved brother and faithful servant of the Lord , can inform you about my situation and what I’m doing .
49006022	I’ve sent him for this reason — so that you will know about us . He can reassure you .
49006023	May there be peace with the brothers and sisters as well as love with the faith that comes from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
49006024	May grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ forever .
50001001	From Paul and Timothy , slaves of Christ Jesus . To all those in Philippi who are God’s people in Christ Jesus , along with your supervisors and servants .
50001002	May the grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ be with you .
50001003	I thank my God every time I mention you in my prayers .
50001004	I’m thankful for all of you every time I pray , and it’s always a prayer full of joy .
50001005	I’m glad because of the way you have been my partners in the ministry of the gospel from the time you first believed it until now .
50001006	I’m sure about this : the one who started a good work in you will stay with you to complete the job by the day of Christ Jesus .
50001007	I have good reason to think this way about all of you because I keep you in my heart . You are all my partners in God’s grace , both during my time in prison and in the defense and support of the gospel .
50001008	God is my witness that I feel affection for all of you with the compassion of Christ Jesus .
50001009	This is my prayer : that your love might become even more and more rich with knowledge and all kinds of insight .
50001010	I pray this so that you will be able to decide what really matters and so you will be sincere and blameless on the day of Christ .
50001011	I pray that you will then be filled with the fruit of righteousness , which comes from Jesus Christ , in order to give glory and praise to God .
50001012	Brothers and sisters , I want you to know that the things that have happened to me have actually advanced the gospel .
50001013	The whole Praetorian Guard and everyone else knows that I’m in prison for Christ .
50001014	Most of the brothers and sisters have had more confidence through the Lord to speak the word boldly and bravely because of my jail time .
50001015	Some certainly preach Christ with jealous and competitive motives , but others preach with good motives .
50001016	They are motivated by love , because they know that I’m put here to give a defense of the gospel ;
50001017	the others preach Christ because of their selfish ambition . They are insincere , hoping to cause me more pain while I’m in prison .
50001018	What do I think about this ? Just this : since Christ is proclaimed in every possible way , whether from dishonest or true motives , I’m glad and I’ll continue to be glad .
50001019	I’m glad because I know that this will result in my release through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ .
50001020	It is my expectation and hope that I won’t be put to shame in anything . Rather , I hope with daring courage that Christ’s greatness will be seen in my body , now as always , whether I live or die .
50001021	Because for me , living serves Christ and dying is even better .
50001022	If I continue to live in this world , I get results from my work .
50001023	But I don’t know what I prefer . I’m torn between the two because I want to leave this life and be with Christ , which is far better .
50001024	However , it’s more important for me to stay in this world for your sake .
50001025	I’m sure of this : I will stay alive and remain with all of you to help your progress and the joy of your faith ,
50001026	and to increase your pride in Christ Jesus through my presence when I visit you again .
50001027	Most important , live together in a manner worthy of Christ’s gospel . Do this , whether I come and see you or I’m absent and hear about you . Do this so that you stand firm , united in one spirit and mind as you struggle together to remain faithful to the gospel .
50001028	That way , you won’t be afraid of anything your enemies do . Your faithfulness and courage are a sign of their coming destruction and your salvation , which is from God .
50001029	God has generously granted you the privilege , not only of believing in Christ but also of suffering for Christ’s sake .
50001030	You are having the same struggle that you saw me face and now hear that I’m still facing .
50002001	Therefore , if there is any encouragement in Christ , any comfort in love , any sharing in the Spirit , any sympathy ,
50002002	complete my joy by thinking the same way , having the same love , being united , and agreeing with each other .
50002003	Don’t do anything for selfish purposes , but with humility think of others as better than yourselves .
50002004	Instead of each person watching out for their own good , watch out for what is better for others .
50002005	Adopt the attitude that was in Christ Jesus :
50002006	Though he was in the form of God ,
50002007	But he emptied himself When he found himself in the form of a human ,
50002009	Therefore , God highly honored him
50002010	so that at the name of Jesus everyone
50002012	Therefore , my loved ones , just as you always obey me , not just when I am present but now even more while I am away , carry out your own salvation with fear and trembling .
50002013	God is the one who enables you both to want and to actually live out his good purposes .
50002014	Do everything without grumbling and arguing
50002015	so that you may be blameless and pure , innocent children of God surrounded by people who are crooked and corrupt . Among these people you shine like stars in the world
50002016	because you hold on to the word of life . This will allow me to say on the day of Christ that I haven’t run for nothing or worked for nothing .
50002017	But even if I am poured out like a drink offering upon the altar of service for your faith , I am glad . I’m glad with all of you .
50002018	You should be glad about this in the same way . Be glad with me !
50002019	I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to see you soon so that I may be encouraged by hearing about you .
50002020	I have no one like him . He is a person who genuinely cares about your well-being .
50002021	All the others put their own business ahead of Jesus Christ’s business .
50002022	You know his character , how he labors with me for the gospel like a son works with his father .
50002023	So he is the one that I hope to send as soon as I find out how things turn out here for me .
50002024	I trust in the Lord that I also will visit you soon .
50002025	I think it is also necessary to send Epaphroditus to you . He is my brother , coworker , and fellow soldier ; and he is your representative who serves my needs .
50002026	He misses you all , and he was upset because you heard he was sick .
50002027	In fact , he was so sick that he nearly died . But God had mercy on him — and not just on him but also on me , because his death would have caused me great sorrow .
50002028	Therefore , I am sending him immediately so that when you see him again you can be glad and I won’t worry .
50002029	So welcome him in the Lord with great joy and show great respect for people like him .
50002030	He risked his life and almost died for the work of Christ , and he did this to make up for the help you couldn’t give me .
50003001	So then , my brothers and sisters , be glad in the Lord . It’s no trouble for me to repeat the same things to you because they will help keep you on track .
50003002	Watch out for the " dogs . " Watch out for people who do evil things . Watch out for those who insist on circumcision , which is really mutilation .
50003003	We are the circumcision . We are the ones who serve by God’s Spirit and who boast in Christ Jesus . We don’t put our confidence in rituals performed on the body ,
50003004	though I have good reason to have this kind of confidence . If anyone else has reason to put their confidence in physical advantages , I have even more :
50003005	I was circumcised on the eighth day . I am from the people of Israel and the tribe of Benjamin . I am a Hebrew of the Hebrews . With respect to observing the Law , I’m a Pharisee .
50003006	With respect to devotion to the faith , I harassed the church . With respect to righteousness under the Law , I’m blameless .
50003007	These things were my assets , but I wrote them off as a loss for the sake of Christ .
50003008	But even beyond that , I consider everything a loss in comparison with the superior value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord . I have lost everything for him , but what I lost I think of as sewer trash , so that I might gain Christ
50003009	and be found in him . In Christ I have a righteousness that is not my own and that does not come from the Law but rather from the faithfulness of Christ . It is the righteousness of God that is based on faith .
50003010	The righteousness that I have comes from knowing Christ , the power of his resurrection , and the participation in his sufferings . It includes being conformed to his death
50003011	so that I may perhaps reach the goal of the resurrection of the dead .
50003012	It’s not that I have already reached this goal or have already been perfected , but I pursue it , so that I may grab hold of it because Christ grabbed hold of me for just this purpose .
50003013	Brothers and sisters , I myself don’t think I’ve reached it , but I do this one thing : I forget about the things behind me and reach out for the things ahead of me .
50003014	The goal I pursue is the prize of God’s upward call in Christ Jesus .
50003015	So all of us who are spiritually mature should think this way , and if anyone thinks differently , God will reveal it to him or her .
50003016	Only let’s live in a way that is consistent with whatever level we have reached .
50003017	Brothers and sisters , become imitators of me and watch those who live this way — you can use us as models .
50003018	As I have told you many times and now say with deep sadness , many people live as enemies of the cross .
50003019	Their lives end with destruction . Their god is their stomach , and they take pride in their disgrace because their thoughts focus on earthly things .
50003020	Our citizenship is in heaven . We look forward to a savior that comes from there — the Lord Jesus Christ .
50003021	He will transform our humble bodies so that they are like his glorious body , by the power that also makes him able to subject all things to himself .
50004001	Therefore , my brothers and sisters whom I love and miss , who are my joy and crown , stand firm in the Lord . Loved ones ,
50004002	I urge Euodia and I urge Syntyche to come to an agreement in the Lord .
50004003	Yes , and I’m also asking you , loyal friend , to help these women who have struggled together with me in the ministry of the gospel , along with Clement and the rest of my coworkers whose names are in the scroll of life .
50004004	Be glad in the Lord always ! Again I say , be glad !
50004005	Let your gentleness show in your treatment of all people . The Lord is near .
50004006	Don’t be anxious about anything ; rather , bring up all of your requests to God in your prayers and petitions , along with giving thanks .
50004007	Then the peace of God that exceeds all understanding will keep your hearts and minds safe in Christ Jesus .
50004008	From now on , brothers and sisters , if anything is excellent and if anything is admirable , focus your thoughts on these things : all that is true , all that is holy , all that is just , all that is pure , all that is lovely , and all that is worthy of praise .
50004009	Practice these things : whatever you learned , received , heard , or saw in us . The God of peace will be with you .
50004010	I was very glad in the Lord because now at last you have shown concern for me again . ( Of course you were always concerned but had no way to show it . )
50004011	I’m not saying this because I need anything , for I have learned how to be content in any circumstance .
50004012	I know the experience of being in need and of having more than enough ; I have learned the secret to being content in any and every circumstance , whether full or hungry or whether having plenty or being poor .
50004013	I can endure all these things through the power of the one who gives me strength .
50004014	Still , you have done well to share my distress .
50004015	You Philippians know from the time of my first mission work in Macedonia how no church shared in supporting my ministry except you .
50004016	You sent contributions repeatedly to take care of my needs even while I was in Thessalonica .
50004017	I’m not hoping for a gift , but I am hoping for a profit that accumulates in your account .
50004018	I now have plenty and it is more than enough . I am full to overflowing because I received the gifts that you sent from Epaphroditus . Those gifts give off a fragrant aroma , an acceptable sacrifice that pleases God .
50004019	My God will meet your every need out of his riches in the glory that is found in Christ Jesus .
50004020	Let glory be given to God our Father forever and always . Amen .
50004021	Greet all God’s people in Christ Jesus . The brothers and sisters with me send you their greeting .
50004022	All God’s people here , especially those in Caesar’s household , send you their greeting .
50004023	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirits .
51001001	From Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus by God’s will , and Timothy our brother .
51001002	To the holy and faithful brothers and sisters in Christ in Colossae . Grace and peace to you from God our Father .
51001003	We always give thanks to God , the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , when we pray for you .
51001004	We’ve done this since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and your love for all God’s people .
51001005	You have this faith and love because of the hope reserved for you in heaven . You previously heard about this hope through the true message , the good news ,
51001006	which has come to you . This message has been bearing fruit and growing among you since the day you heard and truly understood God’s grace , in the same way that it is bearing fruit and growing in the whole world .
51001007	You learned it from Epaphras , who is the fellow slave we love and Christ’s faithful minister for your sake .
51001008	He informed us of your love in the Spirit .
51001009	Because of this , since the day we heard about you , we haven’t stopped praying for you and asking for you to be filled with the knowledge of God’s will , with all wisdom and spiritual understanding .
51001010	We’re praying this so that you can live lives that are worthy of the Lord and pleasing to him in every way : by producing fruit in every good work and growing in the knowledge of God ;
51001011	by being strengthened through his glorious might so that you endure everything and have patience ;
51001012	and by giving thanks with joy to the Father . He made it so you could take part in the inheritance , in light granted to God’s holy people .
51001013	He rescued us from the control of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son he loves .
51001014	He set us free through the Son and forgave our sins .
51001015	The Son is the image of the invisible God ,
51001016	Because all things were created by him :
51001017	He existed before all things ,
51001018	He is the head of the body , the church , who is the beginning ,
51001019	Because all the fullness of God was pleased to live in him ,
51001021	Once you were alienated from God and you were enemies with him in your minds , which was shown by your evil actions .
51001022	But now he has reconciled you by his physical body through death , to present you before God as a people who are holy , faultless , and without blame .
51001023	But you need to remain well established and rooted in faith and not shift away from the hope given in the good news that you heard . This message has been preached throughout all creation under heaven . And I , Paul , became a servant of this good news .
51001024	Now I’m happy to be suffering for you . I’m completing what is missing from Christ’s sufferings with my own body . I’m doing this for the sake of his body , which is the church .
51001025	I became a servant of the church by God’s commission , which was given to me for you , in order to complete God’s word .
51001026	I’m completing it with a secret plan that has been hidden for ages and generations but which has now been revealed to his holy people .
51001027	God wanted to make the glorious riches of this secret plan known among the Gentiles , which is Christ living in you , the hope of glory .
51001028	This is what we preach as we warn and teach every person with all wisdom so that we might present each one mature in Christ .
51001029	I work hard and struggle for this goal with his energy , which works in me powerfully .
51002001	I want you to know how much I struggle for you , for those in Laodicea , and for all who haven’t known me personally .
51002002	My goal is that their hearts would be encouraged and united together in love so that they might have all the riches of assurance that come with understanding , so that they might have the knowledge of the secret plan of God , namely Christ .
51002003	All the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden in him .
51002004	I’m telling you this so that no one deceives you with convincing arguments ,
51002005	because even though I am absent physically , I’m with you in spirit . I’m happy to see the discipline and stability of your faith in Christ .
51002006	So live in Christ Jesus the Lord in the same way as you received him .
51002007	Be rooted and built up in him , be established in faith , and overflow with thanksgiving just as you were taught .
51002008	See to it that nobody enslaves you with philosophy and foolish deception , which conform to human traditions and the way the world thinks and acts rather than Christ .
51002009	All the fullness of deity lives in Christ’s body .
51002010	And you have been filled by him , who is the head of every ruler and authority .
51002011	You were also circumcised by him . This wasn’t performed by human hands — the whole body was removed through this circumcision by Christ .
51002012	You were buried with him through baptism and raised with him through faith in the power of God , who raised him from the dead .
51002013	When you were dead because of the things you had done wrong and because your body wasn’t circumcised , God made you alive with Christ and forgave all the things you had done wrong .
51002014	He destroyed the record of the debt we owed , with its requirements that worked against us . He canceled it by nailing it to the cross .
51002015	When he disarmed the rulers and authorities , he exposed them to public disgrace by leading them in a triumphal parade .
51002016	So don’t let anyone judge you about eating or drinking or about a festival , a new moon observance , or sabbaths .
51002017	These religious practices are only a shadow of what was coming — the body that cast the shadow is Christ .
51002018	Don’t let anyone who wants to practice harsh self-denial and worship angels rob you of the prize . They go into detail about what they have seen in visions and have become unjustifiably arrogant by their selfish way of thinking .
51002019	They don’t stay connected to the head . The head nourishes and supports the whole body through the joints and ligaments , so the body grows with a growth that is from God .
51002020	If you died with Christ to the way the world thinks and acts , why do you submit to rules and regulations as though you were living in the world ?
51002021	" Don’t handle ! " " Don’t taste ! " " Don’t touch ! "
51002022	All these things cease to exist when they are used . Such rules are human commandments and teachings .
51002023	They look like they are wise with this self-made religion and their self-denial by the harsh treatment of the body , but they are no help against indulging in selfish immoral behavior .
51003001	Therefore , if you were raised with Christ , look for the things that are above where Christ is sitting at God’s right side .
51003002	Think about the things above and not things on earth .
51003003	You died , and your life is hidden with Christ in God .
51003004	When Christ , who is your life , is revealed , then you also will be revealed with him in glory .
51003005	So put to death the parts of your life that belong to the earth , such as sexual immorality , moral corruption , lust , evil desire , and greed ( which is idolatry ) .
51003006	The wrath of God is coming upon disobedient people because of these things .
51003007	You used to live this way , when you were alive to these things .
51003008	But now set aside these things , such as anger , rage , malice , slander , and obscene language .
51003009	Don’t lie to each other . Take off the old human nature with its practices
51003010	and put on the new nature , which is renewed in knowledge by conforming to the image of the one who created it .
51003011	In this image there is neither Greek nor Jew , circumcised nor uncircumcised , barbarian , Scythian , slave nor free , but Christ is all things and in all people .
51003012	Therefore , as God’s choice , holy and loved , put on compassion , kindness , humility , gentleness , and patience .
51003013	Be tolerant with each other and , if someone has a complaint against anyone , forgive each other . As the Lord forgave you , so also forgive each other .
51003014	And over all these things put on love , which is the perfect bond of unity .
51003015	The peace of Christ must control your hearts — a peace into which you were called in one body . And be thankful people .
51003016	The word of Christ must live in you richly . Teach and warn each other with all wisdom by singing psalms , hymns , and spiritual songs . Sing to God with gratitude in your hearts .
51003017	Whatever you do , whether in speech or action , do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus and give thanks to God the Father through him .
51003018	Wives , submit to your husbands in a way that is appropriate in the Lord .
51003019	Husbands , love your wives and don’t be harsh with them .
51003020	Children , obey your parents in everything , because this pleases the Lord .
51003021	Parents , don’t provoke your children in a way that ends up discouraging them .
51003022	Slaves , obey your masters on earth in everything . Don’t just obey like people pleasers when they are watching . Instead , obey with the single motivation of fearing the Lord .
51003023	Whatever you do , do it from the heart for the Lord and not for people .
51003024	You know that you will receive an inheritance as a reward . You serve the Lord Christ .
51003025	But evildoers will receive their reward for their evil actions . There is no discrimination .
51004001	Masters , be just and fair to your slaves , knowing that you yourselves have a master in heaven .
51004002	Keep on praying and guard your prayers with thanksgiving .
51004003	At the same time , pray for us also . Pray that God would open a door for the word so we can preach the secret plan of Christ — which is why I’m in chains .
51004004	Pray that I might be able to make it as clear as I ought to when I preach .
51004005	Act wisely toward outsiders , making the most of the opportunity .
51004006	Your speech should always be gracious and sprinkled with insight so that you may know how to respond to every person .
51004007	Tychicus , our dearly loved brother , faithful minister , and fellow slave in the Lord , will inform you about everything that has happened to me .
51004008	This is why I sent him to you , so that you’ll know all about us and so he can encourage your hearts .
51004009	I sent him with Onesimus , our faithful and dearly loved brother , who is one of you . They will let you know about everything here .
51004010	Aristarchus , my fellow prisoner , says hello to you . So does Mark , Barnabas’ cousin ( you received instructions about him ; if he comes to you , welcome him ) .
51004011	Jesus , called Justus , also says hello . These are my only fellow workers for God’s kingdom who are Jewish converts . They have been an encouragement to me .
51004012	Epaphras , who is one of you , says hello . He’s a slave of Christ Jesus who always wrestles for you in prayers so that you will stand firm and be fully mature and complete in the entire will of God .
51004013	I can vouch for him that he has worked hard for you and for those in Laodicea and Hierapolis .
51004014	Luke , the dearly loved physician , and Demas say hello .
51004015	Say hello to the brothers and sisters in Laodicea , along with Nympha and the church that meets in her house .
51004016	After this letter has been read to you publicly , make sure that the church in Laodicea reads it and that you read the one from Laodicea .
51004017	And tell Archippus , " See to it that you complete the ministry that you received in the Lord . "
51004018	I , Paul , am writing this greeting personally . Remember that I’m in prison . Grace be with you .
52001001	From Paul , Silvanus , and Timothy . To the Thessalonians’ church that is in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ . Grace and peace to all of you .
52001002	We always thank God for all of you when we mention you constantly in our prayers .
52001003	This is because we remember your work that comes from faith , your effort that comes from love , and your perseverance that comes from hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the presence of our God and Father .
52001004	Brothers and sisters , you are loved by God , and we know that he has chosen you .
52001005	We know this because our good news didn’t come to you just in speech but also with power and the Holy Spirit and with deep conviction . You know as well as we do what kind of people we were when we were with you , which was for your sake .
52001006	You became imitators of us and of the Lord when you accepted the message that came from the Holy Spirit with joy in spite of great suffering .
52001007	As a result you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia .
52001008	The message about the Lord rang out from you , not only in Macedonia and Achaia but in every place . The news about your faithfulness to God has spread so that we don’t even need to mention it .
52001009	People tell us about what sort of welcome we had from you and how you turned to God from idols . As a result , you are serving the living and true God ,
52001010	and you are waiting for his Son from heaven . His Son is Jesus , who is the one he raised from the dead and who is the one who will rescue us from the coming wrath .
52002001	As you yourselves know , brothers and sisters , our visit with you wasn’t a waste of time .
52002002	On the contrary , we had the courage through God to speak God’s good news in spite of a lot of opposition , although we had already suffered and were publicly insulted , as you know .
52002003	Our appeal isn’t based on false information , the wrong motives , or deception .
52002004	Rather , we have been examined and approved by God to be trusted with the good news , and that’s exactly how we speak . We aren’t trying to please people , but we are trying to please God , who continues to examine our hearts .
52002005	As you know , we never used flattery , and God is our witness that we didn’t have greedy motives .
52002006	We didn’t ask for special treatment from people — not from you or from others —
52002007	although we could have thrown our weight around as Christ’s apostles . Instead , we were gentle with you like a nursing mother caring for her own children .
52002008	We were glad to share not only God’s good news with you but also our very lives because we cared for you so much .
52002009	You remember , brothers and sisters , our efforts and hard work . We preached God’s good news to you , while we worked night and day so we wouldn’t be a burden on any of you .
52002010	You and God are witnesses of how holy , just , and blameless we were toward you believers .
52002011	Likewise , you know how we treated each of you like a father treats his own children .
52002012	We appealed to you , encouraged you , and pleaded with you to live lives worthy of the God who is calling you into his own kingdom and glory .
52002013	We also thank God constantly for this : when you accepted God’s word that you heard from us , you welcomed it for what it truly is . Instead of accepting it as a human message , you accepted it as God’s message , and it continues to work in you who are believers .
52002014	Brothers and sisters , you became imitators of the churches of God in Judea , which are in Christ Jesus . This was because you also suffered the same things from your own people as they did from the Jews .
52002015	They killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets and drove us out . They don’t please God , and they are hostile to the entire human race
52002016	when they try to stop us from speaking to the Gentiles so they can be saved . Their sins are constantly pushing the limit . God’s wrath has caught up with them in the end .
52002017	Brothers and sisters , we were separated from you for a while physically but not in our hearts . We made every effort in our desire to see you again face-to-face .
52002018	We wanted to come to you — I , Paul , tried over and over again — and Satan stopped us .
52002019	What is our hope , joy , or crown that we can brag about in front of our Lord Jesus when he comes ? Isn’t it all of you ?
52002020	You are our glory and joy !
52003001	So when we couldn’t stand it any longer , we thought it was a good idea to stay on in Athens by ourselves ,
52003002	and we sent you Timothy , who is our brother and God’s coworker in the good news about Christ . We sent him to strengthen and encourage you in your faithfulness .
52003003	We didn’t want any of you to be shaken by these problems . You know very well that we were meant to go through this .
52003004	In fact , when we were with you , we kept on predicting that we were going to face problems exactly like what happened , as you know .
52003005	That’s why I sent Timothy to find out about your faithfulness when I couldn’t stand it anymore . I was worried that the tempter might have tempted you so that our work would have been a waste of time .
52003006	Now Timothy has returned to us from you and has given us good news about your faithfulness and love ! He says that you always have good memories about us and that you want to see us as much as we want to see you .
52003007	Because of this , brothers and sisters , we were encouraged in all our distress and trouble through your faithfulness .
52003008	For now we are alive if you are standing your ground in the Lord .
52003009	How can we thank God enough for you , given all the joy we have because of you before our God ?
52003010	Night and day , we pray more than ever to see all of you in person and to complete whatever you still need for your faith .
52003011	Now may our God and Father himself guide us on our way back to you .
52003012	May the Lord cause you to increase and enrich your love for each other and for everyone in the same way as we also love you .
52003013	May the love cause your hearts to be strengthened , to be blameless in holiness before our God and Father when our Lord Jesus comes with all his people . Amen .
52004001	So then , brothers and sisters , we ask and encourage you in the Lord Jesus to keep living the way you already are and even do better in how you live and please God — just as you learned from us .
52004002	You know the instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus .
52004003	God’s will is that your lives are dedicated to him . This means that you stay away from sexual immorality
52004004	and learn how to control your own body in a pure and respectable way .
52004005	Don’t be controlled by your sexual urges like the Gentiles who don’t know God .
52004006	No one should mistreat or take advantage of their brother or sister in this issue . The Lord punishes people for all these things , as we told you before and sternly warned you .
52004007	God didn’t call us to be immoral but to be dedicated to him .
52004008	Therefore , whoever rejects these instructions isn’t rejecting a human authority . They are rejecting God , who gives his Holy Spirit to you .
52004009	You don’t need us to write about loving your brothers and sisters because God has already taught you to love each other .
52004010	In fact , you are doing loving deeds for all the brothers and sisters throughout Macedonia . Now we encourage you , brothers and sisters , to do so even more .
52004011	Aim to live quietly , mind your own business , and earn your own living , just as I told you .
52004012	That way you’ll behave appropriately toward outsiders , and you won’t be in need .
52004013	Brothers and sisters , we want you to know about people who have died so that you won’t mourn like others who don’t have any hope .
52004014	Since we believe that Jesus died and rose , so we also believe that God will bring with him those who have died in Jesus .
52004015	What we are saying is a message from the Lord : we who are alive and still around at the Lord’s coming definitely won’t go ahead of those who have died .
52004016	This is because the Lord himself will come down from heaven with the signal of a shout by the head angel and a blast on God’s trumpet . First , those who are dead in Christ will rise .
52004017	Then , we who are living and still around will be taken up together with them in the clouds to meet with the Lord in the air . That way we will always be with the Lord .
52004018	So encourage each other with these words .
52005001	We don’t need to write to you about the timing and dates , brothers and sisters .
52005002	You know very well that the day of the Lord is going to come like a thief in the night .
52005003	When they are saying , " There is peace and security , " at that time sudden destruction will attack them , like labor pains start with a pregnant woman , and they definitely won’t escape .
52005004	But you aren’t in darkness , brothers and sisters , so the day won’t catch you by surprise like a thief .
52005005	All of you are children of light and children of the day . We don’t belong to night or darkness .
52005006	So then , let’s not sleep like the others , but let’s stay awake and stay sober .
52005007	People who sleep sleep at night , and people who get drunk get drunk at night .
52005008	Since we belong to the day , let’s stay sober , wearing faithfulness and love as a piece of armor that protects our body and the hope of salvation as a helmet .
52005009	God didn’t intend for us to suffer his wrath but rather to possess salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ .
52005010	Jesus died for us so that , whether we are awake or asleep , we will live together with him .
52005011	So continue encouraging each other and building each other up , just like you are doing already .
52005012	Brothers and sisters , we ask you to respect those who are working with you , leading you , and instructing you .
52005013	Think of them highly with love because of their work . Live in peace with each other .
52005014	Brothers and sisters , we urge you to warn those who are disorderly . Comfort the discouraged . Help the weak . Be patient with everyone .
52005015	Make sure no one repays a wrong with a wrong , but always pursue the good for each other and everyone else .
52005016	Rejoice always .
52005017	Pray continually .
52005018	Give thanks in every situation because this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus .
52005019	Don’t suppress the Spirit .
52005020	Don’t brush off Spirit-inspired messages ,
52005021	but examine everything carefully and hang on to what is good .
52005022	Avoid every kind of evil .
52005023	Now , may the God of peace himself cause you to be completely dedicated to him ; and may your spirit , soul , and body be kept intact and blameless at our Lord Jesus Christ’s coming .
52005024	The one who is calling you is faithful and will do this .
52005025	Brothers and sisters , pray for us .
52005026	Greet all the brothers and sisters with a holy kiss .
52005027	By the Lord’s authority , I order all of you to have this letter read aloud to all the brothers and sisters .
52005028	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you .
53001001	From Paul , Silvanus , and Timothy : To the church of the Thessalonians , which is in God our Father , and in the Lord Jesus Christ .
53001002	Grace and peace to all of you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
53001003	Brothers and sisters , we must always thank God for you . This is only right because your faithfulness is growing by leaps and bounds , and the love that all of you have for each other is increasing .
53001004	That’s why we ourselves are bragging about you in God’s churches . We tell about your endurance and faithfulness in all the harassments and trouble that you have put up with .
53001005	This shows that God’s judgment is right , and that you will be considered worthy of God’s kingdom for which you are suffering .
53001006	After all , it’s right for God to pay back the ones making trouble for you with trouble
53001007	and to pay back you who are having trouble with relief along with us . This payback will come when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his powerful angels .
53001008	He will give justice with blazing fire to those who don’t recognize God and don’t obey the good news of our Lord Jesus .
53001009	They will pay the penalty of eternal destruction away from the Lord’s presence and away from his mighty glory .
53001010	This will happen when he comes on that day to receive honor from his holy people and to be admired by everyone who has believed — and our testimony to you was believed .
53001011	We are constantly praying for you for this : that our God will make you worthy of his calling and accomplish every good desire and faithful work by his power .
53001012	Then the name of our Lord Jesus will be honored by you , and you will be honored by him , consistent with the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ .
53002001	Brothers and sisters , we have a request for you concerning our Lord Jesus Christ’s coming and when we are gathered together to be with him .
53002002	We don’t want you to be easily confused in your mind or upset if you hear that the day of the Lord is already here , whether you hear it through some spirit , a message , or a letter supposedly from us .
53002003	Don’t let anyone deceive you in any way . That day won’t come unless the rebellion comes first and the person who is lawless is revealed , who is headed for destruction .
53002004	He is the opponent of every so-called god or object of worship and promotes himself over them . So he sits in God’s temple , displaying himself to show that he is God .
53002005	You remember that I used to tell you these things while I was with you , don’t you ?
53002006	Now you know what holds him back so that he can be revealed when his time comes .
53002007	The hidden plan to live without any law is at work now , but it will be secret only until the one who is holding it back is out of the way .
53002008	Then the person who is lawless will be revealed . The Lord Jesus will destroy him with the breath from his mouth . When the Lord comes , his appearance will put an end to him .
53002009	When the person who is lawless comes , it will happen through Satan’s effort , with all kinds of fake power , signs , and wonders .
53002010	It will happen with every sort of wicked deception of those who are heading toward destruction because they have refused to love the truth that would allow them to be saved .
53002011	This is why God will send them an influence that will mislead them so that they will believe the lie .
53002012	The result will be that everyone will be judged who is not convinced by the truth but is happy with injustice .
53002013	But we always must thank God for you , brothers and sisters who are loved by God . This is because he chose you from the beginning to be the first crop of the harvest . This brought salvation , through your dedication to God by the Spirit and through your belief in the truth .
53002014	God called all of you through our good news so you could possess the honor of our Lord Jesus Christ .
53002015	So then , brothers and sisters , stand firm and hold on to the traditions we taught you , whether we taught you in person or through our letter .
53002016	Our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father loved us and through grace gave us eternal comfort and a good hope .
53002017	May he encourage your hearts and give you strength in every good thing you do or say .
53003001	Finally , brothers and sisters , pray for us so that the Lord’s message will spread quickly and be honored , just like it happened with you .
53003002	Pray too that we will be rescued from inappropriate and evil people since everyone that we meet won’t respond with faith .
53003003	But the Lord is faithful and will give you strength and protect you from the evil one .
53003004	We are confident about you in the Lord — that you are doing and will keep doing what we tell you to do .
53003005	May the Lord lead your hearts to express God’s love and Christ’s endurance .
53003006	Brothers and sisters , we command you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to stay away from every brother or sister who lives an undisciplined life that is not in line with the traditions that you received from us .
53003007	You yourselves know how you need to imitate us because we were not undisciplined when we were with you .
53003008	We didn’t eat anyone’s food without paying for it . Instead , we worked night and day with effort and hard work so that we would not impose on you .
53003009	We did this to give you an example to imitate , not because we didn’t have a right to insist on financial support .
53003010	Even when we were with you we were giving you this command : " If anyone doesn’t want to work , they shouldn’t eat . "
53003011	We hear that some of you are living an undisciplined life . They aren’t working , but they are meddling in other people’s business .
53003012	By the Lord Jesus Christ , we command and encourage such people to work quietly and put their own food on the table .
53003013	Brothers and sisters , don’t get discouraged in doing what is right .
53003014	Take note of anyone who doesn’t obey what we have said in this letter . Don’t associate with them so they will be ashamed of themselves .
53003015	Don’t treat them like enemies , but warn them like you would do for a brother or sister .
53003016	May the Lord of peace himself give you peace always in every way . The Lord be with all of you .
53003017	I , Paul , am writing this greeting with my own hand . This verifies that the letter is from me , as in every letter of mine . This is how I write .
53003018	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you .
54001001	From Paul , who is an apostle of Jesus Christ by the command of God our savior and of Christ Jesus our hope .
54001002	To Timothy , my true child in the faith . Grace , mercy , and peace from God the Father and from Christ Jesus our Lord .
54001003	When I left for Macedonia , I asked you to stay behind in Ephesus so that you could instruct certain individuals not to spread wrong teaching .
54001004	They shouldn’t pay attention to myths and endless genealogies . Their teaching only causes useless guessing games instead of faithfulness to God’s way of doing things .
54001005	The goal of instruction is love from a pure heart , a good conscience , and a sincere faith .
54001006	Because they missed this goal , some people have been distracted by talk that doesn’t mean anything .
54001007	They want to be teachers of Law without understanding either what they are saying or what they are talking about with such confidence .
54001008	Now we know that the Law is good if used appropriately .
54001009	We understand this : the Law isn’t established for a righteous person but for people who live without laws and without obeying any authority . They are the ungodly and the sinners . They are people who are not spiritual , and nothing is sacred to them . They kill their fathers and mothers , and murder others .
54001010	They are people who are sexually unfaithful , and people who have intercourse with the same sex . They are kidnappers , liars , individuals who give false testimonies in court , and those who do anything else that is opposed to sound teaching .
54001011	Sound teaching agrees with the glorious gospel of the blessed God that has been trusted to me .
54001012	I thank Christ Jesus our Lord , who has given me strength because he considered me faithful . So he appointed me to ministry
54001013	even though I used to speak against him , attack his people , and I was proud . But I was shown mercy because I acted in ignorance and without faith .
54001014	Our Lord’s favor poured all over me along with the faithfulness and love that are in Christ Jesus .
54001015	This saying is reliable and deserves full acceptance : " Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners " — and I’m the biggest sinner of all .
54001016	But this is why I was shown mercy , so that Christ Jesus could show his endless patience to me first of all . So I’m an example for those who are going to believe in him for eternal life .
54001017	Now to the king of the ages , to the immortal , invisible , and only God , may honor and glory be given to him forever and always ! Amen .
54001018	Timothy , my child , I’m giving you these instructions based on the prophecies that were once made about you . So if you follow them , you can wage a good war
54001019	because you have faith and a good conscience . Some people have ruined their faith because they refused to listen to their conscience ,
54001020	such as Hymenaeus and Alexander . I’ve handed them over to Satan so that they can be taught not to speak against God .
54002001	First of all , then , I ask that requests , prayers , petitions , and thanksgiving be made for all people .
54002002	Pray for kings and everyone who is in authority so that we can live a quiet and peaceful life in complete godliness and dignity .
54002003	This is right and it pleases God our savior ,
54002004	who wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth .
54002005	There is one God and one mediator between God and humanity , the human Christ Jesus ,
54002006	who gave himself as a payment to set all people free . This was a testimony that was given at the right time .
54002007	I was appointed to be a preacher and apostle of this testimony — I’m telling the truth and I’m not lying ! I’m a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth .
54002008	Therefore , I want men to pray everywhere by lifting up hands that are holy , without anger or argument .
54002009	In the same way , I want women to enhance their appearance with clothing that is modest and sensible , not with elaborate hairstyles , gold , pearls , or expensive clothes .
54002010	They should make themselves attractive by doing good , which is appropriate for women who claim to honor God .
54002011	A wife should learn quietly with complete submission .
54002012	I don’t allow a wife to teach or to control her husband . Instead , she should be a quiet listener .
54002013	Adam was formed first , and then Eve .
54002014	Adam wasn’t deceived , but rather his wife became the one who stepped over the line because she was completely deceived .
54002015	But a wife will be brought safely through giving birth to their children , if they both continue in faith , love , and holiness , together with self-control .
54003001	This saying is reliable : if anyone has a goal to be a supervisor in the church , they want a good thing .
54003002	So the church’s supervisor must be without fault . They should be faithful to their spouse , sober , modest , and honest . They should show hospitality and be skilled at teaching .
54003003	They shouldn’t be addicted to alcohol or a bully . Instead , they should be gentle , peaceable , and not greedy .
54003004	They should manage their own household well — they should see that their children are obedient with complete respect ,
54003005	because if they don’t know how to manage their own household , how can they take care of God’s church ?
54003006	They shouldn’t be new believers so that they won’t become proud and fall under the devil’s spell .
54003007	They should also have a good reputation with those outside the church so that they won’t be embarrassed and fall into the devil’s trap .
54003008	In the same way , servants in the church should be dignified , not two-faced , heavy drinkers , or greedy for money .
54003009	They should hold on to the faith that has been revealed with a clear conscience .
54003010	They should also be tested and then serve if they are without fault .
54003011	In the same way , women who are servants in the church should be dignified and not gossip . They should be sober and faithful in everything they do .
54003012	Servants must be faithful to their spouse and manage their children and their own households well .
54003013	Those who have served well gain a good standing and considerable confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus .
54003014	I hope to come to you quickly . But I’m writing these things to you so that
54003015	if I’m delayed , you’ll know how you should behave in God’s household . It is the church of the living God and the backbone and support of the truth .
54003016	Without question , the mystery of godliness is great : he was revealed as a human , declared righteous by the Spirit , seen by angels , preached throughout the nations , believed in around the world , and taken up in glory .
54004001	The Spirit clearly says that in latter times some people will turn away from the faith . They will pay attention to spirits that deceive and to the teaching of demons .
54004002	They will be controlled by the pretense of lying , and their own consciences will be seared .
54004003	They will prohibit marriage and eating foods that God created — and he intended them to be accepted with thanksgiving by those who are faithful and have come to know the truth .
54004004	Everything that has been created by God is good , and nothing that is received with thanksgiving should be rejected .
54004005	These things are made holy by God’s word and prayer .
54004006	If you point these things out to the believers , you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus who has been trained by the words of faith and the good teaching that you’ve carefully followed .
54004007	But stay away from the godless myths that are passed down from the older women . Train yourself for a holy life !
54004008	While physical training has some value , training in holy living is useful for everything . It has promise for this life now and the life to come .
54004009	This saying is reliable and deserves complete acceptance .
54004010	We work and struggle for this : " Our hope is set on the living God , who is the savior of all people , especially those who believe . "
54004011	Command these things . Teach them .
54004012	Don’t let anyone look down on you because you are young . Instead , set an example for the believers through your speech , behavior , love , faith , and by being sexually pure .
54004013	Until I arrive , pay attention to public reading , preaching , and teaching .
54004014	Don’t neglect the spiritual gift in you that was given through prophecy when the elders laid hands on you .
54004015	Practice these things , and live by them so that your progress will be visible to all .
54004016	Focus on working on your own development and on what you teach . If you do this , you will save yourself and those who hear you .
54005001	Don’t correct an older man , but encourage him like he’s your father ; treat younger men like your brothers ,
54005002	treat older women like your mother , and treat younger women like your sisters with appropriate respect .
54005003	Take care of widows who are truly needy .
54005004	But if a particular widow has children or grandchildren , they should first learn to respect their own family and repay their parents , because this pleases God .
54005005	A widow who is truly needy and all alone puts her hope in God and keeps on going with requests and prayers , night and day .
54005006	But a widow who tries to live a life of luxury is dead even while she is alive .
54005007	Teach these things so that the families will be without fault .
54005008	But if someone doesn’t provide for their own family , and especially for a member of their household , they have denied the faith . They are worse than those who have no faith .
54005009	Put a widow on the list who is older than 60 years old and who was faithful to her husband .
54005010	She should have a reputation for doing good : raising children , providing hospitality to strangers , washing the feet of the saints , helping those in distress , and dedicating herself to every kind of good thing .
54005011	But don’t accept younger widows for the list . When their physical desires distract them from Christ , they will want to get married .
54005012	Then they will be judged for setting aside their earlier commitment .
54005013	Also , they learn to be lazy by going from house to house . They are not only lazy , but they also become gossips and busybodies , talking about things they shouldn’t .
54005014	So I want younger widows to marry , have children , and manage their homes so that they won’t give the enemy any reason to slander us . (
54005015	Some have already turned away to follow Satan . )
54005016	If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family , she should take care of them and not burden the church , so that it can help other widows who are truly needy .
54005017	Elders who lead well should be paid double , especially those who work with public speaking and teaching .
54005018	The scripture says , Don’t put a muzzle on an ox while it treads grain , and Workers deserve their pay .
54005019	Don’t accept an accusation made against an elder unless it is confirmed by two or three witnesses .
54005020	Discipline those who are sinning in front of everyone so that all the others will be afraid .
54005021	I charge you before God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels to follow these practices without bias , and without playing favorites .
54005022	Don’t rush to commission anyone to leadership , and don’t participate in the sins of others . Keep yourself morally pure .
54005023	Don’t drink water anymore , but use a little wine because of your stomach problems and your frequent illnesses .
54005024	The sins of some people are obvious , and the sins are judged before the people must face judgment , but the sins of other people show up later .
54005025	In the same way , the good that people do is also obvious and can’t be hidden .
54006001	Those who are under the bondage of slavery should consider their own masters as worthy of full respect so that God’s name and our teaching won’t get a bad reputation .
54006002	And those who have masters who are believers shouldn’t look down on them because they are brothers . Instead , they should serve them more faithfully , because the people who benefit from your good service are believers who are loved . Teach and encourage these things .
54006003	If anyone teaches anything different and doesn’t agree with sound teaching about our Lord Jesus Christ and teaching that is consistent with godliness ,
54006004	that person is conceited . They don’t understand anything but have a sick obsession with debates and arguments . This creates jealousy , conflict , verbal abuse , and evil suspicions .
54006005	There is constant bickering between people whose minds are ruined and who have been robbed of the truth . They think that godliness is a way to make money !
54006006	Actually , godliness is a great source of profit when it is combined with being happy with what you already have .
54006007	We didn’t bring anything into the world and so we can’t take anything out of it :
54006008	we’ll be happy with food and clothing .
54006009	But people who are trying to get rich fall into temptation . They are trapped by many stupid and harmful passions that plunge people into ruin and destruction .
54006010	The love of money is the root of all kinds of evil . Some have wandered away from the faith and have impaled themselves with a lot of pain because they made money their goal .
54006011	But as for you , man of God , run away from all these things . Instead , pursue righteousness , holy living , faithfulness , love , endurance , and gentleness .
54006012	Compete in the good fight of faith . Grab hold of eternal life — you were called to it , and you made a good confession of it in the presence of many witnesses .
54006013	I command you in the presence of God , who gives life to all things , and Christ Jesus , who made the good confession when testifying before Pontius Pilate .
54006014	Obey this order without fault or failure until the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ .
54006015	The timing of this appearance is revealed by God alone , who is the blessed and only master , the King of kings and Lord of lords .
54006016	He alone has immortality and lives in light that no one can come near . No human being has ever seen or is able to see him . Honor and eternal power belong to him . Amen .
54006017	Tell people who are rich at this time not to become egotistical and not to place their hope on their finances , which are uncertain . Instead , they need to hope in God , who richly provides everything for our enjoyment .
54006018	Tell them to do good , to be rich in the good things they do , to be generous , and to share with others .
54006019	When they do these things , they will save a treasure for themselves that is a good foundation for the future . That way they can take hold of what is truly life .
54006020	Timothy , protect what has been given to you in trust . Avoid godless and pointless discussions and the contradictory claims of so-called " knowledge . "
54006021	When some people adopted this false knowledge , they missed the goal of faith . May grace be with you all .
55001001	From Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus by God’s will , to promote the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus .
55001002	To Timothy , my dear child . Grace , mercy , and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord .
55001003	I’m grateful to God , whom I serve with a good conscience as my ancestors did . I constantly remember you in my prayers day and night .
55001004	When I remember your tears , I long to see you so that I can be filled with happiness .
55001005	I’m reminded of your authentic faith , which first lived in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice . I’m sure that this faith is also inside you .
55001006	Because of this , I’m reminding you to revive God’s gift that is in you through the laying on of my hands .
55001007	God didn’t give us a spirit that is timid but one that is powerful , loving , and self-controlled .
55001008	So don’t be ashamed of the testimony about the Lord or of me , his prisoner . Instead , share the suffering for the good news , depending on God’s power .
55001009	God is the one who saved and called us with a holy calling . This wasn’t based on what we have done , but it was based on his own purpose and grace that he gave us in Christ Jesus before time began .
55001010	Now his grace is revealed through the appearance of our savior , Christ Jesus . He destroyed death and brought life and immortality into clear focus through the good news .
55001011	I was appointed a messenger , apostle , and teacher of this good news .
55001012	This is also why I’m suffering the way I do , but I’m not ashamed . I know the one in whom I’ve placed my trust . I’m convinced that God is powerful enough to protect what he has placed in my trust until that day .
55001013	Hold on to the pattern of sound teaching that you heard from me with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus .
55001014	Protect this good thing that has been placed in your trust through the Holy Spirit who lives in us .
55001015	You know that everyone in Asia has turned away from me , including Phygelus and Hermogenes .
55001016	May the Lord show mercy to Onesiphorus’ household , because he supported me many times and he wasn’t ashamed of my imprisonment .
55001017	After I arrived in Rome , he quickly looked for me and found me .
55001018	May the Lord allow him to find his mercy on that day ( and you know very well how much he served me in Ephesus ) .
55002001	So , my child , draw your strength from the grace that is in Christ Jesus .
55002002	Take the things you heard me say in front of many other witnesses and pass them on to faithful people who are also capable of teaching others .
55002003	Accept your share of suffering like a good soldier of Christ Jesus .
55002004	Nobody who serves in the military gets tied up with civilian matters , so that they can please the one who recruited them .
55002005	Also in the same way , athletes don’t win unless they follow the rules .
55002006	A hardworking farmer should get the first share of the crop .
55002007	Think about what I’m saying ; the Lord will give you understanding about everything .
55002008	Remember Jesus Christ , who was raised from the dead and descended from David . This is my good news .
55002009	This is the reason I’m suffering to the point that I’m in prison like a common criminal . But God’s word cannot be imprisoned .
55002010	This is why I endure everything for the sake of those who are chosen by God so that they too may experience salvation in Christ Jesus with eternal glory .
55002011	This saying is reliable : " If we have died together , we will also live together .
55002013	If we are disloyal , he stays faithful " because he can’t be anything else than what he is .
55002014	Remind them of these things and warn them in the sight of God not to engage in battles over words that aren’t helpful and only destroy those who hear them .
55002015	Make an effort to present yourself to God as a tried-and-true worker , who doesn’t need to be ashamed but is one who interprets the message of truth correctly .
55002016	Avoid their godless discussions , because they will lead many people into ungodly behavior ,
55002017	and their ideas will spread like an infection . This includes Hymenaeus and Philetus ,
55002018	who have deviated from the truth by claiming that the resurrection has already happened . This has undermined some people’s faith .
55002019	God’s solid foundation is still standing with this sign : The Lord knows the people who belong to him , and Everyone who confesses the Lord’s name must avoid wickedness .
55002020	In a mansion , there aren’t just gold and silver bowls but also some bowls that are made of wood and clay . Some are meant for special uses , some for garbage .
55002021	So if anyone washes filth off themselves , they will be set apart as a " special bowl . " They will be useful to the owner of the mansion for every sort of good work .
55002022	Run away from adolescent cravings . Instead , pursue righteousness , faith , love , and peace together with those who confess the Lord with a clean heart .
55002023	Avoid foolish and thoughtless discussions , since you know that they produce conflicts .
55002024	God’s slave shouldn’t be argumentative but should be kind toward all people , able to teach , patient ,
55002025	and should correct opponents with gentleness . Perhaps God will change their mind and give them a knowledge of the truth .
55002026	They may come to their senses and escape from the devil’s trap that holds them captive to do his will .
55003001	Understand that the last days will be dangerous times .
55003002	People will be selfish and love money . They will be the kind of people who brag and who are proud . They will slander others , and they will be disobedient to their parents . They will be ungrateful , unholy ,
55003003	unloving , contrary , and critical . They will be without self-control and brutal , and they won’t love what is good .
55003004	They will be people who are disloyal , reckless , and conceited . They will love pleasure instead of loving God .
55003005	They will look like they are religious but deny God’s power . Avoid people like this .
55003006	Some will slither into households and control immature women who are burdened with sins and driven by all kinds of desires .
55003007	These women are always learning , but they can never arrive at an understanding of the truth .
55003008	These people oppose the truth in the same way that Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses . Their minds are corrupt and their faith is counterfeit .
55003009	But they won’t get very far . Their foolishness will become obvious to everyone like those others .
55003010	But you have paid attention to my teaching , conduct , purpose , faithfulness , patience , love , and endurance .
55003011	You have seen me experience physical abuse and ordeals in places such as Antioch , Iconium , and Lystra . I put up with all sorts of abuse , and the Lord rescued me from it all !
55003012	In fact , anyone who wants to live a holy life in Christ Jesus will be harassed .
55003013	But evil people and swindlers will grow even worse , as they deceive others while being deceived themselves .
55003014	But you must continue with the things you have learned and found convincing . You know who taught you .
55003015	Since childhood you have known the holy scriptures that help you to be wise in a way that leads to salvation through faith that is in Christ Jesus .
55003016	Every scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching , for showing mistakes , for correcting , and for training character ,
55003017	so that the person who belongs to God can be equipped to do everything that is good .
55004001	I’m giving you this commission in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus , who is coming to judge the living and the dead , and by his appearance and his kingdom .
55004002	Preach the word . Be ready to do it whether it is convenient or inconvenient . Correct , confront , and encourage with patience and instruction .
55004003	There will come a time when people will not tolerate sound teaching . They will collect teachers who say what they want to hear because they are self-centered .
55004004	They will turn their back on the truth and turn to myths .
55004005	But you must keep control of yourself in all circumstances . Endure suffering , do the work of a preacher of the good news , and carry out your service fully .
55004006	I’m already being poured out like a sacrifice to God , and the time of my death is near .
55004007	I have fought the good fight , finished the race , and kept the faith .
55004008	At last the champion’s wreath that is awarded for righteousness is waiting for me . The Lord , who is the righteous judge , is going to give it to me on that day . He’s giving it not only to me but also to all those who have set their heart on waiting for his appearance .
55004009	Do your best to come to me quickly .
55004010	Demas has fallen in love with the present world and has deserted me and has gone to Thessalonica . Crescens has gone to Galatia , and Titus has gone to Dalmatia .
55004011	Only Luke is with me . Get Mark , and bring him with you . He has been a big help to me in the ministry .
55004012	I sent Tychicus to Ephesus .
55004013	When you come , bring along the coat I left with Carpus in Troas . Also bring the scrolls and especially the parchments .
55004014	Alexander , the craftsman who works with metal , has really hurt me . The Lord will pay him back for what he has done .
55004015	But watch out for him , because he opposes our teaching .
55004016	No one took my side at my first court hearing . Everyone deserted me . I hope that God doesn’t hold it against them !
55004017	But the Lord stood by me and gave me strength , so that the entire message would be preached through me and so all the nations could hear it . I was also rescued from the lion’s mouth !
55004018	The Lord will rescue me from every evil action and will save me for his heavenly kingdom . To him be the glory forever and always . Amen .
55004019	Say hello to Prisca and Aquila and the household of Onesiphorus .
55004020	Erastus stayed in Corinth , and I left Trophimus in Miletus because of his illness .
55004021	Try hard to come to me before winter . Eubulus , Pudens , Linus , Claudia , and all the brothers and sisters say hello .
55004022	The Lord be with your spirit . Grace be with you all .
56001001	From Paul , a slave of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ . I’m sent to bring about the faith of God’s chosen people and a knowledge of the truth that agrees with godliness .
56001002	Their faith and this knowledge are based on the hope of eternal life that God , who doesn’t lie , promised before time began .
56001003	God revealed his message at the appropriate time through preaching , and I was trusted with preaching this message by the command of God our savior .
56001004	To Titus , my true child in a common faith . Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our savior .
56001005	The reason I left you behind in Crete was to organize whatever needs to be done and to appoint elders in each city , as I told you .
56001006	Elders should be without fault . They should be faithful to their spouse , and have faithful children who can’t be accused of self-indulgence or rebelliousness .
56001007	This is because supervisors should be without fault as God’s managers : they shouldn’t be stubborn , irritable , addicted to alcohol , a bully , or greedy .
56001008	Instead , they should show hospitality , love what is good , and be reasonable , ethical , godly , and self-controlled .
56001009	They must pay attention to the reliable message as it has been taught to them so that they can encourage people with healthy instruction and refute those who speak against it .
56001010	In fact , there are many who are rebellious people , loudmouths , and deceivers , especially some of those who are Jewish believers .
56001011	They must be silenced because they upset entire households . They teach what they shouldn’t to make money dishonestly .
56001012	Someone who is one of their own prophets said , " People from Crete are always liars , wild animals , and lazy gluttons . "
56001013	This statement is true . Because of this , correct them firmly , so that they can be healthy in their faith .
56001014	They shouldn’t pay attention to Jewish myths and commands from people who reject the truth .
56001015	Everything is clean to those who are clean , but nothing is clean to those who are corrupt and without faith . Instead , their mind and conscience are corrupted .
56001016	They claim to know God , but they deny God by the things that they do . They are detestable , disobedient , and disqualified to do anything good .
56002001	But you should talk in a way that is consistent with sound teaching .
56002002	Tell the older men to be sober , dignified , sensible , and healthy in respect to their faith , love , and patience .
56002003	Likewise , tell the older women to be reverent in their behavior , teaching what is good , rather than being gossips or addicted to heavy drinking .
56002004	That way they can mentor young women to love their husbands and children ,
56002005	and to be sensible , morally pure , working at home , kind and submissive to their own husbands , so that God’s word won’t be ridiculed .
56002006	Likewise , encourage the younger men to be sensible
56002007	in every way . Offer yourself as a role model of good actions . Show integrity , seriousness ,
56002008	and a sound message that is above criticism when you teach , so that any opponent will be ashamed because they won’t find anything bad to say about us .
56002009	Tell slaves to submit to their own masters and please them in everything they do . They shouldn’t talk back
56002010	or steal . Instead , they should show that they are completely reliable in everything so that they might make the teaching about God our savior attractive in every way .
56002011	The grace of God has appeared , bringing salvation to all people .
56002012	It educates us so that we can live sensible , ethical , and godly lives right now by rejecting ungodly lives and the desires of this world .
56002013	At the same time we wait for the blessed hope and the glorious appearance of our great God and savior Jesus Christ .
56002014	He gave himself for us in order to rescue us from every kind of lawless behavior , and cleanse a special people for himself who are eager to do good actions .
56002015	Talk about these things . Encourage and correct with complete authority . Don’t let anyone disrespect you .
56003001	Remind them to submit to rulers and authorities . They should be obedient and ready to do every good thing .
56003002	They shouldn’t speak disrespectfully about anyone , but they should be peaceful , kind , and show complete courtesy toward everyone .
56003003	We were once foolish , disobedient , deceived , and slaves to our desires and various pleasures too . We were spending our lives in evil behavior and jealousy . We were disgusting , and we hated other people .
56003004	But " when God our savior’s kindness and love appeared ,
56003005	he saved us because of his mercy , not because of righteous things we had done . He did it through the washing of new birth and the renewing by the Holy Spirit ,
56003006	which God poured out upon us generously through Jesus Christ our savior .
56003007	So , since we have been made righteous by his grace , we can inherit the hope for eternal life . "
56003008	This saying is reliable . And I want you to insist on these things , so that those who have come to believe in God might give careful attention to doing good . These things are good and useful for everyone .
56003009	Avoid stupid controversies , genealogies , and fights about the Law , because they are useless and worthless .
56003010	After a first and second warning , have nothing more to do with a person who causes conflict ,
56003011	because you know that someone like this is twisted and sinful — so they condemn themselves .
56003012	When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you , try to come to me in Nicopolis , because I’ve decided to spend the winter there .
56003013	Help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey with enthusiasm so that they won’t need anything .
56003014	But our people should also learn to devote themselves to doing good in order to meet pressing needs so they aren’t unproductive .
56003015	Everyone with me greets you ; greet those who love us faithfully . Grace be with all of you .
57001001	From Paul , who is a prisoner for the cause of Christ Jesus , and our brother Timothy . To Philemon our dearly loved coworker ,
57001002	Apphia our sister , Archippus our fellow soldier , and the church that meets in your house .
57001003	May the grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ be with you .
57001004	Philemon , I thank my God every time I mention you in my prayers
57001005	because I’ve heard of your love and faithfulness , which you have both for the Lord Jesus and for all God’s people .
57001006	I pray that your partnership in the faith might become effective by an understanding of all that is good among us in Christ .
57001007	I have great joy and encouragement because of your love , since the hearts of God’s people are refreshed by your actions , my brother .
57001008	Therefore , though I have enough confidence in Christ to command you to do the right thing ,
57001009	I would rather appeal to you through love . I , Paul — an old man , and now also a prisoner for Christ Jesus —
57001010	appeal to you for my child Onesimus . I became his father in the faith during my time in prison .
57001011	He was useless to you before , but now he is useful to both of us .
57001012	I’m sending him back to you , which is like sending you my own heart .
57001013	I considered keeping him with me so that he might serve me in your place during my time in prison because of the gospel .
57001014	However , I didn’t want to do anything without your consent so that your act of kindness would occur willingly and not under pressure .
57001015	Maybe this is the reason that Onesimus was separated from you for a while so that you might have him back forever —
57001016	no longer as a slave but more than a slave — that is , as a dearly loved brother . He is especially a dearly loved brother to me . How much more can he become a brother to you , personally and spiritually in the Lord !
57001017	So , if you really consider me a partner , welcome Onesimus as if you were welcoming me .
57001018	If he has harmed you in any way or owes you money , charge it to my account .
57001019	I , Paul , will pay it back to you ( I’m writing this with my own hand ) . Of course , I won’t mention that you owe me your life .
57001020	Yes , brother , I want this favor from you in the Lord ! Refresh my heart in Christ .
57001021	I’m writing to you , confident of your obedience and knowing that you will do more than what I ask .
57001022	Also , one more thing — prepare a guest room for me . I hope that I will be released from prison to be with you because of your prayers .
57001023	Epaphras , who is in prison with me for the cause of Christ Jesus , greets you ,
57001024	as well as my coworkers Mark , Aristarchus , Demas , and Luke .
57001025	May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit .
58001001	In the past , God spoke through the prophets to our ancestors in many times and many ways .
58001002	In these final days , though , he spoke to us through a Son . God made his Son the heir of everything and created the world through him .
58001003	The Son is the light of God’s glory and the imprint of God’s being . He maintains everything with his powerful message . After he carried out the cleansing of people from their sins , he sat down at the right side of the highest majesty .
58001004	And the Son became so much greater than the other messengers , such as angels , that he received a more important title than theirs .
58001005	After all , when did God ever say to any of the angels : You are my Son . Or , even , I will be his Father ,
58001006	But then , when he brought his firstborn into the world , he said , All of God’s angels must worship him .
58001007	He talks about the angels : He’s the one who uses the spirits for his messengers
58001008	But he says to his Son , God , your throne is forever
58001009	You loved righteousness and hated lawless behavior .
58001010	And he says , You , Lord , laid the earth’s foundations in the beginning ,
58001011	They will pass away , They will all wear out like old clothes . They will be changed like a person changes clothes ,
58001013	When has he ever said to any of the angels , Sit at my right side
58001014	Aren’t all the angels ministering spirits who are sent to serve those who are going to inherit salvation ?
58002001	This is why it’s necessary for us to pay more attention to what we have heard , or else we may drift away from it .
58002002	If the message that was spoken by angels was reliable , and every offense and act of disobedience received an appropriate consequence ,
58002003	how will we escape if we ignore such a great salvation ? It was first announced through the Lord , and then it was confirmed by those who heard him .
58002004	God also vouched for their message with signs , amazing things , various miracles , and gifts from the Holy Spirit , which were handed out the way he wanted .
58002005	God didn’t put the world that is coming ( the world we are talking about ) under the angels’ control .
58002006	Instead , someone declared somewhere , What is humanity that you think about them ?
58002007	For a while you made them lower than angels . When he puts everything under their control , he doesn’t leave anything out of control . But right now , we don’t see everything under their control yet .
58002009	However , we do see the one who was made lower in order than the angels for a little while — it’s Jesus ! He’s the one who is now crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of his death . He suffered death so that he could taste death for everyone through God’s grace .
58002010	It was appropriate for God , for whom and through whom everything exists , to use experiences of suffering to make perfect the pioneer of salvation . This salvation belongs to many sons and daughters whom he’s leading to glory .
58002011	This is because the one who makes people holy and the people who are being made holy all come from one source . That is why Jesus isn’t ashamed to call them brothers and sisters when he says ,
58002012	I will publicly announce your name to my brothers and sisters .
58002013	He also says , I will rely on him . And also , Here I am with the children whom God has given to me .
58002014	Therefore , since the children share in flesh and blood , he also shared the same things in the same way . He did this to destroy the one who holds the power over death — the devil — by dying .
58002015	He set free those who were held in slavery their entire lives by their fear of death .
58002016	Of course , he isn’t trying to help angels , but rather he’s helping Abraham’s descendants .
58002017	Therefore , he had to be made like his brothers and sisters in every way . This was so that he could become a merciful and faithful high priest in things relating to God , in order to wipe away the sins of the people .
58002018	He’s able to help those who are being tempted , since he himself experienced suffering when he was tempted .
58003001	Therefore , brothers and sisters who are partners in the heavenly calling , think about Jesus , the apostle and high priest of our confession .
58003002	Jesus was faithful to the one who appointed him just like Moses was faithful in God’s house .
58003003	But he deserves greater glory than Moses in the same way that the builder of the house deserves more honor than the house itself .
58003004	Every house is built by someone , but God is the builder of everything .
58003005	Moses was faithful in all God’s house as a servant in order to affirm the things that would be spoken later .
58003006	But Jesus was faithful over God’s house as a Son . We are his house if we hold on to the confidence and the pride that our hope gives us .
58003007	So , as the Holy Spirit says , Today , if you hear his voice ,
58003008	don’t have stubborn hearts
58003009	That is where your ancestors challenged and tested me ,
58003010	So I was angry with them . I said , " Their hearts always go off course ,
58003011	Because of my anger I swore :
58003012	Watch out , brothers and sisters , so that none of you have an evil , unfaithful heart that abandons the living God .
58003013	Instead , encourage each other every day , as long as it’s called " today , " so that none of you become insensitive to God because of sin’s deception .
58003014	We are partners with Christ , but only if we hold on to the confidence we had in the beginning until the end .
58003015	When it says , Today , if you hear his voice , don’t have stubborn hearts
58003016	Who was it who rebelled when they heard his voice ? Wasn’t it all of those who were brought out of Egypt by Moses ?
58003017	And with whom was God angry for forty years ? Wasn’t it with the ones who sinned , whose bodies fell in the desert ?
58003018	And against whom did he swear that they would never enter his rest , if not against the ones who were disobedient ?
58003019	We see that they couldn’t enter because of their lack of faith .
58004001	Therefore , since the promise that we can enter into rest is still open , let’s be careful so that none of you will appear to miss it .
58004002	We also had the good news preached to us , just as the Israelites did . However , the message they heard didn’t help them because they weren’t united in faith with the ones who listened to it .
58004003	We who have faith are entering the rest . As God said , And because of my anger I swore : And yet God’s works were completed at the foundation of the world .
58004004	Then somewhere he said this about the seventh day of creation : God rested on the seventh day from all his works .
58004005	But again , in the passage above , God said , They will never enter my rest !
58004006	Therefore , it’s left open for some to enter it , and the ones who had the good news preached to them before didn’t enter because of disobedience .
58004007	Just as it says in the passage above , God designates a certain day as " today , " when he says through David much later , Today , if you hear his voice ,
58004008	If Joshua gave the Israelites rest , God wouldn’t have spoken about another day later on .
58004009	So you see that a sabbath rest is left open for God’s people .
58004010	The one who entered God’s rest also rested from his works , just as God rested from his own .
58004011	Therefore , let’s make every effort to enter that rest so that no one will fall by following the same example of disobedience ,
58004012	because God’s word is living , active , and sharper than any two-edged sword . It penetrates to the point that it separates the soul from the spirit and the joints from the marrow . It’s able to judge the heart’s thoughts and intentions .
58004013	No creature is hidden from it , but rather everything is naked and exposed to the eyes of the one to whom we have to give an answer .
58004014	Also , let’s hold on to the confession since we have a great high priest who passed through the heavens , who is Jesus , God’s Son ;
58004015	because we don’t have a high priest who can’t sympathize with our weaknesses but instead one who was tempted in every way that we are , except without sin .
58004016	Finally , let’s draw near to the throne of favor with confidence so that we can receive mercy and find grace when we need help .
58005001	Every high priest is taken from the people and put in charge of things that relate to God for their sake , in order to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins .
58005002	The high priest is able to deal gently with the ignorant and those who are misled since he himself is prone to weakness .
58005003	Because of his weakness , he must offer sacrifices for his own sins as well as for the people .
58005004	No one takes this honor for themselves but takes it only when they are called by God , just like Aaron .
58005005	In the same way Christ also didn’t promote himself to become high priest . Instead , it was the one who said to him , You are my Son .
58005006	as he also says in another place , You are a priest forever ,
58005007	During his days on earth , Christ offered prayers and requests with loud cries and tears as his sacrifices to the one who was able to save him from death . He was heard because of his godly devotion .
58005008	Although he was a Son , he learned obedience from what he suffered .
58005009	After he had been made perfect , he became the source of eternal salvation for everyone who obeys him .
58005010	He was appointed by God to be a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek .
58005011	We have a lot to say about this topic , and it’s difficult to explain , because you have been lazy and you haven’t been listening .
58005012	Although you should have been teachers by now , you need someone to teach you an introduction to the basics about God’s message . You have come to the place where you need milk instead of solid food .
58005013	Everyone who lives on milk is not used to the word of righteousness , because they are babies .
58005014	But solid food is for the mature , whose senses are trained by practice to distinguish between good and evil .
58006001	So let’s press on to maturity , by moving on from the basics about Christ’s word . Let’s not lay a foundation of turning away from dead works , of faith in God ,
58006002	of teaching about ritual ways to wash with water , laying on of hands , the resurrection from the dead , and eternal judgment — all over again .
58006003	We’re going to press on , if God allows it .
58006004	Because it’s impossible to restore people to changed hearts and lives who turn away once they have seen the light , tasted the heavenly gift , become partners with the Holy Spirit ,
58006005	and tasted God’s good word and the powers of the coming age .
58006006	They are crucifying God’s Son all over again and exposing him to public shame .
58006007	The ground receives a blessing from God when it drinks up the rain that regularly comes and falls on it and yields useful plants for those who farm it .
58006008	But if it produces thorns and thistles , it’s useless and close to being cursed . It ends up being burned .
58006009	But we are convinced of better things in your case , brothers and sisters , even though we are talking this way — things that go together with salvation .
58006010	God isn’t unjust so that he forgets your efforts and the love you have shown for his name’s sake when you served and continue to serve God’s holy people .
58006011	But we desperately want each of you to show the same effort to make your hope sure until the end .
58006012	This is so you won’t be lazy but follow the example of the ones who inherit the promises through faith and patience .
58006013	When God gave Abraham his promise , he swore by himself since he couldn’t swear by anyone greater .
58006014	He said , I will certainly bless you and multiply your descendants .
58006015	So Abraham obtained the promise by showing patience .
58006016	People pledge by something greater than themselves . A solemn pledge guarantees what they say and shuts down any argument .
58006017	When God wanted to further demonstrate to the heirs of the promise that his purpose doesn’t change , he guaranteed it with a solemn pledge .
58006018	So these are two things that don’t change , because it’s impossible for God to lie . He did this so that we , who have taken refuge in him , can be encouraged to grasp the hope that is lying in front of us .
58006019	This hope , which is a safe and secure anchor for our whole being , enters the sanctuary behind the curtain .
58006020	That’s where Jesus went in advance and entered for us , since he became a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek .
58007001	This Melchizedek , who was king of Salem and priest of the Most High God , met Abraham as he returned from the defeat of the kings , and Melchizedek blessed him .
58007002	Abraham gave a tenth of everything to him . His name means first " king of righteousness , " and then " king of Salem , " that is , " king of peace . "
58007003	He is without father or mother or any family . He has no beginning or end of life , but he’s like God’s Son and remains a priest for all time .
58007004	See how great Melchizedek was ! Abraham , the father of the people , gave him a tenth of everything he captured .
58007005	The descendants of Levi who receive the office of priest have a commandment under the Law to collect a tenth of everything from the people who are their brothers and sisters , though they also are descended from Abraham .
58007006	But Melchizedek , who isn’t related to them , received a tenth of everything from Abraham and blessed the one who had received the promises .
58007007	Without question , the less important person is blessed by the more important person .
58007008	In addition , in one case a tenth is received by people who die , and in the other case , the tenth is received by someone who continues to live , according to the record .
58007009	It could be said that Levi , who received a tenth , paid a tenth through Abraham
58007010	because he was still in his ancestor’s body when Abraham paid the tenth to Melchizedek .
58007011	So if perfection came through the levitical office of priest ( for the people received the Law under the priests ) , why was there still a need to speak about raising up another priest according to the order of Melchizedek rather than one according to the order of Aaron ?
58007012	When the order of the priest changes , there has to be a change in the Law as well .
58007013	The person we are talking about belongs to another tribe , and no one ever served at the altar from that tribe .
58007014	It’s clear that our Lord came from the tribe of Judah , but Moses never said anything about priests from that tribe .
58007015	And it’s even clearer if another priest appears who is like Melchizedek .
58007016	He has become a priest by the power of a life that can’t be destroyed , rather than a legal requirement about physical descent .
58007017	This is confirmed : You are a priest forever ,
58007018	On the one hand , an earlier command is set aside because it was weak and useless
58007019	( because the Law made nothing perfect ) . On the other hand , a better hope is introduced , through which we draw near to God .
58007020	And this was not done without a solemn pledge ! The others have become priests without a solemn pledge ,
58007021	but this priest was affirmed with a solemn pledge by the one who said , The Lord has made a solemn pledge You are a priest forever .
58007022	As a result , Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant .
58007023	The others who became priests are numerous because death prevented them from continuing to serve .
58007024	In contrast , he holds the office of priest permanently because he continues to serve forever .
58007025	This is why he can completely save those who are approaching God through him , because he always lives to speak with God for them .
58007026	It’s appropriate for us to have this kind of high priest : holy , innocent , incorrupt , separate from sinners , and raised high above the heavens .
58007027	He doesn’t need to offer sacrifices every day like the other high priests , first for their own sins and then for the sins of the people . He did this once for all when he offered himself .
58007028	The Law appoints people who are prone to weakness as high priests , but the content of the solemn pledge , which came after the Law , appointed a Son who has been made perfect forever .
58008001	Now the main point of what we are saying is this : We have this kind of high priest . He sat down at the right side of the throne of the majesty in the heavens .
58008002	He’s serving as a priest in the holy place , which is the true meeting tent that God , not any human being , set up .
58008003	Every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices . So it’s necessary for this high priest also to have something to offer .
58008004	If he was located on earth , he wouldn’t be a priest because there are already others who offer gifts based on the Law .
58008005	They serve in a place that is a copy and shadow of the heavenly meeting tent . This is indicated when Moses was warned by God when he was about to set up the meeting tent : See that you follow the pattern that I showed you on the mountain in every detail .
58008006	But now , Jesus has received a superior priestly service just as he arranged a better covenant that is enacted with better promises .
58008007	If the first covenant had been without fault , it wouldn’t have made sense to expect a second .
58008008	But God did find fault with them , since he says , Look , the days are coming , says the Lord ,
58008009	It will not be like the covenant that I made with their ancestors on the day I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt ,
58008010	This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel I will place my laws in their minds , I will be their God , and they will be my people .
58008011	And each person won’t ever teach a neighbor or their brother or sister , saying , " Know the Lord , "
58008013	When it says new , it makes the first obsolete . And if something is old and outdated , it’s close to disappearing .
58009001	So then the first covenant had regulations for the priests’ service and the holy place on earth .
58009002	They pitched the first tent called the holy place . It contained the lampstand , the table , and the loaves of bread presented to God .
58009003	There was a tent behind the second curtain called the holy of holies .
58009004	It had the gold altar for incense and the chest containing the covenant , which was covered with gold on all sides . In the chest there was a gold jar containing manna , Aaron’s rod that budded , and the stone tablets of the covenant .
58009005	Above the chest there were magnificent winged creatures casting their shadow over the seat of the chest , where sin is taken care of . Right now we can’t talk about these things in detail .
58009006	When these things have been prepared in this way , priests enter the first tent all the time as they perform their service .
58009007	But only the high priest enters the second tent once a year . He never does this without blood , which he offers for himself and for the sins the people committed in ignorance .
58009008	With this , the Holy Spirit is showing that the way into the holy place hadn’t been revealed yet while the first tent was standing .
58009009	This is a symbol for the present time . It shows that the gifts and sacrifices that are being offered can’t perfect the conscience of the one who is serving .
58009010	These are superficial regulations that are only about food , drink , and various ritual ways to wash with water . They are regulations that have been imposed until the time of the new order .
58009011	But Christ has appeared as the high priest of the good things that have happened . He passed through the greater and more perfect meeting tent , which isn’t made by human hands ( that is , it’s not a part of this world ) .
58009012	He entered the holy of holies once for all by his own blood , not by the blood of goats or calves , securing our deliverance for all time .
58009013	If the blood of goats and bulls and the sprinkled ashes of cows made spiritually contaminated people holy and clean ,
58009014	how much more will the blood of Jesus wash our consciences clean from dead works in order to serve the living God ? He offered himself to God through the eternal Spirit as a sacrifice without any flaw .
58009015	This is why he’s the mediator of a new covenant ( which is a will ) : so that those who are called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance on the basis of his death . His death occurred to set them free from the offenses committed under the first covenant .
58009016	When there is a will , you need to confirm the death of the one who made the will .
58009017	This is because a will takes effect only after a death , since it’s not in force while the one who made the will is alive .
58009018	So not even the first covenant was put into effect without blood .
58009019	Moses took the blood of calves and goats , along with water , scarlet wool , and hyssop , and sprinkled both the Law scroll itself and all the people after he had proclaimed every command of the Law to all the people .
58009020	While he did it , he said , This is the blood of the covenant that God established for you .
58009021	And in the same way he sprinkled the meeting tent and also all the equipment that would be used in the priests’ service with blood .
58009022	Almost everything is cleansed by blood , according to the Law’s regulations , and there is no forgiveness without blood being shed .
58009023	So it was necessary for the copies of the heavenly things to be cleansed with these sacrifices , but the heavenly things had to be cleansed with better sacrifices than these .
58009024	Christ didn’t enter the holy place ( which is a copy of the true holy place ) made by human hands , but into heaven itself , so that he now appears in God’s presence for us .
58009025	He didn’t enter to offer himself over and over again , like the high priest enters the earthly holy place every year with blood that isn’t his .
58009026	If that were so , then Jesus would have to suffer many times since the foundation of the world . Instead , he has now appeared once at the end of the ages to get rid of sin by sacrificing himself .
58009027	People are destined to die once and then face judgment .
58009028	In the same way , Christ was also offered once to take on himself the sins of many people . He will appear a second time , not to take away sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him .
58010001	The Law is a shadow of the good things that are coming , not the real things themselves . It never can perfect the ones who are trying to draw near to God through the same sacrifices that are offered continually every year .
58010002	Otherwise , wouldn’t they have stopped being offered ? If the people carrying out their religious duties had been completely cleansed once , no one would have been aware of sin anymore .
58010003	Instead , these sacrifices are a reminder of sin every year ,
58010004	because it’s impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins .
58010005	Therefore , when he comes into the world he says , You didn’t want a sacrifice or an offering , but you prepared a body for me ;
58010006	you weren’t pleased with entirely burned offerings or a sin offering .
58010007	So then I said , " Look , I’ve come to do your will , God . This has been written about me in the scroll . "
58010008	He says above , You didn’t want and you weren’t pleased with a sacrifice or an offering or with entirely burned offerings or a purification offering , which are offered because the Law requires them .
58010009	Then he said , Look , I’ve come to do your will . He puts an end to the first to establish the second .
58010010	We have been made holy by God’s will through the offering of Jesus Christ’s body once for all .
58010011	Every priest stands every day serving and offering the same sacrifices over and over , sacrifices that can never take away sins .
58010012	But when this priest offered one sacrifice for sins for all time , he sat down at the right side of God .
58010013	Since then , he’s waiting until his enemies are made into a footstool for his feet ,
58010014	because he perfected the people who are being made holy with one offering for all time .
58010015	The Holy Spirit affirms this when saying ,
58010016	This is the covenant that I will make with them . After these days , says the Lord ,
58010017	And I won’t remember their sins
58010018	When there is forgiveness for these things , there is no longer an offering for sin .
58010019	Brothers and sisters , we have confidence that we can enter the holy of holies by means of Jesus’ blood ,
58010020	through a new and living way that he opened up for us through the curtain , which is his body ,
58010021	and we have a great high priest over God’s house .
58010022	Therefore , let’s draw near with a genuine heart with the certainty that our faith gives us , since our hearts are sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies are washed with pure water .
58010023	Let’s hold on to the confession of our hope without wavering , because the one who made the promises is reliable .
58010024	Let’s also think about how to motivate each other to show love and to do good works .
58010025	Don’t stop meeting together with other believers , which some people have gotten into the habit of doing . Instead , encourage each other , especially as you see the day drawing near .
58010026	If we make the decision to sin after we receive the knowledge of the truth , there isn’t a sacrifice for sins left any longer .
58010027	There’s only a scary expectation of judgment and of a burning fire that’s going to devour God’s opponents .
58010028	When someone rejected the Law from Moses , they were put to death without mercy on the basis of the testimony of two or three witnesses .
58010029	How much worse punishment do you think is deserved by the person who walks all over God’s Son , who acts as if the blood of the covenant that made us holy is just ordinary blood , and who insults the Spirit of grace ?
58010030	We know the one who said , Judgment is mine ; I will pay people back . And he also said , The Lord will judge his people .
58010031	It’s scary to fall into the hands of the living God !
58010032	But remember the earlier days , after you saw the light . You stood your ground while you were suffering from an enormous amount of pressure .
58010033	Sometimes you were exposed to insults and abuse in public . Other times you became partners with those who were treated that way .
58010034	You even showed sympathy toward people in prison and accepted the confiscation of your possessions with joy , since you knew that you had better and lasting possessions .
58010035	So don’t throw away your confidence — it brings a great reward .
58010036	You need to endure so that you can receive the promises after you do God’s will .
58010037	In a little while longer , the one who is coming will come and won’t delay ;
58010038	but my righteous one will live by faith , and my whole being won’t be pleased with anyone who shrinks back .
58010039	But we aren’t the sort of people who timidly draw back and end up being destroyed . We’re the sort of people who have faith so that our whole beings are preserved .
58011001	Faith is the reality of what we hope for , the proof of what we don’t see .
58011002	The elders in the past were approved because they showed faith .
58011003	By faith we understand that the universe has been created by a word from God so that the visible came into existence from the invisible .
58011004	By faith Abel offered a better sacrifice to God than Cain , which showed that he was righteous , since God gave approval to him for his gift . Though he died , he’s still speaking through faith .
58011005	By faith Enoch was taken up so that he didn’t see death , and he wasn’t found because God took him up . He was given approval for having pleased God before he was taken up .
58011006	It’s impossible to please God without faith because the one who draws near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards people who try to find him .
58011007	By faith Noah responded with godly fear when he was warned about events he hadn’t seen yet . He built an ark to deliver his household . With his faith , he criticized the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes from faith .
58011008	By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place that he was going to receive as an inheritance . He went out without knowing where he was going .
58011009	By faith he lived in the land he had been promised as a stranger . He lived in tents along with Isaac and Jacob , who were coheirs of the same promise .
58011010	He was looking forward to a city that has foundations , whose architect and builder is God .
58011011	By faith even Sarah received the ability to have a child , though she herself was barren and past the age for having children , because she believed that the one who promised was faithful .
58011012	So descendants were born from one man ( and he was as good as dead ) . They were as many as the number of the stars in the sky and as countless as the grains of sand on the seashore .
58011013	All of these people died in faith without receiving the promises , but they saw the promises from a distance and welcomed them . They confessed that they were strangers and immigrants on earth .
58011014	People who say this kind of thing make it clear that they are looking for a homeland .
58011015	If they had been thinking about the country that they had left , they would have had the opportunity to return to it .
58011016	But at this point in time , they are longing for a better country , that is , a heavenly one . Therefore , God isn’t ashamed to be called their God — he has prepared a city for them .
58011017	By faith Abraham offered Isaac when he was tested . The one who received the promises was offering his only son .
58011018	He had been told concerning him , Your legitimate descendants will come from Isaac .
58011019	He figured that God could even raise him from the dead . So in a way he did receive him back from the dead .
58011020	By faith Isaac also blessed Jacob and Esau concerning their future .
58011021	By faith Jacob blessed each of Joseph’s sons as he was dying and bowed in worship over the head of his staff .
58011022	By faith Joseph recalled the exodus of the Israelites at the end of his life , and gave instructions about burying his bones .
58011023	By faith Moses was hidden by his parents for three months when he was born , because they saw that the child was beautiful and they weren’t afraid of the king’s orders .
58011024	By faith Moses refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter when he was grown up .
58011025	He chose to be mistreated with God’s people instead of having the temporary pleasures of sin .
58011026	He thought that the abuses he suffered for Christ were more valuable than the treasures of Egypt , since he was looking forward to the reward .
58011027	By faith he left Egypt without being afraid of the king’s anger . He kept on going as if he could see what is invisible .
58011028	By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood , in order that the destroyer could not touch their firstborn children .
58011029	By faith they crossed the Red Sea as if they were on dry land , but when the Egyptians tried it , they were drowned .
58011030	By faith Jericho’s walls fell after the people marched around them for seven days .
58011031	By faith Rahab the prostitute wasn’t killed with the disobedient because she welcomed the spies in peace .
58011032	What more can I say ? I would run out of time if I told you about Gideon , Barak , Samson , Jephthah , David , Samuel , and the prophets .
58011033	Through faith they conquered kingdoms , brought about justice , realized promises , shut the mouths of lions ,
58011034	put out raging fires , escaped from the edge of the sword , found strength in weakness , were mighty in war , and routed foreign armies .
58011035	Women received back their dead by resurrection . Others were tortured and refused to be released so they could gain a better resurrection .
58011036	But others experienced public shame by being taunted and whipped ; they were even put in chains and in prison .
58011037	They were stoned to death , they were cut in two , and they died by being murdered with swords . They went around wearing the skins of sheep and goats , needy , oppressed , and mistreated .
58011038	The world didn’t deserve them . They wandered around in deserts , mountains , caves , and holes in the ground .
58011039	All these people didn’t receive what was promised , though they were given approval for their faith .
58011040	God provided something better for us so they wouldn’t be made perfect without us .
58012001	So then let’s also run the race that is laid out in front of us , since we have such a great cloud of witnesses surrounding us . Let’s throw off any extra baggage , get rid of the sin that trips us up ,
58012002	and fix our eyes on Jesus , faith’s pioneer and perfecter . He endured the cross , ignoring the shame , for the sake of the joy that was laid out in front of him , and sat down at the right side of God’s throne .
58012003	Think about the one who endured such opposition from sinners so that you won’t be discouraged and you won’t give up .
58012004	In your struggle against sin , you haven’t resisted yet to the point of shedding blood ,
58012005	and you have forgotten the encouragement that addresses you as sons and daughters : My child , don’t make light of the Lord’s discipline or give up when you are corrected by him ,
58012006	because the Lord disciplines whomever he loves ,
58012007	Bear hardship for the sake of discipline . God is treating you like sons and daughters ! What child isn’t disciplined by his or her father ?
58012008	But if you don’t experience discipline , which happens to all children , then you are illegitimate and not real sons and daughters .
58012009	What’s more , we had human parents who disciplined us , and we respected them for it . How much more should we submit to the Father of spirits and live ?
58012010	Our human parents disciplined us for a little while , as it seemed best to them , but God does it for our benefit so that we can share his holiness .
58012011	No discipline is fun while it lasts , but it seems painful at the time . Later , however , it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness for those who have been trained by it .
58012012	So strengthen your drooping hands and weak knees !
58012013	Make straight paths for your feet so that if any part is lame , it will be healed rather than injured more seriously .
58012014	Pursue the goal of peace along with everyone — and holiness as well , because no one will see the Lord without it .
58012015	Make sure that no one misses out on God’s grace . Make sure that no root of bitterness grows up that might cause trouble and pollute many people .
58012016	Make sure that no one becomes sexually immoral or ungodly like Esau . He sold his inheritance as the oldest son for one meal .
58012017	You know that afterward , when he wanted to inherit the blessing , he was rejected because he couldn’t find a way to change his heart and life , though he looked for it with tears .
58012018	You haven’t drawn near to something that can be touched : a burning fire , darkness , shadow , a whirlwind ,
58012019	a blast of a trumpet , and a sound of words that made the ones who heard it beg that there wouldn’t be one more word .
58012020	They couldn’t stand the command , If even a wild animal touches the mountain , it must be stoned .
58012021	The sight was so frightening that Moses said , " I’m terrified and shaking ! "
58012022	But you have drawn near to Mount Zion , the city of the living God , heavenly Jerusalem , to countless angels in a festival gathering ,
58012023	to the assembly of God’s firstborn children who are registered in heaven , to God the judge of all , to the spirits of the righteous who have been made perfect ,
58012024	to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant , and to the sprinkled blood that speaks better than Abel’s blood .
58012025	See to it that you don’t resist the one who is speaking . If the people didn’t escape when they refused to listen to the one who warned them on earth , how will we escape if we reject the one who is warning from heaven ?
58012026	His voice shook the earth then , but now he has made a promise : Still once more I will shake not only the earth but heaven also .
58012027	The words " still once more " reveal the removal of what is shaken — the things that are part of this creation — so that what isn’t shaken will remain .
58012028	Therefore , since we are receiving a kingdom that can’t be shaken , let’s continue to express our gratitude . With this gratitude , let’s serve in a way that is pleasing to God with respect and awe ,
58012029	because our God really is a consuming fire .
58013001	Keep loving each other like family .
58013002	Don’t neglect to open up your homes to guests , because by doing this some have been hosts to angels without knowing it .
58013003	Remember prisoners as if you were in prison with them , and people who are mistreated as if you were in their place .
58013004	Marriage must be honored in every respect , with no cheating on the relationship , because God will judge the sexually immoral person and the person who commits adultery .
58013005	Your way of life should be free from the love of money , and you should be content with what you have . After all , he has said , I will never leave you or abandon you .
58013006	This is why we can confidently say , The Lord is my helper , and I won’t be afraid . What can people do to me ?
58013007	Remember your leaders who spoke God’s word to you . Imitate their faith as you consider the way their lives turned out .
58013008	Jesus Christ is the same yesterday , today , and forever !
58013009	Don’t be misled by the many strange teachings out there . It’s a good thing for the heart to be strengthened by grace rather than by food . Food doesn’t help those who live in this context .
58013010	We have an altar , and those who serve as priests in the meeting tent don’t have the right to eat from it .
58013011	The blood of the animals is carried into the holy of holies by the high priest as an offering for sin , and their bodies are burned outside the camp .
58013012	And so Jesus also suffered outside the city gate to make the people holy with his own blood .
58013013	So now , let’s go to him outside the camp , bearing his shame .
58013014	We don’t have a permanent city here , but rather we are looking for the city that is still to come .
58013015	So let’s continually offer up a sacrifice of praise through him , which is the fruit from our lips that confess his name .
58013016	Don’t forget to do good and to share what you have because God is pleased with these kinds of sacrifices .
58013017	Rely on your leaders and defer to them , because they watch over your whole being as people who are going to be held responsible for you . They need to be able to do this with pleasure and not with complaints about you , because that wouldn’t help you .
58013018	Pray for us . We’re sure that we have a good conscience , and we want to do the right thing in every way .
58013019	I’m particularly asking you to do this so that I can be returned to you quickly .
58013020	May the God of peace ,
58013021	equip you with every good thing to do his will , To him be the glory forever and always . Amen .
58013022	I urge you , brothers and sisters , to put up with this message of encouragement , since I’ve only written a short letter to you !
58013023	You should know that our brother Timothy has been set free . If he comes soon , we will travel together to see you .
58013024	Greet your leaders and all of God’s holy people . The group from Italy greets you .
58013025	May grace be with all of you .
59001001	From James , a slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ . To the twelve tribes who are scattered outside the land of Israel . Greetings !
59001002	My brothers and sisters , think of the various tests you encounter as occasions for joy .
59001003	After all , you know that the testing of your faith produces endurance .
59001004	Let this endurance complete its work so that you may be fully mature , complete , and lacking in nothing .
59001005	But anyone who needs wisdom should ask God , whose very nature is to give to everyone without a second thought , without keeping score . Wisdom will certainly be given to those who ask .
59001006	Whoever asks shouldn’t hesitate . They should ask in faith , without doubting . Whoever doubts is like the surf of the sea , tossed and turned by the wind .
59001007	People like that should never imagine that they will receive anything from the Lord .
59001008	They are double-minded , unstable in all their ways .
59001009	Brothers and sisters who are poor should find satisfaction in their high status .
59001010	Those who are wealthy should find satisfaction in their low status , because they will die off like wildflowers .
59001011	The sun rises with its scorching heat and dries up the grass so that its flowers fall and its beauty is lost . Just like that , in the midst of their daily lives , the wealthy will waste away .
59001012	Those who stand firm during testing are blessed . They are tried and true . They will receive the life God has promised to those who love him as their reward .
59001013	No one who is tested should say , " God is tempting me ! " This is because God is not tempted by any form of evil , nor does he tempt anyone .
59001014	Everyone is tempted by their own cravings ; they are lured away and enticed by them .
59001015	Once those cravings conceive , they give birth to sin ; and when sin grows up , it gives birth to death .
59001016	Don’t be misled , my dear brothers and sisters .
59001017	Every good gift , every perfect gift , comes from above . These gifts come down from the Father , the creator of the heavenly lights , in whose character there is no change at all .
59001018	He chose to give us birth by his true word , and here is the result : we are like the first crop from the harvest of everything he created .
59001019	Know this , my dear brothers and sisters : everyone should be quick to listen , slow to speak , and slow to grow angry .
59001020	This is because an angry person doesn’t produce God’s righteousness .
59001021	Therefore , with humility , set aside all moral filth and the growth of wickedness , and welcome the word planted deep inside you — the very word that is able to save you .
59001022	You must be doers of the word and not only hearers who mislead themselves .
59001023	Those who hear but don’t do the word are like those who look at their faces in a mirror .
59001024	They look at themselves , walk away , and immediately forget what they were like .
59001025	But there are those who study the perfect law , the law of freedom , and continue to do it . They don’t listen and then forget , but they put it into practice in their lives . They will be blessed in whatever they do .
59001026	If those who claim devotion to God don’t control what they say , they mislead themselves . Their devotion is worthless .
59001027	True devotion , the kind that is pure and faultless before God the Father , is this : to care for orphans and widows in their difficulties and to keep the world from contaminating us .
59002001	My brothers and sisters , when you show favoritism you deny the faithfulness of our Lord Jesus Christ , who has been resurrected in glory .
59002002	Imagine two people coming into your meeting . One has a gold ring and fine clothes , while the other is poor , dressed in filthy rags .
59002003	Then suppose that you were to take special notice of the one wearing fine clothes , saying , " Here’s an excellent place . Sit here . " But to the poor person you say , " Stand over there " ; or , " Here , sit at my feet . "
59002004	Wouldn’t you have shown favoritism among yourselves and become evil-minded judges ?
59002005	My dear brothers and sisters , listen ! Hasn’t God chosen those who are poor by worldly standards to be rich in terms of faith ? Hasn’t God chosen the poor as heirs of the kingdom he has promised to those who love him ?
59002006	But you have dishonored the poor . Don’t the wealthy make life difficult for you ? Aren’t they the ones who drag you into court ?
59002007	Aren’t they the ones who insult the good name spoken over you at your baptism ?
59002008	You do well when you really fulfill the royal law found in scripture , Love your neighbor as yourself .
59002009	But when you show favoritism , you are committing a sin , and by that same law you are exposed as a lawbreaker .
59002010	Anyone who tries to keep all of the Law but fails at one point is guilty of failing to keep all of it .
59002011	The one who said , Don’t commit adultery , also said , Don’t commit murder . So if you don’t commit adultery but do commit murder , you are a lawbreaker .
59002012	In every way , then , speak and act as people who will be judged by the law of freedom .
59002013	There will be no mercy in judgment for anyone who hasn’t shown mercy . Mercy overrules judgment .
59002014	My brothers and sisters , what good is it if people say they have faith but do nothing to show it ? Claiming to have faith can’t save anyone , can it ?
59002015	Imagine a brother or sister who is naked and never has enough food to eat .
59002016	What if one of you said , " Go in peace ! Stay warm ! Have a nice meal ! " ? What good is it if you don’t actually give them what their body needs ?
59002017	In the same way , faith is dead when it doesn’t result in faithful activity .
59002018	Someone might claim , " You have faith and I have action . " But how can I see your faith apart from your actions ? Instead , I’ll show you my faith by putting it into practice in faithful action .
59002019	It’s good that you believe that God is one . Ha ! Even the demons believe this , and they tremble with fear .
59002020	Are you so slow ? Do you need to be shown that faith without actions has no value at all ?
59002021	What about Abraham , our father ? Wasn’t he shown to be righteous through his actions when he offered his son Isaac on the altar ?
59002022	See , his faith was at work along with his actions . In fact , his faith was made complete by his faithful actions .
59002023	So the scripture was fulfilled that says , Abraham believed God , and God regarded him as righteous . What is more , Abraham was called God’s friend .
59002024	So you see that a person is shown to be righteous through faithful actions and not through faith alone .
59002025	In the same way , wasn’t Rahab the prostitute shown to be righteous when she received the messengers as her guests and then sent them on by another road ?
59002026	As the lifeless body is dead , so faith without actions is dead .
59003001	My brothers and sisters , not many of you should become teachers , because we know that we teachers will be judged more strictly .
59003002	We all make mistakes often , but those who don’t make mistakes with their words have reached full maturity . Like a bridled horse , they can control themselves entirely .
59003003	When we bridle horses and put bits in their mouths to lead them wherever we want , we can control their whole bodies .
59003004	Consider ships : they are so large that strong winds are needed to drive them . But pilots direct their ships wherever they want with a little rudder .
59003005	In the same way , even though the tongue is a small part of the body , it boasts wildly . Think about this : a small flame can set a whole forest on fire .
59003006	The tongue is a small flame of fire , a world of evil at work in us . It contaminates our entire lives . Because of it , the circle of life is set on fire . The tongue itself is set on fire by the flames of hell .
59003007	People can tame and already have tamed every kind of animal , bird , reptile , and fish .
59003008	No one can tame the tongue , though . It is a restless evil , full of deadly poison .
59003009	With it we both bless the Lord and Father and curse human beings made in God’s likeness .
59003010	Blessing and cursing come from the same mouth . My brothers and sisters , it just shouldn’t be this way !
59003011	Both fresh water and salt water don’t come from the same spring , do they ?
59003012	My brothers and sisters , can a fig tree produce olives ? Can a grapevine produce figs ? Of course not , and fresh water doesn’t flow from a saltwater spring either .
59003013	Are any of you wise and understanding ? Show that your actions are good with a humble lifestyle that comes from wisdom .
59003014	However , if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart , then stop bragging and living in ways that deny the truth .
59003015	This is not the wisdom that comes down from above . Instead , it is from the earth , natural and demonic .
59003016	Wherever there is jealousy and selfish ambition , there is disorder and everything that is evil .
59003017	What of the wisdom from above ? First , it is pure , and then peaceful , gentle , obedient , filled with mercy and good actions , fair , and genuine .
59003018	Those who make peace sow the seeds of justice by their peaceful acts .
59004001	What is the source of conflict among you ? What is the source of your disputes ? Don’t they come from your cravings that are at war in your own lives ?
59004002	You long for something you don’t have , so you commit murder . You are jealous for something you can’t get , so you struggle and fight . You don’t have because you don’t ask .
59004003	You ask and don’t have because you ask with evil intentions , to waste it on your own cravings .
59004004	You unfaithful people ! Don’t you know that friendship with the world makes you an enemy of God ?
59004005	Or do you suppose that scripture is meaningless ? Doesn’t God long for our faithfulness in the life he has given to us ?
59004006	But he gives us more grace . This is why it says , God stands against the proud , but favors the humble .
59004007	Therefore , submit to God . Resist the devil , and he will run away from you .
59004008	Come near to God , and he will come near to you . Wash your hands , you sinners . Purify your hearts , you double-minded .
59004009	Cry out in sorrow , mourn , and weep ! Let your laughter become mourning and your joy become sadness .
59004010	Humble yourselves before the Lord , and he will lift you up .
59004011	Brothers and sisters , don’t say evil things about each other . Whoever insults or criticizes a brother or sister insults and criticizes the Law . If you find fault with the Law , you are not a doer of the Law but a judge over it .
59004012	There is only one lawgiver and judge , and he is able to save and to destroy . But you who judge your neighbor , who are you ?
59004013	Pay attention , you who say , " Today or tomorrow we will go to such-and-such a town . We will stay there a year , buying and selling , and making a profit . "
59004014	You don’t really know about tomorrow . What is your life ? You are a mist that appears for only a short while before it vanishes .
59004015	Here’s what you ought to say : " If the Lord wills , we will live and do this or that . "
59004016	But now you boast and brag , and all such boasting is evil .
59004017	It is a sin when someone knows the right thing to do and doesn’t do it .
59005001	Pay attention , you wealthy people ! Weep and moan over the miseries coming upon you .
59005002	Your riches have rotted . Moths have destroyed your clothes .
59005003	Your gold and silver have rusted , and their rust will be evidence against you . It will eat your flesh like fire . Consider the treasure you have hoarded in the last days .
59005004	Listen ! Hear the cries of the wages of your field hands . These are the wages you stole from those who harvested your fields . The cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of heavenly forces .
59005005	You have lived a self-satisfying life on this earth , a life of luxury . You have stuffed your hearts in preparation for the day of slaughter .
59005006	You have condemned and murdered the righteous one , who doesn’t oppose you .
59005007	Therefore , brothers and sisters , you must be patient as you wait for the coming of the Lord . Consider the farmer who waits patiently for the coming of rain in the fall and spring , looking forward to the precious fruit of the earth .
59005008	You also must wait patiently , strengthening your resolve , because the coming of the Lord is near .
59005009	Don’t complain about each other , brothers and sisters , so that you won’t be judged . Look ! The judge is standing at the door !
59005010	Brothers and sisters , take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord as an example of patient resolve and steadfastness .
59005011	Look at how we honor those who have practiced endurance . You have heard of the endurance of Job . And you have seen what the Lord has accomplished , for the Lord is full of compassion and mercy .
59005012	Most important , my brothers and sisters , never make a solemn pledge — neither by heaven nor earth , nor by anything else . Instead , speak with a simple " Yes " or " No , " or else you may fall under judgment .
59005013	If any of you are suffering , they should pray . If any of you are happy , they should sing .
59005014	If any of you are sick , they should call for the elders of the church , and the elders should pray over them , anointing them with oil in the name of the Lord .
59005015	Prayer that comes from faith will heal the sick , for the Lord will restore them to health . And if they have sinned , they will be forgiven .
59005016	For this reason , confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed . The prayer of the righteous person is powerful in what it can achieve .
59005017	Elijah was a person just like us . When he earnestly prayed that it wouldn’t rain , no rain fell for three and a half years .
59005018	He prayed again , God sent rain , and the earth produced its fruit .
59005019	My brothers and sisters , if any of you wander from the truth and someone turns back the wanderer ,
59005020	recognize that whoever brings a sinner back from the wrong path will save them from death and will bring about the forgiveness of many sins .
60001001	Peter , an apostle of Jesus Christ , To God’s chosen strangers in the world of the diaspora , who live in Pontus , Galatia , Cappadocia , Asia , and Bithynia .
60001002	God the Father chose you because of what he knew beforehand . He chose you through the Holy Spirit’s work of making you holy and because of the faithful obedience and sacrifice of Jesus Christ . May God’s grace and peace be multiplied to you .
60001003	May the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ be blessed ! On account of his vast mercy , he has given us new birth . You have been born anew into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead .
60001004	You have a pure and enduring inheritance that cannot perish — an inheritance that is presently kept safe in heaven for you .
60001005	Through his faithfulness , you are guarded by God’s power so that you can receive the salvation he is ready to reveal in the last time .
60001006	You now rejoice in this hope , even if it’s necessary for you to be distressed for a short time by various trials .
60001007	This is necessary so that your faith may be found genuine . ( Your faith is more valuable than gold , which will be destroyed even though it is itself tested by fire . ) Your genuine faith will result in praise , glory , and honor for you when Jesus Christ is revealed .
60001008	Although you’ve never seen him , you love him . Even though you don’t see him now , you trust him and so rejoice with a glorious joy that is too much for words .
60001009	You are receiving the goal of your faith : your salvation .
60001010	The prophets , who long ago foretold the grace that you’ve received , searched and explored , inquiring carefully about this salvation .
60001011	They wondered what the Spirit of Christ within them was saying when he bore witness beforehand about the suffering that would happen to Christ and the glory that would follow . They wondered what sort of person or what sort of time they were speaking about .
60001012	It was revealed to them that in their search they were not serving themselves but you . These things , which even angels long to examine , have now been proclaimed to you by those who brought you the good news . They did this in the power of the Holy Spirit , who was sent from heaven .
60001013	Therefore , once you have your minds ready for action and you are thinking clearly , place your hope completely on the grace that will be brought to you when Jesus Christ is revealed .
60001014	Don’t be conformed to your former desires , those that shaped you when you were ignorant . But , as obedient children ,
60001015	you must be holy in every aspect of your lives , just as the one who called you is holy .
60001016	It is written , You will be holy , because I am holy .
60001017	Since you call upon a Father who judges all people according to their actions without favoritism , you should conduct yourselves with reverence during the time of your dwelling in a strange land .
60001018	Live in this way , knowing that you were not liberated by perishable things like silver or gold from the empty lifestyle you inherited from your ancestors .
60001019	Instead , you were liberated by the precious blood of Christ , like that of a flawless , spotless lamb .
60001020	Christ was chosen before the creation of the world , but was only revealed at the end of time . This was done for you ,
60001021	who through Christ are faithful to the God who raised him from the dead and gave him glory . So now , your faith and hope should rest in God .
60001022	As you set yourselves apart by your obedience to the truth so that you might have genuine affection for your fellow believers , love each other deeply and earnestly .
60001023	Do this because you have been given new birth — not from the type of seed that decays but from seed that doesn’t . This seed is God’s life-giving and enduring word .
60001024	Thus , All human life on the earth is like grass , and all human glory is like a flower in a field . The grass dries up and its flower falls off , This is the word that was proclaimed to you as good news .
60002001	Therefore , get rid of all ill will and all deceit , pretense , envy , and slander .
60002002	Instead , like a newborn baby , desire the pure milk of the word . Nourished by it , you will grow into salvation ,
60002003	since you have tasted that the Lord is good .
60002004	Now you are coming to him as to a living stone . Even though this stone was rejected by humans , from God’s perspective it is chosen , valuable .
60002005	You yourselves are being built like living stones into a spiritual temple . You are being made into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices that are acceptable to God through Jesus Christ .
60002006	Thus it is written in scripture , Look ! I am laying a cornerstone in Zion , chosen , valuable . The person who believes in him will never be shamed .
60002007	So God honors you who believe . For those who refuse to believe , though , the stone the builders tossed aside has become the capstone .
60002008	This is a stone that makes people stumble and a rock that makes them fall . Because they refuse to believe in the word , they stumble . Indeed , this is the end to which they were appointed .
60002009	But you are a chosen race , a royal priesthood , a holy nation , a people who are God’s own possession . You have become this people so that you may speak of the wonderful acts of the one who called you out of darkness into his amazing light .
60002010	Once you weren’t a people , but now you are God’s people . Once you hadn’t received mercy , but now you have received mercy .
60002011	Dear friends , since you are immigrants and strangers in the world , I urge that you avoid worldly desires that wage war against your lives .
60002012	Live honorably among the unbelievers . Today , they defame you , as if you were doing evil . But in the day when God visits to judge they will glorify him , because they have observed your honorable deeds .
60002013	For the sake of the Lord submit to every human institution . Do this whether it means submitting to the emperor as supreme ruler ,
60002014	or to governors as those sent by the emperor . They are sent to punish those doing evil and to praise those doing good .
60002015	Submit to them because it’s God’s will that by doing good you will silence the ignorant talk of foolish people .
60002016	Do this as God’s slaves , and yet also as free people , not using your freedom as a cover-up for evil .
60002017	Honor everyone . Love the family of believers . Have respectful fear of God . Honor the emperor .
60002018	Household slaves , submit by accepting the authority of your masters with all respect . Do this not only to good and kind masters but also to those who are harsh .
60002019	Now , it is commendable if , because of one’s understanding of God , someone should endure pain through suffering unjustly .
60002020	But what praise comes from enduring patiently when you have sinned and are beaten for it ? But if you endure steadfastly when you’ve done good and suffer for it , this is commendable before God .
60002021	You were called to this kind of endurance , because Christ suffered on your behalf . He left you an example so that you might follow in his footsteps .
60002022	He committed no sin , nor did he ever speak in ways meant to deceive .
60002023	When he was insulted , he did not reply with insults . When he suffered , he did not threaten revenge . Instead , he entrusted himself to the one who judges justly .
60002024	He carried in his own body on the cross the sins we committed . He did this so that we might live in righteousness , having nothing to do with sin . By his wounds you were healed .
60002025	Though you were like straying sheep , you have now returned to the shepherd and guardian of your lives .
60003001	Wives , likewise , submit to your own husbands . Do this so that even if some of them refuse to believe the word , they may be won without a word by their wives’ way of life .
60003002	After all , they will have observed the reverent and holy manner of your lives .
60003003	Don’t try to make yourselves beautiful on the outside , with stylish hair or by wearing gold jewelry or fine clothes .
60003004	Instead , make yourselves beautiful on the inside , in your hearts , with the enduring quality of a gentle , peaceful spirit . This type of beauty is very precious in God’s eyes .
60003005	For it was in this way that holy women who trusted in God used to make themselves beautiful , accepting the authority of their own husbands .
60003006	For example , Sarah accepted Abraham’s authority when she called him master . You have become her children when you do good and don’t respond to threats with fear .
60003007	Husbands , likewise , submit by living with your wife in ways that honor her , knowing that she is the weaker partner . Honor her all the more , as she is also a coheir of the gracious care of life . Do this so that your prayers won’t be hindered .
60003008	Finally , all of you be of one mind , sympathetic , lovers of your fellow believers , compassionate , and modest in your opinion of yourselves .
60003009	Don’t pay back evil for evil or insult for insult . Instead , give blessing in return . You were called to do this so that you might inherit a blessing .
60003010	For those who want to love life and see good days should keep their tongue from evil speaking and their lips from speaking lies .
60003011	They should shun evil and do good ; seek peace and chase after it .
60003012	The Lord’s eyes are on the righteous and his ears are open to their prayers . But the Lord cannot tolerate those who do evil .
60003013	Who will harm you if you are zealous for good ?
60003014	But happy are you , even if you suffer because of righteousness ! Don’t be terrified or upset by them .
60003015	Instead , regard Christ as holy in your hearts . Whenever anyone asks you to speak of your hope , be ready to defend it .
60003016	Yet do this with respectful humility , maintaining a good conscience . Act in this way so that those who malign your good lifestyle in Christ may be ashamed when they slander you .
60003017	It is better to suffer for doing good ( if this could possibly be God’s will ) than for doing evil .
60003018	Christ himself suffered on account of sins , once for all , the righteous one on behalf of the unrighteous . He did this in order to bring you into the presence of God . Christ was put to death as a human , but made alive by the Spirit .
60003019	And it was by the Spirit that he went to preach to the spirits in prison .
60003020	In the past , these spirits were disobedient — when God patiently waited during the time of Noah . Noah built an ark in which a few ( that is , eight ) lives were rescued through water .
60003021	Baptism is like that . It saves you now — not because it removes dirt from your body but because it is the mark of a good conscience toward God . Your salvation comes through the resurrection of Jesus Christ ,
60003022	who is at God’s right side . Now that he has gone into heaven , he rules over all angels , authorities , and powers .
60004001	Therefore , since Christ suffered as a human , you should also arm yourselves with his way of thinking . This is because whoever suffers is finished with sin .
60004002	As a result , they don’t live the rest of their human lives in ways determined by human desires but in ways determined by God’s will .
60004003	You have wasted enough time doing what unbelievers desire — living in their unrestrained immorality and lust , their drunkenness and excessive feasting and wild parties , and their forbidden worship of idols .
60004004	They think it’s strange that you don’t join in these activities with the same flood of unrestrained wickedness . So they slander you .
60004005	They will have to reckon with the one who is ready to judge the living and the dead .
60004006	Indeed , this is the reason the good news was also preached to the dead . This happened so that , although they were judged as humans according to human standards , they could live by the Spirit according to divine standards .
60004007	The end of everything has come . Therefore , be self-controlled and clearheaded so you can pray .
60004008	Above all , show sincere love to each other , because love brings about the forgiveness of many sins .
60004009	Open your homes to each other without complaining .
60004010	And serve each other according to the gift each person has received , as good managers of God’s diverse gifts .
60004011	Whoever speaks should do so as those who speak God’s word . Whoever serves should do so from the strength that God furnishes . Do this so that in everything God may be honored through Jesus Christ . To him be honor and power forever and always . Amen .
60004012	Dear friends , don’t be surprised about the fiery trials that have come among you to test you . These are not strange happenings .
60004013	Instead , rejoice as you share Christ’s suffering . You share his suffering now so that you may also have overwhelming joy when his glory is revealed .
60004014	If you are mocked because of Christ’s name , you are blessed , for the Spirit of glory — indeed , the Spirit of God — rests on you .
60004015	Now none of you should suffer as a murderer or thief or evildoer or rebel .
60004016	But don’t be ashamed if you suffer as one who belongs to Christ . Rather , honor God as you bear Christ’s name . Give honor to God ,
60004017	because it’s time for judgment to begin with God’s own household . But if judgment starts with us , what will happen to those who refuse to believe God’s good news ?
60004018	If the righteous are barely rescued , what will happen to the godless and sinful ?
60004019	So then , those who suffer because they follow God’s will should commit their lives to a trustworthy creator by doing what is right .
60005001	Therefore , I have a request for the elders among you . ( I ask this as a fellow elder and a witness of Christ’s sufferings , and as one who shares in the glory that is about to be revealed . ) I urge the elders :
60005002	Like shepherds , tend the flock of God among you . Watch over it . Don’t shepherd because you must , but do it voluntarily for God . Don’t shepherd greedily , but do it eagerly .
60005003	Don’t shepherd by ruling over those entrusted to your care , but become examples to the flock .
60005004	And when the chief shepherd appears , you will receive an unfading crown of glory .
60005005	In the same way , I urge you who are younger : accept the authority of the elders . And everyone , clothe yourselves with humility toward each other . God stands against the proud , but he gives favor to the humble .
60005006	Therefore , humble yourselves under God’s power so that he may raise you up in the last day .
60005007	Throw all your anxiety onto him , because he cares about you .
60005008	Be clearheaded . Keep alert . Your accuser , the devil , is on the prowl like a roaring lion , seeking someone to devour .
60005009	Resist him , standing firm in the faith . Do so in the knowledge that your fellow believers are enduring the same suffering throughout the world .
60005010	After you have suffered for a little while , the God of all grace , the one who called you into his eternal glory in Christ Jesus , will himself restore , empower , strengthen , and establish you .
60005011	To him be power forever and always . Amen .
60005012	I have written and sent these few lines to you by Silvanus . I consider him to be a faithful brother . In these lines I have urged and affirmed that this is the genuine grace of God . Stand firm in it .
60005013	The fellow-elect church in Babylon greets you , and so does my son Mark .
60005014	Greet each other with the kiss of love . Peace to you all who are in Christ .
61001001	From Simon Peter , a slave and apostle of Jesus Christ . To those who received a faith equal to ours through the justice of our God and savior Jesus Christ .
61001002	May you have more and more grace and peace through the knowledge of God and Jesus our Lord .
61001003	By his divine power the Lord has given us everything we need for life and godliness through the knowledge of the one who called us by his own honor and glory .
61001004	Through his honor and glory he has given us his precious and wonderful promises , that you may share the divine nature and escape from the world’s immorality that sinful craving produces .
61001005	This is why you must make every effort to add moral excellence to your faith ; and to moral excellence , knowledge ;
61001006	and to knowledge , self-control ; and to self-control , endurance ; and to endurance , godliness ;
61001007	and to godliness , affection for others ; and to affection for others , love .
61001008	If all these are yours and they are growing in you , they’ll keep you from becoming inactive and unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ .
61001009	Whoever lacks these things is shortsighted and blind , forgetting that they were cleansed from their past sins .
61001010	Therefore , brothers and sisters , be eager to confirm your call and election . Do this and you will never ever be lost .
61001011	In this way you will receive a rich welcome into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and savior Jesus Christ .
61001012	So I’ll keep reminding you about these things , although you already know them and stand secure in the truth you have .
61001013	I think it’s right that I keep stirring up your memory , as long as I’m alive .
61001014	After all , our Lord Jesus Christ has shown me that I am about to depart from this life .
61001015	I’m eager for you always to remember these things after my death .
61001016	We didn’t repeat crafty myths when we told you about the powerful coming of our Lord Jesus Christ . Quite the contrary , we witnessed his majesty with our own eyes .
61001017	He received honor and glory from God the Father when a voice came to him from the magnificent glory , saying , " This is my dearly loved Son , with whom I am well-pleased . "
61001018	We ourselves heard this voice from heaven while we were with him on the holy mountain .
61001019	In addition , we have a most reliable prophetic word , and you would do well to pay attention to it , just as you would to a lamp shining in a dark place , until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts .
61001020	Most important , you must know that no prophecy of scripture represents the prophet’s own understanding of things ,
61001021	because no prophecy ever came by human will . Instead , men and women led by the Holy Spirit spoke from God .
61002001	But false prophets also arose among the people . In the same way , false teachers will come among you . They will introduce destructive opinions and deny the master who bought them , bringing quick destruction on themselves .
61002002	Many will follow them in their unrestrained immorality , and because of these false teachers the way of truth will be slandered .
61002003	In their greed they will take advantage of you with lies . The judgment pronounced against them long ago hasn’t fallen idle , nor is their destruction sleeping .
61002004	God didn’t spare the angels when they sinned but cast them into the lowest level of the underworld and committed them to chains of darkness , keeping them there until the judgment .
61002005	And he didn’t spare the ancient world when he brought a flood on the world of ungodly people , even though he protected Noah , a preacher of righteousness , along with seven others .
61002006	God condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to total destruction , reducing them to ashes as a warning to ungodly people .
61002007	And he rescued righteous Lot , who was made miserable by the unrestrained immorality of unruly people . (
61002008	While that righteous man lived among them he felt deep distress every day on account of the immoral actions he saw and heard . )
61002009	These things show that the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from their trials , and how to keep the unrighteous for punishment on the Judgment Day .
61002010	This is especially true for those who follow after the corrupt cravings of the sinful nature and defy the Lord’s authority . These reckless , brash people aren’t afraid to insult the glorious ones ,
61002011	yet angels , who are stronger and more powerful , don’t use insults when pronouncing the Lord’s judgment on them .
61002012	These false teachers are like irrational animals , mere creatures of instinct , born to be captured and destroyed . They slander what they don’t understand and , like animals , they will be destroyed .
61002013	In this way , they will receive payment for their wrongdoing . They even enjoy unruly parties in broad daylight . They are blots and blemishes , taking delight in their seductive pleasures while feasting with you .
61002014	They are always looking for someone with whom to commit adultery . They are always on the lookout for opportunities to sin . They ensnare people whose faith is weak . They have hearts trained in greed . They are under God’s curse .
61002015	Leaving the straight path , they have gone off course , following the way of Balaam son of Bosor , who loved the payment of doing wrong .
61002016	But Balaam was rebuked for his wrongdoing . A donkey , which has no voice , spoke with a human voice and put a stop to the prophet’s madness .
61002017	These false teachers are springs without water , mists driven by the wind . The underworld has been reserved for them .
61002018	With empty , self-important speech , they use sinful cravings and unrestrained immorality to ensnare people who have only just escaped life with those who have wandered from the truth .
61002019	These false teachers promise freedom , but they themselves are slaves of immorality ; whatever overpowers you , enslaves you .
61002020	If people escape the moral filth of this world through the knowledge of our Lord and savior Jesus Christ , then get tangled up in it again and are overcome by it , they are worse off than they were before .
61002021	It would be better for them never to have known the way of righteousness than , having come to know it , to turn back from the holy commandment entrusted to them .
61002022	They demonstrate the truth of the proverb : " A dog returns to its own vomit , and a washed sow wallows in the mud . "
61003001	My dear friends , this is now my second letter to you . I have written both letters to stir up your sincere understanding with a reminder .
61003002	I want you to recall what the holy prophets foretold as well as what the Lord and savior commanded through your apostles .
61003003	Most important , know this : in the last days scoffers will come , jeering , living by their own cravings ,
61003004	and saying , " Where is the promise of his coming ? After all , nothing has changed — not since the beginning of creation , nor even since the ancestors died . "
61003005	But they fail to notice that , by God’s word , heaven and earth were formed long ago out of water and by means of water .
61003006	And it was through these that the world of that time was flooded and destroyed .
61003007	But by the same word , heaven and earth are now held in reserve for fire , kept for the Judgment Day and destruction of ungodly people .
61003008	Don’t let it escape your notice , dear friends , that with the Lord a single day is like a thousand years and a thousand years are like a single day .
61003009	The Lord isn’t slow to keep his promise , as some think of slowness , but he is patient toward you , not wanting anyone to perish but all to change their hearts and lives .
61003010	But the day of the Lord will come like a thief . On that day the heavens will pass away with a dreadful noise , the elements will be consumed by fire , and the earth and all the works done on it will be exposed .
61003011	Since everything will be destroyed in this way , what sort of people ought you to be ? You must live holy and godly lives ,
61003012	waiting for and hastening the coming day of God . Because of that day , the heavens will be destroyed by fire and the elements will melt away in the flames .
61003013	But according to his promise we are waiting for a new heaven and a new earth , where righteousness is at home .
61003014	Therefore , dear friends , while you are waiting for these things to happen , make every effort to be found by him in peace — pure and faultless .
61003015	Consider the patience of our Lord to be salvation , just as our dear friend and brother Paul wrote to you according to the wisdom given to him ,
61003016	speaking of these things in all his letters . Some of his remarks are hard to understand , and people who are ignorant and whose faith is weak twist them to their own destruction , just as they do the other scriptures .
61003017	Therefore , dear friends , since you have been warned in advance , be on guard so that you aren’t led off course into the error of sinful people , and lose your own safe position .
61003018	Instead , grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and savior Jesus Christ . To him belongs glory now and forever . Amen .
62001001	We announce to you what existed from the beginning , what we have heard , what we have seen with our eyes , what we have seen and our hands handled , about the word of life .
62001002	The life was revealed , and we have seen , and we testify and announce to you the eternal life that was with the Father and was revealed to us .
62001003	What we have seen and heard , we also announce it to you so that you can have fellowship with us . Our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son , Jesus Christ .
62001004	We are writing these things so that our joy can be complete .
62001005	This is the message that we have heard from him and announce to you : " God is light and there is no darkness in him at all . "
62001006	If we claim , " We have fellowship with him , " and live in the darkness , we are lying and do not act truthfully .
62001007	But if we live in the light in the same way as he is in the light , we have fellowship with each other , and the blood of Jesus , his Son , cleanses us from every sin .
62001008	If we claim , " We don’t have any sin , " we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us .
62001009	But if we confess our sins , he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from everything we’ve done wrong .
62001010	If we claim , " We have never sinned , " we make him a liar and his word is not in us .
62002001	My little children , I’m writing these things to you so that you don’t sin . But if you do sin , we have an advocate with the Father , Jesus Christ the righteous one .
62002002	He is God’s way of dealing with our sins , not only ours but the sins of the whole world .
62002003	This is how we know that we know him : if we keep his commandments .
62002004	The one who claims , " I know him , " while not keeping his commandments , is a liar , and the truth is not in this person .
62002005	But the love of God is truly perfected in whoever keeps his word . This is how we know we are in him .
62002006	The one who claims to remain in him ought to live in the same way as he lived .
62002007	Dear friends , I’m not writing a new commandment to you , but an old commandment that you had from the beginning . The old commandment is the message you heard .
62002008	On the other hand , I am writing a new commandment to you , which is true in him and in you , because the darkness is passing away and the true light already shines .
62002009	The one who claims to be in the light while hating a brother or sister is in the darkness even now .
62002010	The person loving a brother and sister stays in the light , and there is nothing in the light that causes a person to stumble .
62002011	But the person who hates a brother or sister is in the darkness and lives in the darkness , and doesn’t know where to go because the darkness blinds the eyes .
62002012	Little children , I’m writing to you because your sins have been forgiven through Jesus’ name .
62002013	Parents , I’m writing to you because you have known the one who has existed from the beginning . Young people , I’m writing to you because you have conquered the evil one .
62002014	Little children , I write to you because you know the Father . Parents , I write to you because you have known the one who has existed from the beginning . Young people , I write to you because you are strong , the word of God remains in you , and you have conquered the evil one .
62002015	Don’t love the world or the things in the world . If anyone loves the world , the love of the Father is not in them .
62002016	Everything that is in the world — the craving for whatever the body feels , the craving for whatever the eyes see and the arrogant pride in one’s possessions — is not of the Father but is of the world .
62002017	And the world and its cravings are passing away , but the person who does the will of God remains forever .
62002018	Little children , it is the last hour . Just as you have heard that the antichrist is coming , so now many antichrists have appeared . This is how we know it is the last hour .
62002019	They went out from us , but they were not really part of us . If they had been part of us , they would have stayed with us . But by going out from us , they showed they all are not part of us .
62002020	But you have an anointing from the holy one , and all of you know the truth .
62002021	I don’t write to you because you don’t know the truth but because you know it . You know that no lie comes from the truth .
62002022	Who is the liar ? Isn’t it the person who denies that Jesus is the Christ ? This person is the antichrist : the one who denies the Father and the Son .
62002023	Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father , but the one who confesses the Son has the Father also .
62002024	As for you , what you heard from the beginning must remain in you . If what you heard from the beginning remains in you , you will also remain in relationship to the Son and in the Father .
62002025	This is the promise that he himself gave us : eternal life .
62002026	I write these things to you about those who are attempting to deceive you .
62002027	As for you , the anointing that you received from him remains on you , and you don’t need anyone to teach you the truth . But since his anointing teaches you about all things ( it’s true and not a lie ) , remain in relationship to him just as he taught you .
62002028	And now , little children , remain in relationship to Jesus , so that when he appears we can have confidence and not be ashamed in front of him when he comes .
62002029	If you know that he is righteous , you also know that every person who practices righteousness is born from him .
62003001	See what kind of love the Father has given to us in that we should be called God’s children , and that is what we are ! Because the world didn’t recognize him , it doesn’t recognize us .
62003002	Dear friends , now we are God’s children , and it hasn’t yet appeared what we will be . We know that when he appears we will be like him because we’ll see him as he is .
62003003	And everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself even as he is pure .
62003004	Every person who practices sin commits an act of rebellion , and sin is rebellion .
62003005	You know that he appeared to take away sins , and there is no sin in him .
62003006	Every person who remains in relationship to him does not sin . Any person who sins has not seen him or known him .
62003007	Little children , make sure no one deceives you . The person who practices righteousness is righteous , in the same way that Jesus is righteous .
62003008	The person who practices sin belongs to the devil , because the devil has been sinning since the beginning . God’s Son appeared for this purpose : to destroy the works of the devil .
62003009	Those born from God don’t practice sin because God’s DNA remains in them . They can’t sin because they are born from God .
62003010	This is how God’s children and the devil’s children are apparent : everyone who doesn’t practice righteousness is not from God , including the person who doesn’t love a brother or sister .
62003011	This is the message that you heard from the beginning : love each other .
62003012	Don’t behave like Cain , who belonged to the evil one and murdered his brother . And why did he kill him ? He killed him because his own works were evil , but the works of his brother were righteous .
62003013	Don’t be surprised , brothers and sisters , if the world hates you .
62003014	We know that we have transferred from death to life , because we love the brothers and sisters . The person who does not love remains in death .
62003015	Everyone who hates a brother or sister is a murderer , and you know that no murderer has eternal life residing in him .
62003016	This is how we know love : Jesus laid down his life for us , and we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters .
62003017	But if a person has material possessions and sees a brother or sister in need and that person doesn’t care — how can the love of God remain in him ?
62003018	Little children , let’s not love with words or speech but with action and truth .
62003019	This is how we will know that we belong to the truth and reassure our hearts in God’s presence .
62003020	Even if our hearts condemn us , God is greater than our hearts and knows all things .
62003021	Dear friends , if our hearts don’t condemn us , we have confidence in relationship to God .
62003022	We receive whatever we ask from him because we keep his commandments and do what pleases him .
62003023	This is his commandment , that we believe in the name of his Son , Jesus Christ , and love each other as he commanded us .
62003024	The person who keeps his commandments remains in God and God remains in him ; and this is how we know that he remains in us , because of the Spirit that he has given to us .
62004001	Dear friends , don’t believe every spirit . Test the spirits to see if they are from God because many false prophets have gone into the world .
62004002	This is how you know if a spirit comes from God : every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come as a human is from God ,
62004003	and every spirit that doesn’t confess Jesus is not from God . This is the spirit of the antichrist , which you have heard is coming and is now already in the world .
62004004	You are from God , little children , and you have defeated these people because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world .
62004005	They are from the world . So they speak from the world’s point of view and the world listens to them .
62004006	We are from God . The person who knows God listens to us . Whoever is not from God doesn’t listen to us . This is how we recognize the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error .
62004007	Dear friends , let’s love each other , because love is from God , and everyone who loves is born from God and knows God .
62004008	The person who doesn’t love does not know God , because God is love .
62004009	This is how the love of God is revealed to us : God has sent his only Son into the world so that we can live through him .
62004010	This is love : it is not that we loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son as the sacrifice that deals with our sins .
62004011	Dear friends , if God loved us this way , we also ought to love each other .
62004012	No one has ever seen God . If we love each other , God remains in us and his love is made perfect in us .
62004013	This is how we know we remain in him and he remains in us , because he has given us a measure of his Spirit .
62004014	We have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son to be the savior of the world .
62004015	If any of us confess that Jesus is God’s Son , God remains in us and we remain in God .
62004016	We have known and have believed the love that God has for us . God is love , and those who remain in love remain in God and God remains in them .
62004017	This is how love has been perfected in us , so that we can have confidence on the Judgment Day , because we are exactly the same as God is in this world .
62004018	There is no fear in love , but perfect love drives out fear , because fear expects punishment . The person who is afraid has not been made perfect in love .
62004019	We love because God first loved us .
62004020	If anyone says , I love God , and hates a brother or sister , he is a liar , because the person who doesn’t love a brother or sister who can be seen can’t love God , who can’t be seen .
62004021	This commandment we have from him : Those who claim to love God ought to love their brother and sister also .
62005001	Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born from God . Whoever loves someone who is a parent loves the child born to the parent .
62005002	This is how we know that we love the children of God : when we love God and keep God’s commandments .
62005003	This is the love of God : we keep God’s commandments . God’s commandments are not difficult ,
62005004	because everyone who is born from God defeats the world . And this is the victory that has defeated the world : our faith .
62005005	Who defeats the world ? Isn’t it the one who believes that Jesus is God’s Son ?
62005006	This is the one who came by water and blood : Jesus Christ . Not by water only but by water and blood . And the Spirit is the one who testifies , because the Spirit is the truth .
62005007	The three are testifying —
62005008	the Spirit , the water , and the blood — and the three are united in agreement .
62005009	If we receive human testimony , God’s testimony is greater , because this is what God testified : he has testified about his Son .
62005010	The one who believes in God’s Son has the testimony within ; the one who doesn’t believe God has made God a liar , because that one has not believed the testimony that God gave about his Son .
62005011	And this is the testimony : God gave eternal life to us , and this life is in his Son .
62005012	The one who has the Son has life . The one who doesn’t have God’s Son does not have life .
62005013	I write these things to you who believe in the name of God’s Son so that you can know that you have eternal life .
62005014	This is the confidence that we have in our relationship with God : If we ask for anything in agreement with his will , he listens to us .
62005015	If we know that he listens to whatever we ask , we know that we have received what we asked from him .
62005016	If anyone sees a brother or sister committing a sin that does not result in death , they should pray , and God will give life to them — that is , to those who commit sins that don’t result in death . There is a sin that results in death — I’m not saying that you should pray about that .
62005017	Every unrighteous action is sin , but there is a sin that does not result in death .
62005018	We know that everyone born from God does not sin , but the ones born from God guard themselves , and the evil one cannot touch them .
62005019	We know we are from God , and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one .
62005020	We know that God’s Son has come and has given us understanding to know the one who is true . We are in the one who is true by being in his Son , Jesus Christ . This is the true God and eternal life .
62005021	Little children , guard yourselves from idols !
63001001	From the elder . To the chosen gentlewoman and her children , whom I truly love ( and I am not the only one , but also all who know the truth ) ,
63001002	because of the truth that remains with us and will be with us forever .
63001003	Grace , mercy , and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ , the Son of the Father , will be ours who live in truth and love .
63001004	I was overjoyed to find some of your children living in the truth , just as we had been commanded by the Father .
63001005	Now , dear friends , I am requesting that we love each other . It’s not as though I’m writing a new command to you , but it’s one we have had from the beginning .
63001006	This is love : that we live according to his commands . This is the command that you heard from the beginning : live in love .
63001007	Many deceivers have gone into the world who do not confess that Jesus Christ came as a human being . This kind of person is the deceiver and the antichrist .
63001008	Watch yourselves so that you don’t lose what we’ve worked for but instead receive a full reward .
63001009	Anyone who goes too far and does not continue in the teaching about Christ does not have God . Whoever continues in this teaching has both the Father and the Son .
63001010	Whoever comes to you who does not affirm this teaching should neither be received nor welcomed into your home ,
63001011	because welcoming people like that is the same thing as sharing in their evil actions .
63001012	I have a lot to tell you . I don’t want to use paper and ink , but I hope to visit you and talk with you face-to-face , so that our joy can be complete .
63001013	Your chosen sister’s children greet you .
64001001	From the elder . To my dear friend Gaius , whom I truly love .
64001002	Dear friend , I’m praying that all is well with you and that you enjoy good health in the same way that you prosper spiritually .
64001003	I was overjoyed when the brothers and sisters arrived and spoke highly of your faithfulness to the truth , shown by how you live according to the truth .
64001004	I have no greater joy than this : to hear that my children are living according to the truth .
64001005	Dear friend , you act faithfully in whatever you do for our brothers and sisters , even though they are strangers .
64001006	They spoke highly of your love in front of the church . You all would do well to provide for their journey in a way that honors God ,
64001007	because they left on their journey for the sake of Jesus Christ without accepting any support from the Gentiles .
64001008	Therefore , we ought to help people like this so that we can be coworkers with the truth .
64001009	I wrote something to the church , but Diotrephes , who likes to put himself first , doesn’t welcome us .
64001010	Because of this , if I come , I will bring up what he has done — making unjustified and wicked accusations against us . And as if that were not enough , he not only refuses to welcome the brothers and sisters but stops those who want to do so and even throws them out of the church !
64001011	Dear friend , don’t imitate what is bad but what is good . Whoever practices what is good belongs to God . Whoever practices what is bad has not seen God .
64001012	Everyone speaks highly of Demetrius , even the truth itself . We also speak highly of him , and you know that what we say is true .
64001013	I have a lot to say to you , but I don’t want to use pen and ink .
64001014	I hope to see you soon , and we will speak face-to-face .
64001015	Peace be with you . Your friends here greet you . Greet our friends there by name .
65001001	Jude , a slave of Jesus Christ and brother of James . To those who are called , loved by God the Father and kept safe by Jesus Christ .
65001002	May you have more and more mercy , peace , and love .
65001003	Dear friends , I wanted very much to write to you concerning the salvation we share . Instead , I must write to urge you to fight for the faith delivered once and for all to God’s holy people .
65001004	Godless people have slipped in among you . They turn the grace of our God into unrestrained immorality and deny our only master and Lord , Jesus Christ . Judgment was passed against them a long time ago .
65001005	I want to remind you of something you already know very well . The Lord , who once saved a people out of Egypt , later destroyed those who didn’t maintain their faith .
65001006	I remind you too of the angels who didn’t keep their position of authority but deserted their own home . The Lord has kept them in eternal chains in the underworld until the judgment of the great day .
65001007	In the same way , Sodom and Gomorrah and neighboring towns practiced immoral sexual relations and pursued other sexual urges . By undergoing the punishment of eternal fire , they serve as a warning .
65001008	Yet , even knowing this , these dreamers in the same way pollute themselves , reject authority , and slander the angels .
65001009	The archangel Michael , when he argued with the devil about Moses’ body , did not dare charge him with slander . Instead , he said , " The Lord rebuke you ! "
65001010	But these people slander whatever they don’t understand . They are destroyed by what they know instinctively , as though they were irrational animals .
65001011	They are damned , for they follow in the footsteps of Cain . For profit they give themselves over to Balaam’s error . They are destroyed in the uprising of Korah .
65001012	These people who join your love feasts are dangerous . They feast with you without reverence . They care only for themselves . They are waterless clouds carried along by the winds ; fruitless autumn trees , twice dead , uprooted ;
65001013	wild waves of the sea foaming up their own shame ; wandering stars for whom the darkness of the underworld is reserved forever .
65001014	Enoch , who lived seven generations after Adam , prophesied about these people when he said , " See , the Lord comes with his countless holy ones ,
65001015	to execute judgment on everyone and to convict everyone about every ungodly deed they have committed in their ungodliness as well as all the harsh things that sinful ungodly people have said against him . "
65001016	These are faultfinding grumblers , living according to their own desires . They speak arrogant words and they show partiality to people when they want a favor in return .
65001017	But you , dear friends , remember the words spoken beforehand by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ .
65001018	They said to you , " In the end time scoffers will come living according to their own ungodly desires . "
65001019	These people create divisions . Since they don’t have the Spirit , they are worldly .
65001020	But you , dear friends : build each other up on the foundation of your most holy faith , pray in the Holy Spirit ,
65001021	keep each other in the love of God , wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ , who will give you eternal life .
65001022	Have mercy on those who doubt .
65001023	Save some by snatching them from the fire . Fearing God , have mercy on some , hating even the clothing contaminated by their sinful urges .
65001024	To the one who is able to protect you from falling ,
65001025	to the only God our savior , through Jesus Christ our Lord ,
66001001	A revelation of Jesus Christ , which God gave him to show his servants what must soon take place . Christ made it known by sending it through his angel to his servant John ,
66001002	who bore witness to the word of God and to the witness of Jesus Christ , including all that John saw .
66001003	Favored is the one who reads the words of this prophecy out loud , and favored are those who listen to it being read , and keep what is written in it , for the time is near .
66001004	John , to the seven churches that are in Asia : Grace and peace to you from the one who is and was and is coming , and from the seven spirits that are before God’s throne ,
66001005	and from Jesus Christ — the faithful witness , the firstborn from among the dead , and the ruler of the kings of the earth . To the one who loves us and freed us from our sins by his blood ,
66001006	who made us a kingdom , priests to his God and Father — to him be glory and power forever and always . Amen .
66001007	Look , he is coming with the clouds ! Every eye will see him , including those who pierced him , and all the tribes of the earth will mourn because of him . This is so . Amen .
66001008	" I am the Alpha and the Omega , " says the Lord God , " the one who is and was and is coming , the Almighty . "
66001009	I , John , your brother who shares with you in the hardship , kingdom , and endurance that we have in Jesus , was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and my witness about Jesus .
66001010	I was in a Spirit-inspired trance on the Lord’s day , and I heard behind me a loud voice that sounded like a trumpet .
66001011	It said , " Write down on a scroll whatever you see , and send it to the seven churches : to Ephesus , Smyrna , Pergamum , Thyatira , Sardis , Philadelphia , and Laodicea . "
66001012	I turned to see who was speaking to me , and when I turned , I saw seven oil lamps burning on top of seven gold stands .
66001013	In the middle of the lampstands I saw someone who looked like the Human One . He wore a robe that stretched down to his feet , and he had a gold sash around his chest .
66001014	His head and hair were white as white wool — like snow — and his eyes were like a fiery flame .
66001015	His feet were like fine brass that has been purified in a furnace , and his voice sounded like rushing water .
66001016	He held seven stars in his right hand , and from his mouth came a sharp , two-edged sword . His appearance was like the sun shining with all its power .
66001017	When I saw him , I fell at his feet like a dead man . But he put his right hand on me and said , " Don’t be afraid . I’m the first and the last ,
66001018	and the living one . I was dead , but look ! Now I’m alive forever and always . I have the keys of Death and the Grave .
66001019	So write down what you have seen , both the scene now before you and the things that are about to unfold after this .
66001020	As for the mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and the seven gold lampstands , here is what they mean : the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches , and the seven lampstands are the seven churches .
66002001	“ Write this to the angel of the church in Ephesus : These are the words of the one who holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the seven gold lampstands :
66002002	I know your works , your labor , and your endurance . I also know that you don’t put up with those who are evil . You have tested those who say they are apostles but are not , and you have found them to be liars .
66002003	You have shown endurance and put up with a lot for my name’s sake , and you haven’t gotten tired .
66002004	But I have this against you : you have let go of the love you had at first .
66002005	So remember the high point from which you have fallen . Change your hearts and lives and do the things you did at first . If you don’t , I’m coming to you . I will move your lampstand from its place if you don’t change your hearts and lives .
66002006	But you have this in your favor : you hate what the Nicolaitans are doing , which I also hate .
66002007	If you can hear , listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches . I will allow those who emerge victorious to eat from the tree of life , which is in God’s paradise .
66002008	“ Write this to the angel of the church in Smyrna : These are the words of the one who is the first and the last , who died and came back to life :
66002009	I know your hardship and poverty ( though you are actually rich ) . I also know the hurtful things that have been spoken about you by those who say they are Jews ( though they are not , but are really Satan’s synagogue ) .
66002010	Don’t be afraid of what you are going to suffer . Look ! The devil is going to throw some of you into prison in order to test you . You will suffer hardship for ten days . Be faithful even to the point of death , and I will give you the crown of life .
66002011	If you can hear , listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches . Those who emerge victorious won’t be hurt by the second death .
66002012	“ Write this to the angel of the church in Pergamum : These are the words of the one who has the sharp , two-edged sword :
66002013	I know that you are living right where Satan’s throne is . You are holding on to my name , and you didn’t break faith with me even at the time that Antipas , my faithful witness , was killed among you , where Satan lives .
66002014	But I have a few things against you , because you have some there who follow Balaam’s teaching . Balaam had taught Balak to trip up the Israelites so that they would eat food sacrificed to idols and commit sexual immorality .
66002015	In the same way , you have some who follow the Nicolaitans’ teaching .
66002016	So change your hearts and lives . If you don’t , I am coming to you soon , and I will make war on them with the sword that comes from my mouth .
66002017	If you can hear , listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches . I will give those who emerge victorious some of the hidden manna to eat . I will also give to each of them a white stone with a new name written on it , which no one knows except the one who receives it .
66002018	“ Write this to the angel of the church in Thyatira : These are the words of God’s Son , whose eyes are like a fiery flame , and whose feet are like fine brass .
66002019	I know your works , your love and faithfulness , your service and endurance . I also know that the works you have done most recently are even greater than those you did at first .
66002020	But I have this against you : you put up with that woman , Jezebel , who calls herself a prophet . You allow her to teach and to mislead my servants into committing sexual immorality and eating food sacrificed to idols .
66002021	I gave her time to change her heart and life , but she refuses to change her life of prostitution .
66002022	Look ! I’m throwing her onto a sickbed . I am casting those who have committed adultery with her into terrible hardship — if they don’t change their hearts from following her practices —
66002023	and I will even put her children to death with disease . Then all the churches will know that I’m the one who examines minds and hearts , and that I will give to each of you what your actions deserve .
66002024	As for the rest of you in Thyatira — those of you who don’t follow this teaching and haven’t learned the so-called " deep secrets " of Satan — I won’t burden you with anything else .
66002025	Just hold on to what you have until I come .
66002026	To those who emerge victorious , keeping my practices until the end , I will give authority over the nations —
66002027	to rule the nations with an iron rod and smash them like pottery —
66002028	just as I received authority from my Father . I will also give them the morning star .
66002029	If you can hear , listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches .
66003001	“ Write this to the angel of the church in Sardis : These are the words of the one who holds God’s seven spirits and the seven stars : I know your works . You have the reputation of being alive , and you are in fact dead .
66003002	Wake up and strengthen whatever you have left , teetering on the brink of death , for I’ve found that your works are far from complete in the eyes of my God .
66003003	So remember what you received and heard . Hold on to it and change your hearts and lives . If you don’t wake up , I will come like a thief , and you won’t know what time I will come upon you .
66003004	But you do have a few people in Sardis who haven’t stained their clothing . They will walk with me clothed in white because they are worthy .
66003005	Those who emerge victorious will wear white clothing like this . I won’t scratch out their names from the scroll of life , but will declare their names in the presence of my Father and his angels .
66003006	If you can hear , listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches .
66003007	“ Write this to the angel of the church in Philadelphia : These are the words of the one who is holy and true , who has the key of David . Whatever he opens , no one will shut ; and whatever he shuts , no one opens .
66003008	I know your works . Look ! I have set in front of you an open door that no one can shut . You have so little power , and yet you have kept my word and haven’t denied my name .
66003009	Because of this I will make the people from Satan’s synagogue ( who say they are Jews and really aren’t , but are lying ) — I will make them come and bow down at your feet and realize that I have loved you .
66003010	Because you kept my command to endure , I will keep you safe through the time of testing that is about to come over the whole world , to test those who live on earth .
66003011	I’m coming soon . Hold on to what you have so that no one takes your crown .
66003012	As for those who emerge victorious , I will make them pillars in the temple of my God , and they will never leave it . I will write on them the name of my God and the name of the city of my God , the New Jerusalem that comes down out of heaven from my God . I will also write on them my own new name .
66003013	If you can hear , listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches .
66003014	" Write this to the angel of the church in Laodicea : These are the words of the Amen , the faithful and true witness , the ruler of God’s creation .
66003015	I know your works . You are neither cold nor hot . I wish that you were either cold or hot .
66003016	So because you are lukewarm , and neither hot nor cold , I’m about to spit you out of my mouth .
66003017	After all , you say , ‘ I’m rich , and I’ve grown wealthy , and I don’t need a thing . ’ You don’t realize that you are miserable , pathetic , poor , blind , and naked .
66003018	My advice is that you buy gold from me that has been purified by fire so that you may be rich , and white clothing to wear so that your nakedness won’t be shamefully exposed , and ointment to put on your eyes so that you may see .
66003019	I correct and discipline those whom I love . So be earnest and change your hearts and lives .
66003020	Look ! I’m standing at the door and knocking . If any hear my voice and open the door , I will come in to be with them , and will have dinner with them , and they will have dinner with me .
66003021	As for those who emerge victorious , I will allow them to sit with me on my throne , just as I emerged victorious and sat down with my Father on his throne .
66003022	If you can hear , listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches . "
66004001	After this I looked and there was a door that had been opened in heaven . The first voice that I had heard , which sounded like a trumpet , said to me , " Come up here , and I will show you what must take place after this . "
66004002	At once I was in a Spirit-inspired trance and I saw a throne in heaven , and someone was seated on the throne .
66004003	The one seated there looked like jasper and carnelian , and surrounding the throne was a rainbow that looked like an emerald .
66004004	Twenty-four thrones , with twenty-four elders seated upon them , surrounded the throne . The elders were dressed in white clothing and had gold crowns on their heads .
66004005	From the throne came lightning , voices , and thunder . In front of the throne were seven flaming torches , which are the seven spirits of God .
66004006	Something like a glass sea , like crystal , was in front of the throne . In the center , by the throne , were four living creatures encircling the throne . These creatures were covered with eyes on the front and on the back .
66004007	The first living creature was like a lion . The second living creature was like an ox . The third living creature had a face like a human being . And the fourth living creature was like an eagle in flight .
66004008	Each of the four living creatures had six wings , and each was covered all around and on the inside with eyes . They never rest day or night , but keep on saying , " Holy , holy , holy is the Lord God Almighty , who was and is and is coming . "
66004009	Whenever the living creatures give glory , honor , and thanks to the one seated on the throne , who lives forever and always ,
66004010	the twenty-four elders fall before the one seated on the throne . They worship the one who lives forever and always . They throw down their crowns before the throne and say ,
66004011	" You are worthy , our Lord and God ,
66005001	Then I saw a scroll in the right hand of the one seated on the throne . It had writing on the front and the back , and it was sealed with seven seals .
66005002	I saw a powerful angel , who proclaimed in a loud voice , " Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals ? "
66005003	But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth could open the scroll or look inside it .
66005004	So I began to weep and weep , because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look inside it .
66005005	Then one of the elders said to me , " Don’t weep . Look ! The Lion of the tribe of Judah , the Root of David , has emerged victorious so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals . "
66005006	Then , in between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders , I saw a Lamb , standing as if it had been slain . It had seven horns and seven eyes , which are God’s seven spirits , sent out into the whole earth .
66005007	He came forward and took the scroll from the right hand of the one seated on the throne .
66005008	When he took the scroll , the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb . Each held a harp and gold bowls full of incense , which are the prayers of the saints .
66005009	They took up a new song , saying , " You are worthy to take the scroll and open its seals ,
66005010	You made them a kingdom and priests to our God ,
66005011	Then I looked , and I heard the sound of many angels surrounding the throne , the living creatures , and the elders . They numbered in the millions — thousands upon thousands .
66005012	They said in a loud voice , " Worthy is the slaughtered Lamb
66005013	And I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea — I heard everything everywhere say , " Blessing , honor , glory , and power belong to the one seated on the throne and to the Lamb
66005014	Then the four living creatures said , " Amen , " and the elders fell down and worshipped .
66006001	Then I looked on as the Lamb opened one of the seven seals . I heard one of the four living creatures say in a voice like thunder , " Come ! "
66006002	So I looked , and there was a white horse . Its rider held a bow and was given a crown . And he went forth from victory to victory .
66006003	When the Lamb opened the second seal , I heard the second living creature say , " Come ! "
66006004	Out came another horse , fiery red . Its rider was allowed to take peace from the earth so that people would kill each other . He was given a large sword .
66006005	When he opened the third seal , I heard the third living creature say , " Come ! " So I looked , and there was a black horse . Its rider held a balance for weighing in his hand .
66006006	I heard what sounded like a voice from among the four living creatures . It said , " A quart of wheat for a denarion , and three quarts of barley for a denarion , but don’t damage the olive oil and the wine . "
66006007	When he opened the fourth seal , I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say , " Come ! "
66006008	So I looked , and there was a pale green horse . Its rider’s name was Death , and the Grave was following right behind . They were given authority over a fourth of the earth , to kill by sword , famine , disease , and the wild animals of the earth .
66006009	When he opened the fifth seal , I saw under the altar those who had been slaughtered on account of the word of God and the witness they had given .
66006010	They cried out with a loud voice , " Holy and true Master , how long will you wait before you pass judgment ? How long before you require justice for our blood , which was shed by those who live on earth ? "
66006011	Each of them was given a white robe , and they were told to rest a little longer , until their fellow servants and brothers and sisters — who were about to be killed as they were — were finished .
66006012	I looked on as he opened the sixth seal , and there was a great earthquake . The sun became black as funeral clothing , and the entire moon turned red as blood .
66006013	The stars of the sky fell to the earth as a fig tree drops its fruit when shaken by a strong wind .
66006014	The sky disappeared like a scroll being rolled up , and every mountain and island was moved from its place .
66006015	Then the kings of the earth , the officials and the generals , the rich and the powerful , and everyone , slave and free , hid themselves in caves and in the rocks of the mountains .
66006016	They called to the mountains and the rocks , " Fall on us and hide us from the face of the one seated on the throne and from the Lamb’s wrath !
66006017	The great day of their wrath has come , and who is able to stand ? "
66007001	After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth . They held back the earth’s four winds so that no wind would blow against the earth , the sea , or any tree .
66007002	I saw another angel coming up from the east , holding the seal of the living God . He cried out with a loud voice to the four angels who had been given the power to damage the earth and sea .
66007003	He said , " Don’t damage the earth , the sea , or the trees until we have put a seal on the foreheads of those who serve our God . "
66007004	Then I heard the number of those who were sealed : one hundred forty-four thousand , sealed from every tribe of the Israelites :
66007005	From the tribe of Judah , twelve thousand were sealed ; from the tribe of Reuben , twelve thousand ; from the tribe of Gad , twelve thousand ;
66007006	from the tribe of Asher , twelve thousand ; from the tribe of Naphtali , twelve thousand ; from the tribe of Manasseh , twelve thousand ;
66007007	from the tribe of Simeon , twelve thousand ; from the tribe of Levi , twelve thousand ; from the tribe of Issachar , twelve thousand ;
66007008	from the tribe of Zebulun , twelve thousand ; from the tribe of Joseph , twelve thousand ; from the tribe of Benjamin , twelve thousand were sealed .
66007009	After this I looked , and there was a great crowd that no one could number . They were from every nation , tribe , people , and language . They were standing before the throne and before the Lamb . They wore white robes and held palm branches in their hands .
66007010	They cried out with a loud voice : " Victory belongs to our God
66007011	All the angels stood in a circle around the throne , and around the elders and the four living creatures . They fell facedown before the throne and worshipped God ,
66007012	saying , " Amen ! Blessing and glory
66007013	Then one of the elders said to me , " Who are these people wearing white robes , and where did they come from ? "
66007014	I said to him , " Sir , you know . " Then he said to me , " These people have come out of great hardship . They have washed their robes and made them white in the Lamb’s blood .
66007015	This is the reason they are before God’s throne . They worship him day and night in his temple , and the one seated on the throne will shelter them .
66007016	They won’t hunger or thirst anymore . No sun or scorching heat will beat down on them ,
66007017	because the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne will shepherd them . He will lead them to the springs of life-giving water , and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes . "
66008001	Then , when the Lamb opened the seventh seal , there was silence in heaven for about half an hour .
66008002	Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God , and seven trumpets were given to them .
66008003	Another angel came and stood at the altar , and he held a gold bowl for burning incense . He was given a large amount of incense , in order to offer it on behalf of the prayers of all the saints on the gold altar in front of the throne .
66008004	The smoke of the incense offered for the prayers of the saints rose up before God from the angel’s hand .
66008005	Then the angel took the incense container and filled it with fire from the altar . He threw it down to the earth , and there were thunder , voices , lightning , and an earthquake .
66008006	Then the seven angels who held the seven trumpets got ready to blow them .
66008007	The first angel blew his trumpet , and hail and fire mixed with blood appeared , and was thrown down to the earth . A third of the earth was burned up . A third of the trees were burned up . All the green grass was burned up .
66008008	Then the second angel blew his trumpet , and something like a huge mountain burning with fire was thrown down into the sea . A third of the sea became blood ,
66008009	a third of the creatures living in the sea died , and a third of the ships were destroyed .
66008010	Then the third angel blew his trumpet , and a great star , burning like a torch , fell from heaven . It fell on a third of the rivers and springs of water .
66008011	The star’s name is Wormwood , and a third of the waters became wormwood , and many people died from the water , because it became so bitter .
66008012	Then the fourth angel blew his trumpet , and a third of the sun was struck , and a third of the moon , and a third of the stars so that a third of them became dark . The day lost a third of its light , and the night lost a third of its light too .
66008013	Then I looked and I heard an eagle flying high overhead . It said with a loud voice , " Horror , horror , oh ! The horror for those who live on earth because of the blasts of the remaining trumpets that the three angels are about to blow ! "
66009001	Then the fifth angel blew his trumpet , and I saw a star that had fallen from heaven to earth , and he was given the key to the shaft of the abyss .
66009002	He opened the shaft of the abyss ; and smoke rose up from the shaft , like smoke from a huge furnace . The sun and air were darkened by the smoke from the shaft .
66009003	Then locusts came forth from the smoke and onto the earth . They were given power like the power that scorpions have on the earth .
66009004	They were told not to hurt the grass of the earth or any green plant or any tree . They could only hurt the people who didn’t have the seal of God on their foreheads .
66009005	The locusts weren’t allowed to kill them , but only to make them suffer for five months — and the suffering they inflict is like that of a scorpion when it strikes a person .
66009006	In those days people will seek death , but they won’t find it . They will want to die , but death will run away from them .
66009007	The locusts looked like horses ready for battle . On their heads were what seemed to be gold crowns . Their faces were like human faces ,
66009008	their hair was like women’s hair , and their teeth were like lions’ teeth .
66009009	In front they had what seemed to be iron armor upon their chests , and the sound of their wings was like the sound of many chariots and horses racing into battle .
66009010	They also have tails with stingers , just like scorpions ; and in their tails is their power to hurt people for five months .
66009011	Their king is an angel from the abyss , whose Hebrew name is Abaddon , and whose Greek name is Apollyon .
66009012	The first horror has passed . Look ! Two horrors are still coming after this .
66009013	Then the sixth angel blew his trumpet , and I heard a voice from the four horns of the gold altar that is before God .
66009014	It said to the sixth angel , who had the trumpet , " Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates . "
66009015	Then the four angels who had been made ready for that hour , day , month , and year were released to kill a third of humankind .
66009016	The number of cavalry troops was two hundred million . I heard their number .
66009017	And this is the way I saw the horses and their riders in the vision : they had breastplates that were fiery red , dark blue , and yellow as sulfur . The horses’ heads were like lions’ heads , and out of their mouths came fire , smoke , and sulfur .
66009018	By these three plagues a third of humankind was killed : by the fire , smoke , and sulfur coming out of their mouths .
66009019	The horses’ power is in their mouths and their tails , for their tails are like snakes with heads that inflict injuries .
66009020	The rest of humankind , who weren’t killed by these plagues , didn’t change their hearts and lives and turn from their handiwork . They didn’t stop worshipping demons and idols made of gold , silver , bronze , stone , and wood — idols that can’t see or hear or walk .
66009021	They didn’t turn away from their murders , their spells and drugs , their sexual immorality , or their stealing .
66010001	Then I saw another powerful angel coming down from heaven . He was robed with a cloud , with a rainbow over his head . His face was like the sun , and his feet were like fiery pillars .
66010002	He held an open scroll in his hand . He put his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land .
66010003	He called out with a loud voice like a lion roaring , and when he called out , the seven thunders raised their voices .
66010004	When the seven thunders spoke , I was about to write , but I heard a voice from heaven say , " Seal up what the seven thunders have said , and don’t write it down . "
66010005	Then the angel I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven .
66010006	He swore by the one who lives forever and always , who created heaven and what is in it , the earth and what is in it , and the sea and what is in it , and said , " The time is up .
66010007	In the days when the seventh angel blows his trumpet , God’s mysterious purpose will be accomplished , fulfilling the good news he gave to his servants the prophets . "
66010008	Then the voice I heard from heaven spoke to me again and said , " Go , take the opened scroll from the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the land . "
66010009	So I went to the angel and told him to give me the scroll . He said to me , " Take it and eat it . It will make you sick to your stomach , but sweet as honey in your mouth . "
66010010	So I took the scroll from the angel’s hand and ate it . And it was sweet as honey in my mouth , but when I swallowed it , it made my stomach churn .
66010011	I was told , " You must prophesy again about many peoples , nations , languages , and kings . "
66011001	Then I was given a measuring rod , which was like a pole . And I was told , “ Get up and measure God’s temple , the altar , and those who worship there .
66011002	But don’t measure the court outside the temple . Leave that out , because it has been given to the nations , and they will trample the holy city underfoot for forty-two months .
66011003	“ And I will allow my two witnesses to prophesy for one thousand two hundred sixty days , wearing mourning clothes .
66011004	These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth .
66011005	If anyone wants to hurt them , fire comes out of their mouth and burns up their enemies . So if anyone wants to hurt them , they have to be killed in this way .
66011006	They have the power to close up the sky so that no rain will fall for as long as they prophesy . They also have power over the waters , to turn them into blood , and to strike the earth with any plague , as often as they wish .
66011007	“ When they have finished their witnessing , the beast that comes up from the abyss will make war on them , gain victory over them , and kill them .
66011008	Their dead bodies will lie on the street of the great city that is spiritually called Sodom and Egypt , where also their Lord was crucified .
66011009	And for three and a half days , members of the peoples , tribes , languages , and nations will look at their dead bodies , but they won’t let their dead bodies be put in a tomb .
66011010	Those who live on earth will rejoice over them . They will celebrate and give each other gifts , because these two prophets had brought such pain to those who live on earth .
66011011	" But after three and a half days , the breath of life from God entered them , and they stood on their feet . Great fear came over those who saw them .
66011012	Then they heard a loud voice from heaven say to them , ‘ Come up here . ’ And they went up to heaven in a cloud , while their enemies watched them .
66011013	At that hour there was a great earthquake , and a tenth of the city fell . Seven thousand people were killed by the earthquake , and the rest were afraid and gave glory to the God of heaven . "
66011014	The second horror is over . The third horror is coming soon .
66011015	Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet , and there were loud voices in heaven saying , " The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and his Christ ,
66011016	Then the twenty-four elders , who were seated on their thrones before God , fell on their faces and worshipped God .
66011017	They said , " We give thanks to you , Lord God Almighty , who is and was , The time came for the dead to be judged . The time came to reward your servants , the prophets and saints ,
66011019	Then God’s temple in heaven was opened , and the chest containing his covenant appeared in his temple . There were lightning , voices , thunder , an earthquake , and large hail .
66012001	Then a great sign appeared in heaven : a woman clothed with the sun , with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head .
66012002	She was pregnant , and she cried out because she was in labor , in pain from giving birth .
66012003	Then another sign appeared in heaven : it was a great fiery red dragon , with seven heads and ten horns , and seven royal crowns on his heads .
66012004	His tail swept down a third of heaven’s stars and threw them to the earth . The dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth so that when she gave birth , he might devour her child .
66012005	She gave birth to a son , a male child who is to rule all the nations with an iron rod . Her child was snatched up to God and his throne .
66012006	Then the woman fled into the desert , where God has prepared a place for her . There she will be taken care of for one thousand two hundred sixty days .
66012007	Then there was war in heaven : Michael and his angels fought the dragon . The dragon and his angels fought back ,
66012008	but they did not prevail , and there was no longer any place for them in heaven .
66012009	So the great dragon was thrown down . The old snake , who is called the devil and Satan , the deceiver of the whole world , was thrown down to the earth ; and his angels were thrown down with him .
66012010	Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say , " Now the salvation and power and kingdom of our God , The accuser of our brothers and sisters ,
66012011	They gained the victory over him on account of the blood of the Lamb Love for their own lives didn’t make them afraid to die .
66012012	Therefore , rejoice , you heavens and you who dwell in them . But oh ! The horror for the earth and sea !
66012013	When the dragon saw that he had been thrown down to the earth , he chased the woman who had given birth to the male child .
66012014	But the woman was given the two wings of the great eagle so that she could fly to her place in the desert . There she would be taken care of — out of the snake’s reach — for a time and times and half a time .
66012015	Then from his mouth the snake poured a river of water after the woman so that the river would sweep her away .
66012016	But the earth helped the woman . The earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river that the dragon poured out of his mouth .
66012017	So the dragon was furious with the woman , and he went off to make war on the rest of her children , on those who keep God’s commandments and hold firmly to the witness of Jesus .
66013001	Then the dragon stood on the seashore , and I saw a beast coming up out of the sea . It had ten horns and seven heads . Each of its horns was decorated with a royal crown , and on its heads were blasphemous names .
66013002	The beast I saw was like a leopard . Its feet were like a bear’s , and its mouth was like a lion’s mouth . The dragon gave it his power , throne , and great authority .
66013003	One of its heads appeared to have been slain and killed , but its deadly wound was healed . So the whole earth was amazed and followed the beast .
66013004	They worshipped the dragon because it had given the beast its authority . They worshipped the beast and said , " Who is like the beast , and who can fight against it ? "
66013005	The beast was given a mouth that spoke boastful and blasphemous things , and it was given authority to act for forty-two months .
66013006	It opened its mouth to speak blasphemies against God . It blasphemed God’s name and his dwelling place ( that is , those who dwell in heaven ) .
66013007	It was also allowed to make war on the saints and to gain victory over them . It was given authority over every tribe , people , language , and nation .
66013008	All who live on earth worshipped it , all whose names hadn’t been written — from the time the earth was made — in the scroll of life of the Lamb who was slain .
66013009	Whoever has ears must listen :
66013010	If any are to be taken captive , then into captivity they will go . If any are to be killed by the sword , then by the sword they will be killed . This calls for endurance and faithfulness on the part of the saints .
66013011	Then I saw another beast coming up from the earth . It had two horns like a lamb , but it was speaking like a dragon .
66013012	It exercises all the authority of the first beast in its presence . It also makes the earth and those who live in it worship the first beast , whose fatal wound was healed .
66013013	It does great signs so that it even makes fire come down from heaven to earth in the presence of the people .
66013014	It deceives those who live on earth by the signs that it was allowed to do in the presence of the beast . It told those who live on earth to make an image for the beast who had been wounded by the sword and yet came to life again .
66013015	It was allowed to give breath to the beast’s image so that the beast’s image would even speak and cause anyone who didn’t worship the beast’s image to be put to death .
66013016	It forces everyone — the small and great , the rich and poor , the free and slaves — to have a mark put on their right hand or on their forehead .
66013017	It will not allow anyone to make a purchase or sell anything unless the person has the mark with the beast’s name or the number of its name .
66013018	This calls for wisdom . Let the one who understands calculate the beast’s number , for it’s a human being’s number . Its number is six hundred sixty-six .
66014001	Then I looked , and there was the Lamb , standing on Mount Zion . With him were one hundred forty-four thousand who had his name and his Father’s name written on their foreheads .
66014002	I heard a sound from heaven that was like the sound of rushing water and loud thunder . The sound I heard was like that of harpists playing their harps .
66014003	They sing a new song in front of the throne , the four living creatures , and the elders . And no one could learn the song except the one hundred forty-four thousand who had been purchased from the earth .
66014004	They weren’t defiled with women , for these people who follow the Lamb wherever he goes are virgins . They were purchased from among humankind as early produce for God and the Lamb .
66014005	No lie came from their mouths ; they are blameless .
66014006	Then I saw another angel flying high overhead with eternal good news to proclaim to those who live on earth , and to every nation , tribe , language , and people .
66014007	He said in a loud voice , " Fear God and give him glory , for the hour of his judgment has come . Worship the one who made heaven and earth , the sea and springs of water . "
66014008	Another angel , a second one , followed and said , " Fallen , fallen is Babylon the great ! She made all the nations drink the wine of her lustful passion . "
66014009	Then another angel , a third one , followed them and said in a loud voice , " If any worship the beast and its image , and receive a mark on their foreheads or their hands ,
66014010	they themselves will also drink the wine of God’s passionate anger , poured full strength into the cup of his wrath . They will suffer the pain of fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and the Lamb .
66014011	The smoke of their painful suffering goes up forever and always . There is no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and its image , and those who receive the mark of its name . "
66014012	This calls for the endurance of the saints , who keep God’s commandments and keep faith with Jesus .
66014013	And I heard a voice from heaven say , " Write this : Favored are the dead who die in the Lord from now on . " " Yes , " says the Spirit , " so they can rest from their labors , because their deeds follow them . "
66014014	Then I looked , and there was a white cloud . On the cloud was seated someone who looked like the Human One . He had a gold crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand .
66014015	Another angel came out of the temple , calling in a loud voice to the one seated on the cloud : " Use your sickle to reap the harvest , for the time to harvest has come , and the harvest of the earth is ripe . "
66014016	So the one seated on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth , and the earth was harvested .
66014017	Then another angel came out of the temple in heaven , and he also had a sharp sickle .
66014018	Still another angel , who has power over fire , came out from the altar . He said in a loud voice to the one who had the sharp sickle , " Use your sharp sickle to cut the clusters in the vineyard of the earth , because its grapes are ripe . "
66014019	So the angel swung his sickle into the earth , and cut the vineyard of the earth , and he put what he reaped into the great winepress of God’s passionate anger .
66014020	Then the winepress was trampled outside the city , and the blood came out of the winepress as high as the horses’ bridles for almost two hundred miles .
66015001	Then I saw another great and awe-inspiring sign in heaven . There were seven angels with seven plagues — and these are the last , for with them God’s anger is brought to an end .
66015002	Then I saw what appeared to be a sea of glass mixed with fire . Those who gained victory over the beast , its image , and the number of its name were standing by the glass sea , holding harps from God .
66015003	They sing the song of Moses , God’s servant , and the song of the Lamb , saying , " Great and awe-inspiring are your works , Just and true are your ways ,
66015004	Who won’t fear you , Lord , and glorify your name ? All nations will come and fall down in worship before you ,
66015005	After this I looked , and the temple in heaven — that is , the tent of witness — was opened .
66015006	The seven angels , who have the seven plagues , came out of the temple . They were clothed in pure bright linen and had gold sashes around their waists .
66015007	Then one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven gold bowls full of the anger of the God who lives forever and always .
66015008	The temple was filled with smoke from God’s glory and power , and no one could go into the temple until the seven plagues of the seven last angels were brought to an end .
66016001	Then I heard a loud voice from the temple say to the seven angels , " Go and pour out the seven bowls of God’s anger on the earth . "
66016002	So the first angel poured his bowl on the earth , and a nasty and terrible sore appeared on the people who had the beast’s mark and worshipped its image .
66016003	The second angel poured his bowl into the sea , and the sea turned into blood , like the blood of a corpse , and every living thing in the sea died .
66016004	The third angel poured his bowl into the rivers and springs of water , and they turned into blood .
66016005	Then I heard the angel of the waters say , " You are just , holy one , who is and was ,
66016006	They poured out the blood of saints and prophets ,
66016007	And I heard the altar say ,
66016008	The fourth angel poured his bowl on the sun , and it was allowed to burn people with fire .
66016009	The people were burned by intense heat , and they cursed the name of the God who had power over these plagues . But they didn’t change their hearts and lives and give him glory .
66016010	The fifth angel poured his bowl over the beast’s throne , and darkness covered its kingdom . People bit their tongues because of their pain ,
66016011	and they cursed the God of heaven because of their pains and sores ; but they didn’t turn away from what they had done .
66016012	Then the sixth angel poured his bowl on the great river Euphrates . Its water was dried up so that the way was ready for the kings from the east .
66016013	Then I saw three unclean spirits , like frogs , come from the dragon’s mouth , the beast’s mouth , and the mouth of the false prophet .
66016014	These are demonic spirits that do signs . They go out to the kings of the whole world , to gather them for battle on the great day of God the Almighty . (
66016015	Look ! I’m coming like a thief ! Favored are those who stay awake and clothed so that they don’t go around naked and exposed to shame . )
66016016	The spirits gathered them at the place that is called in Hebrew , Harmagedon .
66016017	Then the seventh angel poured his bowl into the air , and a loud voice came out from the temple , from the throne , saying , " It is done ! "
66016018	There were lightning strikes , voices , and thunder , and a great earthquake occurred . The earthquake was greater than any that have occurred since there have been people on earth .
66016019	The great city split into three parts , and the cities of the nations fell . God remembered Babylon the great so that he gave her the wine cup of his furious anger .
66016020	Every island fled , and the mountains disappeared .
66016021	Huge hailstones weighing about one hundred pounds came down from heaven on the people . They cursed God for the plague of hail , because the plague was so terrible .
66017001	Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls spoke with me . " Come , he said , I will show you the judgment upon the great prostitute , who is seated on deep waters .
66017002	The kings of the earth have committed sexual immorality with her , and those who live on earth have become drunk with the wine of her whoring . "
66017003	Then he brought me in a Spirit-inspired trance to a desert . There I saw a woman seated on a scarlet beast that was covered with blasphemous names . It had seven heads and ten horns .
66017004	The woman wore purple and scarlet clothing , and she glittered with gold and jewels and pearls . In her hand she held a gold cup full of the vile and impure things that came from her activity as a prostitute .
66017005	A name — a mystery — was written on her forehead : " Babylon the great , the mother of prostitutes and the vile things of the earth . "
66017006	I saw that the woman was drunk on the blood of the saints and the blood of Jesus’ witnesses . I was completely stunned when I saw her .
66017007	Then the angel said to me , " Why are you amazed ? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and the seven-headed , ten-horned beast that carries her .
66017008	The beast that you saw was and is not , and is about to come up out of the abyss and go to destruction . Those who live on earth , whose names haven’t been written in the scroll of life from the time the earth was made , will be amazed when they see the beast , because it was and is not and will again be present .
66017009	This calls for an understanding mind . The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated . They are also seven kings .
66017010	Five kings have fallen , the one is , and the other hasn’t yet come . When that king comes , he must remain for only a short time .
66017011	As for the beast that was and is not , it is itself an eighth king that belongs to the seven , and it is going to destruction .
66017012	The ten horns that you saw are ten kings , who haven’t yet received royal power . But they will receive royal authority for an hour , along with the beast .
66017013	These kings will be of one mind , and they will give their power and authority to the beast .
66017014	They will make war on the Lamb , but the Lamb will emerge victorious , for he is Lord of lords and King of kings . Those with him are called , chosen , and faithful . "
66017015	Then he said to me , " The waters that you saw , where the prostitute is seated , are peoples , crowds , nations , and languages .
66017016	As for the ten horns that you saw , they and the beast will hate the prostitute . They will destroy her and strip her bare . They will devour her flesh and burn her with fire
66017017	because God moved them to carry out his purposes . That is why they will be of one mind and give their royal power to the beast , until God’s words have been accomplished .
66017018	The woman whom you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth . "
66018001	After this I saw another angel coming down from heaven . He had great authority , and the earth was filled with light because of his glory .
66018002	He called out with a loud voice , saying , " Fallen , fallen is Babylon the great ! She has become a home for demons and a lair for every unclean spirit . She is a lair for every unclean bird , and a lair for every unclean and disgusting beast
66018003	because all the nations have fallen due to the wine of her lustful passion . The kings of the earth committed sexual immorality with her , and the merchants of the earth became rich from the power of her loose and extravagant ways . "
66018004	Then I heard another voice from heaven say , “ Come out of her , my people , so that you don’t take part in her sins and don’t receive any of her plagues .
66018005	Her sins have piled up as high as heaven , and God remembered her unjust acts .
66018006	Give her what she has given to others . Give her back twice as much for what she has done . In the cup that she has poured , pour her twice as much .
66018007	To the extent that she glorified herself and indulged her loose and extravagant ways , give her pain and grief . In her heart she says , ‘ I sit like a queen ! I’m not a widow . I’ll never see grief . ’
66018008	This is why her plagues will come in a single day — deadly disease , grief , and hunger . She will be consumed by fire because the Lord God who judges her is powerful .
66018009	“ The kings of the earth , who committed sexual immorality with her and shared her loose and extravagant ways , will weep and mourn over her when they see the smoke from her burning .
66018010	They will stand a long way off because they are afraid of the pain she suffers , and they will say , ‘ Oh , the horror ! Babylon , you great city , you powerful city ! In a single hour your judgment has come . ’
66018011	“ The merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her , for no one buys their cargoes anymore —
66018012	cargoes of gold , silver , jewels , and pearls ; fine linen , purple , silk , and scarlet ; all those things made of scented wood , ivory , fine wood , bronze , iron , and marble ;
66018013	cinnamon , incense , fragrant ointment , and frankincense ; wine , oil , fine flour , and wheat ; cattle , sheep , horses , and carriages ; and slaves , even human lives .
66018014	‘ The fruit your whole being craved has gone from you . All your glitter and glamour are lost to you , never ever to be found again . ’
66018015	“ The merchants who sold these things , and got so rich by her , will stand a long way off because they fear the pain she suffers . They will weep and mourn , and say ,
66018016	‘ Oh , the horror ! The great city that wore fine linen , purple , and scarlet , who glittered with gold , jewels , and pearls —
66018017	in just one hour such great wealth was destroyed . ’ " Every sea captain , every seafarer , sailors , and all who make their living on the sea stood a long way off .
66018018	They cried out as they saw the smoke from her burning and said , ‘ What city was ever like the great city ? ’
66018019	They threw dust on their heads , and they cried out , weeping and mourning . They said , ‘ Oh , the horror ! The great city , where all who have ships at sea became so rich by her prosperity — in just one hour she was destroyed .
66018020	Rejoice over her , heaven — you saints , apostles , and prophets — because God has condemned her as she condemned you . ’ "
66018021	Then a powerful angel picked up a stone that was like a huge millstone and threw it into the sea , saying , " With such violent force the great city of Babylon will be thrown down , and it won’t be found anymore .
66018022	The sound of harpists and musicians , of pipers and trumpeters , will never be heard among you again . No craftsman of any kind will ever be found among you again . The sound of the hand mill will never be heard among you again .
66018023	The light of a lamp will never shine among you again . The sound of a bridegroom and bride will never be heard among you again because your merchants ran the world , because all the nations were deceived by the spell you cast , and because
66018024	the blood of prophets , of saints , and of all who have been slaughtered on the earth was found among you . "
66019001	After this I heard what sounded like a huge crowd in heaven . They said , " Hallelujah ! The salvation and glory and power of our God !
66019002	His judgments are true and just , because he judged the great prostitute , and he exacted the penalty for the blood of his servants
66019003	Then they said a second time , " Hallelujah ! Smoke goes up from her forever and always . "
66019004	The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped God , who is seated on the throne , and they said , " Amen . Hallelujah ! "
66019005	Then a voice went out from the throne and said , " Praise our God , all you his servants ,
66019006	And I heard something that sounded like a huge crowd , like rushing water and powerful thunder . They said , " Hallelujah ! The Lord our God , the Almighty ,
66019007	Let us rejoice and celebrate , and give him the glory , for the wedding day of the Lamb has come ,
66019008	She was given fine , pure white linen to wear , for the fine linen is the saints’ acts of justice . "
66019009	Then the angel said to me , " Write this : Favored are those who have been invited to the wedding banquet of the Lamb . " He said to me , " These are the true words of God . "
66019010	Then I fell at his feet to worship him . But he said , " Don’t do that ! I’m a servant just like you and your brothers and sisters who hold firmly to the witness of Jesus . Worship God ! The witness of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy ! "
66019011	Then I saw heaven opened , and there was a white horse . Its rider was called Faithful and True , and he judges and makes war justly .
66019012	His eyes were like a fiery flame , and on his head were many royal crowns . He has a name written on him that no one knows but he himself .
66019013	He wore a robe dyed with blood , and his name was called the Word of God .
66019014	Heaven’s armies , wearing fine linen that was white and pure , were following him on white horses .
66019015	From his mouth comes a sharp sword that he will use to strike down the nations . He is the one who will rule them with an iron rod . And he is the one who will trample the winepress of the Almighty God’s passionate anger .
66019016	He has a name written on his robe and on his thigh : King of kings and Lord of lords .
66019017	Then I saw an angel standing in the sun , and he called out with a loud voice and said to all the birds flying high overhead , " Come and gather for God’s great supper .
66019018	Come and eat the flesh of kings , the flesh of generals , the flesh of the powerful , and the flesh of horses and their riders . Come and eat the flesh of all , both free and slave , both small and great . "
66019019	Then I saw that the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies had gathered to make war against the rider on the horse and his army .
66019020	But the beast was seized , along with the false prophet who had done signs in the beast’s presence . ( He had used the signs to deceive people into receiving the beast’s mark and into worshipping the beast’s image . ) The two of them were thrown alive into the fiery lake that burns with sulfur .
66019021	The rest were killed by the sword that comes from the mouth of the rider on the horse , and all the birds ate their fill of their flesh .
66020001	Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven , holding in his hand the key to the abyss and a huge chain .
66020002	He seized the dragon , the old snake , who is the devil and Satan , and bound him for a thousand years .
66020003	He threw him into the abyss , then locked and sealed it over him . This was to keep him from continuing to deceive the nations until the thousand years were over . After this he must be released for a little while .
66020004	Then I saw thrones , and people took their seats on them , and judgment was given in their favor . They were the ones who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and God’s word , and those who hadn’t worshipped the beast or its image , who hadn’t received the mark on their forehead or hand . They came to life and ruled with Christ for one thousand years .
66020005	The rest of the dead didn’t come to life until the thousand years were over . This is the first resurrection .
66020006	Favored and holy are those who have a share in the first resurrection . The second death has no power over them , but they will be priests of God and of Christ , and will rule with him for one thousand years .
66020007	When the thousand years are over , Satan will be released from his prison .
66020008	He will go out to deceive the nations that are at the four corners of the earth — Gog and Magog . He will gather them for battle . Their number is like the sand of the sea .
66020009	They came up across the whole earth and surrounded the saints’ camp , the city that God loves . But fire came down from heaven and consumed them .
66020010	Then the devil , who had deceived them , was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur , where the beast and the false prophet also were . There painful suffering will be inflicted upon them day and night , forever and always .
66020011	Then I saw a great white throne and the one who is seated on it . Before his face both earth and heaven fled away , and no place was found for them .
66020012	I saw the dead , the great and the small , standing before the throne , and scrolls were opened . Another scroll was opened too ; this is the scroll of life . And the dead were judged on the basis of what was written in the scrolls about what they had done .
66020013	The sea gave up the dead that were in it , and Death and the Grave gave up the dead that were in them , and people were judged by what they had done .
66020014	Then Death and the Grave were thrown into the fiery lake . This , the fiery lake , is the second death .
66020015	Then anyone whose name wasn’t found written in the scroll of life was thrown into the fiery lake .
66021001	Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth , for the former heaven and the former earth had passed away , and the sea was no more .
66021002	I saw the holy city , New Jerusalem , coming down out of heaven from God , made ready as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband .
66021003	I heard a loud voice from the throne say , " Look ! God’s dwelling is here with humankind . He will dwell with them , and they will be his peoples . God himself will be with them as their God .
66021004	He will wipe away every tear from their eyes . Death will be no more . There will be no mourning , crying , or pain anymore , for the former things have passed away . "
66021005	Then the one seated on the throne said , " Look ! I’m making all things new . " He also said , " Write this down , for these words are trustworthy and true . "
66021006	Then he said to me , " All is done . I am the Alpha and the Omega , the beginning and the end . To the thirsty I will freely give water from the life-giving spring .
66021007	Those who emerge victorious will inherit these things . I will be their God , and they will be my sons and daughters .
66021008	But for the cowardly , the faithless , the vile , the murderers , those who commit sexual immorality , those who use drugs and cast spells , the idolaters and all liars — their share will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur . This is the second death . "
66021009	Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues spoke with me . " Come , " he said , " I will show you the bride , the Lamb’s wife . "
66021010	He took me in a Spirit-inspired trance to a great , high mountain , and he showed me the holy city , Jerusalem , coming down out of heaven from God .
66021011	The city had God’s glory . Its brilliance was like a priceless jewel , like jasper that was as clear as crystal .
66021012	It had a great high wall with twelve gates . By the gates were twelve angels , and on the gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of Israel’s sons .
66021013	There were three gates on the east , three gates on the north , three gates on the south , and three gates on the west .
66021014	The city wall had twelve foundations , and on them were the twelve names of the Lamb’s twelve apostles .
66021015	The angel who spoke to me had a gold measuring rod with which to measure the city , its gates , and its wall .
66021016	Now the city was laid out as a square . Its length was the same as its width . He measured the city with the rod , and it was fifteen hundred miles . Its length and width and height were equal .
66021017	He also measured the thickness of its wall . It was two hundred sixteen feet thick , as a person — or rather , an angel — measures things .
66021018	The wall was built of jasper , and the city was pure gold , like pure glass .
66021019	The city wall’s foundations were decorated with every kind of jewel . The first foundation was jasper , the second was sapphire , the third was chalcedony , and the fourth was emerald .
66021020	The fifth was sardonyx , the sixth was carnelian , the seventh was chrysolite , and the eighth was beryl . The ninth was topaz , the tenth was chrysoprase , the eleventh was jacinth , and the twelfth was amethyst .
66021021	The twelve gates were twelve pearls ; each one of the gates was made from a single pearl . And the city’s main street was pure gold , as transparent as glass .
66021022	I didn’t see a temple in the city , because its temple is the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb .
66021023	The city doesn’t need the sun or the moon to shine on it , because God’s glory is its light , and its lamp is the Lamb .
66021024	The nations will walk by its light , and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it .
66021025	Its gates will never be shut by day , and there will be no night there .
66021026	They will bring the glory and honor of the nations into it .
66021027	Nothing unclean will ever enter it , nor anyone who does what is vile and deceitful , but only those who are registered in the Lamb’s scroll of life .
66022001	Then the angel showed me the river of life-giving water , shining like crystal , flowing from the throne of God and the Lamb
66022002	through the middle of the city’s main street . On each side of the river is the tree of life , which produces twelve crops of fruit , bearing its fruit each month . The tree’s leaves are for the healing of the nations .
66022003	There will no longer be any curse . The throne of God and the Lamb will be in it , and his servants will worship him .
66022004	They will see his face , and his name will be on their foreheads .
66022005	Night will be no more . They won’t need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun , for the Lord God will shine on them , and they will rule forever and always .
66022006	Then he said to me , “ These words are trustworthy and true . The Lord , the God of the spirits of the prophets , sent his angel to show his servants what must soon take place .
66022007	" Look ! I’m coming soon . Favored is the one who keeps the words of the prophecy contained in this scroll . "
66022008	I , John , am the one who heard and saw these things . When I heard and saw them , I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who had shown them to me .
66022009	But he said to me , " Don’t do that ! I’m a servant just like you and your brothers and sisters , the prophets , and those who keep the words of this scroll . Worship God ! "
66022010	Then he said to me , " Don’t seal up the words of the prophecy contained in this scroll , because the time is near .
66022011	Let those who do wrong keep doing what is wrong . Let the filthy still be filthy . Let those who are righteous keep doing what is right . Let those who are holy still be holy .
66022012	" Look ! I’m coming soon . My reward is with me , to repay all people as their actions deserve .
66022013	I am the alpha and the omega , the first and the last , the beginning and the end .
66022014	Favored are those who wash their robes so that they may have the right of access to the tree of life and may enter the city by the gates .
66022015	Outside are the dogs , the drug users and spell-casters , those who commit sexual immorality , the murderers , the idolaters , and all who love and practice deception .
66022016	" I , Jesus , have sent my angel to bear witness to all of you about these things for the churches . I’m the root and descendant of David , the bright morning star .
66022017	The Spirit and the bride say , ‘ Come ! ’ Let the one who hears say , ‘ Come ! ’ And let the one who is thirsty come ! Let the one who wishes receive life-giving water as a gift . "
66022018	Now I bear witness to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy contained in this scroll : If anyone adds to them , God will add to that person the plagues that are written in this scroll .
66022019	If anyone takes away from the words of this scroll of prophecy , God will take away that person’s share in the tree of life and the holy city , which are described in this scroll .
66022020	The one who bears witness to these things says , " Yes , I’m coming soon . " Amen . Come , Lord Jesus !
66022021	The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all .
