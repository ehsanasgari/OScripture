# copyright_long:       Tree of Life<br><br>Messianic Jewish Family Bible Project<br>A diverse community of Messianic Jewish and Christian scholars collaborated to produce The Tree of Life Messianic Family Bible-The New Covenant. Messianic rabbis, leaders, scholars, artists, professors, psalmists, linguists, writers, parents, and children came together to work on this groundbreaking version that is meant for the entire family to read and enjoy together. Wisdom is a tree of life to those who take hold of her, and happy are those who hold her fast (Proverbs 3:18). If you are a Jew who is curious about Messiah, this book will help you, with guidance from the Holy Spirit, to see how Yeshua became the Prophet, like Moses, full of glory, grace, and truth. Compare what the New Covenant says with what the Hebrew Bible says-the footnotes point the way for you. Many modern-day Christians recognize the value of rediscovering the Jewish roots of their faith, and Messianic Jews are growing in numbers and scholarship. The middle wall of partition is crumbling, and unity is being restored, teaching that diversity is strength.
40001001	The book of the genealogy of Yeshua ha-Mashiach , Ben-David , Ben-Avraham :
40001002	Abraham fathered Isaac , Isaac fathered Jacob , Jacob fathered Judah and his brothers ,
40001003	Judah fathered Perez and Zerah by Tamar , Perez fathered Hezron , Hezron fathered Ram ,
40001004	Ram fathered Amminadab , Amminadab fathered Nahshon , Nahshon fathered Salmon ,
40001005	Salmon fathered Boaz by Rahab , Boaz fathered Obed by Ruth , Obed fathered Jesse ,
40001006	and Jesse fathered David the king . David fathered Solomon by the wife of Uriah ,
40001007	Solomon fathered Rehoboam , Rehoboam fathered Abijah , Abijah fathered Asa ,
40001008	Asa fathered Jehoshaphat , Jehoshaphat fathered Joram , Joram fathered Uzziah ,
40001009	Uzziah fathered Jotham , Jotham fathered Ahaz , Ahaz fathered Hezekiah ,
40001010	Hezekiah fathered Manasseh , Manasseh fathered Amon , Amon fathered Josiah ,
40001011	and Josiah fathered Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon .
40001012	After the Babylonian exile Jeconiah fathered Shealtiel , Shealtiel fathered Zerubbabel ,
40001013	Zerubbabel fathered Abiud , Abiud fathered Eliakim , Eliakim fathered Azor ,
40001014	Azor fathered Zadok , Zadok fathered Achim , Achim fathered Eliud ,
40001015	Eliud fathered Eleazar , Eleazar fathered Matthan , Matthan fathered Jacob ,
40001016	and Jacob fathered Joseph the husband of Miriam , from whom was born Yeshua who is called the Messiah .
40001017	So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations , from David until the Babylonian exile are fourteen generations , and from the Babylonian exile until the Messiah are fourteen generations .
40001018	Now the birth of Yeshua the Messiah happened this way . When His mother Miriam was engaged to Joseph but before they came together , she was found to be pregnant through the Ruach ha-Kodesh .
40001019	And Joseph her husband , being a righteous man and not wanting to disgrace her publicly , made up his mind to dismiss her secretly .
40001020	But while he considered these things , behold , an angel of Adonai appeared to him in a dream , saying , “ Joseph son of David , do not be afraid to take Miriam as your wife , for the Child conceived in her is from the Ruach ha-Kodesh .
40001021	She will give birth to a son ; and you shall call His name Yeshua , for He will save His people from their sins . ”
40001022	Now all this took place to fulfill what was spoken by Adonai through the prophet , saying ,
40001023	“ Behold , the virgin shall conceive and give birth to a son , and they shall call His name Immanuel , ” which means “ God with us . ”
40001024	When Joseph woke up from his sleep , he did as the angel of Adonai commanded him and took Miriam as his wife .
40001025	But he did not know her intimately until she had given birth to a Son . And he called His name Yeshua .
40002001	Now after Yeshua was born in Bethlehem of Judea , in the days of King Herod , magi from the east came to Jerusalem ,
40002002	saying , “ Where is the One who has been born King of the Jews ? For we saw His star in the east and have come to worship Him . ”
40002003	When King Herod heard , he was troubled , and all Jerusalem with him .
40002004	And when he had called together all the ruling kohanim and Torah scholars , he began to inquire of them where the Messiah was to be born .
40002005	So they told him , “ In Bethlehem of Judea , for so it has been written by the prophet :
40002006	‘ And you , Bethlehem , land of Judah , are by no means least among the rulers of Judah ; For out of you shall come a ruler who will shepherd My people Israel . ’ ”
40002007	Then Herod secretly called the magi and determined from them the exact time the star had appeared .
40002008	And he sent them to Bethlehem and said , “ Go and search carefully for the Child . And when you have found Him , bring word back to me so that I may come and worship Him as well . ”
40002009	After listening to the king , they went their way . And behold , the star they had seen in the east went on before them , until it came to rest over the place where the Child was .
40002010	When they saw the star , they rejoiced exceedingly with great gladness .
40002011	And when they came into the house , they saw the Child with His mother Miriam ; and they fell down and worshiped Him . Then , opening their treasures , they presented to Him gifts of gold , frankincense , and myrrh .
40002012	And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod , they returned to their own country by another way .
40002013	Now when they had gone , behold , an angel of Adonai appears to Joseph in a dream , saying , “ Get up ! Take the Child and His mother and flee to Egypt . Stay there until I tell you , for Herod is about to search for the Child , to kill Him . ”
40002014	So he got up , took the Child and His mother during the night , and went to Egypt .
40002015	He stayed there until Herod’s death . This was to fulfill what was spoken by Adonai through the prophet , saying , “ Out of Egypt I called My Son . ”
40002016	Then when Herod saw that he had been tricked by the magi , he became furious . And he sent and killed all boys in Bethlehem and in all its surrounding area , from two years old and under , according to the time he had determined from the magi .
40002017	Then was fulfilled what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet , saying ,
40002018	“ A voice is heard in Ramah , weeping and loud wailing , Rachel sobbing for her children and refusing to be comforted , because they are no more . ”
40002019	But when Herod died , behold , an angel of Adonai appears in a dream to Joseph in Egypt ,
40002020	saying , “ Get up ! Take the Child and His mother and go to the land of Israel , for those seeking the Child’s life are dead . ”
40002021	So he got up , took the Child and His mother , and went to the land of Israel .
40002022	But hearing that Archelaus was king of Judea in place of his father Herod , he became afraid to go there . Then after being warned in a dream , he withdrew to the region of the Galilee .
40002023	And he went and lived in a city called Natzeret , to fulfill what was spoken through the prophets , that Yeshua shall be called a Natzrati .
40003001	In those days , John the Immerser came proclaiming in the wilderness of Judea ,
40003002	“ Turn away from your sins , for the kingdom of heaven is near ! ”
40003003	For he is the one Isaiah the prophet spoke about , saying , “ The voice of one crying in the wilderness , ‘ Prepare the way of Adonai , and make His paths straight . ’ ”
40003004	Now John wore clothing from camel’s hair and a leather belt around his waist , and his food was locusts and wild honey .
40003005	Then Jerusalem was going out to him , and all Judea and all the region around the Jordan .
40003006	Confessing their sins , they were being immersed by him in the Jordan River .
40003007	But when he saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his immersion , he said to them , “ You brood of vipers ! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath ?
40003008	Therefore produce fruit worthy of repentance ;
40003009	and do not think that you can say to yourselves , ‘ We have Abraham as our father ’ ! For I tell you that from these stones God can raise up children for Abraham .
40003010	Already the axe is laid at the root of the trees ; therefore every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire !
40003011	“ As for me , I immerse you in water for repentance . But the One coming after me is mightier than I am ; I am not worthy to carry His sandals . He will immerse you in the Ruach ha-Kodesh and fire .
40003012	His winnowing fork is in His hand , and He shall clear His threshing floor and gather His wheat into the barn ; but the chaff He shall burn up with inextinguishable fire . ”
40003013	Then Yeshua came from the Galilee to John , to be immersed by him in the Jordan .
40003014	But John tried to prevent Him , saying , “ I need to be immersed by You , and You are coming to me ? ”
40003015	But Yeshua responded , “ Let it happen now , for in this way it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness . ” So John yielded to Him .
40003016	After being immersed , Yeshua rose up out of the water ; and behold , the heavens were opened to Him , and He saw the Ruach Elohim descending like a dove and coming upon Him .
40003017	And behold , a voice from the heavens said , “ This is My Son , whom I love ; with Him I am well pleased ! ”
40004001	Then Yeshua was led by the Ruach into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil .
40004002	After He had fasted for forty days and forty nights , He was hungry .
40004003	And when the tempter came to Him , he said , “ If You are Ben-Elohim , tell these stones to become bread . ”
40004004	But He replied , “ It is written , ‘ Man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word that comes from the mouth of God . ’ ”
40004005	Then the devil took Him into the holy city and placed Him on the highest point of the Temple .
40004006	“ If You are Ben-Elohim , ” he said , “ throw Yourself down . For it is written , ‘ He shall command His angels concerning you , ’ and ‘ upon their hands they shall lift you up , so that you may not strike your foot against a stone . ’ ”
40004007	Yeshua said to him , “ Again it is written , ‘ You shall not put Adonai your God to the test . ’ ”
40004008	Again , the devil takes Him to a very high mountain and shows Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory .
40004009	And he said to Him , “ All these things I will give You , if You fall down and worship me . ”
40004010	Then Yeshua says to him , “ Go away , satan ! For it is written , ‘ You shall worship Adonai your God , and Him only shall you serve . ’ ”
40004011	Then the devil leaves Him . And behold , angels came and began to take care of Him .
40004012	Now when Yeshua heard that John had been handed over , He withdrew to the Galilee .
40004013	Leaving Natzeret , He came and settled in Capernaum , which is by the sea in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali .
40004014	This was to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet , saying ,
40004015	“ Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali , the way of the sea , beyond the Jordan , Galilee of the nations —
40004016	the people sitting in darkness have seen a great light , and those sitting in the region and shadow of death , on them a light has dawned . ”
40004017	From then on , Yeshua began to proclaim , “ Turn away from your sins , for the kingdom of heaven is near . ”
40004018	Now as Yeshua was walking by the Sea of Galilee , He saw two brothers , Simon who was called Peter and Andrew his brother . They were casting a net into the sea , for they were fishermen .
40004019	And He said to them , “ Follow Me , and I will make you fishers of men . ”
40004020	Immediately they left their nets and followed Him .
40004021	Going on from there , He saw two other brothers , Jacob the son of Zebedee and John his brother . They were in the boat with Zebedee their father , mending their nets , and He called them .
40004022	Immediately they left the boat and their father and followed Him .
40004023	Yeshua was going throughout all the Galilee , teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the Good News of the kingdom , and healing every kind of disease and sickness among the people .
40004024	News about Him spread throughout all Syria . And they brought to Him all the sick — those tormented by various diseases and afflictions , those plagued by demons , the epileptics , the paralyzed — and He healed them .
40004025	And large crowds followed Him from the Galilee , the Decapolis , Jerusalem , Judea , and beyond the Jordan .
40005001	Now when Yeshua saw the crowds , He went up on the mountain . And after He sat down , His disciples came to Him .
40005002	And He opened His mouth and began to teach them , saying ,
40005003	“ Blessed are the poor in spirit , for theirs is the kingdom of heaven .
40005004	“ Blessed are those who mourn , for they shall be comforted .
40005005	“ Blessed are the meek , for they shall inherit the earth .
40005006	“ Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness , for they shall be satisfied .
40005007	“ Blessed are the merciful , for they shall be shown mercy .
40005008	“ Blessed are the pure in heart , for they shall see God .
40005009	“ Blessed are the peacemakers , for they shall be called sons of God .
40005010	“ Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness , for theirs is the kingdom of heaven .
40005011	“ Blessed are you when people revile you and persecute you and say all kinds of evil against you falsely , on account of Me .
40005012	Rejoice and be glad , for your reward in heaven is great ! For in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you . ”
40005013	“ You are the salt of the earth ; but if the salt should lose its flavor , how shall it be made salty again ? It is no longer good for anything , except to be thrown out and trampled under foot by men .
40005014	“ You are the light of the world . A city set on a hill cannot be hidden .
40005015	Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a basket . Instead , they put it on a lampstand so it gives light to all in the house .
40005016	In the same way , let your light shine before men so they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven . ”
40005017	“ Do not think that I came to abolish the Torah or the Prophets ! I did not come to abolish , but to fulfill .
40005018	Amen , I tell you , until heaven and earth pass away , not the smallest letter or serif shall ever pass away from the Torah until all things come to pass .
40005019	Therefore , whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments , and teaches others the same , shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven . But whoever keeps and teaches them , this one shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven .
40005020	For I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the Pharisees and Torah scholars , you shall never enter the kingdom of heaven !
40005021	“ You have heard it was said to those of old , ‘ You shall not murder , and whoever commits murder shall be subject to judgment . ’
40005022	I tell you now that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be subject to judgment . And whoever says to his brother , ‘ Raca ’ shall be subject to the council ; and whoever says , ‘ You fool ! ’ shall be subject to fiery Gehenna .
40005023	“ Therefore if you are presenting your offering upon the altar , and there remember that your brother has something against you ,
40005024	leave your offering there before the altar and go . First be reconciled to your brother , and then come and present your offering .
40005025	“ Make friends quickly with your opponent while you are with him on the way . Otherwise , your opponent may hand you over to the judge , and the judge to the assistant , and you will be thrown into prison .
40005026	Amen , I tell you , you will never get out of there until you have paid back the last penny !
40005027	“ You have heard that it was said , ‘ You shall not commit adultery . ’
40005028	I tell you that everyone who looks upon a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart .
40005029	And if your right eye causes you to stumble , gouge it out and throw it away ! It is better for you that one part of your body should be destroyed , than that your whole body be thrown into Gehenna .
40005030	And if your right hand causes you to stumble , cut it off and throw it away ! It is better for you that one part of your body should be destroyed , than that your whole body go into Gehenna .
40005031	“ It was said , ‘ Whoever sends his wife away , let him give her a certificate of divorce . ’
40005032	I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife , except for sexual immorality , makes her commit adultery ; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery .
40005033	“ Again , you have heard that it was said to those of old , ‘ You shall not swear falsely , but shall carry out your oaths to Adonai . ’
40005034	I tell you , do not swear at all — not by heaven , for it is the throne of God ;
40005035	or by the earth , for it is the footstool of His feet ; or by Jerusalem , for it is the city of the Great King .
40005036	And do not swear by your head , for you cannot make a single hair white or black .
40005037	But let your word ‘ Yes’ be ‘ Yes’ and your ‘ No , ’ ‘ No’ — anything more than this is from the evil one . ”
40005038	“ You have heard that it was said , ‘ An eye for an eye , and a tooth for a tooth . ’
40005039	I tell you , do not resist an evildoer . But whoever slaps you on your right cheek , turn to him also the other .
40005040	And the one wanting to sue you and to take your shirt , let him also have your coat .
40005041	Whoever forces you to go one mile , go with him two .
40005042	Give to the one who asks of you , and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you .
40005043	“ You have heard that it was said , ‘ You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy . ’
40005044	I tell you , love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you ,
40005045	so that you may be children of your Father in heaven . He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good , and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous .
40005046	For if you love those who love you , what reward do you have ? Even the tax collectors do the same , don’t they ?
40005047	And if you greet only your brothers , what more are you doing than anyone else ? Even the pagans do that , don’t they ?
40005048	Therefore be perfect , just as your Father in heaven is perfect . ”
40006001	“ Beware of practicing your righteousness before others to be seen by them ; otherwise you have no reward from your Father in heaven .
40006002	So whenever you do tzedakah , do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets , so that they may be glorified by men . Amen , I tell you , they have their reward in full !
40006003	But when you do tzedakah , do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing ,
40006004	so that your tzedakah may be in secret ; and your Father , who sees in secret , shall reward you .
40006005	“ When you pray , do not be like the hypocrites ; for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners , so that they may be seen by others . Amen , I tell you , they have their reward in full !
40006006	But you , when you pray , go into your inner room ; and when you have shut your door , pray to your Father who is in secret . And your Father , who sees in secret , shall reward you .
40006007	And when you are praying , do not babble on and on like the pagans ; for they think they will be heard because of their many words .
40006008	Do not be like them , for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him .
40006009	“ Therefore , pray in this way : ‘ Our Father in heaven , sanctified be Your name .
40006010	Your kingdom come , Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven .
40006011	Give us this day our daily bread .
40006012	And forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors .
40006013	And lead us not into temptation , but deliver us from the evil one . ’
40006014	“ For if you forgive others their transgressions , your heavenly Father will also forgive you .
40006015	But if you do not forgive others , neither will your Father forgive your transgressions .
40006016	“ And whenever you fast , do not become sad-faced like the hypocrites , for they neglect their faces to make their fasting evident to men . Amen , I tell you , they have their reward in full !
40006017	But when you fast , anoint your head and wash your face ,
40006018	so that your fasting won’t be evident to men , but to your Father who is in secret . And your Father , who sees in secret , will reward you .
40006019	“ Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth , where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal .
40006020	But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven , where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in or steal .
40006021	For where your treasure is , there will your heart be also .
40006022	“ The eye is the lamp of the body . Therefore if your eye is good , your whole body will be full of light .
40006023	But if your eye is bad , your body will be full of darkness . If therefore the light that is in you is darkness , how great is the darkness !
40006024	“ No one can serve two masters ; for either he will hate the one and love the other , or he will stick by one and look down on the other . You cannot serve God and money . ”
40006025	“ So I say to you , do not worry about your life — what you will eat or drink , or about your body , what you will wear . Isn’t life more than food and the body more than clothing ?
40006026	“ Look at the birds of the air . They do not sow or reap or gather into barns ; yet your Father in heaven feeds them . Are you not of more value than they ?
40006027	And which of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life ?
40006028	And why do you worry about clothing ? Consider the lilies of the field , how they grow . They neither toil nor spin .
40006029	Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory clothed himself like one of these .
40006030	Now if in this way God clothes the grass — which is here today and thrown into the furnace tomorrow — will He not much more clothe you , O you of little faith ?
40006031	“ Therefore do not worry , saying , ‘ What will we eat ? ’ or ‘ What will we drink ? ’ or ‘ What will we wear ? ’
40006032	For the pagans eagerly pursue all these things ; yet your Father in heaven knows that you need all these .
40006033	But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness , and all these things shall be added to you .
40006034	Therefore do not worry about tomorrow , for tomorrow will worry about itself . Each day has enough trouble of its own . ”
40007001	“ Stop judging , so that you may not be judged .
40007002	For with the judgment you judge , you will be judged ; and with the measure you use , it will be measured to you .
40007003	“ Why do you look at the speck in your brother’s eye , but do not notice the beam in your own eye ?
40007004	Or how will you say to your brother , ‘ Let me take the speck out of your eye , ’ and look , the beam is in your own eye ?
40007005	Hypocrite , first take the beam out of your own eye , and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother’s eye .
40007006	“ Do not give what is holy to dogs or throw your pearls before pigs ; otherwise they will trample them under their feet , then turn and rip you to shreds .
40007007	“ Ask , and it shall be given to you . Seek , and you shall find . Knock , and it shall be opened to you .
40007008	For everyone who asks receives , and the one who seeks finds , and to the one who knocks it shall be opened .
40007009	“ For what man among you , when his son asks him for bread , will give him a stone ?
40007010	Or when he asks for a fish , will give him a snake ?
40007011	If you then , being evil , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask Him !
40007012	So in all things , do to others what you would want them to do to you — for this is the Torah and the Prophets .
40007013	“ Enter through the narrow gate ; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction , and those who enter through it are many .
40007014	How narrow is the gate and difficult the way that leads to life , and those who find it are few . ”
40007015	“ Watch out for false prophets , who come to you in sheep’s clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves .
40007016	You will recognize them by their fruit . Grapes aren’t gathered from thorn bushes or figs from thistles , are they ?
40007017	Even so , every good tree produces good fruit , but the rotten tree produces bad fruit .
40007018	A good tree cannot produce bad fruit , nor can a rotten tree produce good fruit .
40007019	Every tree that does not produce good fruit is chopped down and thrown into the fire .
40007020	So then , you will recognize them by their fruit .
40007021	“ Not everyone who says to Me , ‘ Lord , Lord ! ’ will enter the kingdom of heaven , but he who does the will of My Father in heaven .
40007022	Many will say to Me on that day , ‘ Lord , Lord , didn’t we prophesy in Your name , and drive out demons in Your name , and perform many miracles in Your name ? ’
40007023	Then I will declare to them , ‘ I never knew you . Get away from Me , you workers of lawlessness ! ’ ”
40007024	“ Therefore everyone who hears these words of Mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock .
40007025	And the rain fell , and the floods came , and the winds blew and beat against that house ; and yet it did not fall , for its foundation had been built on the rock .
40007026	Everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not act on them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand .
40007027	And the rain fell , and the floods came , and the winds blew and beat against that house ; and it fell — and great was its fall . ”
40007028	Now when Yeshua had finished these words , the crowds were astounded at His teaching ,
40007029	for He was teaching them as one having authority and not as their Torah scholars .
40008001	When He came down from the mountain , large crowds followed Him .
40008002	And a man with tzara’at came to Him and bowed down before Him , saying , “ Master , if You are willing , You can make me clean . ”
40008003	Yeshua stretched out His hand and touched him , saying , “ I am willing . Be cleansed . ” Immediately his tzara’at was cleansed .
40008004	And Yeshua said to him , “ See that you tell no one ; but go show yourself to the kohen and offer the gift that Moses commanded , as a testimony to them . ”
40008005	Now when Yeshua came into Capernaum , a centurion came begging for help .
40008006	“ Master , ” he said , “ my servant is lying at home paralyzed , horribly tormented . ”
40008007	Yeshua said to him , “ I’ll come and heal him . ”
40008008	But the centurion said , “ Master , I’m not worthy to have You come under my roof . But just say the word and my servant will be healed .
40008009	For I also am a man under authority , with soldiers under me . I say to this one , ‘ Go ! ’ and he goes ; and to another , ‘ Come ! ’ and he comes ; and to my servant , ‘ Do this ! ’ and he does it . ”
40008010	Now when Yeshua heard this , He marveled and said to those who were following , “ Amen , I tell you , I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith !
40008011	Moreover , I tell you that many will come from the east and the west , and they will recline at table with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven .
40008012	But the sons of the kingdom will be driven out into the outer darkness ; in that place will be weeping and gnashing of teeth . ”
40008013	Then Yeshua said to the centurion , “ Go . As you have believed , let it be done for you . ” And the servant was healed in that same hour .
40008014	And when Yeshua came into Peter’s house , He saw Peter’s mother-in-law lying down , sick with a fever .
40008015	Yeshua touched her hand , and the fever left her . Then she got up and began to take care of Him .
40008016	When evening came , the people brought to Him many who were afflicted by demons . He forced out the spirits with a word and healed all who were sick .
40008017	So was fulfilled what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet , saying , “ He Himself took our sicknesses and carried away our diseases . ”
40008018	Now when Yeshua saw a crowd around Him , He gave orders to go to the other side of the sea .
40008019	Then a Torah scholar came to Him and said , “ Teacher , I will follow You wherever You go . ”
40008020	Yeshua tells him , “ Foxes have dens and birds of the air have nests , but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head . ”
40008021	Then another of the disciples said , “ Master , first let me go and bury my father . ”
40008022	But Yeshua tells him , “ Follow Me , and let the dead bury their own dead . ”
40008023	As He got into the boat , His disciples followed Him .
40008024	Suddenly a great storm arose on the sea , so that the boat was being covered by the waves . But Yeshua kept on sleeping .
40008025	So they came and woke Him up , saying , “ Master , save us ! We’re perishing ! ”
40008026	He said to them , “ Why are you afraid , O you of little faith ? ” Then He got up and rebuked the winds and the sea , and it became totally calm .
40008027	The men were amazed , saying , “ What kind of person is this ? Even the winds and the sea obey Him ! ”
40008028	When He came to the other side , into the region of the Gadarenes , two demon-plagued men coming from the graveyard met Him . They were so violent that no one could pass by that way .
40008029	And they screamed , “ What’s between You and us , Ben-Elohim ? Have You come here to torment us , before the appointed time ? ”
40008030	Now a large herd of pigs was feeding some distance away from them .
40008031	The demons kept begging Him , “ If You drive us out , send us into the herd of pigs . ”
40008032	And He told them , “ Go ! ” So they came out and went into the pigs , and the whole herd rushed down the cliff into the sea and drowned .
40008033	The herdsmen ran away , went into the town , and told everything , including what had happened to the demon-plagued men .
40008034	The whole town came out to meet Yeshua . And when they saw him , they begged Him to leave their region .
40009001	After getting into a boat , Yeshua crossed over and came to His own town .
40009002	Just then , some people brought to Him a paralyzed man lying on a cot . And seeing their faith , Yeshua said to the paralyzed man , “ Take courage , son ! Your sins are forgiven . ”
40009003	Then some of the Torah scholars said among themselves , “ This fellow blasphemes ! ”
40009004	And knowing their thoughts , Yeshua said , “ Why are you entertaining evil in your hearts ?
40009005	For which is easier , to say , ‘ Your sins are forgiven , ’ or to say , ‘ Get up and walk ’ ?
40009006	But so you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to pardon sins . . . ” Then He tells the paralyzed man , “ Get up , take your cot and go home . ”
40009007	And he got up and went home .
40009008	When the crowd saw it , they were afraid and glorified God , who had given such authority to men .
40009009	As Yeshua was passing by from there , He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector’s booth . He said to him , “ Follow Me . ” And he got up and followed Him .
40009010	Now it happened that when Yeshua was reclining at the table in the house , many tax collectors and sinners came and were reclining with Yeshua and His disciples .
40009011	When the Pharisees saw this , they said to His disciples , “ Why does this Teacher of yours eat with tax collectors and sinners ? ”
40009012	But when He heard this , Yeshua said , “ Those who are healthy have no need for a doctor , but those who are sick do .
40009013	Now go and learn what this means : ‘ Mercy I desire , and not sacrifice . ’ For I didn’t come to call the righteous , but the sinful . ”
40009014	Then John’s disciples came to Him , saying , “ Why do we and the Pharisees fast , but Your disciples do not fast ? ”
40009015	And Yeshua said to them , “ The guests of the bridegroom cannot mourn while the bridegroom is with them , can they ? But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them , and then they will fast .
40009016	“ And no one puts a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment , for the patch pulls away from the garment and a worse tear happens .
40009017	Nor do they put new wine into old wineskins . Otherwise the skins burst , and the wine spills out and the skins are ruined . But they put new wine into fresh wineskins , and both are preserved . ”
40009018	Just as He was saying these things to them , a synagogue leader came and began to bow before Him , saying , “ My daughter has just died , but come lay Your hand on her and she will live . ”
40009019	And Yeshua got up and began to follow him , with His disciples .
40009020	Just then a woman , losing blood for twelve years , came from behind and touched the tzitzit of His garment .
40009021	For she kept saying to herself , “ If only I touch His garment , I will be healed . ”
40009022	But then Yeshua turned and saw her . “ Take heart , daughter , ” He said , “ your faith has made you well . ” That very hour the woman was healed .
40009023	When Yeshua came into the synagogue leader’s house and saw the flute players and the noisy crowd wailing ,
40009024	He said , “ Go away , for the girl isn’t dead , but sleeping . ” And they began jeering at Him .
40009025	But when the crowd had been cleared out , He went in and took her hand , and the girl got up .
40009026	And news of this spread all around that region .
40009027	As Yeshua went on from there , two blind men followed Him , crying out , “ Ben-David , have mercy on us ! ”
40009028	When He went into the house , the blind men came to Him . And Yeshua said to them , “ Do you believe that I am able to do this ? ” “ Yes , Master , ” they said to Him .
40009029	Then He touched their eyes , saying , “ According to your faith , let it be done for you . ”
40009030	And their eyes were opened . And Yeshua warned them sternly , “ See that no one knows . ”
40009031	But they went out and spread the news about Him all around that region .
40009032	As they were going out , a mute man plagued by a demon was brought to Him .
40009033	After the demon was driven out , the mute man started speaking . The crowds were astounded , saying , “ Never has anything like this been seen in Israel ! ”
40009034	But the Pharisees were saying , “ By the prince of demons He drives out demons . ”
40009035	Now Yeshua was going around all the towns and villages , teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the Good News of the kingdom , and healing every kind of disease and sickness .
40009036	When He saw the crowds , He felt compassion for them , because they were harassed and helpless , like sheep without a shepherd .
40009037	Then He said to His disciples , “ The harvest is plentiful , but the workers are few .
40009038	Therefore pray to the Lord of the harvest that He may send out workers into His harvest field . ”
40010001	Yeshua summoned His twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits , so they could drive them out and heal every kind of disease and sickness .
40010002	Now these are the names of the twelve shlichim : first , Simon , called Peter , and his brother Andrew ; Jacob the son of Zebedee and John his brother ;
40010003	Philip and Bartholomew ; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector ; Jacob , the son of Alphaeus , and Thaddaeus ;
40010004	Simon the Zealot , and Judah the man from Kriot , the one who also betrayed Him .
40010005	Yeshua sent out these twelve and ordered them , “ Do not go to the Gentiles , and do not enter into any Samaritan town .
40010006	But go instead to the lost sheep of the house of Israel .
40010007	As you go , proclaim , ‘ The kingdom of heaven has come near ! ’
40010008	Heal the sick , raise the dead , cleanse those with tzara’at , drive out demons . Freely you received , freely give .
40010009	Do not get gold or silver or copper for your money belts ,
40010010	or a bag for the journey , or two shirts , or sandals , or a walking stick ; for the worker is entitled to his food .
40010011	“ Whatever town or village you shall enter , find out who in it is worthy and stay there until you leave .
40010012	As you come into the house , greet it .
40010013	If the household is worthy , let your shalom come upon it . But if it’s not worthy , let your shalom return to you .
40010014	And whoever will not receive you or listen to your words , as you leave that house or that town , shake the dust off your feet .
40010015	Amen , I tell you , it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the Day of Judgment than for that town .
40010016	“ Behold , I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves , so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves .
40010017	But beware of men , for they will hand you over to the courts and flog you in their synagogues .
40010018	You will be brought before governors and kings because of Me , as a witness to them and to the Gentiles .
40010019	But when they hand you over , do not worry about how or what you should say , for it shall be given to you in that hour what you should say .
40010020	For it is not you speaking , but the Ruach of your Father speaking through you .
40010021	“ Brother will betray brother to death , and a father his child ; and children will rise up against their parents and have them put to death .
40010022	And you will be hated by all because of My name , but the one who endures to the end shall be saved .
40010023	Whenever they persecute you in one city , flee to the next . Amen , I tell you , you will never finish going through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes .
40010024	“ A disciple is not above his teacher , nor a slave above his master .
40010025	It is enough for the disciple to become like his teacher , and the slave like his master . If they have called the head of the house beelzebul , how much more the members of his household !
40010026	“ So do not fear them , for there is nothing concealed that will not be revealed and nothing hidden that will not be made known .
40010027	What I tell you in the darkness , speak in the light ; and what you hear in your ear , proclaim from the housetops !
40010028	And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul . Instead , fear the One who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna .
40010029	“ Are not two sparrows sold for a penny ? Yet not one of them shall fall to the ground apart from your Father’s consent .
40010030	But even the hairs of your head are all numbered .
40010031	So do not fear ; you are worth more than many sparrows .
40010032	“ Therefore whoever acknowledges Me before men , I will also acknowledge him before My Father who is in heaven .
40010033	But whoever denies Me before men , I will also deny him before My Father who is in heaven .
40010034	“ Do not think that I came to bring shalom on the earth ; I did not come to bring shalom , but a sword .
40010035	For I have come to set ‘ a man against his father , a daughter against her mother , and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law ;
40010036	and a man’s enemies will be the members of his household . ’
40010037	“ He who loves father or mother more than Me isn’t worthy of Me , and he who loves son or daughter more than Me isn’t worthy of Me .
40010038	And whoever does not take up his cross and follow after Me isn’t worthy of Me .
40010039	He who finds his life will lose it , and he who loses his life for My sake will find it .
40010040	“ He who receives you receives Me , and he who receives Me receives the One who sent Me .
40010041	He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward , and he who receives a tzaddik in the name of a tzaddik shall receive a tzaddik’s reward .
40010042	And whoever gives to one of these little ones even a cup of cold water in the name of a disciple , amen I tell you , he shall never lose his reward . ”
40011001	When Yeshua had finished instructing His twelve disciples , He went on from there to teach and preach in their towns .
40011002	Now when John heard in prison about the works of the Messiah , he sent word through his disciples
40011003	and said to Yeshua , “ Are You the Coming One , or do we look for another ? ”
40011004	Yeshua replied , “ Go report to John what you hear and see :
40011005	the blind see and the lame walk , those with tzara’at are cleansed and the deaf hear , and the dead are raised and the poor have good news proclaimed to them .
40011006	Blessed is the one who is not led to stumble because of Me . ”
40011007	Now as they were leaving , Yeshua began to talk to the crowd concerning John . “ What did you go out to the wilderness to see ? A reed shaken by the wind ?
40011008	No ? So what did you go out to see ? A man dressed in finery ? Look , those who wear finery are in the palaces of kings !
40011009	Then what did you go out to see ? A prophet ? Yes , I tell you , even more than a prophet .
40011010	This is the one about whom it is written , ‘ Behold , I send My messenger before You , who will prepare Your way before You . ’
40011011	“ Amen , I tell you , among those born of women , none has arisen greater than John the Immerser . Yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he .
40011012	From the days of John the Immerser until now , the kingdom of heaven is treated with violence , and the violent grasp hold of it .
40011013	For all the prophets and the Torah prophesied until the time of John .
40011014	And if you are willing to accept it , he is Elijah who is to come .
40011015	He who has ears , let him hear !
40011016	“ But to what shall I compare this generation ? It’s like children sitting in the marketplaces who call to one other , saying ,
40011017	‘ We played the flute for you , but you did not dance . We wailed , but you did not mourn . ’
40011018	“ For John came neither eating nor drinking , and they say , ‘ He has a demon ! ’
40011019	The Son of Man came eating and drinking , and they say , ‘ Look , a glutton and a drunkard , a friend of tax collectors and sinners ! ’ Yet wisdom is vindicated by her deeds . ”
40011020	Then Yeshua began to denounce the towns where most of His miracles had happened , because they did not turn from their sins .
40011021	“ Woe to you , Chorazin ! Woe to you , Bethsaida ! For if the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon , they would have turned long ago in sackcloth and ashes .
40011022	Nevertheless I tell you , it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the Day of Judgment than for you .
40011023	And you , Capernaum ? Will you be lifted up to heaven ? No , you will go down to Sheol ! For if the miracles done in you had been done in Sodom , it would have remained to this day .
40011024	Nevertheless I tell you that it will be more bearable for the land of Sodom on the Day of Judgment than for you . ”
40011025	At that time Yeshua said in response , “ I praise You , Father , Lord of heaven and of earth , that You have hidden these things from the wise and discerning and revealed them to infants .
40011026	Yes , Father , for this way was pleasing to You .
40011027	“ All things have been handed over to Me by My Father . No one knows the Son except the Father , and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him .
40011028	Come to Me , all who are weary and burdened , and I will give you rest .
40011029	Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me , for I am gentle and humble in heart , and ‘ you will find rest for your souls . ’
40011030	For My yoke is easy and My burden is light . ”
40012001	At that time Yeshua went through the grain fields on Shabbat . His disciples became hungry and began to pluck heads of grain and eat them .
40012002	But when the Pharisees saw this , they said to Him , “ Look , Your disciples are doing what is not permitted on Shabbat . ”
40012003	But He said to them , “ Haven’t you read what David did when he became hungry , and those with him ?
40012004	How he entered into the house of God , and they ate the showbread , which was not permitted for him to eat , nor for those with him , but only for the kohanim ?
40012005	Or haven’t you read in the Torah that on Shabbat the kohanim in the Temple break Shabbat and yet are innocent ?
40012006	But I tell you that something greater than the Temple is here .
40012007	If you had known what this means , ‘ I desire mercy , not sacrifice , ’ you wouldn’t have condemned the innocent .
40012008	For the Son of Man is Lord of Shabbat . ”
40012009	Leaving from there , He went into their synagogue .
40012010	A man with a withered hand was there . And so that they might accuse Him , they questioned Yeshua , saying , “ Is it permitted to heal on Shabbat ? ”
40012011	He said to them , “ What man among you will not grab his sheep and lift it out , if it falls into a pit on Shabbat ?
40012012	How much more valuable then is a man than a sheep ! Therefore it is permitted to do good on Shabbat . ”
40012013	Then He said to the man , “ Stretch out your hand . ” And he stretched it out and it was restored , as healthy as the other .
40012014	But the Pharisees went out and plotted against Him , how they might destroy Him .
40012015	Knowing this , Yeshua went away from there . And large crowds followed Him , and He healed them all .
40012016	And He sternly warned them not to make Him known .
40012017	This was to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet , saying ,
40012018	“ Here is My servant whom I chose , the One I love , in whom My soul takes delight . I will put My Ruach upon Him , and He shall proclaim justice to the nations .
40012019	He will not quarrel or cry out , nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets .
40012020	A crushed reed He will not break , and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out , until He brings forth justice to victory .
40012021	And in His name the nations shall hope . ”
40012022	Then a demon-plagued man , who was blind and mute , was brought to Yeshua ; and He healed him , so that he spoke and saw .
40012023	All the crowds were astounded and saying , “ This can’t be Ben-David , can it ? ”
40012024	But hearing this , the Pharisees said , “ This fellow drives out demons only by beelzebul , the ruler of demons . ”
40012025	Knowing their thoughts , Yeshua said to them , “ Every kingdom divided against itself is destroyed , and every city or house divided against itself will not stand .
40012026	If satan drives out satan , he is divided against himself ; how then will his kingdom stand ?
40012027	And if I drive out demons by beelzebul , by whom do your sons drive them out ? For this reason , they will be your judges .
40012028	But if I drive out demons by the Ruach Elohim , then the kingdom of God has come upon you .
40012029	Or how can one enter a strong man’s house and carry off his property , unless he first ties up the strong man ? Then he will thoroughly plunder his house .
40012030	He who is not with Me is against Me , and he who does not gather with Me scatters .
40012031	“ For this reason I say to you , every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men , but blasphemy against the Ruach will not be forgiven .
40012032	Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven , but whoever speaks against the Ruach ha-Kodesh will not be forgiven , neither in this age nor in the one to come . ”
40012033	“ Either make the tree good and its fruit good , or make the tree rotten and its fruit rotten ; for the tree is known by its fruit .
40012034	You brood of vipers ! How can you who are evil say anything good ? For from the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks .
40012035	The good man from his good treasury brings forth good , and the evil man from his evil treasury brings forth evil .
40012036	But I tell you that on the Day of Judgment , men will give account for every careless word they speak .
40012037	For by your words you will be justified , and by your words you will be condemned . ”
40012038	Then some of the Torah scholars and Pharisees answered Him , “ Teacher , we want to see a sign from You . ”
40012039	But Yeshua replied to them , “ An evil and adulterous generation clamors for a sign , yet no sign shall be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet .
40012040	For just as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish for three days and three nights , so the Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights .
40012041	The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it , because they repented at the preaching of Jonah . And behold , something greater than Jonah is here .
40012042	The Queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it , for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon . And behold , something greater than Solomon is here .
40012043	“ Now when an unclean spirit goes out of a man , it passes through waterless places looking for rest and doesn’t find it .
40012044	Then it says , ‘ I’ll go back home where I came from . ’ And when it comes , it finds the house vacant , swept clean , and put in order .
40012045	Then it goes and brings along seven other spirits more evil than itself , and they go in and live there . And that man’s last condition becomes worse than the first . So also will it be for this evil generation . ”
40012046	While Yeshua was still speaking to the crowds , His mother and brothers were standing outside , trying to speak to Him .
40012047	Someone said to Him , “ Look , Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside , trying to speak to You . ”
40012048	But to the one telling Him this , Yeshua responded , “ Who is My mother ? And who are My brothers ? ”
40012049	Stretching out His hand toward His disciples , He said , “ Here are My mother and My brothers .
40012050	For whoever does the will of My Father in heaven , he is My brother and sister and mother . ”
40013001	On that day after Yeshua left the house , He was sitting by the sea .
40013002	And large crowds gathered around Him ; so He got into a boat and sat down , and the whole crowd stood on the shore .
40013003	And He told them many things in parables , saying , “ Behold , a sower went out to spread some seed .
40013004	As he was scattering the seed , some seeds fell by the road ; and the birds came and ate them up .
40013005	Other seeds fell on rocky ground , where they didn’t have much soil . They sprang up immediately , because the soil wasn’t deep .
40013006	But when the sun came up , they were scorched ; and because they had no roots , they withered away .
40013007	Other seeds fell among the thorns , and the thorns grew and choked them out .
40013008	But others fell on good soil and were producing fruit . They yielded a crop — some a hundredfold , some sixty , some thirty .
40013009	He who has ears , let him hear . ”
40013010	Then the disciples came to Him and said , “ Why do You speak to them in parables ? ”
40013011	And He replied to them , “ To you has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven , but to them it has not been given .
40013012	For whoever has , to him more will be given and he will have plenty . But whoever does not have , even what he has will be taken away from him .
40013013	For this reason I speak to them in parables , because seeing they do not see , and hearing they do not hear nor do they understand .
40013014	” And in them the prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled , which says , ‘ You will keep on hearing but will never understand ; you will keep looking , but will never see .
40013015	For the heart of this people has become dull , their ears can barely hear , and they have shut their eyes . Otherwise they might see with their eyes , hear with their ears , and understand with their hearts . Then they would turn back , and I would heal them . ’
40013016	“ But blessed are your eyes because they see , and your ears because they hear .
40013017	Amen , I tell you , many a prophet and tzaddik longed to see what you are seeing and did not see , and to hear what you are hearing and did not hear . ”
40013018	“ You then , hear the parable of the sower .
40013019	When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and doesn’t understand it , the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart . This is the one having been sown along the road .
40013020	“ The one sown on rocky ground , this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy .
40013021	Yet he has no root himself but lasts only a short while ; and when trouble or persecution comes because of the word , immediately he falls away .
40013022	“ But the one sown among the thorns , this is the one who hears the word ; and the worries of the world and the seduction of wealth choke the word , and it becomes unfruitful .
40013023	“ Now the one sown on the good soil , this is the one who hears the word and understands . He indeed bears fruit , yielding a hundredfold , some sixty , some thirty times what was sown . ”
40013024	He presented to them another parable , saying , “ The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field .
40013025	But while the men were sleeping , his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away .
40013026	Now when the stalk sprouted and produced grain , then the weeds also appeared .
40013027	So the slaves of the landowner came and said to him , ‘ Master , didn’t you sow good seed in your field ? Then where did the weeds come from ? ’
40013028	But he replied , ‘ An enemy did this . ’ Now the slaves say to him , ‘ Do you want us , then , to go out and gather them up ? ’
40013029	But he says , ‘ No , for while you are gathering up the weeds , you may uproot the wheat with them .
40013030	Let both grow together until the harvest . At harvest time , I will tell the reapers , “ First , gather up the weeds and tie them in bundles to burn them up ; but gather the wheat into my barn . ’ ”
40013031	He presented to them another parable , saying , “ The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed , which a man took and planted in his field .
40013032	It’s the smallest of all seeds ; yet when it’s full grown , it’s greater than the other herbs . It becomes like a tree , so that the birds of the air come and nest in its branches . ”
40013033	He told them another parable , “ The kingdom of heaven is like hametz , which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour , until it was all leavened . ”
40013034	All these things Yeshua spoke to the crowds in parables . And apart from a parable , He wasn’t speaking to them ,
40013035	in order to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet , saying , “ I will open My mouth in parables , I will utter things hidden since the foundation of the world . ”
40013036	Then He sent the crowds away and went into the house . His disciples came to Him , saying , “ Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field . ”
40013037	He answered , “ The one sowing the good seed is the Son of Man ,
40013038	and the field is the world . And the good seed , these are the sons of the kingdom ; and the weeds are the sons of the evil one .
40013039	The enemy who sowed them is the devil , the harvest is the end of the age , and the reapers are angels .
40013040	Therefore just as the weeds are gathered up and burned with fire , so shall it be at the end of the age .
40013041	The Son of Man will send forth His angels , and they will gather out of His kingdom all stumbling blocks and those who practice lawlessness .
40013042	They will throw them into the fiery furnace ; in that place will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
40013043	Then the righteous will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father . He who has ears , let him hear !
40013044	“ The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field , which a man found and hid . And because of his joy , he goes out and sells all that he has and buys that field .
40013045	“ Again , the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant searching for fine pearls .
40013046	Upon finding a pearl of great value , he went out and sold all that he had and bought it .
40013047	“ Again , the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet that was cast into the sea , gathering things of every kind .
40013048	When it was filled , they pulled it ashore ; and they sat down and gathered up the good into containers , but threw the bad away .
40013049	So it will be at the end of the age . The angels will come forth and separate the wicked from among the righteous
40013050	and throw them into the fiery furnace ; in that place will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
40013051	“ Have you understood all these things ? ” They said to Him , “ Yes . ”
40013052	Then He said to them , “ Therefore every Torah scholar discipled for the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household who brings out of his treasure both new things and old . ”
40013053	Now when Yeshua had finished these parables , He left that place .
40013054	Coming into His hometown , He began to teach them in their synagogue so that they were amazed . “ Where did this fellow get this wisdom and these mighty works ? ” they said .
40013055	“ Isn’t this the carpenter’s son ? Isn’t His mother called Miriam , and His brothers Jacob and Joseph and Simon and Judah ?
40013056	And His sisters , aren’t they all with us ? So where does He get all these things ? ”
40013057	And they took offense at Him . But Yeshua said to them , “ A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and in his own house . ”
40013058	And He did not do many mighty works there because of their unbelief .
40014001	At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the report about Yeshua .
40014002	He said to his servants , “ This is John the Immerser — he has risen from the dead ! Because of this , these powers are at work in Him . ”
40014003	For Herod had arrested John , bound him , and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias , the wife of his brother Philip ,
40014004	because John had been telling him , “ It is not permitted for you to have her . ”
40014005	Although Herod wanted to kill John , he feared the crowd because they considered John a prophet .
40014006	But when Herod’s birthday celebration came , the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod ,
40014007	so much that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask .
40014008	Prompted by her mother , she said , “ Give me the head of John the Immerser , here on a platter ! ”
40014009	The king became sorrowful ; but because of his oaths and those reclining with him , he commanded it to be given .
40014010	And he sent and had John beheaded in the prison .
40014011	His head was brought on a platter and given to the girl , and she brought it to her mother .
40014012	John’s disciples came forth and took the body and buried it . Then they went and reported to Yeshua .
40014013	Now when Yeshua heard this , He went away from there privately by boat to an isolated place . But when the crowds heard , they followed Him on foot from the towns .
40014014	As Yeshua came ashore , He saw a large crowd and felt compassion for them and healed their sick .
40014015	When it became evening , the disciples came to Him , saying , “ This place is isolated , and the hour is already late . Send the crowds away so they can go into the villages and buy food for themselves . ”
40014016	But Yeshua said to them , “ They don’t need to leave — you give them something to eat . ”
40014017	“ We have nothing here except five loaves and two fish , ” they said to Him .
40014018	“ Bring them here to Me , ” He said .
40014019	Ordering the crowd to recline on the grass , He took the five loaves and the two fish ; and looking up to heaven , He offered the bracha . After breaking the loaves , He gave them to the disciples , and the disciples gave them to the crowds .
40014020	They all ate and were satisfied , and the disciples picked up twelve baskets full of broken pieces left over .
40014021	Now those eating were about five thousand men , besides women and children .
40014022	Right away , Yeshua made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of Him to the other side , while He sent the crowds away .
40014023	After He had sent the crowds away , He went up on the hillside by Himself to pray . And when evening came , He was there alone .
40014024	But the boat was already a long way from land , tossed around by the waves , for the wind was against it .
40014025	Now in the fourth watch of the night , Yeshua came to them , walking on the sea .
40014026	But when the disciples saw Him walking on the sea , they were terrified , saying , “ It’s a ghost ! ” And they cried out with fear .
40014027	But immediately , Yeshua spoke to them , saying , “ Take courage ! I am . Don’t be afraid . ”
40014028	Answering , Peter said to Him , “ Master , if it’s You , command me to come to You on the water . ”
40014029	And He said , “ Come ! ” And Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water to go to Yeshua .
40014030	But seeing the wind , he became terrified . And beginning to sink , he cried out , saying , “ Master , save me ! ”
40014031	Immediately Yeshua reached out His hand and grabbed him . And He said to him , “ O you of little faith , why did you doubt ? ”
40014032	When they got into the boat , the wind ceased .
40014033	And those in the boat worshiped Him , saying , “ You really are Ben-Elohim ! ”
40014034	After they had crossed over , they came to land at Gennesaret .
40014035	And when the men of that place recognized Yeshua , they sent word into all the surrounding region . And they brought to Him all those who were in bad shape
40014036	and kept begging Him that they might just touch the tzitzit of His garment — and all who touched it were cured .
40015001	Then some Pharisees and Torah scholars came to Yeshua from Jerusalem . They said ,
40015002	“ Why do Your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders ? For they do not do the ritual handwashing when they eat bread . ”
40015003	And answering , He said to them , “ Why do you also transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition ?
40015004	For God said , ‘ Honor your father and mother ’ and ‘ He who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death . ’
40015005	But you say , ‘ Whoever tells his father or mother , “ Whatever you might have gained from me is a gift to God , ”
40015006	he need not honor his father . ’ On account of your tradition , you made void the word of God .
40015007	Hypocrites ! Rightly did Isaiah prophesy about you , saying ,
40015008	‘ This people honors Me with their lips , but their heart is far from Me .
40015009	And in vain they worship Me , teaching as doctrines the commandments of men . ’ ”
40015010	Then Yeshua called the crowd and said to them , “ Hear and understand .
40015011	It’s not what goes into the mouth that makes the man unholy ; but what comes out of the mouth , this makes the man unholy . ”
40015012	Then the disciples came and said to Him , “ Do You know that the Pharisees took offense when they heard this saying ? ”
40015013	But He replied , “ Every plant that My heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted .
40015014	Leave them alone ; they are blind guides of the blind . And if a blind man leads a blind man , both will fall into a pit . ”
40015015	Then Peter answered and said to Him , “ Explain this parable to us . ”
40015016	“ Are you also still lacking understanding ? ” Yeshua said .
40015017	“ Don’t you grasp that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the stomach and then is ejected into the sewer ?
40015018	But the things that proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart , and those things make the man unholy .
40015019	For out of the heart come evil thoughts , murder , adultery , sexual immorality , theft , false witness , and slander .
40015020	These are the things that make the man unholy ; but to eat with unwashed hands does not make the man unholy . ”
40015021	Now Yeshua left from there and went away to the region of Tyre and Sidon .
40015022	And behold , a Canaanite woman from that district came out and started shouting , “ Have mercy on me , O Master , Ben-David ! My daughter is severely tormented by a demon . ”
40015023	But He did not answer her a word . And when His disciples came , they were urging Him , saying , “ Send her away , because she keeps shouting at us . ”
40015024	But He responded , “ I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel . ”
40015025	So she came and got down on her knees before Him , saying , “ Master , help me ! ”
40015026	And answering , He said , “ It’s not right to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs . ”
40015027	But she said , “ Yes , Master , but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters’ table . ”
40015028	Then answering , Yeshua said to her , “ O woman , great is your faith ! Let it be done for you as you wish . ” And her daughter was healed in that very hour .
40015029	After Yeshua left there , He went along the Sea of Galilee . Then He went up on a mountainside and was sitting there .
40015030	And large crowds came to Him , bringing with them the lame , blind , disabled , mute , and many others . And they laid them at His feet , and He healed them .
40015031	So the crowd marveled when they saw the mute speaking , the disabled made whole , the lame walking , and the blind seeing . And they praised the God of Israel .
40015032	Yeshua called His disciples and said , “ I have compassion for the crowd , because they’ve stayed with Me for three days now and have nothing to eat . I don’t want to send them away hungry , because they might pass out on the way . ”
40015033	The disciples said to Him , “ Where in this wasteland is enough bread to satisfy such a large crowd ? ”
40015034	Yeshua said to them , “ How many loaves do you have ? ” “ Seven , ” they said , “ and a few small fish . ”
40015035	After directing the crowd to recline on the ground ,
40015036	He took the seven loaves and the fish ; and after giving thanks , He broke them . And He began giving them to the disciples , and the disciples to the crowds .
40015037	And they all ate and were satisfied . And they picked up the broken pieces left over — seven baskets full .
40015038	And those who ate were four thousand men , besides women and children .
40015039	And after sending away the crowds , Yeshua got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan .
40016001	Now the Pharisees and Sadducees came up , and testing Yeshua , they asked Him to show them a sign from heaven .
40016002	But He replied to them , “ When evening comes , you say , ‘ Fair weather coming , for the sky is red , ’
40016003	and in the morning , ‘ Stormy weather today , for the sky is red and gloomy . ’ You know how to discern the appearance of the sky , but you cannot discern the signs of the times !
40016004	An evil and adulterous generation clamors for a sign , yet no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah . ” And leaving them behind , He went away .
40016005	Now when the disciples came to the other side of the sea , they had forgotten to take bread .
40016006	“ Watch out , ” Yeshua said to them , “ and beware of the hametz of the Pharisees and Sadducees . ”
40016007	And they began to discuss among themselves , saying , “ We didn’t bring any bread . ”
40016008	But knowing this , Yeshua said , “ O you of little faith , why do you discuss among yourselves that you have no bread ?
40016009	You still don’t get it ? Don’t you remember the five loaves for the five thousand , and how many baskets of leftovers you gathered ?
40016010	Or how about the seven loaves for the four thousand and all the baskets of leftovers you gathered ?
40016011	How is it that you don’t understand that I wasn’t talking to you about bread ? Now beware of the hametz of the Pharisees and Sadducees ! ”
40016012	Then they understood that He wasn’t talking about the hametz in the bread , but about the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees .
40016013	When Yeshua came into the region of Caesarea Philippi , He asked His disciples , “ Who do people say that the Son of Man is ? ”
40016014	They answered , “ Some say John the Immerser , others say Elijah , and still others say Jeremiah or one of the other prophets . ”
40016015	He said , “ But who do you say I am ? ”
40016016	Simon Peter answered , “ You are the Messiah , the Son of the living God . ”
40016017	Yeshua said to him , “ Blessed are you , Simon son of Jonah , because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you , but My Father who is in heaven !
40016018	And I also tell you that you are Peter , and upon this rock I will build My community ; and the gates of Sheol will not overpower it .
40016019	I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven . Whatever you forbid on earth will have been forbidden in heaven and what you permit on earth will have been permitted in heaven . ”
40016020	Then He ordered the disciples not to tell anyone that He was the Messiah .
40016021	From that time on , Yeshua began to show His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and ruling kohanim and Torah scholars , and be killed , and be raised on the third day .
40016022	Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him , saying , “ Never , Master ! This must never happen to You ! ”
40016023	But He turned and said to Peter , “ Get behind Me , satan ! You are a stumbling block to Me , for you are not setting your mind on the things of God , but the things of men . ”
40016024	Then Yeshua said to His disciples , “ If anyone wants to follow after Me , he must deny himself , take up his cross , and follow Me .
40016025	For whoever wants to save his life will lose it , but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it .
40016026	For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world but forfeits his soul ? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul ?
40016027	For the Son of Man is about to come in the glory of His Father with His angels , and then ‘ He will repay everyone according to his deeds . ’
40016028	Amen , I tell you , there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom . ”
40017001	After six days , Yeshua takes with Him Peter and Jacob and John his brother , and brings them up a high mountain by themselves .
40017002	Now He was transfigured before them ; His face shone like the sun , and His clothes became as white as the light .
40017003	And behold , Moses and Elijah appeared to them , talking with Yeshua .
40017004	Peter responded to Yeshua , “ Master , it’s good for us to be here ! If You wish , I will make three sukkot here — one for You , and one for Moses , and one for Elijah . ”
40017005	While He was still speaking , suddenly a bright cloud overshadowed them ; and behold , a voice from out of the cloud , saying , “ This is My Son , whom I love ; with Him I am well pleased . Listen to Him ! ”
40017006	When the disciples heard this , they fell face down , terrified .
40017007	But Yeshua came and touched them . “ Get up , ” He said . “ Stop being afraid . ”
40017008	And lifting their eyes , they saw no one except Yeshua alone .
40017009	As they were coming down from the mountain , Yeshua commanded them , saying , “ Do not tell anyone about the vision until the Son of Man is raised from the dead . ”
40017010	The disciples questioned Him , saying , “ Why then do the Torah scholars say that Elijah must come first ? ”
40017011	Yeshua replied , “ Indeed , Elijah is coming and will restore all things .
40017012	I tell you that Elijah already came ; and they didn’t recognize him , but did to him whatever they wanted . In the same way , the Son of Man is about to suffer at their hands . ”
40017013	Then the disciples understood that He was speaking to them about John the Immerser .
40017014	When they came to the crowd , a man came to Yeshua , falling on his knees before Him and saying ,
40017015	“ Master , have mercy on my son , for he has seizures and suffers badly . For he often falls into the fire and often into the water .
40017016	I brought him to Your disciples , but they couldn’t heal him . ”
40017017	And answering , Yeshua said , “ O faithless and twisted generation ! How long shall I be with you ? How long shall I put up with you ? Bring him here to Me . ”
40017018	Yeshua rebuked the demon and it came out of him , and the boy was healed from that very hour .
40017019	Then the disciples came to Yeshua in private and said , “ Why couldn’t we drive it out ? ”
40017020	And He said to them , “ Because you trust so little . Amen , I tell you , if you have faith the size of a mustard seed , you will say to this mountain , ‘ Move from here to there , ’ and it will move . Nothing will be impossible for you . ” ( 21 )
40017022	Now while they were gathering in the Galilee , Yeshua said to them , “ The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men ;
40017023	and they will kill Him , and on the third day He will be raised . ” And the disciples became greatly distressed .
40017024	When they came to Capernaum , the collectors of the Temple tax came to Peter and said , “ Your teacher pays the Temple tax , doesn’t He ? ”
40017025	“ Yes , ” Peter said . Now when Peter came into the house , Yeshua spoke to him first , saying , “ What do you think , Simon ? The kings of the earth , from whom do they collect tolls or tax ? From their sons or from strangers ? ”
40017026	After Peter said , “ From strangers , ” Yeshua said to him , “ Then the sons are free .
40017027	But so that we do not offend them , go to the sea and throw out a hook , and take the first fish that comes up . And when you open its mouth , you’ll find a coin . Take that , and give it to them , for Me and you . ”
40018001	At that hour the disciples came to Yeshua , saying , “ Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven ? ”
40018002	And He called a child to Himself , set him in the midst of them ,
40018003	and said , “ Amen , I tell you , unless you turn and become like children , you shall never enter the kingdom of heaven .
40018004	Whoever then shall humble himself like this child , this one is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven .
40018005	And whoever welcomes one such child in My name , welcomes Me .
40018006	“ But whoever causes one of these little ones who trust in Me to stumble , it would be better for him to have a heavy millstone hung around his neck and to be sunk in the depth of the sea !
40018007	Woe to the world because of snares ! For snares must come , but woe to that man through whom the snare comes !
40018008	“ And if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble , cut it off and throw it away from you . It’s better for you to enter into life crippled or lame than , having two hands or two feet , to be thrown into fiery Gehenna .
40018009	If your eye causes you to stumble , pluck it out and throw it away from you . It’s better for you to enter into life with one eye than , having two eyes , to be thrown into fiery Gehenna .
40018010	“ See that you do not despise one of these little ones , for I tell you that their angels in heaven continually see the face of My Father in heaven . ( 11 )
40018012	“ What do you think ? If a certain man has a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray , won’t he leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go looking for the one that is straying ?
40018013	And if he finds it , amen I tell you , he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that didn’t stray .
40018014	Even so , it’s not the will of your Father in heaven that one of these little ones should be lost . ”
40018015	“ Now if your brother sins against you , go and show him his fault while you’re with him alone . If he listens to you , you have won your brother .
40018016	But if he does not listen , take with you one or two more , so that ‘ by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may stand . ’
40018017	But if he refuses to listen to them , tell it to Messiah’s community . And if he refuses to listen even to Messiah’s community , let him be to you as a pagan and a tax collector .
40018018	“ Amen , I tell you , whatever you forbid on earth will have been forbidden in heaven and what you permit on earth will have been permitted in heaven .
40018019	Again I say to you , that if two of you agree on earth about anything they may ask , it shall be done for them by My Father in heaven .
40018020	For where two or three are gathered together in My name , there I am in their midst . ”
40018021	Then Peter came to Him and said , “ Master , how often shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me ? Up to seven times ? ”
40018022	Yeshua said to him , “ No , not up to seven times , I tell you , but seventy times seven !
40018023	Therefore , the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wanted to settle accounts with his slaves .
40018024	When he had begun to settle up , a man was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents .
40018025	But since he didn’t have the money to repay , his master ordered him to be sold , along with his wife and children and all that he had , and payment to be made .
40018026	Then the slave fell on his knees and begged him , saying , ‘ Be patient with me , and I’ll repay you everything . ’
40018027	And the master of that slave , filled with compassion , released him and forgave him the debt .
40018028	“ Now that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii . And he grabbed him and started choking him , saying , ‘ Pay back what you owe ! ’
40018029	“ So his fellow slave fell down and kept begging him , saying , ‘ Be patient with me , and I’ll pay you back . ’
40018030	Yet he was unwilling . Instead , he went off and threw the man into prison until he paid back all he owed .
40018031	“ So when his fellow slaves saw what had happened , they were deeply distressed . They went to their master and reported in detail all that had happened .
40018032	Then summoning the first slave , his master said to him , ‘ You wicked slave ! I forgave all that debt because you pleaded with me .
40018033	Wasn’t it necessary for you also to show mercy to your fellow slave , just as I showed mercy to you ? ’
40018034	Enraged , the master handed him over to the torturers until he paid back all he owed .
40018035	“ So also My heavenly Father will do to you , unless each of you , from your hearts , forgives his brother . ”
40019001	Now when Yeshua had finished these words , He moved on from the Galilee and entered the region of Judea beyond the Jordan .
40019002	Large crowds followed Him , and He healed them there .
40019003	Pharisees came up to Yeshua , testing Him and saying , “ Is it permitted for a man to divorce his wife for any reason at all ? ”
40019004	“ Haven’t you read ? ” He answered . “ He who created them from the beginning ‘ made them male and female ’
40019005	and said , ‘ For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife , and the two shall become one flesh . ’
40019006	So they are no longer two , but one flesh . Therefore what God has joined together , let no man separate . ”
40019007	They said to Him , “ Why then did Moses command to ‘ give her a certificate of divorce and put her away ? ’ ”
40019008	Yeshua said to them , “ Because of your hardness of heart Moses permitted you to divorce your wives , but from the beginning it was not so .
40019009	Now I tell you , whoever divorces his wife , except for sexual immorality , and marries another , commits adultery . ”
40019010	The disciples said to Him , “ If that’s the case for a man and his wife , it’s better not to marry ! ”
40019011	But He said to them , “ Not everyone can accept this saying — only those to whom it has been given .
40019012	For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother’s womb ; and there are eunuchs who were made that way by men ; and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven . He who can accept this , let him accept it . ”
40019013	Then little children were brought to Yeshua so that He might lay hands upon them and pray . Then the disciples rebuked those who brought them .
40019014	But Yeshua said , “ Let the little children come to Me and do not hinder them , for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these . ”
40019015	After laying His hands upon them , He went on from there .
40019016	Now behold , one came to Him and said , “ Teacher , what good shall I do to have eternal life ? ”
40019017	“ Why do you ask Me about what is good ? ” Yeshua said to him . “ There is only One who is good ; but if you want to enter into life , keep the commandments . ”
40019018	“ Which ones ? ” he said . Yeshua said , “ ‘ Do not murder , do not commit adultery , do not steal , do not give false testimony ,
40019019	honor your father and mother , ’ and ‘ love your neighbor as yourself . ’ ”
40019020	“ All these I’ve kept , ” the young man said to Him . “ What do I still lack ? ”
40019021	Yeshua said to him , “ If you wish to be perfect , go , sell what you own , and give to the poor ; and you will have treasure in heaven . Then come , follow Me . ”
40019022	But when the young man heard this statement , he went away grieving , for he had much property .
40019023	Then Yeshua said to His disciples , “ Amen , I tell you , it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven .
40019024	Again I tell you , it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle , than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God . ”
40019025	When the disciples heard this , they were utterly astonished and said , “ Then who can be saved ? ”
40019026	And looking , Yeshua said to them , “ With men this is impossible , but with God all things are possible . ”
40019027	Then Peter said to Him , “ Look , we’ve left everything to follow You ! So what will we have ? ”
40019028	And Yeshua said to them , “ Amen , I tell you , when the Son of Man sits on His glorious throne in the new world , you who have followed Me shall also sit on twelve thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
40019029	And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or property , for My name’s sake , will receive a hundred times as much , and will inherit eternal life .
40019030	But many who are first will be last , and the last first . ”
40020001	“ For the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household , who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard .
40020002	Now when he had agreed with the workers for a denarius per day , he sent them into his vineyard .
40020003	And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing in the marketplace , idle .
40020004	And to them he said , ‘ You go into the vineyard too , and I’ll give you whatever is right . ’
40020005	So they went . Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour and did the same .
40020006	And about the eleventh hour , he went out and found others standing around . And he said to them , ‘ Why have you been standing here idle the whole day ? ’
40020007	“ ‘ Because no one hired us , ’ they said to him . “ He said to them , ‘ You go into the vineyard , too . ’
40020008	“ Now when evening came , the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman , ‘ Call the workers and pay them their wages , beginning from the last to the first . ’
40020009	And those who had come about the eleventh hour each received a denarius .
40020010	And when the first came , they supposed that they would receive more ; yet they too received a denarius .
40020011	“ But when they received it , they began to grumble against the master of the house ,
40020012	saying , ‘ These last guys did one hour , and you’ve made them equal to us , who bore the burden and scorching heat of the day ! ’
40020013	“ But answering , he said to one of them , ‘ Friend , I’m doing you no wrong . Didn’t you agree with me on a denarius ?
40020014	Take what is yours and go . But I want to give this last guy the same as you .
40020015	Am I not permitted to do what I want with what belongs to me ? Or is your eye evil because I am good ? ’
40020016	“ So the last will be first , and the first last . ”
40020017	Now as Yeshua was going up to Jerusalem , He took the Twelve aside privately ; and on the way he told them ,
40020018	“ Look , we’re going up to Jerusalem , and the Son of Man will be handed over to the ruling kohanim and Torah scholars . They will condemn Him to death
40020019	and hand Him over to the Gentiles to mock , and to scourge , and to crucify . Yet on the third day , He will be raised up . ”
40020020	Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came with her sons to Yeshua , and she was kneeling down and asking something from Him .
40020021	“ What do you want ? ” He said to her . She said to Him , “ Declare that these two sons of mine might sit , one on Your right and one on Your left , in Your kingdom . ”
40020022	But Yeshua replied , “ You don’t know what you’re asking ! Are you able to drink the cup I am about to drink ? ” “ We are able , ” they say to Him .
40020023	He said to them , “ You shall indeed drink My cup . But to sit on My right and left , this isn’t Mine to grant . Rather , it’s for those for whom it has been prepared by My Father . ”
40020024	Now when the ten heard , they became indignant with the two brothers .
40020025	But Yeshua called them over and said , “ You know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them , and their great ones play the tyrant over them .
40020026	It shall not be this way among you . But whoever wants to be great among you shall be your servant ,
40020027	and whoever wants to be first among you shall be your slave —
40020028	just as the Son of Man did not come to be served , but to serve , and to give His life as a ransom for many . ”
40020029	Now as they were leaving Jericho , a large crowd followed Him .
40020030	And here two blind men sitting by the roadside , when they heard that Yeshua was passing by , cried out , saying , “ Have mercy on us , O Master , Ben-David ! ”
40020031	The crowd warned them to be quiet , but they cried out all the more , saying , “ Have mercy on us , O Master , Ben-David ! ”
40020032	Yeshua stopped and called out to them . “ What do you want Me to do for you ? ” He said .
40020033	They said to Him , “ Master , let our eyes be opened ! ”
40020034	Moved with compassion , Yeshua touched their eyes . Instantly they regained their sight and followed Him .
40021001	Now as they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage , to the Mount of Olives , then Yeshua sent two disciples ,
40021002	saying to them , “ Go into the village before you . Right away , you’ll find a donkey tied up and a colt with her . Untie them and bring them to Me .
40021003	If anyone says anything to you , you shall say , ‘ The Master needs them . ’ And right away he will send them . ”
40021004	This happened to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet , saying ,
40021005	“ Say to the daughter of Zion , ‘ See , your King is coming to you , humble and sitting on a donkey , a colt , the foal of a donkey . ’ ”
40021006	The disciples went and did as Yeshua had directed them .
40021007	They brought the donkey and colt and put their clothing on them , and He sat on the clothing .
40021008	Most of the crowd spread their clothing on the road , and others began cutting branches from the trees and spreading them on the road .
40021009	The crowds going before Him and those following kept shouting , saying , “ Hoshia-na to Ben-David ! Baruch ha-ba b’shem Adonai ! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord ! Hoshia-na in the highest ! ”
40021010	When He entered Jerusalem , the whole city was stirred up , saying , “ Who is this ? ”
40021011	And the crowds kept saying , “ This is the prophet Yeshua , from Natzeret in the Galilee . ”
40021012	Then Yeshua entered the Temple and drove out all those selling and buying in the Temple . He overturned the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of those selling doves .
40021013	And He said to them , “ It is written , ‘ My house shall be called a house of prayer , ’ but you are making it ‘ a den of thieves’ ! ”
40021014	The blind and lame came to Him in the Temple , and He healed them .
40021015	But when the ruling kohanim and Torah scholars saw the wonders He performed , and the children crying out in the Temple and saying , “ Hoshia-na to Ben-David , ” they became indignant .
40021016	And they said to Him , “ Do You hear what these children are saying ? ” “ Yes , ” Yeshua said to them . “ Haven’t you ever read , ‘ Out of the mouth of babes and nursing toddlers You have prepared praise for Yourself ’ ? ”
40021017	Then He left them and went out of the city to Bethany , and He spent the night there .
40021018	Now early in the morning , as He was returning to the city , He became hungry .
40021019	Seeing a lone fig tree by the road , He came up to it and found nothing on it except leaves only . And He said to it , “ May no fruit ever come from you again ! ” And the fig tree shriveled up at once .
40021020	When the disciples saw it they were astonished . “ How did the fig tree shrivel on the spot ? ” they asked .
40021021	Yeshua answered them , “ Amen , I tell you , if you have faith and do not doubt , not only will you do what was done to the fig tree , but even if you say to this mountain , ‘ Be taken up and thrown into the sea , ’ it will happen .
40021022	And whatever you ask in prayer , trusting , you shall receive . ”
40021023	Now when He entered the Temple , the ruling kohanim and the elders of the people came to Him while He was teaching , saying , “ By what authority are You doing these things ? Who gave You this authority ? ”
40021024	Yeshua replied to them , “ I also will ask you one question . If you tell Me , I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things .
40021025	John’s immersion , where was it from ? From heaven or from men ? ” They began to dialogue among themselves , saying , “ If we say , ‘ From heaven , ’ He will say to us , ‘ Then why didn’t you believe him ? ’
40021026	But if we say , ‘ From men , ’ we fear the crowd , for all hold up John as a prophet . ”
40021027	So answering Yeshua , they said , “ We don’t know . ” Then He said to them , “ Neither am I telling you by what authority I do these things . ”
40021028	“ Now what do you think ? A man had two sons , and he went to the first and said , ‘ Son , go work in the vineyard today . ’
40021029	The son answered , ‘ I won’t , ’ but afterward he had a change of heart and went .
40021030	The man went to the second son and said the same thing . But he answered , ‘ I will , sir , ’ and didn’t go .
40021031	Which of the two did the will of the father ? ” “ The first , ” they said . Yeshua said to them , “ Amen , I tell you , the tax collectors and prostitutes are going ahead of you into the kingdom of God .
40021032	For John came to you in the way of righteousness , and you did not believe him . But the tax collectors and prostitutes did believe him ; and even after you saw this , you had no change of heart to believe him . ”
40021033	“ Listen to another parable . There was a master of a household who planted a vineyard . He put a hedge around it , dug a winepress in it , and built a tower . Then He leased it to some tenant farmers and went on a journey .
40021034	Now when fruit season drew near , he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his fruit .
40021035	But grabbing his servants , the tenants beat up one , killed another , and stoned still another .
40021036	Again the master sent other servants , even more than the first , and they did the same thing to them .
40021037	Finally he sent his son to them , saying , ‘ They will respect my son . ’
40021038	“ But when the tenants saw the son , they said among themselves , ‘ This is the heir ! Come on , let’s kill him and get his inheritance ! ’
40021039	So grabbing him , they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him .
40021040	Therefore when the master of the vineyard comes , what will he do to those tenants ? ”
40021041	“ He will bring those miserable men to a miserable end , ” they said to Him , “ and will lease the vineyard to other tenants , who will give him his share of the fruits in their seasons . ”
40021042	Yeshua said to them , “ Have you never read in the Scriptures ? ‘ The stone which the builders rejected , this has become the chief cornerstone . This came from Adonai , and it is marvelous in our eyes . ’
40021043	Therefore I say to you , the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to people producing its fruits .
40021044	Whoever falls on this stone will be shattered ; but the one upon whom it falls , it will crush him . ”
40021045	When the ruling kohanim and Pharisees heard Yeshua’s parables , they realized He was talking about them .
40021046	Although they were trying to seize Him , they feared the crowds , because they regarded Him as a prophet .
40022001	Yeshua answered and spoke to them again in parables , saying ,
40022002	“ The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who made a wedding feast for his son .
40022003	He sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding feast , but they wouldn’t come .
40022004	Again he sent out other servants , saying , ‘ Tell those who were invited , “ Look , I’ve prepared my meal . My oxen and fattened cattle are killed , and everything is ready . Come to the wedding feast ! ” ’
40022005	“ But paying no attention , they went away , one to his own farm , another to his business .
40022006	And the rest grabbed his servants , humiliated them , and killed them .
40022007	Now the king became furious ! Sending his troops , he destroyed those murderers and set fire to their city .
40022008	“ Then he said to his servants , ‘ The wedding feast is ready , but those who were invited were not worthy .
40022009	So go into the highways and byways , and invite everyone you find to the wedding feast . ’
40022010	And those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all they found , both bad and good ; and the wedding was filled with guests .
40022011	“ But when the king came in to look over the guests , he saw a man there who wasn’t dressed in wedding clothes .
40022012	‘ Friend , ’ he said to him , ‘ how did you get in here without wedding clothes ? ’ But the man was silent .
40022013	Then the king said to his servants , ‘ Tie him up hand and foot , and throw him into the outer darkness ; in that place will be weeping and gnashing of teeth . ’
40022014	For many are called , but few are chosen . ”
40022015	Then the Pharisees went and plotted how they might trap Him with a word .
40022016	And they sent to Him some of their disciples , along with the Herodians , saying , “ Teacher , we know that You are honest and teach the way of God in truth . And what others think doesn’t concern You , for You do not look at men’s appearance .
40022017	Tell us therefore , what do You think ? Is it permitted to pay taxes to Caesar , or not ? ”
40022018	But Yeshua , knowing their wickedness , said , “ Why are you testing Me , you hypocrites ?
40022019	Show Me the tax money . ” So they brought Him a denarius .
40022020	And He said to them , “ Whose image is this ? And whose inscription ? ”
40022021	“ Caesar’s , ” they said to Him . Then He said to them , “ Give therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s , and to God the things that are God’s . ”
40022022	And hearing this , they were amazed . So they left Him and went away .
40022023	On that day , Sadducees ( who say there is no resurrection ) came to Yeshua and questioned Him , saying ,
40022024	“ Teacher , Moses said , ‘ If someone dies having no children , his brother as next of kin shall marry his widow and father children for his brother . ’
40022025	Now there were seven brothers among us . The first married and died ; and having no offspring , left his wife to his brother .
40022026	In the same way also the second , and the third , down to the seventh .
40022027	Last of all , the woman died .
40022028	So in the resurrection , whose wife of the seven will she be ? For they all had married her . ”
40022029	But answering , Yeshua said to them , “ You’ve gone astray , because you don’t understand the Scriptures or the power of God .
40022030	For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage , but are like angels in heaven .
40022031	But concerning the resurrection of the dead , haven’t you read what was spoken to you by God , saying ,
40022032	‘ I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ’ ? He is not the God of the dead , but of the living ! ”
40022033	When the crowds heard this , they were astounded at His teaching .
40022034	But the Pharisees , when they heard that Yeshua had silenced the Sadducees , gathered together in one place .
40022035	And testing Him , one of them , a lawyer , asked ,
40022036	“ Teacher , which is the greatest commandment in the Torah ? ”
40022037	And He said to him , “ ‘ You shall love Adonai your God with all your heart , and with all your soul , and with all your mind . ’
40022038	This is the first and greatest commandment .
40022039	And the second is like it , ‘ You shall love your neighbor as yourself . ’
40022040	The entire Torah and the Prophets hang on these two commandments . ”
40022041	Now while the Pharisees were gathered together , Yeshua asked them a question ,
40022042	saying , “ What do you think about the Messiah ? Whose Son is He ? ” “ David’s , ” they say to Him .
40022043	“ Then how is it , ” He says to them , “ that David by the Ruach calls him ‘ Lord ’ ?
40022044	For he says , ‘ Adonai said to my Lord , “ Sit at My right hand , until I put Your enemies under Your feet . ” ’
40022045	If David then calls Him ‘ Lord , ’ how is He his son ? ”
40022046	No one was able to answer Him a word . Nor did anyone dare from that day on to question Him any longer .
40023001	Then Yeshua spoke to the crowds and to His disciples ,
40023002	saying , “ The Torah scholars and Pharisees sit on the seat of Moses .
40023003	So whatever they tell you , do and observe . But don’t do what they do ; for what they say , they do not do .
40023004	They tie up heavy loads , hard to carry , and lay them on men’s shoulders ; but they themselves aren’t willing to lift a finger to move them .
40023005	All their works they do to be noticed by men . They make their tefillin wide and their tzitziyot long .
40023006	They love the place of honor at feasts , the best seats in the synagogues ,
40023007	greetings in the marketplaces , and to be called rabbi by men .
40023008	“ But you are not to be called rabbi ; for One is your Teacher , and you are all brethren .
40023009	And call no man on earth your father ; for One is your Father , who is in heaven .
40023010	Nor are you to be called teachers ; for One is your Teacher , the Messiah .
40023011	But the greatest among you shall be your servant .
40023012	Whoever exalts himself shall be humbled , and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted .
40023013	“ But woe to you , Torah scholars and Pharisees , hypocrites ! For you shut people out of the kingdom of heaven . For you do not enter yourselves , nor do you let those enter who are trying to go in . ( 14 )
40023015	“ Woe to you , Torah scholars and Pharisees , hypocrites ! For you travel over land and sea to make one convert . And when he becomes one , you make him twice as much a son of Gehenna as yourself .
40023016	“ Woe to you , blind guides ! You say , ‘ Whoever swears by the Temple , it is nothing ; but whoever swears by the gold of the Temple , he is obligated . ’
40023017	O fools and blind ones ! Which is greater , the gold or the Temple that made the gold holy ?
40023018	And you say , ‘ Whoever swears by the altar , it is nothing ; but whoever swears by the offering on it , he is obligated . ’
40023019	O blind ones ! Which is greater , the offering or the altar that makes the offering holy ?
40023020	Therefore , whoever swears by the altar , swears both by the altar and everything on it .
40023021	And whoever swears by the Temple , swears both by the Temple and by Him who dwells in it .
40023022	And whoever swears by heaven , swears both by the throne of God and by Him who sits on it .
40023023	“ Woe to you , Torah scholars and Pharisees , hypocrites ! You tithe mint and dill and cumin , yet you have neglected the weightier matters of Torah — justice and mercy and faithfulness . It is necessary to do these things without neglecting the others .
40023024	O blind guides , straining out a gnat while swallowing a camel !
40023025	“ Woe to you , Torah scholars and Pharisees , hypocrites ! You clean the outside of the cup and dish , but inside they are full of greed and uncontrolled desire .
40023026	O blind Pharisee ! First clean the inside of the cup and dish , so that the outside may become clean as well .
40023027	“ Woe to you , Torah scholars and Pharisees , hypocrites ! For you are like whitewashed tombs , which look beautiful on the outside but inside are full of dead men’s bones and everything unclean .
40023028	In the same way , you appear righteous to men on the outside , but are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness .
40023029	“ Woe to you , Torah scholars and Pharisees , hypocrites ! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the monuments of the tzaddikim .
40023030	And you say , ‘ If we’d been alive in the days of our forefathers , we wouldn’t have been partners with them in shedding the blood of the prophets . ’
40023031	So you testify against yourselves , that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets .
40023032	Fill up , then , the measure of your fathers !
40023033	O snakes , you brood of vipers ! How will you escape the condemnation of Gehenna ?
40023034	“ Because of this , behold , I’m sending you prophets and wise men and Torah scholars . Some of them you will kill and execute at the stake , and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city .
40023035	And so , upon you shall come all the righteous blood shed on earth , from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berechiah , whom you murdered between the Temple and the altar .
40023036	Amen , I tell you , all these things will come upon this generation . ”
40023037	“ O Jerusalem , Jerusalem who kills the prophets and stones those sent to her ! How often I longed to gather your children together , as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings , but you were not willing !
40023038	Look , your house is left to you desolate !
40023039	For I tell you , you will never see Me again until you say , ‘ Baruch ha-ba b’shem Adonai . Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord ! ’ ”
40024001	Now when Yeshua went out and was going away from the Temple , His disciples came up to point out to Him the Temple buildings .
40024002	“ Don’t you see all these ? ” He responded to them . “ Amen , I tell you , not one stone will be left here on top of another — every one will be torn down ! ”
40024003	As He was sitting on the Mount of Olives , the disciples came to Him privately , saying , “ Tell us , when will these things happen ? What will be the sign of Your coming and of the end of the age ? ”
40024004	Yeshua answered them , “ Be careful that no one leads you astray !
40024005	For many will come in My name , saying , ‘ I am the Messiah , ’ and will lead many astray .
40024006	You will hear of wars and rumors of wars . See that you are not alarmed , for this must happen but it is not yet the end .
40024007	For nation will rise up against nation , and kingdom against kingdom . And there will be famines and earthquakes in various places .
40024008	But all these things are only the beginning of birth pains .
40024009	“ Then they will hand you over to persecution and will kill you . You will be hated by all the nations because of My name .
40024010	And then many will fall away and will betray one another and hate one other .
40024011	Many false prophets will arise and lead many astray .
40024012	Because lawlessness will multiply , the love of many will grow cold .
40024013	But the one who endures to the end will be saved .
40024014	This Good News of the kingdom shall be proclaimed in the whole world as a testimony to all the nations , and then the end will come .
40024015	“ So when you see ‘ the abomination of desolation , ’ which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet , standing in the Holy Place ( let the reader understand ) ,
40024016	then those in Judea must flee to the mountains .
40024017	The one on the roof must not go down to take what is in his house ,
40024018	and the one in the field must not turn back to get his coat .
40024019	Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days !
40024020	Pray that your escape will not happen in winter , or on Shabbat .
40024021	For then there will be great trouble , such as has not happened since the beginning of the world until now , nor ever will .
40024022	And unless those days were cut short , no one would be delivered . But for the sake of the chosen , those days will be cut short .
40024023	“ Then if anyone says to you , ‘ Look , here’s the Messiah , ’ or ‘ There He is , ’ do not believe it .
40024024	For false messiahs and false prophets will rise up and show great signs and wonders so as to lead astray , if possible , even the chosen .
40024025	See , I have told you beforehand .
40024026	“ So if they say to you , ‘ Look , He is in the wilderness , ’ do not go out . Or , ‘ Look , He is in the inner rooms , ’ do not believe it .
40024027	For just as lightning comes from the east and flashes as far as the west , so also will be the coming of the Son of Man .
40024028	For wherever the carcass is , there the vultures will gather .
40024029	“ But immediately after the trouble of those days , ‘ the sun will be darkened , and the moon will not give its light and the stars will fall from heaven and the powers of the heavens will be shaken . ’
40024030	Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven , and then all the tribes of the land will mourn , and they will see ‘ the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven ’ with power and great glory .
40024031	He will send out His angels with a great shofar , and they will gather together His chosen from the four winds , from one end of heaven to the other . ”
40024032	“ Now learn the parable from the fig tree . When its branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves , you know that summer is near .
40024033	So also , when you see all these things , know that it is near , at the door .
40024034	Amen , I tell you , this generation will not pass away until all these things happen .
40024035	Heaven and earth will pass away , but My words will never pass away .
40024036	But of that day and hour no one knows , not even the angels of heaven nor the Son , except the Father alone .
40024037	“ For just as the days of Noah were , so will be the coming of the Son of Man .
40024038	For in those days before the flood , they were eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , until the day Noah entered the ark .
40024039	And they did not understand until the flood came and swept them all away . So shall it be at the coming of the Son of Man .
40024040	Then two men will be in the field , one taken and one left .
40024041	Two women will be grinding at the mill , one taken and one left .
40024042	Therefore stay alert ; for you do not know what day your Lord is coming .
40024043	But know this , that if the master of the house had known what time the thief was coming , he would have kept watch and not let his house be broken into .
40024044	So you also must be ready , for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect . ”
40024045	“ Who then is the faithful and wise servant , whom the master put in charge of his household to give them food at the proper time ?
40024046	Blessed is that servant whose master finds him so doing when he comes .
40024047	Amen , I tell you , his master will put him in charge of all his possessions .
40024048	But if that wicked servant says in his heart , ‘ My master is taking a long time , ’
40024049	and he begins to beat his fellow servants , and he eats and drinks with drunkards ,
40024050	the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know .
40024051	And he will cut him in two and assign his place with the hypocrites , where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth . ”
40025001	“ Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom .
40025002	Five of them were foolish , and five were wise .
40025003	For when the foolish ones took their lamps , they took no oil with them .
40025004	But the wise ones took oil in jars along with their lamps .
40025005	“ Now while the bridegroom was taking a long time , they all got drowsy and started falling asleep .
40025006	But in the middle of the night there was a shout , ‘ Look , the bridegroom ! Come out to meet him ! ’
40025007	Then all those virgins got up and trimmed their lamps .
40025008	Now the foolish ones said to the wise , ‘ Give us some of your oil , since our lamps are going out . ’
40025009	But the wise ones replied , ‘ No , there won’t be enough for us and for you . Instead , go to those who sell , and buy some for yourselves . ’
40025010	“ But while they were going off to buy , the bridegroom came . And those who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast , and the door was shut .
40025011	Now later , the other virgins came , saying , ‘ Sir , Sir , open up for us ! ’
40025012	“ But he replied , ‘ Amen , I tell you , I do not know you . ’
40025013	Therefore stay alert , for you know neither the day nor the hour . ”
40025014	“ For it is like a man about to go on a journey . He called his own servants and handed over his possessions to them .
40025015	To one he gave five talents , to another two , and to another one , each according to his own ability . Then he went on his journey .
40025016	“ Immediately the one who had received the five talents went and traded with them and gained five more .
40025017	In the same way , the one with two gained two more .
40025018	But the one who received one went off and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master’s money .
40025019	“ Now after a long time , the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them .
40025020	The one who had received the five talents came up and brought another five talents , saying , ‘ Master , you handed me five talents . Look , I’ve gained five more . ’
40025021	His master said to him , ‘ Well done , good and faithful servant ! You were faithful with a little , so I’ll put you in charge of much . Enter into your master’s joy ! ’
40025022	“ The one who had received the two talents also came up and said , ‘ Master , you handed me two talents . Look , I’ve gained two more . ’
40025023	His master said to him , ‘ Well done , good and faithful servant ! You were faithful with a little , so I’ll put you in charge of much . Enter into your master’s joy ! ’
40025024	“ Then the one who had received the one talent also came up and said , ‘ Master , I knew that you are a hard man , reaping where you didn’t sow and gathering where you scattered no seed .
40025025	So I was afraid , and I went off and hid your talent in the ground . See , you have what is yours . ’
40025026	“ But his master responded , ‘ You wicked , lazy servant ! You knew that I reap where I didn’t sow and gather where I scattered no seed ?
40025027	Then you should have brought my money to the brokers , and when I came I would have received it back with interest .
40025028	Therefore take the talent away from him , and give it to the one who has the ten talents .
40025029	For to the one who has , more shall be given , and he shall have an abundance . But from the one who does not have , even what he does have shall be taken away .
40025030	Throw the worthless servant out , into the outer darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth . ’ ”
40025031	“ Now when the Son of Man comes in His glory , and all the angels with Him , then He will sit on His glorious throne .
40025032	All the nations will be gathered before Him , and He will separate them from one another , just as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats .
40025033	And He will put the sheep on His right , but the goats on His left .
40025034	Then the King will say to those on His right , ‘ Come , you who are blessed by My Father , inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world .
40025035	For I was hungry and you gave Me something to eat ; I was thirsty and you gave Me something to drink ; I was a stranger and you invited Me in ;
40025036	I was naked and you clothed Me ; I was sick and you visited Me ; I was in prison and you came to Me . ’
40025037	“ Then the righteous will answer Him , ‘ Lord , when did we see You hungry and feed You ? Or thirsty and give You something to drink ?
40025038	And when did we see You a stranger and invite You in ? Or naked and clothe You ?
40025039	When did we see You sick , or in prison , and come to You ? ’
40025040	“ And answering , the King will say to them , ‘ Amen , I tell you , whatever you did to one of the least of these My brethren , you did it to Me . ’
40025041	Then He will also say to those on the left , ‘ Go away from Me , you cursed ones , into the everlasting fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels .
40025042	For I was hungry and you gave Me nothing to eat ; I was thirsty and you gave Me nothing to drink ;
40025043	I was a stranger and you did not invite Me in ; naked and you did not clothe Me ; sick and in prison and you did not visit Me . ’
40025044	“ Then they too will answer , saying , ‘ Lord , when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison , and did not care for You ? ’
40025045	Then He will answer them , saying , ‘ Amen , I tell you , whatever you did not do for one of the least of these , you did not do for Me . ’
40025046	These shall go off to everlasting punishment , but the righteous into everlasting life . ”
40026001	Now it happened that when Yeshua had finished all these words , He said to His disciples ,
40026002	“ You know that Passover comes in two days , and the Son of Man will be handed over to be executed . ”
40026003	Then the ruling kohanim and elders of the people were gathered together in the court of the kohen gadol named Caiaphas .
40026004	They plotted together in order that they might seize Yeshua by stealth and kill Him .
40026005	“ But not during the festival , ” they were saying , “ so there won’t be a riot among the people . ”
40026006	Now while Yeshua was in Bethany at the house of Simon ha-Metzora ,
40026007	a woman came up to Him with an alabaster jar of very expensive oil . And she poured it on His head as He was reclining at the table .
40026008	But when the disciples saw this , they were indignant , saying , “ Why this waste ?
40026009	It could have been sold for a lot , and the money given to the poor ! ”
40026010	But Yeshua , knowing this , said to them , “ Why do you cause trouble for this woman ? She’s done Me a mitzvah .
40026011	You always have the poor with you , but you won’t always have Me .
40026012	For when she poured this oil on My body , she did it to prepare Me for burial .
40026013	Amen , I tell you , wherever this Good News is proclaimed in all the world , what she has done will also be told in memory of her . ”
40026014	Then one of the Twelve , the one called Judah of Kriot , went to the ruling kohanim
40026015	and said , “ What are you willing to give me if I hand Him over to you ? ” And they weighed out thirty shekels of silver for him .
40026016	From then on , Judah began looking for a chance to hand Him over .
40026017	Now on the first day of matzah , the disciples came to Yeshua , saying , “ Where do You want us to prepare for You to eat the Passover ? ”
40026018	He said , “ Go into the city to a certain man , and tell him , ‘ The Teacher says , “ My time is near ; at your house I am to keep the Passover with My disciples . ” ’ ”
40026019	The disciples did as Yeshua had ordered them , and they prepared the Passover .
40026020	Now when it was evening , Yeshua was reclining at the table with the Twelve .
40026021	As they were eating , He said , “ Amen , I tell you , one of you will betray Me . ”
40026022	And being very sorrowful , they began , each one , to say to Him , “ I’m not the one , am I , Master ? ”
40026023	And He replied , “ The one who dipped his hand in the bowl with Me , he’s the one who will betray Me .
40026024	The Son of Man indeed goes , just as it is written about Him ; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed ! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born ! ”
40026025	And Judah , the one betraying Him , replied , “ I’m not the one , am I , Rabbi ? ” Yeshua said to him , “ You’ve said it yourself . ”
40026026	Now while they were eating , Yeshua took matzah ; and after He offered the bracha , He broke and gave to the disciples and said , “ Take , eat ; this is My body . ”
40026027	And He took a cup ; and after giving thanks , He gave to them , saying , “ Drink from it , all of you ;
40026028	for this is My blood of the covenant , which is poured out for many for the removal of sins .
40026029	But I say to you , I will never drink of this fruit of the vine from now on , until that day when I drink it anew with you in My Father’s kingdom . ”
40026030	After singing the Hallel , they went out to the Mount of Olives .
40026031	Then Yeshua said to them , “ This night you will all fall away because of Me ; for it is written , ‘ I will strike the Shepherd , and the sheep of the flock will be scattered . ’
40026032	But after I am raised up , I will go before you to the Galilee . ”
40026033	But Peter replied to Him , “ Though all fall away because of You , I’ll never fall away . ”
40026034	Yeshua said to him , “ Truly , I tell you , this very night , before a rooster crows , you will deny Me three times . ”
40026035	“ Even if I must die with You , ” Peter says to Him , “ I’ll never deny You ! ” And so said all the disciples .
40026036	Then Yeshua comes with them to a place called Gethsemane , and He tells the disciples , “ Sit here , while I go over there and pray . ”
40026037	And He took along Peter and Zebedee’s two sons , and He began to be sorrowful and troubled .
40026038	Then He tells them , “ My soul is deeply grieved , even to the point of death . Stay here and keep watch with Me . ”
40026039	Going a little farther , He fell face down and prayed , saying , “ My Father , if it is possible , let this cup pass from Me ! Yet not as I will , but as You will . ”
40026040	Then He comes to the disciples and finds them sleeping ; and He tells Peter , “ So couldn’t you keep watch with Me for one hour ?
40026041	Keep watching and praying , so that you won’t enter into temptation . The spirit is willing , but the flesh is weak . ”
40026042	Again for a second time He went away and prayed , saying , “ My Father , if this cannot pass away unless I drink it , let Your will be done . ”
40026043	And again He came and found them sleeping , for their eyes were heavy .
40026044	So He left them again and prayed a third time , saying the same words once more .
40026045	Then He comes to the disciples and says to them , “ Still sleeping ? Taking your rest ? Look , the hour is at hand , and the Son of Man is being delivered into the hands of sinners .
40026046	Get up , let’s go ! Look , My betrayer is near . ”
40026047	While Yeshua was still speaking , here came Judah , one of the Twelve , and with him a big crowd with swords and clubs , from the ruling kohanim and elders of the people .
40026048	Now His betrayer had given them a sign , saying , ‘ The One I kiss , He’s the One — seize Him ! ’
40026049	And immediately Judah drew near to Yeshua and said , “ Shalom , Rabbi ! ” and kissed Him .
40026050	“ Friend , ” Yeshua said to him , “ do what you’ve come to do . ” Then they came up and threw their hands on Yeshua and seized Him .
40026051	And suddenly , one of those with Yeshua stretched out his hand and drew his sword , and he struck the kohen gadol’s servant and cut off his ear .
40026052	Then Yeshua said to him , “ Put your sword back in its place ! For all who take up the sword shall perish by the sword .
40026053	Or do you suppose that I cannot call on My Father , and at once He will place at My side twelve legions of angels ?
40026054	How then would the Scriptures be fulfilled , that it must be so ? ”
40026055	At that hour Yeshua said to the crowds , “ Have you come out with swords and clubs , to capture Me as you would a revolutionary ? Every day I sat teaching in the Temple , and you didn’t seize Me .
40026056	But all this has happened so that the writings of the prophets would be fulfilled . ” Then all the disciples fled , abandoning Him .
40026057	Now those who had seized Yeshua led Him away to Caiaphas , the kohen gadol , where the Torah scholars and elders had gathered .
40026058	Peter was following Him from a distance as far as the courtyard of the kohen gadol . And after going inside , he was sitting with the guards , to see the outcome .
40026059	Now the ruling kohanim and all the Sanhedrin kept trying to get false testimony against Yeshua so they could put Him to death .
40026060	But they found none , though many false witnesses came forward . At last two came forward
40026061	and said , “ This fellow said , ‘ I’m able to destroy the Temple of God and rebuild it in three days ! ’ ”
40026062	The kohen gadol stood up and said to Yeshua , “ Have You no answer ? What’s this they’re testifying against You ? ”
40026063	But Yeshua kept silent . The kohen gadol said to Him , “ I charge You under oath by the living God , tell us if You are Mashiach Ben-Elohim ! ”
40026064	“ As you have said , ” replied Yeshua . “ Besides that , I tell you , soon after you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven . ”
40026065	Then the kohen gadol tore his clothes and said , “ Blasphemy ! Why do we need any more witnesses ? Look , you’ve heard the blasphemy .
40026066	What’s your verdict ? ” “ Guilty , ” they answered . “ He deserves death ! ”
40026067	Then they spat in His face and pounded Him with their fists . Others slapped Him and demanded ,
40026068	“ Prophesy to us , you Messiah ! Which one hit You ? ”
40026069	Meanwhile , Peter was sitting in the courtyard . A servant girl came over to him and said , “ You also were with Yeshua of the Galilee . ”
40026070	But he denied it before everyone , saying , “ I don’t know what you’re talking about ! ”
40026071	When he went onto the porch , another servant girl saw him and said to those who were there , “ This man was with Yeshua ha-Natzrati . ”
40026072	Again he denied it with an oath : “ I don’t know the Man ! ”
40026073	A little while later , some of the bystanders approached Peter and said to him , “ Surely you’re one of them , too — your accent gives you away . ”
40026074	Then he began to curse and to swear an oath : “ I do not know the Man ! ” Right then , a rooster crowed .
40026075	Then Peter reminded himself of the word Yeshua had said : “ Before the rooster crows , you will deny Me three times . ” And he went away and wept bitterly .
40027001	When daybreak came , the ruling kohanim and elders of the people conspired against Yeshua to put Him to death .
40027002	And they tied Him up , led Him away , and handed Him over to Pilate , the governor .
40027003	Then Judah , His betrayer , saw that Yeshua had been condemned . Feeling remorse , he brought the thirty silver pieces back to the ruling kohanim and elders ,
40027004	saying , “ I’ve sinned , betraying innocent blood ! ” But they said , “ What’s that to us ? You see to it yourself ! ”
40027005	After tossing the silver into the Temple sanctuary , he left . Then he went off and hanged himself .
40027006	But the ruling kohanim took the silver pieces and said , “ It is not permitted to put these in the treasury , since it is blood money . ”
40027007	So after they conferred , they bought with them the potter’s field , as a cemetery for strangers .
40027008	For this reason that field has been called the “ Field of Blood ” to this day .
40027009	Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet , saying , “ And they took the thirty silver pieces , the price of Him on whom a price had been set by B’nei-Israel ;
40027010	and they gave them for the potter’s field , just as Adonai arranged for me . ”
40027011	Now Yeshua stood before the governor . The governor questioned Him , saying , “ Are You the King of the Jews ? ” “ You say so , ” Yeshua said .
40027012	And while He was accused by the ruling kohanim and elders , He did not answer .
40027013	Then Pilate said to Him , “ Don’t You hear how many things they testify against you ? ”
40027014	Yeshua did not answer , not even one word , so the governor was greatly amazed .
40027015	Now during the feast , the governor was accustomed to release to the crowd one prisoner , anyone they wanted .
40027016	At that time they had a notorious prisoner , called Yeshua Bar-Abba .
40027017	So when they were gathered together , Pilate said to them , “ Which one do you want me to release for you ? Yeshua who is Bar-Abba , or Yeshua who is called Messiah ? ”
40027018	For he knew that they had handed Him over out of envy .
40027019	While Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat , his wife sent him a message , saying , “ Don’t have anything to do with that righteous Man , for today I’ve suffered many things in a dream because of Him . ”
40027020	Now the ruling kohanim and elders persuaded the crowds that they should ask for Bar-Abba and destroy Yeshua .
40027021	But the governor responded , “ Which of the two do you want me to release for you ? ” And they said , “ Bar-Abba ! ”
40027022	Pilate said to them , “ What then shall I do with Yeshua , who is called Messiah ? ” “ Execute Him ! ” all of them say .
40027023	But Pilate said , “ Why ? What evil has He done ? ” But they kept shouting all the more , saying , “ Let Him be executed ! ”
40027024	When Pilate saw he was accomplishing nothing , but instead a riot was starting , he took some water and washed his hands in front of the crowd . “ I am innocent of this blood , ” he said . “ You see to it yourselves ! ”
40027025	All the people answered and said , “ His blood be on us and on our children ! ”
40027026	Then he released to them Bar-Abba . And after he had Yeshua scourged , he handed Him over to be crucified .
40027027	Then the governor’s soldiers took Yeshua into the Praetorium and gathered the whole cohort around Him .
40027028	They stripped Him and put a scarlet robe around Him .
40027029	And after braiding a crown of thorns , they placed it on His head and put a staff in His right hand . And falling on their knees before Him , they mocked Him , saying , “ Hail , King of the Jews ! ”
40027030	They spat on Him , and they took the staff and beat Him over and over on the head .
40027031	When they finished mocking Him , they stripped the robe off Him and put His own clothes back on Him . And they led Him away to crucify Him .
40027032	As they came out , they found a man from Cyrene , Simon by name . They forced him into service , to carry Yeshua’s cross-beam .
40027033	And when they came to a place called Golgotha ( that is to say , Place of a Skull ) ,
40027034	they offered Him wine mixed with gall to drink ; but after tasting , He was unwilling to drink it .
40027035	And when they had crucified Him , they divided His clothing among themselves by casting lots .
40027036	And they sat down and kept guard over Him there .
40027037	Over His head they put the charge against Him , which read : “ THIS IS YESHUA , THE KING OF THE JEWS . ”
40027038	Then two outlaws were executed with Him , one on the right and one on the left .
40027039	Those passing by were jeering at Him , shaking their heads
40027040	and saying , “ You who are going to destroy the Temple and rebuild it in three days , save Yourself ! If you are Ben-Elohim , come down from the stake ! ”
40027041	Likewise the ruling kohanim , along with the Torah scholars and elders , were also mocking Him .
40027042	“ He saved others , ” they were saying , “ but He can’t save Himself ? He’s the King of Israel ! Let Him come down now from the stake , and we’ll believe in Him !
40027043	He trusts in God ; let God rescue Him now , if He wants Him . For He said , ‘ I am Ben-Elohim . ’ ”
40027044	Even the outlaws who were executed with Him were ridiculing Him in the same way .
40027045	Now from the sixth hour , darkness fell upon all the land until the ninth hour .
40027046	About the ninth hour Yeshua cried out with a loud voice , saying , “ Eli , Eli , lema sabachthani ? ” that is , “ My God , My God , why have You abandoned Me ? ”
40027047	When some of those standing there heard it , they began saying , “ This Man is calling for Elijah . ”
40027048	Right away one of them ran and took a sponge . He filled it with sour wine and put it on a stick , and was offering it to Yeshua to drink .
40027049	But the rest were saying , “ Leave Him alone ! Let’s see if Elijah comes to save Him . ”
40027050	And Yeshua cried out again with a loud voice and gave up His spirit .
40027051	And behold , the curtain of the Temple was split in two , from top to bottom . And the earth quaked and rocks were split apart .
40027052	And the tombs were opened , and many bodies of the kedoshim who were sleeping were raised to life .
40027053	And coming forth out of the tombs after His resurrection , they went into the holy city and appeared to many .
40027054	Now the centurion , and those with him keeping guard over Yeshua , when they saw the earthquake and what was happening , they became terribly frightened and said , “ This really was the Son of God ! ”
40027055	Many women were there , watching from a distance . They had followed Yeshua from the Galilee , serving Him .
40027056	Among them were Miriam from Magdala , Miriam the mother of Jacob and Joseph , and the mother of Zebedee’s sons .
40027057	Now when it was evening , there came a rich man from Arimathea , named Joseph , who had also become a disciple of Yeshua .
40027058	This man went to Pilate and asked for Yeshua’s body . Then Pilate ordered it to be given up .
40027059	And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth .
40027060	And he laid it in his own new tomb , which he had cut in the rock . Then he rolled a large stone up to the door of the tomb and went away .
40027061	Now Miriam from Magdala was there , and the other Miriam , sitting opposite the tomb .
40027062	Now on the next day , which is after the preparation , the ruling kohanim and Pharisees were gathered before Pilate .
40027063	“ Sir , ” they said , “ we remember how that deceiver said while He was still alive , ‘ After three days I’m to be raised . ’
40027064	Therefore , order the tomb to be made secure until the third day , so His disciples do not come and steal Him away . They will tell the people , ‘ He is risen from the dead , ’ and the last deception will be worse than the first ! ”
40027065	“ You have a guard , ” Pilate said to them . “ Go , make it as secure as you know how . ”
40027066	So they went and made the tomb secure , sealing the stone along with the soldiers of the guard .
40028001	Now after Shabbat , as it began to dawn on the first day of the week , Miriam of Magdala and the other Miriam came to look at the tomb .
40028002	And suddenly there was a great earthquake , for an angel of Adonai descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone and sat on it .
40028003	His appearance was like lightning , and his clothing as white as snow .
40028004	And those keeping watch were shaken for fear of him and became like dead men .
40028005	But the angel answered and said to the women , “ Do not be afraid , for I know you are looking for Yeshua who was crucified .
40028006	He is not here ; for He is risen , just as He said . Come , see the place where He was lying .
40028007	Go quickly now and tell His disciples that He is risen from the dead . And behold , He’s going before you to the Galilee . There you will see Him . See , I have told you ! ”
40028008	They quickly left the tomb , with fear yet with great joy , and ran to bring news to His disciples .
40028009	And behold , Yeshua met them . “ Shalom ! ” He said . They drew near , grasped his feet , and worshiped Him .
40028010	“ Don’t be afraid , ” Yeshua said to them . “ Go tell My brethren to head for the Galilee , and there they will see Me . ”
40028011	Now while they were going , some of the guard came into the city and reported to the ruling kohanim all that had happened .
40028012	And when they had assembled with the elders and consulted together , they gave a large sum of silver to the soldiers ,
40028013	saying , “ Tell them , ‘ His disciples came at night and stole Him away while we were sleeping . ’
40028014	And if this is heard by the governor , we’ll appease him and keep you out of trouble . ”
40028015	So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed . And this story was spread among the Judeans to this day .
40028016	Now the eleven disciples went to the Galilee , to the mountain Yeshua had designated .
40028017	When they saw Him , they worshiped ; but some wavered .
40028018	And Yeshua came up to them and spoke to them , saying , “ All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me .
40028019	Go therefore and make disciples of all nations , immersing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Ruach ha-Kodesh ,
40028020	teaching them to observe all I have commanded you . And remember ! I am with you always , even to the end of the age . ”
41001001	The beginning of the Good News of Yeshua ha-Mashiach , Ben-Elohim .
41001002	As Isaiah the prophet has written , “ Behold , I send My messenger before You , who will prepare Your way .
41001003	The voice of one crying in the wilderness , ‘ Prepare the way of Adonai , and make His paths straight . ’ ”
41001004	John appeared , immersing in the wilderness , proclaiming an immersion involving repentance for the removal of sins .
41001005	All the Judean countryside was going out to him , and all the Jerusalemites . As they confessed their sins , they were being immersed by him in the Jordan River .
41001006	John wore clothes made from camel’s hair , with a leather belt around his waist , and he ate locusts and wild honey .
41001007	“ After me comes One who is mightier than I am , ” he proclaimed . “ I’m not worthy to stoop down and untie the strap of His sandals !
41001008	I immersed you with water , but He will immerse you in the Ruach ha-Kodesh . ”
41001009	In those days , Yeshua came from Natzeret in the Galilee and was immersed by John in the Jordan .
41001010	Just as He was coming up out of the water , He saw the heavens ripping open and the Ruach as a dove coming down upon Him .
41001011	And there came a voice from the heavens : “ You are My Son , whom I love ; with You I am well pleased ! ”
41001012	That instant , the Ruach drives Him into the wilderness .
41001013	He was in the wilderness forty days , being tempted by satan . And He was with the wild beasts , and the angels were taking care of Him .
41001014	Now after John was put in jail , Yeshua came into the Galilee , proclaiming the Good News of God .
41001015	“ Now is the fullness of time , ” He said , “ and the kingdom of God is near ! Turn away from your sins , and believe in the Good News ! ”
41001016	Passing along by the Sea of Galilee , He saw Simon and Simon’s brother Andrew casting a net in the sea , for they were fishermen .
41001017	And Yeshua said to them , “ Follow Me , and I will make you become fishers of men . ”
41001018	Immediately they left their nets and followed Him .
41001019	Going a little farther , He saw Jacob the son of Zebedee and John his brother , who were in their boat mending the nets .
41001020	Immediately He called them , and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired hands and followed Him .
41001021	And they went into Capernaum . Right away , on Shabbat , He entered the synagogue and began to teach .
41001022	And they were astounded at His teaching , for He was teaching them as one having authority and not as the Torah scholars .
41001023	Just then there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit . And he cried out ,
41001024	“ What have we to do with You , Yeshua of Natzeret ? Have You come to destroy us ? I know who You are ! You’re the Holy One of God ! ”
41001025	Yeshua rebuked him , saying , “ Quiet ! Come out of him ! ”
41001026	And the unclean spirit , after throwing the man into convulsions and crying out with a loud voice , came out of him .
41001027	They were all so amazed that they asked among themselves , “ What is this ? A new teaching with authority ! He commands even the unclean spirits , and they obey Him ! ”
41001028	And immediately news about Him spread throughout the region surrounding the Galilee .
41001029	As soon as they left the synagogue , they went with Jacob and John to the house of Simon and Andrew .
41001030	Now Simon’s mother-in-law was lying sick with a fever . Right away , they told Yeshua about her .
41001031	He came and raised her up by taking her hand . The fever left her , and she began to take care of them .
41001032	When evening came , at sunset , the people brought to Him all the sick and those who were afflicted by demons .
41001033	The whole town gathered together at the door .
41001034	He healed many who were sick with various diseases and drove out many demons . And He would not allow the demons to speak , because they knew who He was .
41001035	Very early , while it was still night , Yeshua got up , left , and went away to a place in the wilderness ; and there He was praying .
41001036	Then Simon and those with him hunted for Yeshua .
41001037	And when they found Him , they said to Him , “ Everybody’s looking for You . ”
41001038	He said to them , “ Let’s go somewhere else , to the neighboring towns , so that I may proclaim the message there also — this is what I came for . ”
41001039	And He went throughout all the Galilee , proclaiming the message in their synagogues and driving out demons .
41001040	A man with tzara’at comes to Him , begging Him and falling on his knees , saying , “ If You are willing , You can make me clean . ”
41001041	Moved with compassion , Yeshua stretched out His hand and touched him . He said , “ I am willing . Be cleansed . ”
41001042	Immediately , the tzara’at left him , and he was cleansed .
41001043	Yeshua sent him away at once , sternly warning him .
41001044	He said to him , “ See that you say nothing to anyone , but go show yourself to the kohen . Then , for your cleansing , offer what Moses commanded , as a testimony to them . ”
41001045	But he went out and began to proclaim and spread the word , so much that Yeshua could no longer enter a town openly but had to stay out in wilderness areas . Still , they kept on coming to Him from everywhere .
41002001	When He returned to Capernaum after some days , it was heard that He was at the house .
41002002	So many were gathered that there was no longer room for them even outside the door . He kept proclaiming the word to them .
41002003	Some people came bringing to Him a paralyzed man , carried by four men .
41002004	When they couldn’t get near Yeshua because of the crowd , they removed the roof where He was . After digging through , they lowered the mat on which the paralyzed man was lying .
41002005	Yeshua , seeing their faith , said to the paralyzed man , “ Son , your sins are forgiven . ”
41002006	But some of the Torah scholars were sitting there , questioning in their hearts ,
41002007	“ Why does this fellow speak like this ? He blasphemes ! Who can pardon sins but God alone ? ”
41002008	Immediately Yeshua , knowing in His spirit that they were raising questions this way within themselves , said to them , “ Why are you questioning these things in your hearts ?
41002009	Which is easier , to say to the paralyzed man , ‘ Your sins are forgiven , ’ or to say , ‘ Get up , and take your mat and walk ’ ?
41002010	But so you may know that the Son of Man has authority to pardon sins on earth … . ” He tells the paralyzed man ,
41002011	“ I tell you , get up , take your mat and go home ! ”
41002012	At once the man got up , took his mat , and walked before them all . They were all astonished and glorified God , saying , “ We’ve never seen anything like this ! ”
41002013	Again , Yeshua went out by the sea . The whole crowd kept coming to Him , and He continued to teach them .
41002014	As He was passing by , He saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector’s booth . He said to him , “ Follow Me . ” And he got up and followed Him .
41002015	Now it happens that Yeshua was reclining at the table in Levi’s house , and many tax collectors and sinners were reclining with Yeshua and His disciples . For there were many , and they were following Him .
41002016	When the Torah scholars of the Pharisees saw Him eating with sinners and tax collectors , they began to say to His disciples , “ With tax collectors and sinners He eats ? ”
41002017	And when He heard this , Yeshua said to them , “ Those who are healthy have no need for a doctor , but those who are sick do . I did not come to call the righteous , but the sinful . ”
41002018	Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting . They came and said to Him , “ Why do the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees fast , but Your disciples do not fast ? ”
41002019	And Yeshua said to them , “ The guests of the bridegroom cannot fast while the bridegroom is with them , can they ? As long as they have the bridegroom with them , they cannot fast .
41002020	But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them , and then they will fast in that day .
41002021	“ No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment . Otherwise the patch pulls away from the old , and a worse tear happens .
41002022	And no one puts new wine into old wineskins . Otherwise , the wine will burst the skins ; and the wine is lost , also the skins . But one puts new wine into fresh wineskins . ”
41002023	Now it happened on Shabbat that Yeshua was going through the grain fields ; and His disciples began to make their way , plucking the heads of grain .
41002024	The Pharisees were saying to Him , “ Look , why are they doing what is not permitted on Shabbat ? ”
41002025	And He said to them , “ Haven’t you ever read what David did when he was in need , and he and those with him became hungry ?
41002026	How he entered into the house of God when Abiathar was kohen gadol and ate the showbread , which is permitted only for the kohanim to eat , and gave some even to those who were with him ? ”
41002027	Then He said to them , “ Shabbat was made for man , and not man for Shabbat .
41002028	So the Son of Man is Lord even of Shabbat . ”
41003001	Yeshua entered the synagogue again , and a man with a withered hand was there .
41003002	Now some were carefully watching Him , to see if He would heal him on Shabbat , so that they might accuse Him .
41003003	He said to the man with the withered hand , “ Stand up here in the center . ”
41003004	Then He said to them , “ Is it permitted on Shabbat to do good or to do evil , to save a life or to kill ? ” But they kept silent .
41003005	After looking around at them with anger , grieved by their hardness of heart , He says to the man , “ Stretch out your hand . ” And he stretched it out , and his hand was restored .
41003006	The Pharisees went out right away with the Herodians and began plotting against Him , how they might destroy Him .
41003007	Yeshua withdrew to the sea with His disciples , and a large crowd from the Galilee followed . From Judea ,
41003008	and from Jerusalem , and from Idumea , and beyond the Jordan , and around Tyre and Sidon , a great number , hearing all He was doing , came to Him .
41003009	He told His disciples to have a small boat ready for Him because of the crowd , so that they wouldn’t mob Him .
41003010	For He had healed many , so that all those afflicted fell down before Him in order to touch Him .
41003011	And the unclean spirits , whenever they saw Him , would fall down before Him and cry out , “ You are Ben-Elohim ! ”
41003012	But Yeshua strictly ordered them not to make Him known .
41003013	Now He climbs up on the mountain and calls those He Himself wanted , and they came to Him .
41003014	He appointed twelve ( whom He also named shlichim ) , so that they might be with Him and He might send them to proclaim the Good News ,
41003015	and to have power to drive out demons .
41003016	And He appointed the Twelve : to Simon He gave the name Peter ;
41003017	to Jacob and his brother John , the sons of Zebedee , He gave the name Boanerges , which is Sons of Thunder ;
41003018	and Andrew , Philip , Bartholomew , Matthew , Thomas , Jacob the son of Alphaeus , Thaddaeus , Simon the Zealot ;
41003019	and Judah from Kriot , who also betrayed Him .
41003020	Then He comes into a house , and again a crowd gathers so they couldn’t even eat .
41003021	When His family heard about this , they went out to take hold of Him ; for they were saying , “ He’s out of His mind ! ”
41003022	The Torah scholars who came down from Jerusalem said , “ He’s possessed by beelzebul , ” and , “ By the ruler of demons He drives out demons . ”
41003023	He called them and began speaking to them in parables : “ How can satan drive out satan ?
41003024	If a kingdom is divided against itself , that kingdom cannot stand .
41003025	And if a house is divided against itself , that house will not be able to stand .
41003026	And if satan has risen up against himself and is divided , he cannot stand but his end has come .
41003027	“ But no one can enter a strong man’s house to ransack his property , unless he first ties up the strong man . Then he will thoroughly plunder his house .
41003028	Amen , I tell you , all things will be forgiven the sons of men , the sins and whatever blasphemies they utter ;
41003029	but whoever slanders the Ruach ha-Kodesh never has release , but is guilty of an eternal sin ! ”
41003030	For they were saying , “ He has an unclean spirit . ”
41003031	Then His mother and brothers come . Standing outside , they sent word to Him , summoning Him .
41003032	A crowd was sitting around Him , and they tell Him , “ Look , Your mother and Your brothers are outside looking for You . ”
41003033	Answering them , He said , “ Who are My mother and My brothers ? ”
41003034	Looking at those sitting in a circle around Him , He said , “ Here are My mother and My brothers !
41003035	For whoever does the will of God , he is My brother and sister and mother . ”
41004001	Again Yeshua began to teach by the sea . A large crowd gathered around Him , so He got into a boat on the sea and sat down . And the crowd was by the sea on the land .
41004002	He began teaching them many things by parables , and in His teaching , He said to them :
41004003	“ Listen ! Behold , a sower went out to spread some seed .
41004004	It happened that as he sowed , some fell beside the road ; and the birds came and ate it up .
41004005	“ Other seed fell on rocky ground , where it didn’t have much soil . It sprang up immediately , because the soil wasn’t deep .
41004006	But when the sun came up , it was scorched ; and because it had no root , it withered away .
41004007	“ Other seed fell among the thorns ; and the thorns grew and choked it , and it yielded no crop .
41004008	“ And others fell into the good soil and were producing fruit , springing up and increasing . They yielded a crop , producing thirty , sixty , and a hundredfold . ”
41004009	And He said , “ He who has ears to hear , let him hear . ”
41004010	When Yeshua was alone , those around Him with the Twelve started asking Him about the parables .
41004011	And He told them , “ To you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God . But for those who are outside , everything is in parables , so that
41004012	‘ Seeing , they may see and not perceive , and hearing , they may hear and not understand , so they may not turn back and be forgiven . ’ ”
41004013	He said to them , “ Don’t you grasp this parable ? Then how will you understand all the parables ?
41004014	The sower sows the word .
41004015	These are the ones beside the road where the word is sown . Whenever they hear , satan comes quickly and takes away the word that has been sown in them .
41004016	“ These are the ones sown on rocky ground . When they hear the word , immediately they receive it with joy .
41004017	And they have no root in themselves but last only a short while . When trouble or persecution comes because of the word , immediately they fall away .
41004018	“ And others are the ones sown among the thorns . They have heard the word ;
41004019	but the worries of the world , the seduction of wealth , and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word , and it becomes unfruitful .
41004020	“ And those are the ones sown on the good soil . They hear the word and accept it and produce fruit , thirty , sixty , and a hundredfold . ”
41004021	He also was saying to them , “ Is a lamp put under a basket or a bed ? No , shouldn’t it be placed on a lampstand ?
41004022	For there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed , nor anything kept secret except that it would come to light .
41004023	If anyone has ears to hear , let him hear . ”
41004024	Then He continued , “ Pay attention to what you hear . With the measure you use , it will be measured to you ; and more will be added to you .
41004025	For whoever has , to him more will be given . And whoever does not have , even what he has will be taken away from him . ”
41004026	And He was saying , “ The kingdom of God is like when a man spreads seed on the soil
41004027	and falls asleep at night and gets up by day , and the seed sprouts and grows . He himself doesn’t know how .
41004028	Automatically , the earth brings forth a crop — first the blade , then the head , then the full grain in the head .
41004029	But when the grain is ready , at once he sends in the sickle , for the harvest has come . ”
41004030	Yeshua also said , “ How should we picture the kingdom of God ? Or by what story shall we present it ?
41004031	It is like a mustard seed when it’s planted in the ground . Though the smallest of all seeds in the earth , yet when planted it grows up and becomes the largest of all the herbs . It puts forth big branches , so the birds of the air can nest in its shade . ”
41004033	With many such parables He used to tell them the word , as much as they were able to hear .
41004034	But apart from a parable , He wasn’t speaking to them . Yet when they were alone , to His own disciples He would explain everything .
41004035	Now on that same day in the evening , He says to them , “ Let’s cross over to the other side . ”
41004036	After leaving the crowd , they take Him along in the boat , just as He was . And other boats were with Him .
41004037	A great windstorm arises , and the waves were rushing into the boat . The boat was beginning to fill up .
41004038	But Yeshua was in the back of the boat , sleeping on a pillow . They wake Him up and say to Him , “ Teacher , don’t you care that we are perishing ? ”
41004039	So He woke up and rebuked the wind . And He said to the sea , “ Quiet ! Be still ! ” Then the wind stopped , and it became totally calm .
41004040	And He said to them , “ Why are you afraid ? Even now you have no faith ? ”
41004041	They were struck with awe and said to one another , “ Who is this ? Even the wind and the sea obey Him ! ”
41005001	They came to the other side of the sea , into the country of the Gerasenes .
41005002	As soon as Yeshua got out of the boat , a man from the graveyard with an unclean spirit met Him .
41005003	He lived among the tombs , and no one could restrain him anymore , even with a chain .
41005004	For he had often been bound with shackles and chains , but the chains had been ripped apart by him and the shackles broken . No one was strong enough to tame him .
41005005	And through it all , night and day , at the graveyard and in the mountains , he kept screaming and gashing himself with stones .
41005006	When he saw Yeshua from a distance , he ran and bowed down before Him .
41005007	Crying out with a loud voice , he said , “ What’s between You and me , Yeshua , Ben El Elyon ? I’m warning you , in the name of God , do not torment me ! ”
41005008	For Yeshua had said to him , “ Come out of the man , you unclean spirit ! ”
41005009	Then Yeshua began questioning him , “ What is your name ? ” And he answered , “ My name is Legion , for we are many . ”
41005010	He kept begging Him not to send them out of the country .
41005011	Now a large herd of pigs was feeding on the hillside nearby .
41005012	The unclean spirits urged Him , saying , “ Send us to the pigs , so we may enter them . ”
41005013	So Yeshua gave them permission . The unclean spirits came out and entered the pigs . And the herd , about two thousand in number , rushed down the cliff and were drowned in the sea .
41005014	The herdsmen ran away and told the town and countryside , and they came to see what had happened .
41005015	Now they came to Yeshua and saw the madman who had had the legion . He was sitting there , dressed in clothes and in his right mind . The people were scared .
41005016	Those who had seen it described in detail what had happened to the man plagued by a demon , and they also told about the pigs .
41005017	And they began to beg Yeshua to leave their country .
41005018	As He was getting into the boat , the man who had been infested with demons kept begging to remain with Him .
41005019	Yeshua did not let him , but He told him , “ Go home to your friends and tell them how much Adonai has done for you , how He showed you mercy . ”
41005020	So he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how much Yeshua had done for him . And all were amazed .
41005021	When Yeshua had crossed over in the boat again to the other side , a big crowd gathered around Him ; and He was by the sea .
41005022	Then one of the synagogue leaders , named Jairus , comes . Seeing Him , he falls at His feet .
41005023	He begs Him a great deal , saying , “ My little daughter is near death ! Come and lay hands on her so that she may be healed and live ! ”
41005024	So Yeshua went off with him , and a big crowd was following Him and pressing upon Him .
41005025	And there was a woman with a blood flow for twelve years ,
41005026	who had suffered much under many doctors . She had spent all that she had without benefit ; instead , she grew worse .
41005027	When she heard about Yeshua , she came through the crowd from behind and touched His garment .
41005028	For she kept saying , “ If I touch even His clothes , I shall be healed . ”
41005029	Right away the blood flow stopped , and she felt in her body that she was healed from her disease .
41005030	At once Yeshua , knowing in Himself that power had gone out from Him , turned around in the crowd and said , “ Who touched My clothes ? ”
41005031	His disciples responded , “ You see the crowd pressing upon You and you say , ‘ Who touched Me ? ’ ”
41005032	But He kept looking around to see who had done this .
41005033	But the woman , scared and shaking , knowing what had happened to her , came and fell down before Him and told Him the whole truth .
41005034	And He said to her , “ Daughter , your faith has made you well . Go in shalom and be healed from your disease . ”
41005035	While Yeshua was still speaking , messengers come from the house of the synagogue leader , saying , “ Your daughter is dead . Why do you still trouble the Teacher ? ”
41005036	But ignoring what they said , Yeshua tells the synagogue leader , “ Do not be afraid ; only believe . ”
41005037	He did not let anyone follow Him except Peter , Jacob , and John , the brother of Jacob .
41005038	They come to the house of the synagogue leader . He sees a commotion , people weeping and wailing loudly .
41005039	After entering , He said to them , “ Why make such a fuss and weep ? The child didn’t die , but is sleeping . ”
41005040	They start jeering at Him . But after sending all of them out , He takes the child’s father and mother , and those with Him , and enters where the child was .
41005041	Then , taking hold of the child’s hand , He tells her , “ Talitha koum , ” which means , “ Little girl , I say to you , get up . ”
41005042	Immediately , the girl stood up and began to walk around ! ( She was twelve years old . ) And they were overcome with astonishment .
41005043	But He gave them strict orders that no one should know about this , and He said something to eat should be given to her .
41006001	Now Yeshua went out from there , and He comes to His hometown , and His disciples follow Him .
41006002	When Shabbat came , He began to teach in the synagogue . Many listeners were amazed , saying , “ Where did this fellow get these things ? What’s this wisdom given to Him ? Such miracles are done by His hands !
41006003	Isn’t this the carpenter , the son of Miriam , and the brother of Jacob and Joseph and Judah and Simon ? Aren’t His sisters here with us ? ” And they took offense at Him .
41006004	Then Yeshua began saying to them , “ A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown , among his relatives , and in his own house . ”
41006005	He was not able to do any miracle , except that He laid hands on a few sick people and healed them .
41006006	And He was astonished because of their unbelief . And He was going around among the villages teaching .
41006007	Yeshua summoned the Twelve , and He began to send them out two by two . And He gave them authority over the unclean spirits .
41006008	He directed them to take nothing for the journey except a walking stick — no bread , no bag , no copper coin in their belt —
41006009	but to wear sandals and not to put on two shirts .
41006010	He was also telling them , “ Wherever you enter a house , stay there until you leave that place .
41006011	And whatever place will not receive you or listen to you , as you leave from there , shake the dust off the bottom of your feet as a witness against them . ”
41006012	So they went out and proclaimed that all should repent ,
41006013	and they were driving out many demons and anointing with oil many who were sick and healing them .
41006014	King Herod heard , for Yeshua’s name had become known . Some were saying , “ John the Immerser has risen from the dead ! Because of this , these powers are at work in Him ! ”
41006015	But others were saying , “ It’s Elijah ! ” Still others were saying , “ It’s a prophet , like one of the prophets of old . ”
41006016	But when Herod heard , he said , “ John , the one I beheaded , has been raised ! ”
41006017	For Herod himself sent and arrested John and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias , the wife of his brother Philip , because Herod had married her .
41006018	For John had been telling Herod , “ It is not permitted for you to have your brother’s wife . ”
41006019	Now Herodias had a grudge against John and wanted to kill him , but she wasn’t able .
41006020	For Herod was in awe of John and kept him safe , knowing him to be a righteous and holy man . When he listened to John he was confused , but he still listened gladly .
41006021	An opportunity came — when Herod , on his birthday , gave a banquet for his high officials , military brass , and the leaders of the Galilee .
41006022	When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced , she pleased Herod and those reclining with him . And the king said to the girl , “ Ask me for whatever you want , and I’ll give it to you ! ”
41006023	He vowed to her , “ Whatever you ask of me I’ll give you , up to half of my kingdom ! ”
41006024	She left the room and said to her mother , “ What should I ask for ? ” Her mother said , “ The head of John the Immerser ! ”
41006025	Immediately she rushed to the king and requested , “ I want you to give me , right now , the head of John the Immerser on a platter ! ”
41006026	The king became very sorrowful ; but because of his oaths and those reclining with him , he didn’t want to refuse her .
41006027	Immediately the king sent an executioner and gave orders to bring John’s head . And the executioner went out and beheaded John in the prison ,
41006028	brought his head on a platter , and gave it to the girl ; and the girl gave it to her mother .
41006029	When John’s disciples heard , they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb .
41006030	The twelve shlichim gathered together with Yeshua , and they reported to Him all they had done and taught .
41006031	There were many coming and going , and they had no time even to eat . So He said to them , “ Come away by yourselves to an isolated place and rest awhile . ”
41006032	So they left privately by boat to an isolated place .
41006033	However , the people saw them leaving , and many recognized them . They ran on foot from all the towns to get there ahead of them .
41006034	As Yeshua came ashore , He saw a large crowd and felt compassion for them , because they were like sheep without a shepherd . So He taught them many things .
41006035	When it was already late , His disciples came to Him and said , “ This place is isolated , and the hour is already late .
41006036	Send these people away so they can go into the nearby countryside and the villages and buy themselves something to eat . ”
41006037	But He answered and said to them , “ You give them something to eat ! ” And they said to Him , “ Should we go and spend two hundred denarii on bread to give them something to eat ? ”
41006038	Then He said to them , “ How many loaves do you have ? Go and see . ” When they found out , they said , “ Five , and two fish . ”
41006039	Then Yeshua made them all sit down in groups on the green grass .
41006040	So they reclined in groups of hundreds and fifties .
41006041	And He took the five loaves and the two fish ; and looking up to heaven , He offered the bracha . He broke the loaves and kept giving them to the disciples to serve to the people ; and He divided the two fish among them all .
41006042	They all ate and were satisfied ,
41006043	and the disciples picked up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and fish .
41006044	Now there were five thousand men who ate the loaves .
41006045	Right away , Yeshua made His disciples get into the boat and go ahead of Him to the other side , to Bethsaida , while He Himself was sending the crowd away .
41006046	After leaving them , He went up on the hillside to pray .
41006047	And when evening came , the boat was in the middle of the sea and He was alone on the land .
41006048	He saw the disciples struggling to row , for the wind was against them . Around the fourth watch in the night , Yeshua comes to them , walking on the sea ; and He wanted to pass by them .
41006049	But when they saw Him walking on the sea , they thought He was a ghost and cried out —
41006050	for they all saw Him and were terrified . But immediately , He spoke to them . He said , “ Take courage ! I am . Do not be afraid . ”
41006051	Then He got into the boat with them , and the wind stopped . They were utterly dumbfounded ,
41006052	for they still hadn’t understood about the loaves . Instead , their hearts were hardened .
41006053	After they had crossed over , they came to land at Gennesaret and set anchor there .
41006054	As they got out of the boat , immediately people recognized Yeshua .
41006055	They ran about the region and began to carry around on their mats all those who were in bad shape , to wherever they heard He was .
41006056	And wherever He entered villages , towns , or countryside , people were placing the sick in the marketplaces and begging Him to let them touch even the tzitzit of His garment — and all who touched it were being healed .
41007001	Now the Pharisees and some of the Torah scholars who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Yeshua .
41007002	And they saw that some of His disciples were eating bread with unclean hands , that is , not washed .
41007003	( For the Pharisees and all Jewish people do not eat unless they wash their hands up to the elbow , keeping the tradition of the elders .
41007004	And when they come from the marketplace , they do not eat unless they perform a ritual washing . There are many other traditions they have received and hold , such as the washing of cups , pitchers , copper vessels . )
41007005	The Pharisees and Torah scholars questioned Yeshua , “ Why don’t Your disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders ? Why do they eat bread with unwashed hands ? ”
41007006	And He said to them , “ Rightly did Isaiah prophesy about you hypocrites , as it is written , ‘ This people honors Me with their lips but their heart is far from Me .
41007007	And in vain they worship Me , teaching as doctrines the commandments of men . ’
41007008	Having left behind the commandment of God , you hold on to the tradition of men . ”
41007009	He was also telling them , “ You set aside the commands of God , in order that you may validate your own tradition .
41007010	For Moses said , ‘ Honor your father and your mother , ’ and , ‘ He who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death . ’
41007011	But you say if anyone tells his father or mother , ‘ Whatever you might have gained from me is korban ( that is , an offering to God ) , ’
41007012	then you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or mother ,
41007013	making void the word of God with your tradition that you’ve handed down . And you do many such things . ”
41007014	Then Yeshua called the crowd again and began saying to them , “ Hear Me , everyone , and understand .
41007015	There is nothing outside the man that can make him unholy by going into him . Rather , it is what comes out of the man that makes the man unholy . ” ( 16 )
41007017	When He had left the crowd and entered the house , His disciples questioned Him about the parable .
41007018	And He said to them , “ Are you then also lacking understanding ? Don’t you grasp that whatever goes into the man cannot make him unholy ?
41007019	For it does not enter into the heart but into the stomach , and then is eliminated , cleaning out all foods . ”
41007020	And He continued , “ It is what comes out of the man that makes the man unholy .
41007021	For from within , out of the heart of men , come evil intentions , sexual immorality , theft , murder ,
41007022	adultery , greed , wickedness , deceit , lustfulness , envy , slander , pride , and foolishness .
41007023	All these evil things come from within and make the man unholy . ”
41007024	Yeshua got up and left from there to the region of Tyre . When He had entered a house , He didn’t want anyone to know ; but He couldn’t escape notice .
41007025	A woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit heard about Him . She came immediately and fell at His feet .
41007026	The woman was a Greek , from Syrophoenicia . And she kept begging Yeshua to drive the demon out of her daughter .
41007027	He was telling her , “ First let the children get their fill , for it’s not right to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs . ”
41007028	“ Yes , Master , ” she said to Him , “ but even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs . ”
41007029	Then He said to her , “ Because of this word , go your way ! The demon has left your daughter . ”
41007030	She went home and found the child lying on the bed , and the demon gone .
41007031	Again He left the region of Tyre and came through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee , within the region of the Decapolis .
41007032	They bring Him a deaf man who had a speech impediment , and they beg Him to lay His hand on him .
41007033	Yeshua took him aside from the crowd to a private place , and He put His fingers in the man’s ears . After spitting , He touched the man’s tongue .
41007034	Looking up to heaven , He says to the man , “ Ephphatha , ” which means “ Be opened ! ”
41007035	Immediately the man’s ears were opened , his tongue was loosened , and he began to speak plainly .
41007036	Yeshua ordered them not to tell anyone . But the more He ordered them , the more they continued proclaiming it .
41007037	People were completely astounded , saying , “ He has done all things well . He makes even the deaf hear and the mute speak ! ”
41008001	In those days , there was another large crowd with nothing to eat , and Yeshua called the disciples . He said to them ,
41008002	“ I have compassion for the crowd , because they’ve stayed with Me for three days now and have nothing to eat .
41008003	If I send them home hungry they’ll pass out on the way , for some of them have come from very far away . ”
41008004	His disciples answered Him , “ How can anyone satisfy these people with bread here in a wasteland ? ”
41008005	“ How many loaves do you have ? ” Yeshua was asking them . “ Seven , ” they said .
41008006	He directed the crowd to recline on the ground . After taking the seven loaves and giving thanks , He broke them and began giving them to His disciples to serve ; and they served them to the crowd .
41008007	They also had a few small fish and , after offering a bracha for them , He commanded these to be served as well .
41008008	They ate and were satisfied , and they picked up the broken pieces left over — seven baskets .
41008009	About four thousand were there , and Yeshua sent them away .
41008010	Right away , He got into the boat with His disciples and went to the area of Dalmanutha .
41008011	The Pharisees came and began to argue with Him , demanding a sign from heaven , to test Him .
41008012	Sighing deeply in His spirit , Yeshua said , “ Why does this generation demand a sign ? Amen , I tell you , no sign will be given to this generation . ”
41008013	Leaving them , He got back into the boat and crossed to the other side .
41008014	Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread , and they had only one loaf in the boat .
41008015	Yeshua was warning them , “ Watch out ! Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod . ”
41008016	They began to discuss with each other that they had no bread .
41008017	And Yeshua , aware of this , said to them , “ Why do you discuss that you have no bread ? You still don’t get it ? Don’t you understand ? Are your hearts hardened ?
41008018	Having eyes , don’t you see ? And having ears , don’t you hear ? And don’t you remember ?
41008019	When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand , how many baskets of leftovers did you pick up ? ” “ Twelve , ” they say to Him .
41008020	“ When I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand , how many baskets of leftovers did you pick up ? ” “ Seven , ” they say to Him .
41008021	He said to them , “ Do you still not understand ? ”
41008022	They come to Bethsaida . Some people bring a blind man to Yeshua and beg Him to touch the man .
41008023	Taking the blind man by the hand , Yeshua brought him outside the village . After spitting on the man’s eyes and laying His hands on him , Yeshua asked the man , “ Do you see anything ? ”
41008024	The man looked up and said , “ I see men ! They look like trees walking about . ”
41008025	Then Yeshua put His hands on the man’s eyes again . The man looked intently , his sight was restored , and he began to see everything clearly .
41008026	Yeshua sent him straight home , saying , “ Don’t even enter the village ! ”
41008027	Now Yeshua and His disciples went out to the villages around Caesarea Philippi . On the way He asked His disciples , “ Who do people say that I am ? ”
41008028	They told Him , “ John the Immerser ; and others Elijah ; but others , one of the prophets . ”
41008029	Then He asked them , “ But who do you say that I am ? ” Peter answered Him , “ You are the Messiah ! ”
41008030	And He warned them not to tell anyone about Him .
41008031	Then He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and ruling kohanim and Torah scholars , and be killed , and after three days rise again .
41008032	He was speaking openly about this . And Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him .
41008033	But turning around and looking at His disciples , He rebuked Peter . He said , “ Get behind Me , satan ! You are not setting your mind on the things of God , but the things of men . ”
41008034	Then He called the crowd , along with His disciples , and said to them , “ If anyone wants to follow after Me , he must deny himself , take up his cross , and keep following Me .
41008035	For whoever wants to save his life will lose it , but whoever loses his life for My sake and the sake of the Good News will save it .
41008036	For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world , yet forfeit his soul ?
41008037	For what could a man give in exchange for his soul ?
41008038	For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words in this unfaithful and sinful generation , the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels ! ”
41009001	Yeshua was telling them , “ Amen , I tell you , there are some standing here who will never taste death until they see the kingdom of God come with power ! ”
41009002	After six days , Yeshua takes with Him Peter and Jacob and John , and brings them up a high mountain by themselves . And He was transfigured before them .
41009003	His clothes became radiant and brilliantly white , whiter than any launderer on earth could bleach them .
41009004	Then Elijah appeared to them with Moses , and they were talking with Yeshua .
41009005	Peter responds to Yeshua , “ Rabbi , it’s good for us to be here . Let’s make three sukkot — one for You , and one for Moses , and one for Elijah . ”
41009006	( He didn’t know what to say , for they were terrified . )
41009007	Then a cloud came , overshadowing them ; and out of the cloud came a voice , “ This is My Son , whom I love . Listen to Him ! ”
41009008	Suddenly when they looked around , they no longer saw anyone with them except Yeshua .
41009009	As they were coming down from the mountain , Yeshua ordered them not to tell anyone what they had seen , until the Son of Man rose up from the dead .
41009010	They kept this word to themselves , discussing among themselves what it is to rise up from the dead .
41009011	And they questioned Him , saying , “ Why do the Torah scholars say that Elijah must come first ? ”
41009012	Now He told them , “ Indeed Elijah comes first ; he restores all things . And how is it written that the Son of Man must suffer much and be treated with contempt ?
41009013	I tell you that Elijah has come , and they did to him whatever they wanted , just as it is written about him . ”
41009014	When they came to the disciples , they saw a big crowd around them and the Torah scholars arguing with them .
41009015	Suddenly , when the whole crowd saw Yeshua , they were amazed and began running to greet Him .
41009016	He questioned them , “ What are you arguing about with them ? ”
41009017	And a man from the crowd answered Him , “ Teacher , I brought You my son , who has a spirit that makes him mute .
41009018	Whenever it seizes him , it throws him down ; he foams at the mouth , grinds his teeth , and becomes stiff . I told Your disciples to drive it out , but they couldn’t ! ”
41009019	And answering them , He said , “ Oh faithless generation , how long shall I be with you ? How long shall I put up with you ? Bring him to Me . ”
41009020	They brought the boy to Yeshua . When the spirit saw Him , immediately it threw the boy into a convulsion . The boy fell to the ground and began rolling around and foaming at the mouth .
41009021	Yeshua asked the father , “ How long has this been happening to him ? ” “ Since he was a child , ” the man answered .
41009022	“ It has often thrown him into fire or water to destroy him . But if You can do anything , have compassion and help us ! ”
41009023	“ ‘ If You can ’ ? ” Yeshua said to him . “ All things are possible for one who believes ! ”
41009024	Immediately the boy’s father cried out , “ I believe ! Help my unbelief ! ”
41009025	When Yeshua saw that a crowd was gathering fast , He rebuked the unclean spirit , telling it , “ I command you , deaf and mute spirit , come out of him and do not ever enter him again ! ”
41009026	After howling and shaking the boy wildly , it came out . The boy became so much like a corpse that many were saying , “ He’s dead ! ”
41009027	But Yeshua took him by the hand and lifted him , and the boy stood up .
41009028	After Yeshua came into the house , His disciples began questioning Him in private , “ Why couldn’t we drive it out ? ”
41009029	And He said to them , “ This kind cannot come out except by prayer . ”
41009030	They left from there and passed through the Galilee . Yeshua didn’t want anyone to know ,
41009031	for He was teaching His disciples and telling them , “ The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men , and they will kill Him . And after He is killed , three days later He will rise up . ”
41009032	But the disciples didn’t understand this statement , and they were afraid to question Him about it .
41009033	Then they came to Capernaum . And when Yeshua was in the house , He began to ask the disciples , “ What were you discussing on the way ? ”
41009034	But they kept quiet , because on the way they had argued with one another about who was the greatest .
41009035	Sitting down , He called the Twelve and said to them , “ If any man wants to be first , he shall be least of all and the servant of everyone . ”
41009036	Taking a small child , He set him in the midst of them . And taking him in His arms , He said to them ,
41009037	“ Whoever welcomes one of these children in My name , welcomes Me ; and whoever welcomes Me , welcomes not Me but the One who sent Me . ”
41009038	John said to Him , “ Teacher , we saw someone driving out demons in Your name , and we tried to stop him because he wasn’t following us . ”
41009039	But Yeshua responded , “ Don’t stop him ! No one who does a miracle in My name will be able soon afterward to speak evil about Me .
41009040	He who is not against us is for us .
41009041	For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink in My name because you belong to Messiah , amen I tell you , he will never lose his reward . ”
41009042	“ But whoever causes one of these little ones who trust in Me to stumble , it would be better for him to have a heavy millstone put around his neck and to be thrown into the sea ! ”
41009043	“ And if your hand causes you to stumble , cut it off ! It is better for you to enter into life crippled than , having two hands , to go to Gehenna , into the unquenchable fire .
41009045	And if your foot causes you to stumble , cut it off ! It’s better for you to enter life lame than , having your two feet , to be thrown into Gehenna .
41009047	If your eye causes you to stumble , tear it out ! It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than , having two eyes , to be thrown into Gehenna ,
41009048	where ‘ their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched . ’
41009049	“ For everyone will be salted with fire .
41009050	Salt is good ; but if the salt becomes unsalty , with what will you flavor it ? Have salt in yourselves , and keep shalom with one another . ”
41010001	Then getting up from there , Yeshua goes to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan . Again crowds gather around Him , and , as was His custom , He began to teach them once more .
41010002	Pharisees came up , and to test Him they began asking , “ Is it permitted for a man to divorce his wife ? ”
41010003	And He replied to them , “ What did Moses command you ? ”
41010004	The Pharisees said , “ Moses permitted a man to write a bill of divorce and to put her away . ”
41010005	But Yeshua said to them , “ Because of your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment !
41010006	But from the beginning of creation , God ‘ made them male and female .
41010007	For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife ,
41010008	and the two shall become one flesh . ’ So they are no longer two , but one flesh .
41010009	Therefore what God has joined together , let no man separate ! ”
41010010	In the house , the disciples began questioning Him about this again .
41010011	And He said to them , “ Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her .
41010012	And if she divorces her husband and marries another , she is committing adultery . ”
41010013	Now people were bringing little children to Yeshua so He might touch them , but the disciples rebuked those who brought them .
41010014	But when Yeshua saw this , He got angry . He told them , “ Let the little children come to Me ! Do not hinder them , for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these .
41010015	Amen , I tell you , whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it ! ”
41010016	And He took them in His arms and began blessing them , laying His hands on them .
41010017	As Yeshua was setting out on His way , a man ran up to Him , fell on his knees before Him , and asked , “ Good Teacher , what shall I do to inherit eternal life ? ”
41010018	“ Why do you call Me good ? ” Yeshua said to him . “ No one is good except One — that is God .
41010019	You know the commandments , ‘ Do not murder , do not commit adultery , do not steal , do not give false testimony , ’ do not cheat , ‘ honor your father and mother . ’ ”
41010020	The man responded , “ Teacher , all these I have kept since my youth ! ”
41010021	Looking at him , Yeshua loved him and said , “ One thing you lack . Go , sell as much as you have , and give to the poor ; and you will have treasure in heaven . Then come , follow Me . ”
41010022	But at this statement , the man became sad and went away grieving , for he had much property .
41010023	Then looking around , Yeshua says to His disciples , “ How hard it will be for the rich to enter the kingdom of God ! ”
41010024	The disciples were amazed at His words . But Yeshua answers again and says to them , “ Children , how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God !
41010025	It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle , than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God . ”
41010026	The disciples were even more astonished , saying among themselves , “ Then who can be saved ? ”
41010027	Looking at them , Yeshua said , “ With men it is impossible , but not with God . For all things are possible with God ! ”
41010028	Peter began to say to Him , “ Look , we’ve left everything to follow You ! ”
41010029	“ Amen , I tell you , ” Yeshua replied , “ there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or property , for My sake and for the sake of the Good News ,
41010030	who will not receive a hundred times as much now in this time , houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and property , along with persecutions ; and in the olam ha-ba , eternal life .
41010031	But many who are first will be last , and the last first . ”
41010032	They were on the way going up to Jerusalem , and Yeshua was going ahead of them . And they were amazed , while those who followed were fearful . Again Yeshua took the Twelve aside and began to tell them what was going to happen to Him .
41010033	He said , “ Look , we are going up to Jerusalem , and the Son of Man will be handed over to the ruling kohanim and the Torah scholars . They will condemn Him to death and hand Him over to the Gentiles .
41010034	They will mock Him and spit on Him , scourge Him and kill Him . Yet after three days , He will rise again ! ”
41010035	Then Jacob and John , the sons of Zebedee , come up to Him , saying , “ Teacher , we want You to do for us whatever we ask of You . ”
41010036	And He said to them , “ What do you want Me to do for you ? ”
41010037	They said to Him , “ Let us sit , one on Your right and one on Your left , in Your glory . ”
41010038	But Yeshua answered them , “ You don’t know what you’re asking ! Are you able to drink the cup I drink , or endure the immersion I must endure ? ”
41010039	They said to Him , “ We are able . ” And Yeshua said to them , “ You will drink the cup I drink , and you will endure the immersion I must endure .
41010040	But to sit on My right or left is not Mine to grant — it is for those for whom it has been prepared . ”
41010041	Now when the ten heard , they started to get angry with Jacob and John .
41010042	And calling them over , Yeshua said to them , “ You know those recognized as rulers of the nations lord it over them , and their great ones play the tyrant over them .
41010043	Yet it is not this way among you . But whoever wants to be great among you shall be your servant ,
41010044	and whoever wants to be first among you shall be slave of all .
41010045	For even the Son of Man did not come to be served , but to serve , and to give His life as a ransom for many . ”
41010046	Then they came to Jericho . Now as Yeshua was leaving Jericho with His disciples and a large crowd , Bartimaeus the son of Timaeus , a blind beggar , was sitting by the roadside .
41010047	When he heard that it was Yeshua of Natzeret , he began to cry out , “ Ben-David , Yeshua ! Have mercy on me ! ”
41010048	Many were warning him to be quiet ; but he kept crying out all the more , “ Ben-David , have mercy on me ! ”
41010049	Yeshua stopped and said , “ Call him over . ” So they call the blind man , saying , “ Take heart ! Get up , He’s calling you ! ”
41010050	Throwing off his cloak , he jumped up and came to Yeshua .
41010051	And answering him , Yeshua said , “ What do you want Me to do for you ? ” The blind man said , “ Rabboni , I want to see again ! ”
41010052	Yeshua said to him , “ Go ! Your faith has made you well . ” Instantly he regained his sight and began following Yeshua down the road .
41011001	Now as they draw near to Jerusalem , to Bethphage and Bethany , to the Mount of Olives , Yeshua sends two of His disciples
41011002	and says to them , “ Go into the village ahead of you . Right away as you enter it , you will find a colt tied up that no one has ever sat upon . Untie it and bring it .
41011003	If anyone says to you , ‘ Why are you doing this ? ’ say , ‘ The Master needs it . ’ And right away he will send it back here . ”
41011004	They went and found a colt outside in the street , tied at a door . And they untied it .
41011005	Some people standing there began saying to them , “ What are you doing , untying the colt ? ”
41011006	They answered just as Yeshua had told them , and the people let them go .
41011007	And they brought the colt to Yeshua and laid their cloaks on it , and He sat on it .
41011008	Many spread their cloaks on the road , and others spread branches cut from the fields .
41011009	Those going before and those following kept shouting , “ Hoshia-na ! Baruch ha-ba b’shem Adonai ! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord !
41011010	Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David ! Hoshia-na in the highest ! ”
41011011	And He entered Jerusalem and went into the Temple . After looking around at everything , He went out to Bethany with the Twelve , since it was already late .
41011012	The next day , when they had left Bethany , He became hungry .
41011013	Seeing from a distance a fig tree in leaf , He went to see if He would find any fruit on it . When He came up to it , He found nothing except leaves , because it wasn’t the season for figs .
41011014	And He said to it , “ May no one ever eat fruit from you again ! ” And His disciples were listening .
41011015	Then they came to Jerusalem . And He entered the Temple and started to drive out those selling and buying in the Temple . He overturned the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of those selling doves ,
41011016	and He wouldn’t let anyone carry goods through the Temple .
41011017	And He began to teach them , saying , “ Is it not written , ‘ My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations’ ? But you have made it a ‘ den of thieves . ’ ”
41011018	The ruling kohanim and Torah scholars heard this and began looking for a way to destroy Him ; for they were afraid of Him , because the whole crowd was astonished at His teaching .
41011019	Whenever evening came , Yeshua and His disciples would leave the city .
41011020	As they were passing by in the morning , they saw the fig tree shriveled from the roots .
41011021	Peter remembered and said to Yeshua , “ Rabbi , look ! The fig tree You cursed has shriveled up ! ”
41011022	And Yeshua answered , saying to them , “ Have faith in God !
41011023	Amen , I tell you , if someone says to this mountain , ‘ Be taken up and thrown into the sea , ’ and does not doubt in his heart but trusts that what he says is happening , so shall it be for him .
41011024	For this reason I say to you , whatever you pray and ask , believe that you have received it , and it will be yours .
41011025	Whenever you stand praying , if you have anything against anyone , forgive him , so that your Father in heaven may also forgive you your transgressions . ” ( 26 )
41011027	Again they come to Jerusalem . While Yeshua was walking in the Temple , the ruling kohanim , Torah scholars , and elders come up to Him .
41011028	And they start saying to Him , “ By what authority are You doing these things ? Who gave You this authority to do these things ? ”
41011029	Yeshua said to them , “ I will put one question to you . Answer Me , and I will tell you by what authority I do these things .
41011030	The immersion of John — was it from heaven or from men ? Answer Me ! ”
41011031	They began to dialogue among themselves , saying , “ If we say , ‘ From heaven , ’ He will say , ‘ Then why didn’t you believe him ? ’
41011032	But if we say , ‘ From men ’ … ? ” They were afraid of the crowd , for all held that John really was a prophet .
41011033	So answering Yeshua , they say , “ We don’t know . ” And Yeshua tells them , “ Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things . ”
41012001	Yeshua began to speak to them in parables : “ A man planted a vineyard . He put a hedge around it , dug a pit for the winepress , and built a tower . He leased it to some tenant farmers and went on a journey .
41012002	And at the season , he sent a servant to collect from the tenants part of the vineyard’s fruit .
41012003	But grabbing him , they beat him up and sent him away empty-handed .
41012004	And again the man sent another servant to them , and they wounded his head and treated him shamefully .
41012005	He sent another , and that one they killed ; and so on with many others , beating some and killing some .
41012006	He had yet one , a well-loved son . He sent him to them last of all , saying , ‘ They will respect my son . ’
41012007	“ But those tenants said to one another , ‘ This is the heir ! Come on , let’s kill him and the inheritance will be ours ! ’
41012008	So grabbing the son , they killed him and threw him out of the vineyard .
41012009	“ What then will the master of the vineyard do ? He will come and destroy the tenants and give the vineyard to others .
41012010	Haven’t you read this Scripture ? ‘ The stone which the builders rejected , this has become the chief cornerstone .
41012011	This came from Adonai , and it is marvelous in our eyes . ’ ”
41012012	They were trying to seize Yeshua , because they realized that He spoke the parable against them . But they feared the crowd , so they left Him and went away .
41012013	Then they send some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Yeshua in order to trap Him with a word .
41012014	They come and say to Him , “ Teacher , we know that You are honest , and what others think doesn’t concern You . You don’t look at men’s appearance , but teach the way of God according to the truth . Is it permitted to pay taxes to Caesar , or not ?
41012015	Should we pay , or shouldn’t we ? ” But Yeshua saw through their hypocrisy and said to them , “ Why are you testing Me ? Bring Me a denarius so I may see it . ”
41012016	They brought one . And He said to them , “ Whose image is this ? And whose inscription ? ” “ Caesar’s , ” they said to Him .
41012017	Then Yeshua said to them , “ Give to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s , and to God the things that are God’s . ” And they were completely amazed at Him .
41012018	Then Sadducees ( who say there is no resurrection ) came and began questioning Yeshua , saying ,
41012019	“ Teacher , Moses wrote for us that ‘ if a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife but no children , then his brother should take the widow and father children for his brother . ’
41012020	There were seven brothers ; and the first took a wife and , when he died , left no offspring .
41012021	And the second took her and died , leaving no offspring , and the third likewise .
41012022	Now the seven left no offspring . Last of all , the woman died , too .
41012023	In the resurrection , when they rise up , whose wife will she be ? For all seven had married her . ”
41012024	Yeshua said to them , “ Isn’t this the reason you’ve gone astray , because you don’t understand the Scriptures or the power of God ?
41012025	For when they rise up from the dead , they neither marry nor are given in marriage , but are like angels in heaven .
41012026	But concerning the dead being raised , haven’t you read in the book of Moses about the burning bush ? How God said to him , ‘ I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ’ ?
41012027	He’s not the God of the dead , but of the living . You have gone far astray ! ”
41012028	One of the Torah scholars came and heard them debating . Seeing that Yeshua had answered them well , he asked Him , “ Which commandment is first of all ? ”
41012029	Yeshua answered , “ The first is , ‘ Shema Yisrael , Adonai Eloheinu , Adonai echad . Hear , O Israel , the Lord our God , the Lord is One .
41012030	And you shall love Adonai your God with all your heart , and with all your soul , and with all your mind , and with all your strength . ’
41012031	The second is this , ‘ You shall love your neighbor as yourself . ’ There is no other commandment greater than these . ”
41012032	“ Well said , Teacher , ” the Torah scholar said to Him . “ You have spoken the truth , that He is echad , and besides Him there is no other !
41012033	And ‘ to love Him with all the heart , with all the understanding , and with all the strength , ’ and ‘ to love the neighbor as oneself , ’ is much more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices . ”
41012034	When Yeshua saw that he had answered wisely , He said to him , “ You are not far from the kingdom of God . ” And no one dared any longer to question Him .
41012035	While Yeshua was teaching in the Temple , He said , “ How is it that the Torah scholars say that the Messiah is Ben-David ?
41012036	David himself , through the Ruach ha-Kodesh , said , ‘ Adonai said to my Lord , “ Sit at My right hand , until I put Your enemies under Your feet . ” ’
41012037	If David himself calls Him ‘ Lord , ’ in what way is He his son ? ” And the large crowd was listening to Him with delight .
41012038	In His teaching He said , “ Watch out for the Torah scholars , who like to walk around in long robes . They like greetings in the marketplaces ,
41012039	the best seats in the synagogues , and places of honor at feasts .
41012040	They devour widows’ houses and make long prayers as a show . These men will receive greater condemnation ! ”
41012041	He sat down opposite the treasury and began watching how the people were putting money into the offering box . Many rich people were putting in a lot .
41012042	Then a poor widow came and put in two small copper coins , worth less than a penny .
41012043	Calling His disciples over , He said to them , “ Amen , I tell you , this poor widow has put in more than all those contributing to the box !
41012044	For they all put in from their surplus ; but she , out of her poverty , put in everything she had , her whole living . ”
41013001	As Yeshua was going out of the Temple , one of His disciples said to Him , “ Teacher , look ! What stones and what buildings ! ”
41013002	Yeshua said to him , “ You see these great buildings ? Not one stone here will be left upon another . Every one will be torn down ! ”
41013003	As He was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the Temple , Peter , Jacob , John , and Andrew were questioning Him privately ,
41013004	“ Tell us , when will these things happen ? What will be the sign that all these things are about to be accomplished ? ”
41013005	Yeshua began to tell them , “ Watch out that no one leads you astray !
41013006	Many will come in My name , saying , ‘ I am He , ’ and they will lead many astray .
41013007	When you hear of wars and rumors of wars , do not be alarmed , for this must happen but it is not yet the end .
41013008	For nation will rise up against nation , and kingdom against kingdom . There will be earthquakes in various places , and there will be famines . These things are only the beginning of birth pains .
41013009	“ Watch out for yourselves ! They will hand you over to the courts , and you will be beaten in the synagogues . You will stand before governors and kings because of Me , as a witness to them .
41013010	The Good News must first be proclaimed to all the nations .
41013011	When they arrest you and hand you over , do not worry beforehand about what to say . Say whatever is given to you in that hour , for it is not you who speaks but the Ruach ha-Kodesh .
41013012	Brother will betray brother to death , and a father his child . And children will rise up against parents and have them put to death .
41013013	And you will be hated by all because of My name , but the one who endures to the end will be saved . ”
41013014	“ But when you see ‘ the abomination of desolation ’ standing where it should not be ( let the reader understand ) , then those in Judea must flee to the mountains .
41013015	The one on the roof must not go down , nor enter to take anything out of his house .
41013016	And the one in the field must not turn back to get his cloak .
41013017	Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days !
41013018	Pray that it will not happen in winter .
41013019	“ For in those days there will be trouble such as has never happened , not since the beginning of the creation which God created until now , and never will .
41013020	And unless Adonai had cut short those days , no one would be saved . But for the sake of the elect , whom He chose , He cut short the days .
41013021	“ And then if anyone says to you , ‘ Look , here’s the Messiah ! ’ or , ‘ Look , there He is ! ’ do not believe it .
41013022	For false messiahs and false prophets will rise up and show signs and wonders to lead astray , if possible , the chosen .
41013023	So be careful ! See , I have told you everything beforehand . ”
41013024	“ But in those days , after that trouble , ‘ the sun will be darkened , and the moon will not give its light ,
41013025	and the stars will be falling from heaven , and the powers in the heavens will be shaken . ’
41013026	And then they will see ‘ the Son of Man coming in clouds’ with great power and glory .
41013027	Then He will send out the angels and will gather together His chosen from the four winds , from the end of the earth , to the end of heaven . ”
41013028	“ Now learn the parable from the fig tree . When its branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves , you know that summer is near .
41013029	So also , when you see all these things happening , know that it is near , at the door .
41013030	Amen , I tell you , this generation will not pass away until all these things happen .
41013031	Heaven and earth will pass away , but My words will never pass away .
41013032	But of that day or hour no one knows , not even the angels in heaven nor the Son , except the Father .
41013033	“ Keep on the lookout ! Stay alert ! For you do not know when the time is .
41013034	It is like a man away on a journey . After leaving his house and putting his servants in charge and giving each his task , he also commanded the doorkeeper to watch .
41013035	Therefore stay alert , for you do not know when the master of the house is coming , whether in the evening , at midnight , when the rooster crows , or in the early morning .
41013036	So watch in case , coming suddenly , he finds you asleep .
41013037	What I say to you I say to all : ‘ Stay alert ! ’ ”
41014001	Now it was two days before Passover and the Feast of Matzah . The ruling kohanim and Torah scholars were searching for a way to grab Yeshua by stealth and kill Him .
41014002	“ But not during the festival , ” they were saying , “ so there won’t be a riot among the people . ”
41014003	And while Yeshua was in Bethany at the house of Simon ha-Metzora , reclining at the table , a woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive oil of pure nard . Breaking open the jar , she poured it over His head .
41014004	But some got angry and said among themselves , “ Why was this fragrant oil wasted ?
41014005	It could have been sold for over three hundred denarii , and the money given to the poor ! ” And they kept scolding her .
41014006	But Yeshua said , “ Leave her alone . Why do you cause trouble for her ? She’s done Me a mitzvah .
41014007	For you always have the poor with you , and you can do good for them whenever you want ; but you won’t always have Me .
41014008	She did what she could — she came beforehand to anoint My body for burial .
41014009	Amen , I tell you , wherever the Good News is proclaimed in all the world , what she has done will also be told in memory of her . ”
41014010	Then Judah from Kriot , one of the Twelve , went out to the ruling kohanim to betray Yeshua to them .
41014011	They were delighted when they heard this and promised to give him money . And Judah began looking for a chance to hand Him over .
41014012	Now on the first day of matzah , when they were slaughtering the Passover lamb , Yeshua’s disciples say to Him , “ Where do You want us to go and prepare for You to eat the Passover ? ”
41014013	He sends two of His disciples and tells them , “ Go into the city , and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you . Follow him ,
41014014	and wherever he enters , tell the homeowner , ‘ The Teacher says , “ Where is My guest room , where I may eat the Passover with My disciples ? ” ’
41014015	He will show you a large upper room , furnished and ready . Make preparations for us there . ”
41014016	The disciples went out , came to the city , and found just what Yeshua had told them . And they prepared the Passover .
41014017	When it was evening , He came with the Twelve .
41014018	As they were reclining and eating , Yeshua said , “ Amen , I tell you , one of you who is eating with Me will betray Me . ”
41014019	They began to be sorrowful and to say to Him one by one , “ I’m not the one , am I ? ”
41014020	He said to them , “ It’s one of the Twelve , one who dips with Me in the bowl .
41014021	For the Son of Man indeed goes , just as it is written about Him ; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed ! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born ! ”
41014022	And while they were eating , He took matzah ; and after He offered the bracha , He broke it and gave it to them and said , “ Take ; this is My body . ”
41014023	And He took a cup ; and after giving thanks , He gave to them and they all drank from it .
41014024	And He said to them , “ This is My blood of the covenant , which is poured out for many .
41014025	Amen , I tell you , I will never again drink of the fruit of the vine , until that day when I drink it anew in the kingdom of God . ”
41014026	After singing the Hallel , they went out to the Mount of Olives .
41014027	And Yeshua said to them , “ You will all fall away , for it is written , ‘ I will strike the Shepherd , and the sheep will be scattered . ’
41014028	But after I’m raised up , I will go before you to the Galilee . ”
41014029	Peter said to Him , “ Even though all fall away , I won’t ! ”
41014030	And Yeshua said to him , “ Amen , I tell you , today — this very night — before a rooster crows twice , you will deny Me three times . ”
41014031	But Peter kept insisting exceedingly , “ Even if I must die with You , I’ll never deny You ! ” And they all were saying the same .
41014032	Then they come to a place whose name is Gethsemane ; and Yeshua says to His disciples , “ Sit here while I pray . ”
41014033	He takes with Him Peter , Jacob , and John ; and He began to be deeply distressed and troubled .
41014034	And He tells them , “ My soul is deeply grieved , even to the point of death . Stay here and keep watch . ”
41014035	Going a little farther , He fell to the ground and began praying that if possible this hour might pass Him by .
41014036	And He was saying , “ Abba , Father , all things are possible for You ! Take this cup from Me ! Yet not what I will , but what You will . ”
41014037	Then He comes and finds them sleeping ; and He tells Peter , “ Simon , you’re asleep ? Couldn’t you keep watch for one hour ?
41014038	Keep watching and praying , so that you do not enter into temptation . The spirit is willing , but the flesh is weak . ”
41014039	Again He went away and prayed , saying the same words .
41014040	And again He came and found them sleeping , for their eyes were very heavy . They didn’t know what to answer Him .
41014041	And He comes the third time and says to them , “ Are you still sleeping and taking your rest ? Enough ! The hour has come . Look , the Son of Man is being delivered into the hands of sinners .
41014042	Get up , let’s go ! Look , My betrayer is near . ”
41014043	Right away , while Yeshua was still speaking , Judah comes up , one of the Twelve , and with him a crowd with swords and clubs , from the ruling kohanim , Torah scholars , and elders .
41014044	Now His betrayer had given them a signal , saying , “ The One I kiss , He’s the One ! Seize Him and lead Him away under guard . ”
41014045	As soon as Judah came , he drew near to Yeshua and said , “ Rabbi ! ” and kissed Him .
41014046	Then they threw their hands on Yeshua and seized Him .
41014047	But one of the bystanders , drawing his sword , struck the servant of the kohen gadol and cut off his ear .
41014048	Yeshua said to them , “ Have you come out with swords and clubs , to capture Me as you would against a revolutionary ?
41014049	Every day I was with you in the Temple teaching , and you didn’t seize Me . But this is so that the Scriptures would be fulfilled . ”
41014050	And all fled , abandoning Him .
41014051	A certain young man was following Him , with nothing but a linen cloth around his body , and they grabbed him .
41014052	But he ran away naked , leaving behind the linen cloth .
41014053	Then they led Yeshua away to the kohen gadol . And all the ruling kohanim , elders , and Torah scholars gathered .
41014054	Peter had followed Him from a distance , right into the courtyard of the kohen gadol . He was sitting with the guards , warming himself by the fire .
41014055	Now the ruling kohanim and all the Sanhedrin kept trying to get evidence against Yeshua so they could put Him to death , but they weren’t finding any .
41014056	Many were giving false testimony against Him , but their testimony wasn’t consistent .
41014057	Some stood up and began to give false testimony against Him , saying ,
41014058	“ We heard Him say , ‘ I will destroy this Temple made with hands , and in three days I will build another made without hands . ’ ”
41014059	Yet even then , their testimony didn’t agree .
41014060	The kohen gadol stood up in the middle and questioned Yeshua , saying , “ Do You have no answer ? What is this they’re testifying against You ? ”
41014061	But keeping silent , Yeshua did not answer . Again the kohen gadol questioned Him , “ Are you Mashiach , Son of the Blessed One ? ”
41014062	“ I am , ” said Yeshua , “ and you shall see ‘ the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Powerful One , ’ and ‘ coming with the clouds of heaven ’ ! ”
41014063	Tearing his clothes , the kohen gadol says , “ Why do we still need witnesses ?
41014064	You’ve heard the blasphemy . What seems right to you ? ” Then all condemned Him as deserving death .
41014065	Some began to spit on Him , to blindfold Him , and to beat Him with their fists , saying , “ Prophesy ! ” Also the guards slapped Him around .
41014066	As Peter was below in the courtyard , one of the servant girls of the kohen gadol comes by .
41014067	Seeing Peter warming himself , she looked straight at him . “ You also were with Yeshua of Natzeret , ” she says .
41014068	But he denied it , saying , “ I don’t know or understand what you’re talking about ! ” Then he went outside to the gateway , and a rooster crowed .
41014069	Seeing him , the servant girl began again to tell the bystanders , “ This is one of them . ”
41014070	But again he denied it . And a little while later , the bystanders were again saying to Peter , “ Surely you’re one of them , for you’re also a Galilean . ”
41014071	But he began to curse himself and to swear an oath : “ I do not know this Man you’re talking about ! ”
41014072	Right then , a rooster crowed a second time . Then Peter called to mind the word Yeshua had said to him : “ Before a rooster crows twice , you will deny Me three times . ” And he broke down and began to weep .
41015001	Right at daybreak , the ruling kohanim held a meeting to consult with the elders and Torah scholars and the whole Sanhedrin . They tied up Yeshua , led Him away , and handed Him over to Pilate .
41015002	Pilate interrogated Him , “ Are You the King of the Jews ? ” Yeshua answers him , “ As you say . ”
41015003	The ruling kohanim began to accuse Him of many things .
41015004	Again , Pilate asked Him , “ Aren’t you going to answer ? Look how many charges they’re bringing against You ! ”
41015005	But Yeshua did not answer , so Pilate was amazed .
41015006	Now during the feast , he used to release to them one prisoner , anyone they were asking for .
41015007	Now a man named Bar-Abba had been in jail with the rebels who had committed murder during the rebellion .
41015008	The crowd came up and began to request what he was accustomed to do for them .
41015009	But Pilate answered them , saying , “ Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews ? ”
41015010	For he knew that out of envy the ruling kohanim had handed Him over .
41015011	But the ruling kohanim stirred up the crowd , so he would release Bar-Abba to them instead .
41015012	Then answering again , Pilate said to them , “ So what do you want me to do with the One you call the King of the Jews ? ”
41015013	They shouted back , “ Execute Him ! ”
41015014	Pilate responded , “ Why ? What evil has He done ? ” But they shouted all the more , “ Execute Him ! ”
41015015	Wanting to satisfy the crowd , Pilate released Bar-Abba for them . And after he had Yeshua scourged , he handed Him over to be crucified .
41015016	The soldiers took Him away , into the palace , the governor’s mansion called the Praetorium . And they call together the cohort of soldiers .
41015017	They dress Him up in purple . After braiding a crown of thorns , they put it on Him .
41015018	And they began to salute Him , “ Hail , King of the Jews ! ”
41015019	Over and over , they kept hitting Him on the head with a staff and spitting on Him ; and kneeling down , they worshiped Him .
41015020	When they finished mocking Him , they stripped the purple off Him and put His own clothes back on Him . And they led Him out to crucify Him .
41015021	Now Simon of Cyrene , the father of Alexander and Rufus , was coming in from the countryside . The soldiers force this passerby to carry Yeshua’s cross-beam .
41015022	They bring Yeshua to the place called Golgotha ( which is translated , Place of a Skull ) .
41015023	They were offering Him wine mixed with myrrh , but He didn’t take it .
41015024	Then they crucify Him and divide up His clothing among themselves , casting lots for them to see who should take what .
41015025	Now it was the third hour when they nailed Him on the stake .
41015026	And the inscription of the charge against Him was written above : “ THE KING OF THE JEWS . ”
41015027	And with Him they execute two outlaws , one on His right and one on His left . ( 28 )
41015029	Those passing by were jeering at Him , shaking their heads and saying , “ Ha ! You who are going to destroy the Temple and rebuild it in three days ,
41015030	save Yourself by coming down from the stake ! ”
41015031	Likewise the ruling kohanim , along with the Torah scholars , were also mocking Him among themselves . “ He saved others , ” they were saying , “ but He can’t save Himself ?
41015032	Let the Messiah , the King of Israel , come down now from the stake , so we may see and believe ! ” Even those executed with Him were ridiculing Him .
41015033	When the sixth hour had come , darkness fell over the whole land until the ninth hour .
41015034	At the ninth hour Yeshua cried out with a loud voice , “ Eloi , Eloi , lema sabachthani ? ” which is translated , “ My God , My God , why have You abandoned Me ? ”
41015035	When some of the bystanders heard it , they began saying , “ Look , He’s calling for Elijah . ”
41015036	Then someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine . He put it on a stick and was offering it to Yeshua to drink , saying , “ Wait , let’s see if Elijah comes to take Him down . ”
41015037	But letting out a loud cry , Yeshua breathed His last .
41015038	Then the curtain of the Temple was split in two , from top to bottom .
41015039	When the centurion , who was standing in front of Him , saw the way Yeshua breathed His last , he said , “ This Man really was the Son of God ! ”
41015040	There were also women watching from a distance . Among them were Miriam from Magdala , Miriam the mother of Jacob the younger and of Joses , and Salome .
41015041	They would follow Him and serve Him when He was in the Galilee . Many other women who had gone up together with Him to Jerusalem were there also .
41015042	Now evening had already come . Since it was the Day of Preparation , that is , the day before Shabbat ,
41015043	Joseph of Arimathea , a respected council member who himself was waiting for the kingdom of God , went boldly to Pilate and asked for Yeshua’s body .
41015044	Pilate was surprised that He was already dead . Summoning the centurion , he asked him whether Yeshua had been dead for long .
41015045	When Pilate learned this from the centurion , he granted the body to Joseph .
41015046	Joseph bought a linen cloth , took Him down , wrapped Him in the linen , and laid Him in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock . Then he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb .
41015047	Miriam from Magdala and Miriam the mother of Joses were watching where Yeshua’s body was placed .
41016001	When Shabbat was over , Miriam of Magdala , Miriam the mother of Jacob , and Salome bought spices , so that they might come and anoint Yeshua’s body .
41016002	Very early on the first day of the week , when the sun had risen , they come to the tomb .
41016003	They were saying to each other , “ Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb ? ”
41016004	Looking up , they see that the stone ( it was really huge ) had been rolled away .
41016005	As they entered the tomb , they saw a young man sitting on the right side , dressed in a white robe ; and they were startled .
41016006	But he said to them , “ Do not be alarmed . You are looking for Yeshua of Natzeret , who was crucified . He is risen ! He is not here ! See the place where they put Him .
41016007	But go , tell His disciples and Peter , ‘ He is going before you to the Galilee . There you will see Him , just as He told you . ’ ”
41016008	And going outside , they fled from the tomb , gripped by trembling and amazement . They didn’t say anything to anybody , for they were afraid .
41016009	After He had risen early on the first day of the week , He appeared first to Miriam of Magdala , from whom He had driven out seven demons .
41016010	She went and brought word to those who had been with Him , while they were mourning and weeping .
41016011	When they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her , they refused to believe .
41016012	After that , He appeared in a different form to two of them as they were walking on their way to the country .
41016013	They went and reported it to the rest , but they did not believe them either .
41016014	Later He appeared to them , the eleven , as they were reclining at the table . He rebuked them for their unbelief and hardheartedness , because they did not believe those who had seen Him after He had been raised .
41016015	He told them , “ Go into all the world and proclaim the Good News to every creature .
41016016	He who believes and is immersed shall be saved , but he who does not believe shall be condemned .
41016017	These signs will accompany those who believe : in My name they will drive out demons ; they will speak new languages ;
41016018	they will handle snakes ; and if they drink anything deadly , it will not harm them ; they will lay hands on the sick , and they will get well . ”
41016019	Then the Lord Yeshua , after He had spoken to them , was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God .
41016020	And they went out and proclaimed everywhere , the Lord working with them and confirming the word by the signs that follow .
42001001	Now many have undertaken to organize an account of the events fulfilled among us ,
42001002	just as they were handed down to us from the start by the eyewitnesses and reporters of the word .
42001003	Therefore it seemed best to me also , because I have carefully investigated everything from the beginning , to write for you an orderly record , most excellent Theophilus ,
42001004	so you may know for sure the truth of the words you have been taught .
42001005	In the days of Herod , King of Judah , there was a kohen named Zechariah from the priestly division of Abijah . Elizabeth , his wife , was from the daughters of Aaron .
42001006	Together they were righteous before Adonai , walking without fault in all His commandments and instructions .
42001007	But they were childless , because Elizabeth was barren and both of them were elderly .
42001008	Now it happened to be Zechariah’s time to serve as kohen before Adonai in the order of his division .
42001009	According to the custom of the priestly office , it became his lot to enter the Holy Place of Adonai to burn incense .
42001010	And the whole crowd of people was praying outside at the hour of incense burning .
42001011	An angel of Adonai appeared to him , standing at the right side of the altar of incense .
42001012	Zechariah was in turmoil when he saw the angel , and fear fell upon him .
42001013	But the angel said , “ Do not be afraid , Zechariah , because your prayer has been heard . Your wife , Elizabeth , will give birth to your son , and you will name him John .
42001014	And you will have joy and gladness , and many will rejoice at his birth .
42001015	He will be great before Adonai ; and he should not drink wine and intoxicating beverage , but he will be filled with the Ruach ha-Kodesh just out of his mother’s womb .
42001016	Many of B’nei-Israel will turn to Adonai their God .
42001017	And he will go before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah , to turn the hearts of fathers to the children and the disobedient ones to the wisdom of the righteous , to make ready for Adonai a prepared people .
42001018	Zechariah said to the angel , “ How will I know this for certain ? I’m an old man , and my wife is well-advanced in age . ”
42001019	And speaking to him , the angel declared , “ I am Gabriel , the one standing in God’s presence . I was commissioned to tell you and proclaim to you this good news .
42001020	So look , you will be silent and powerless to speak until the day these things happen , since you did not believe my words which will be fulfilled in their time . ”
42001021	The people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering about his long delay in the Holy Place .
42001022	But when he came out , he couldn’t speak to them . Then they realized that he had seen a vision in the Holy Place . He was making signs to them but remained mute .
42001023	When the days of his priestly service had been completed , he went home .
42001024	After these days , his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and hid herself for five months , saying ,
42001025	“ Adonai has done this for me ! In these days He looked upon me , to take away my disgrace among the people . ”
42001026	Then in the sixth month , the angel Gabriel was sent by Adonai into a town in the Galilee named Natzeret
42001027	and to a virgin engaged to a man named Joseph , of the house of David . The virgin’s name was Miriam .
42001028	And coming to her , the angel said , “ Shalom , favored one ! Adonai is with you . ”
42001029	But at the message , she was perplexed and kept wondering what kind of greeting this might be .
42001030	The angel spoke to her , “ Do not be afraid , Miriam , for you have found favor with God .
42001031	Behold , you will become pregnant and give birth to a son , and you shall call His name Yeshua .
42001032	He will be great and will be called Ben-Elyon . Adonai Elohim will give Him the throne of David , His father .
42001033	He shall reign over the house of Jacob for all eternity , and His kingdom will be without end . ”
42001034	Miriam said to the angel , “ How can this be , since I am not intimate with a man ? ”
42001035	And responding , the angel said to her , “ The Ruach ha-Kodesh will come upon you , and the power of Elyon will overshadow you . Therefore , the Holy One being born will be called Ben-Elohim .
42001036	Behold , even your relative Elizabeth has conceived a son in her old age ; and the one who was called barren is six months pregnant .
42001037	For nothing will be impossible with God . ”
42001038	So Miriam said , “ Behold , the servant of Adonai . Let it be done to me according to your word . ” And the angel left her .
42001039	Now in those days , Miriam got up and quickly traveled into the hill country , to a town in Judah .
42001040	She entered Zechariah’s home and happily greeted Elizabeth .
42001041	When Elizabeth heard Miriam’s greeting , the unborn child leaped in her womb ; and Elizabeth was completely filled with the Ruach ha-Kodesh .
42001042	She then cried out with a great shout , saying , “ You are blessed among women , and blessed is the fruit of your womb .
42001043	Who am I , that the mother of my Master should come to me ?
42001044	For even when I just heard the sound of your greeting in my ear , the unborn child leaped with joy in my womb .
42001045	Blessed is she who trusted that there would be a fulfillment of those things spoken to her by Adonai . ”
42001046	Then Miriam said , “ My soul magnifies Adonai ,
42001047	and my spirit greatly rejoices in God , my Savior .
42001048	For He has looked with care upon the humble state of His maidservant . For behold , from now on all generations will call me blessed .
42001049	For the Mighty One has done a great thing for me , and holy is His name .
42001050	And His mercy is from generation to generation to the ones who fear Him .
42001051	He has displayed power with His arm He has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts .
42001052	He has brought down rulers from thrones and exalted humble ones .
42001053	He has filled the hungry with good things and sent away the rich empty-handed .
42001054	He has helped His servant Israel , remembering His mercy ,
42001055	just as He spoke to our fathers , to Abraham and to his seed forever . ”
42001056	Miriam stayed with her for three months and then returned to her home .
42001057	Upon Elizabeth’s full term to deliver , she gave birth to a son .
42001058	Her neighbors and relatives heard how Adonai had shown her His great mercy , and they began to rejoice with her .
42001059	Now on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child , and they kept trying to call him by his father’s name , Zechariah .
42001060	But his mother declared , “ No , he will be called John . ”
42001061	But they said to her , “ No one among your relatives is called by this name . ”
42001062	So they began making signs to his father , as to what he wanted him named .
42001063	Asking for a small tablet , he wrote , “ John is his name . ” They were all astonished !
42001064	And his mouth was immediately unlocked as well as his tongue , and he began to speak , praising God .
42001065	Fear came on all those who lived around them , and all these matters were talked about throughout the hill country of Judah .
42001066	Everyone who heard pondered these things in their hearts , saying , “ What then will this child become ? ” For the hand of Adonai was on him .
42001067	His father Zechariah was filled with the Ruach ha-Kodesh and prophesied , saying ,
42001068	“ Blessed be Adonai , God of Israel , for He has looked after His people and brought them redemption .
42001069	He has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of His servant David ,
42001070	just as He spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets from ages past ,
42001071	salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us !
42001072	So He shows mercy to our fathers and remembers His holy covenant ,
42001073	the vow which He swore to Abraham our father , to grant us —
42001074	rescued fearlessly from the hand of our enemies — to serve Him ,
42001075	in holiness and righteousness before Him all our days .
42001076	And you , child , will be called a prophet of Elyon . For you will go before Adonai to prepare His ways ,
42001077	to give knowledge of salvation to His people through removal of their sins .
42001078	Through our God’s heart of mercy , the Sunrise from on high will come upon us ,
42001079	to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death , to guide our feet in the way of shalom . ”
42001080	And the child kept growing and became strong in spirit ; and he lived in the wilderness until the day of his public appearance to Israel .
42002001	Now it happened in those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus to register all the world’s inhabitants .
42002002	This was the first census taken when Quirinius was governor of Syria .
42002003	Everyone was traveling to be registered in his own city .
42002004	Now Joseph also went up from the Galilee , out of the town of Natzeret to Judah , to the city of David , which is called Bethlehem , because he was from the house and family of David .
42002005	He went to register with Miriam , who was engaged to him and was pregnant .
42002006	But while they were there , the time came for her to give birth —
42002007	and she gave birth to her firstborn son . She wrapped Him in strips of cloth and set Him down in a manger , since there was no room for them in the inn .
42002008	Now there were shepherds in the same region , living out in the fields and guarding their flock at night .
42002009	Suddenly an angel of Adonai stood before them , and the glory of Adonai shone all around them ; and they were absolutely terrified .
42002010	But the angel said to them , “ Do not be afraid ! For behold , I proclaim Good News to you , which will be great joy to all the people .
42002011	A Savior is born to you today in the city of David , who is Messiah the Lord .
42002012	And the sign to you is this : You will find an infant wrapped in strips of cloth and lying in a manger . ”
42002013	And suddenly a multitude of heavenly armies appeared with the angel , praising God and saying ,
42002014	“ Glory to God in the highest , and on earth shalom to men of good will . ”
42002015	And when the angels departed from them into the heavens , the shepherds were saying to one another , “ Let’s go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened which Adonai has made known to us ! ”
42002016	So they hurried off and found Miriam and Joseph , and the Baby lying in the manger .
42002017	When they had seen this , they made known the word that had been spoken to them concerning this Child .
42002018	And all those who heard were amazed at the things the shepherds told them .
42002019	But Miriam treasured all these things , pondering them in her heart .
42002020	The shepherds returned , glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen , just as they had been told .
42002021	When eight days had passed for His brit-milah , He was named Yeshua , the name given by the angel before He was conceived in the womb .
42002022	And when the days of their purification were fulfilled , according to the Torah of Moses , they brought Him to Jerusalem to present to Adonai .
42002023	As it is written in the Torah of Adonai , “ Every firstborn male that opens the womb shall be called holy to Adonai . ”
42002024	So they offered a sacrifice according to what was said in the Torah of Adonai : “ a pair of turtle doves , or two young pigeons . ”
42002025	Now there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon , and this man was just and pious , waiting for the consolation of Israel . The Ruach ha-Kodesh was on him .
42002026	And it had been revealed to him by the Ruach ha-Kodesh that he would not die before he had seen the Anointed One of Adonai .
42002027	So in the Ruach , Simeon came into the Temple ; and when the parents brought the Child Yeshua to do for Him according to the custom of the Torah ,
42002028	Simeon received Him into his arms and offered a bracha to God , saying ,
42002029	“ Now may You let Your servant go in peace , O Sovereign Master , according to Your word .
42002030	For my eyes have seen Your salvation ,
42002031	which You have prepared in the presence of all peoples :
42002032	‘ A light for revelation to the nations’ and the glory of Your people Israel . ”
42002033	And His father and mother were marveling at the things that were said about Him .
42002034	And Simeon offered a bracha over them and said to Miriam His mother , “ Behold , this One is destined to cause the fall and rise of many in Israel , and to be a sign that is opposed ,
42002035	so the thoughts of many hearts may be uncovered . ( And even for you , a sword will pierce through your soul . ) ”
42002036	Now Anna , a daughter of Phanuel of the tribe of Asher , was a prophetess . She was well advanced in age , having lived with a husband only seven years
42002037	and then as a widow until age eighty-four . She never left the Temple , serving night and day with fasting and prayers .
42002038	And coming up at that very instant , she began praising God and speaking about the Child to all those waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem .
42002039	When Joseph and Miriam had completed everything according to the Torah of Adonai , they returned to the Galilee , to their own city of Natzeret .
42002040	The Child kept growing and became strong , filled with wisdom ; and the favor of God was upon Him .
42002041	Now His parents were going every year to Jerusalem for the Passover feast .
42002042	When He became twelve years old , they were going up according to festival custom .
42002043	As they headed home after completing the days , the boy Yeshua remained in Jerusalem , but His parents didn’t know .
42002044	Supposing He was in the caravan , they went a day’s journey , then began looking for Him among relatives and friends .
42002045	When they did not find Him , they returned to Jerusalem to search for Him .
42002046	After three days they found Him in the Temple , sitting in the center of the teachers , listening to them and asking them questions .
42002047	And all those hearing Him were astonished at His understanding and His answers .
42002048	When His parents saw Yeshua , they were overwhelmed . And His mother said to Him , “ Child , why did you do this to us ? Look ! Your father and I were searching for You frantically ! ”
42002049	He said to them , “ Why were you searching for Me ? Didn’t you know that I must be about the things of My Father ? ”
42002050	But they did not grasp the message He was telling them .
42002051	Then He went down with them to Natzeret and was obedient to them . But His mother treasured all these words in her heart .
42002052	And Yeshua kept increasing in wisdom and stature , and in favor with God and men .
42003001	It was now the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar — when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea , and Herod was tetrarch of the Galilee , and his brother Philip was tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis , and Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene .
42003002	During the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas , the word of God came upon John , the son of Zechariah , in the wilderness .
42003003	And he came into all the surrounding region of the Jordan , proclaiming an immersion of repentance for the removal of sins .
42003004	As it is written in the scroll of the words of Isaiah the prophet , “ The voice of one crying in the wilderness , ‘ Prepare the way of Adonai , and make His paths straight .
42003005	Every valley shall be filled up and every mountain and hill brought low . The crooked shall be made straight and the rough ways made smooth ,
42003006	and all humanity shall see the salvation of God . ’ ”
42003007	Therefore John was saying to the crowds that came out to be immersed by him , “ You brood of vipers ! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath ?
42003008	Therefore produce fruits worthy of repentance ; and don’t even begin to say among yourselves , ‘ We have Abraham as our father ’ ! For I tell you that from these stones God can raise up children for Abraham .
42003009	Even now the axe is laid at the root of the trees , so every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire ! ”
42003010	The crowds were asking him , “ What should we do ? ”
42003011	He answered them , saying , “ Whoever has two coats , let him give to the one who has none ; and whoever has food , let him do the same . ”
42003012	Tax collectors also came to him to be immersed . “ Teacher , ” they said to him , “ what should we do ? ”
42003013	He said to them , “ Do not take more than you are supposed to . ”
42003014	Also soldiers asked him , saying , “ And what should we do ? ” He said to them , “ Do not take things from anyone by force , do not falsely accuse anyone , and be content with your wages . ”
42003015	Now the people were filled with expectation , and all were wondering in their hearts about John , whether he might be the Messiah .
42003016	John answered them all , saying , “ As for me , I immerse you with water . But One is coming who is mightier than I am ; I am not worthy to untie the strap of His sandals ! He will immerse you in the Ruach ha-Kodesh and fire .
42003017	His winnowing fork is in His hand to clear His threshing floor and gather the wheat into His barn , but the chaff He will burn up with inextinguishable fire . ”
42003018	So with many other exhortations , John proclaimed Good News to the people .
42003019	But Herod the tetrarch — after being rebuked by John because of Herodias , his brother’s wife , and because of all the evil things Herod had done —
42003020	added even this on top of them all : he shut up John in prison .
42003021	Now when all the people were immersed , Yeshua also was immersed . And while He was praying , heaven was opened
42003022	and the Ruach ha-Kodesh came down upon Him in bodily form like a dove . And from out of heaven came a voice , “ You are My Son , whom I love — with You I am well pleased ! ”
42003023	Yeshua was about thirty years old when He began his ministry . He was the son ( as was supposed ) of Joseph , the son of Heli ,
42003024	the son of Matthat , the son of Levi , the son of Melki , the son of Jannai , the son of Joseph ,
42003025	the son of Mattathias , the son of Amos , the son of Nahum , the son of Esli , the son of Naggai ,
42003026	the son of Maath , the son of Mattathias , the son of Semein , the son of Josech , the son of Joda ,
42003027	the son of Joanan , the son of Rhesa , the son of Zerubbabel , the son of Shealtiel , the son of Neri ,
42003028	the son of Melki , the son of Addi , the son of Cosam , the son of Elmadam , the son of Er ,
42003029	the son of Joshua , the son of Eliezer , the son of Jorim , the son of Matthat , the son of Levi ,
42003030	the son of Simeon , the son of Judah , the son of Joseph , the son of Jonam , the son of Eliakim ,
42003031	the son of Melea , the son of Menna , the son of Mattatha , the son of Nathan , the son of David ,
42003032	the son of Jesse , the son of Obed , the son of Boaz , the son of Salmon , the son of Nahshon ,
42003033	the son of Amminadab , the son of Ram , the son of Hezron , the son of Perez , the son of Judah ,
42003034	the son of Jacob , the son of Yitzhak , the son of Abraham , the son of Terah , the son of Nahor ,
42003035	the son of Serug , the son of Reu , the son of Peleg , the son of Eber , the son of Shelah ,
42003036	the son of Cainan , the son of Arphaxad , the son of Shem , the son of Noah , the son of Lamech ,
42003037	the son of Methuselah , the son of Enoch , the son of Jared , the son of Mahalalel , the son of Kenan ,
42003038	the son of Enosh , the son of Seth , the son of Adam , the son of God .
42004001	Yeshua , now filled with the Ruach ha-Kodesh , returned from the Jordan . He was led by the Ruach in the wilderness
42004002	for forty days , being tested by the devil . Now He ate nothing during those days , and when they had ended , He was hungry .
42004003	The devil said to Him , “ If You are Ben-Elohim , tell this stone to become bread . ”
42004004	Yeshua answered him , “ It is written , ‘ Man shall not live by bread alone . ’ ”
42004005	And leading Him up , the devil showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in an instant .
42004006	And the devil said to Him , “ I’ll give to You all this authority along with its glory , because it has been handed over to me and I can give it to anyone I wish .
42004007	Therefore , if you will worship before me , all this shall be Yours . ”
42004008	But answering , Yeshua told him , “ It is written , ‘ You shall worship Adonai your God , and Him only shall you serve . ’ ”
42004009	Then he brought Yeshua to Jerusalem and placed Him on the highest point of the Temple . He said to Him , “ If You are Ben-Elohim , throw Yourself down from here .
42004010	For it is written , ‘ He will command His angels concerning you , to guard you , ’
42004011	and ‘ upon their hands they will lift you up , so that you may not strike your foot against a stone . ’ ”
42004012	But answering , Yeshua said to him , “ It is said , ‘ You shall not put Adonai your God to the test . ’ ”
42004013	And when the devil had completed every test , he departed from Him until another occasion .
42004014	Yeshua returned in the power of the Ruach to the Galilee , and news about Him went out through all the surrounding region .
42004015	He taught in their synagogues , and everyone was praising Him .
42004016	And He came to Natzeret , where He had been raised . As was His custom , He went into the synagogue on Shabbat , and He got up to read .
42004017	When the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to Him , He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written ,
42004018	“ The Ruach Adonai is on me , because He has anointed me to proclaim Good News to the poor . He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind , to set free the oppressed ,
42004019	and to proclaim the year of Adonai’s favor . ”
42004020	He closed the scroll , gave it back to the attendant , and sat down . All eyes in the synagogue were focused on Him .
42004021	Then He began to tell them , “ Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your ears . ”
42004022	All were speaking well of Him and marveling at the gracious words coming out of His mouth . And they were saying , “ Isn’t this the son of Joseph ? ”
42004023	But He said to them , “ Doubtless you will say to Me this proverb , ‘ Doctor , heal yourself ! ’ and ‘ What we have heard was done at Capernaum , do as much here also in your hometown . ’ ”
42004024	But He said , “ Truly , I tell you , ‘ No prophet is accepted in his own hometown . ’
42004025	But with all truthfulness I say to you , that there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah , when heaven was closed for three and a half years and there came a great famine over all the land .
42004026	Elijah was not sent to any of them , but only to Zarephath in the land of Sidon , to a widowed woman .
42004027	There were many with tzara’at in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet , and none of them were purified apart from Naaman the Syrian . ”
42004028	Now all in the synagogue were filled with rage upon hearing these things .
42004029	Rising up , they drove Him out of the town and brought Him as far as the edge of the mountain on which their city had been built , in order to throw Him off the cliff .
42004030	But passing through the middle of them , He went on His way .
42004031	Yeshua came down to Capernaum , a town in the Galilee . He was teaching them on Shabbat ,
42004032	and they were astounded at His teaching because His message had authority .
42004033	In the synagogue was a man who had a unclean demonic spirit , and he cried out with a loud voice ,
42004034	“ Ah ! What have we to do with You , Yeshua of Natzeret ? Have You come to destroy us ? I know who You are ! You are the Holy One of God ! ”
42004035	Yeshua rebuked him , saying , “ Quiet ! Come out of him ! ” And when the demon threw him down in their midst , it came out without hurting him .
42004036	They were all amazed , and they spoke to one another , saying , “ What is this message ? For with authority and power He commands the unclean spirits , and they come out . ”
42004037	So His reputation grew , spreading to every place in that region .
42004038	After He left the synagogue , Yeshua entered Simon’s home . Simon’s mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever , and they petitioned Him concerning her .
42004039	Then standing over her , He rebuked the fever and it left her . Immediately she arose to wait on them .
42004040	When the sun was setting , they brought to Yeshua all who were sick with various diseases . And He was laying hands on each one and healing them .
42004041	Even demons were coming out from many , shouting out and saying , “ You are Ben-Elohim ! ” But He was rebuking them and not permitting them to speak , because they knew Him to be the Messiah .
42004042	Now when it was day , He left and went to a desert place . The crowds were searching for Him , and they came to Him and were trying to keep Him from leaving them .
42004043	But He said to them , “ I must proclaim the Good News of the kingdom of God to the other towns also . It was for this purpose I was sent . ”
42004044	So He kept preaching in the synagogues of Judea .
42005001	It happened that the crowds were pressing upon Yeshua to hear the word of God as He was standing by the Lake of Kinneret ,
42005002	when He saw two boats standing beside the lake . Now the fishermen had left them and were washing the nets .
42005003	Getting into one of the boats , Simon’s boat , Yeshua asked him to push out a ways from the land . Then sitting down , He taught the crowds from the boat .
42005004	When He had finished speaking , He said to Simon , “ Go out into the deep water , and let down your nets for a catch . ”
42005005	Simon replied , “ Master , we’ve worked hard all night and caught nothing . But at Your word I will let down the nets . ”
42005006	When they had done this , they caught so many fish that their nets began to break .
42005007	So they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them . They came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink .
42005008	But when Simon Peter saw this , he fell down at Yeshua’s knees , saying , “ Go away from me , Master , for I am a sinful man ! ”
42005009	For amazement had gripped him and all who were with him , over the catch of fish they had netted ;
42005010	so also Jacob and John , Zebedee’s sons , who were partners with Simon . But Yeshua said to Simon , “ Do not be afraid . From now on , you will be catching men . ”
42005011	So when they had brought the boats to the landing , they left everything and followed Him .
42005012	Now while Yeshua was in one of the towns , a man covered with tzara’at appeared . And when he saw Yeshua , he fell on his face and begged Him , saying , “ Master , if You are willing , You can make me clean . ”
42005013	Yeshua stretched out His hand and touched him , saying , “ I am willing . Be cleansed ! ” Immediately , the tzara’at left him .
42005014	Yeshua ordered him to tell no one , but commanded him , “ Go and show yourself to the kohen . Then bring an offering for your cleansing , just as Moses commanded , as a testimony to them . ”
42005015	But the news about Yeshua was spreading all the more , and many crowds were coming together to hear and to be healed of their diseases .
42005016	Yet He would often slip away into the wilderness and pray .
42005017	Now on one of those days , Yeshua was teaching . Pharisees and Torah scholars were sitting there , who had come from every village of the Galilee and Judea , as well as from Jerusalem . And Adonai’s power to heal was in Him .
42005018	And behold , men were carrying a paralyzed man on a stretcher , trying to bring him in and place him before Yeshua .
42005019	But when they found no way to bring him in because of the crowd , they went up on the roof and let him down with his stretcher through the tiles , right in the middle before Yeshua .
42005020	When He saw their faith , He said , “ Man , your sins are forgiven . ”
42005021	Then the Torah scholars and the Pharisees began to question , saying , “ Who is this fellow speaking blasphemies ? Who can pardon sins but God alone ? ”
42005022	Yeshua , knowing their thoughts , replied to them , “ Why are you raising questions in your hearts ?
42005023	Which is easier , to say , ‘ Your sins are forgiven you , ’ or to say , ‘ Get up and walk ’ ?
42005024	But so you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to pardon sins … . ” He said to the paralyzed one , “ I tell you , get up and take your cot , and go home ! ”
42005025	Immediately he got up before them , picked up what he had been lying on , and went home , glorifying God .
42005026	Astonishment took hold of them , and they glorified God and all were filled with awe , saying , “ We’ve seen incredible things today ! ”
42005027	After these things , Yeshua went out and observed a tax collector named Levi , sitting at the tax booth . He said to him , “ Follow Me . ”
42005028	And leaving everything , he got up and followed Him .
42005029	Levi made a great banquet for Yeshua at his house , and there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining with them .
42005030	The Pharisees and their Torah scholars began murmuring to His disciples , saying , “ Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners ? ”
42005031	And Yeshua answered and said to them , “ Those who are healthy have no need for a doctor , but those who are sick do .
42005032	I did not come to call the righteous , but the sinful to repentance . ”
42005033	But they said to Him , “ John’s disciples often fast and offer prayers , as do the disciples of the Pharisees . But Your disciples are eating and drinking . ”
42005034	But Yeshua said to them , “ You cannot make the guests of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them , can you ?
42005035	But the days will come ; and when the bridegroom is taken away from them , then they will fast in those days . ”
42005036	Now he was also telling them a parable . “ No one tears a patch from a new garment to use it on an old garment . Otherwise he will rip the new , and the patch from the new will not match the old .
42005037	And no one puts new wine into old wineskins . Otherwise , the new wine will burst the skins , it will be spilled out , and the skins will be destroyed .
42005038	But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins .
42005039	No man who drinks old wine wants new , because he says , ‘ The old is fine . ’ ”
42006001	Now during Shabbat , Yeshua was passing through grain fields ; and His disciples were picking and eating heads of grain , rubbing them in their hands .
42006002	But some of the Pharisees said , “ Why are you doing what is not permitted on Shabbat ? ”
42006003	Then answering them , Yeshua said , “ Haven’t you read what David did when he was hungry , and those with him ?
42006004	How he entered into the house of God , took and ate the showbread which only the kohanim are permitted to eat , and even gave it to those with him ? ”
42006005	He said to them , “ The Son of Man is Lord of Shabbat . ”
42006006	On a different Shabbat , Yeshua entered the synagogue and was teaching . A man was there , whose right hand was paralyzed .
42006007	But closely watching Him were the Torah scholars and Pharisees , to see if He heals on Shabbat , so that they might find grounds to accuse Him .
42006008	But He knew their opinions and said to the man with the paralyzed hand , “ Get up and stand in our midst . ” And getting up , the man stood .
42006009	Yeshua said to them , “ I ask you , is it permitted on Shabbat to do good or to do evil , to save or to destroy a life ? ”
42006010	Then looking around at everyone , He said to the man , “ Stretch out your hand . ” The man did , and his hand was restored .
42006011	But they were filled with fury and discussed among themselves what they might do to Yeshua .
42006012	And it was during these days that Yeshua went out to the mountain to pray , and He spent all night in prayer to God .
42006013	When day came , He called His disciples , choosing from among them twelve whom He also named shlichim —
42006014	Simon , whom He also named Peter , and Andrew his brother ; and Jacob and John ; and Philip and Bartholomew ;
42006015	and Matthew and Thomas ; Jacob the son of Alphaeus ; Simon who was called the Zealot ;
42006016	Judah the son of Jacob ; and Judah from Kriot , who became a traitor .
42006017	Then Yeshua came down with them and stood on a level place . A large crowd of His disciples and a multitude of people , from all Judea , Jerusalem , and the coastal region of Tyre and Sidon ,
42006018	had come to hear Him and to be healed of their diseases . Even those disturbed by defiling spirits were being healed .
42006019	Everyone in the crowd was trying to touch Him , because power flowed from Him and He was healing them all .
42006020	And looking up at His disciples , He said , “ Blessed are you who are poor , for yours is the kingdom of God .
42006021	Blessed are you who hunger now , for you shall be satisfied . Blessed are you who weep now , for you shall laugh .
42006022	Blessed are you when people hate you , and when they exclude you , and revile you , and spurn your name as evil on account of the Son of Man .
42006023	Rejoice in that day and jump for joy ! For behold , your reward is great in heaven ! For their fathers used to treat the prophets the same way . ”
42006024	But woe to you who are rich , for you are receiving your comfort in full .
42006025	Woe to you who are full , for you shall be hungry . Woe to you who are laughing now , for you shall mourn and weep .
42006026	Woe to you when all men speak well of you , for their fathers used to treat the false prophets the same way . ”
42006027	“ But I say to you who are listening : Love your enemies , do good to those who hate you ,
42006028	bless those who curse you , pray for the ones who mistreat you .
42006029	To the one who strikes you on the cheek , offer the other also . And from the one who takes your cloak , do not hold back your shirt .
42006030	Give to every one who asks you ; and whoever takes something of yours , make no demands upon him .
42006031	“ Do to others as you would have them do to you .
42006032	If you love those who love you , what credit is that to you ? For even sinners love those who love them .
42006033	And if you do good to those who are doing good to you , what credit is that to you ? Even sinners do this .
42006034	And if you lend to those from whom you expect to take , what credit is that to you ? Even sinners lend to sinners in order to receive back the same .
42006035	“ But love your enemies , and do good , and lend , expecting nothing in return . Then your reward will be great and you will be sons of Elyon , for He is kind to the ungrateful and evil ones .
42006036	Be compassionate , just as your Father is compassionate to you . ”
42006037	Do not judge , and you will not be judged . Do not condemn , and you will not be condemned . Pardon , and you will be pardoned .
42006038	Give , and it will be given to you — a good measure , pressed down , shaken together , overflowing , will be given into your lap . For whatever measure you measure out will be measured back to you . ”
42006039	He also spoke this parable to them : “ The blind cannot show the way to the blind , can he ? Won’t they both fall into a pit ?
42006040	A disciple is not above his teacher , but everyone who is fully trained will be like his teacher .
42006041	“ Why do you look at the speck in your brother’s eye , but do not notice the beam in your own eye ?
42006042	How can you say to your brother , ‘ Brother , let me take out the speck in your eye , ’ when you yourself do not see the beam in your own eye ? You hypocrite ! First take the beam out of your own eye , and then you will see clearly the speck in your brother’s eye , to take it out . ”
42006043	“ For there is no good tree that produces rotten fruit , nor again does a rotten tree produce good fruit .
42006044	Each tree comes to be known by its own fruit . For figs are not gleaned out of briars ; neither are bunches of grapes gathered from thorn bushes .
42006045	“ Out of the good treasure of his heart the good man brings forth good , and out of evil the evil man brings forth evil . For from the overflow of the heart his mouth speaks . ”
42006046	“ Why do you call Me ‘ Master , Master ’ and do not do what I say ?
42006047	Everyone who comes to Me and hears My words and does them , I will show you what he is like .
42006048	He is like a man building a house , who dug deep and laid a foundation on the rock . And when a flood came , the torrent burst against that house but could not shake it , because it had been well built .
42006049	“ But the one who hears yet does not do is like a man who built a house upon land without a foundation . When the torrent burst against it , immediately it collapsed — and the destruction of that house was great ! ”
42007001	When Yeshua finished all His drash in the hearing of the people , He entered Capernaum .
42007002	Now a certain centurion had a valued slave , who was ill and about to die .
42007003	When he heard about Yeshua , he sent Jewish elders to Him , asking Him to come and save his slave .
42007004	When they came to Yeshua , they begged Him earnestly , saying , “ He is worthy for You to grant this ,
42007005	for he loves our people and even built our synagogue . ”
42007006	Now Yeshua started to go with them ; and when He wasn’t far from the house , the centurion sent friends to say to Him , “ Master , do not trouble Yourself , for I’m not worthy for You to come under my roof .
42007007	That is why I didn’t consider myself worthy to come to You . But say the word and let my servant be healed .
42007008	For I also am a man under authority , with soldiers under me . I say to this one , ‘ Go ! ’ and he goes ; and to another , ‘ Come ! ’ and he comes ; and to my servant , ‘ Do this ! ’ and he does it . ”
42007009	Now when Yeshua heard this , He was amazed at him . Turning to the crowd following Him , He said , “ I tell you , not even in Israel have I found such great faith . ”
42007010	When those who had been sent returned to the house , they found the slave in good health .
42007011	The next day Yeshua traveled to a town called Nain , and coming along with Him were His disciples and a large crowd .
42007012	Just as He came near the town gate , behold , a dead man was being carried out , the only son of his mother , a widow . A considerable crowd from the town was with her .
42007013	When the Lord saw her , He felt compassion for her and said , “ Don’t cry . ”
42007014	Then He came up and touched the coffin , and the pallbearers came to a standstill . He said , “ Young man ! I tell you , get up ! ”
42007015	The dead man sat up and began speaking , and Yeshua gave him to his mother .
42007016	Fear took hold of them all , and they glorified God , saying , “ A great prophet has appeared among us , and God has visited His people . ”
42007017	This report concerning Him spread throughout all Judea and the surrounding region .
42007018	John’s disciples reported to him about all these things . Calling two of his disciples ,
42007019	John sent them to the Lord , saying , “ Are you the One who is to come , or should we look for another ? ”
42007020	When they appeared before Him , the men said , “ John the Immerser sent us to you , saying , ‘ Are you the One who is to come , or shall we look for another ? ’ ”
42007021	At this very hour He was healing many of diseases , sicknesses , and evil spirits ; and He granted sight to many who were blind .
42007022	And answering , He said to them , “ Go report to John what you saw and heard : the blind see , the lame walk , those with tzara’at are cleansed , the deaf hear , the dead are raised , and the poor have good news proclaimed to them .
42007023	Blessed is he who is not led to stumble because of Me . ”
42007024	And after John’s messengers left , He began to speak about John to the crowds . “ What did you go out to the wilderness to see ? A reed shaken by the wind ?
42007025	No ? So what did you go out to see ? A man dressed in fine garments ? Look , those who wear finery and live in luxury are in the palaces of kings !
42007026	Then what did you go out to see ? A prophet ? Yes , I tell you , even more than a prophet .
42007027	This is the one about whom it is written , ‘ Behold , I send My messenger before You , who will prepare Your way before You . ’
42007028	I say to you , there is no one greater than John among those born of women ; yet the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he . ”
42007029	And when all the people heard , even the tax collectors , they affirmed God’s justice , because they had been immersed with John’s immersion .
42007030	But the Pharisees and Torah lawyers , not having been immersed by John , declared God’s purpose invalid for themselves .
42007031	“ So then , to what shall I compare the people of this generation ? What are they like ?
42007032	They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to each other , saying , ‘ We played the flute for you , and you didn’t dance . We sang a dirge , and you didn’t weep . ’
42007033	“ For John the Immerser has come not eating bread nor drinking wine , and you say , ‘ He has a demon . ’
42007034	The Son of Man has come eating and drinking . and you say , ‘ Look , a glutton and a drunkard , a friend of tax collectors and sinners ! ’
42007035	Yet wisdom is vindicated by all her children . ”
42007036	Now one of the Pharisees was asking Yeshua if He would eat with him . Upon entering the Pharisee’s home , He reclined at the table .
42007037	And behold , a woman in the town who was a sinner , when she discovered that Yeshua was reclining at the Pharisee’s home , brought an alabaster jar of perfume .
42007038	As she stood behind Him at His feet , weeping , she began to drench His feet with tears and kept wiping them with her head of hair . Then she was kissing His feet and anointing them with perfume .
42007039	Now when the Pharisee who invited Him saw this , he said to himself , “ If this were a prophet , He would know what sort of woman is touching Him — that she’s a sinner . ”
42007040	And answering , Yeshua said to him , “ Simon , I have something to say to you . ” And he said , “ Say it , Teacher ! ”
42007041	“ A moneylender had two debtors . One owed him five hundred denarii , but the other fifty .
42007042	When neither could repay him , he canceled both debts . So which of them will love him more ? ”
42007043	Simon replied , “ I suppose the one who had the bigger debt canceled . ” “ You have judged correctly , ” Yeshua said .
42007044	Turning toward the woman , He said to Simon , “ Do you see this woman ? I entered into your house , and you didn’t give Me water for My feet . But she has drenched My feet with tears and wiped them with her hair .
42007045	You didn’t greet Me with a kiss ; but from the time she entered , she has not stopped kissing My feet .
42007046	You didn’t anoint My head with oil , but she has anointed My feet with perfume .
42007047	For this reason I tell you , her sins , which are many , have been forgiven — for she loved much . But the one who is forgiven little , loves little .
42007048	He then said to her , “ Your sins have been forgiven . ”
42007049	But those who were reclining at table with Him began to say to one another , “ Who is this , who even forgives sins ? ”
42007050	Then He said to the woman , “ Your faith has saved you . Go in shalom . ”
42008001	Soon afterward , Yeshua began traveling throughout towns and villages , preaching and proclaiming the Good News of the Kingdom of God . The twelve were also with Him .
42008002	And certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities — Miriam , the one called Magdalene , out of whom seven demons had gone ;
42008003	Joanna , the wife of Kuza , Herod’s finance minister ; Susanna ; and many others — were supporting them out of their own resources .
42008004	And when a large crowd was gathering and those from various towns were traveling to Him , He spoke by means of a parable .
42008005	“ The sower went out to spread his seed . As he sowed , some fell beside the road and was trampled ; and the birds of the air ate it up .
42008006	And other seed fell on rock ; when it came up , that seed withered away because it had no moisture .
42008007	Other seed fell among the thorns , and the thorns grew up with it and choked it .
42008008	And other seed fell into the good soil ; and when it came up , it produced fruit a hundredfold . ” While saying these things , He would call out , “ He who has ears to hear , let him hear . ”
42008009	Now His disciples were asking Him what this parable meant .
42008010	Then Yeshua said to them , “ To you has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of God ; but to the others it is given in parables , in order that ‘ Seeing , they may not see , and hearing , they may not understand . ’
42008011	“ Now the parable is this : the seed is the word of God .
42008012	Those beside the road are the ones who have heard ; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart , so that they may not believe and be saved .
42008013	But those on the rocky places are the ones who , when they hear , accept the word with joy . But these have no root ; they believe for a season , and in a time of testing fall away .
42008014	Now that which fell into the thorns are those who were hearing ; but as they go along the way , they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life , and they do not bear mature fruit .
42008015	But the seed in the good soil are those with a praiseworthy and good heart , who have heard the word and hold it fast and bear fruit with patient endurance .
42008016	“ Now no one after lighting a lamp covers it with some object or places it under a bed . But he puts it on a lampstand so that all those who enter may be able to see the light .
42008017	For nothing is hidden that will not become evident , nor secret that shall not be known and come into open view .
42008018	So pay attention how you listen . For whoever has , to him more will be given . And whoever does not have , even what he supposes he has will be taken away from him . ”
42008019	Yeshua’s mother and brothers came to Him , but were not able to reach Him through the crowd .
42008020	Now it was reported to Him , “ Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside , wanting to see You . ”
42008021	But answering , He said to them , “ My mother and My brothers are these who are hearing the word of God and doing it . ”
42008022	Now on one of those days Yeshua and His disciples got into a boat , and He said to them , “ Let’s move to the other side of the lake . ” So they set out .
42008023	Then as they were sailing , He fell asleep . A violent windstorm came down on the lake , and they were swamped with water and in danger .
42008024	They came to Yeshua and woke Him , saying , “ Master , Master , we’re perishing ! ” He got up and rebuked the wind and the surging wave of water . Then they stopped , and it became calm .
42008025	Then Yeshua said to them , “ Where is your faith ? ” But they were afraid and marveled , saying to one another , “ Who then is this ? He commands even the winds and the water , and they obey Him ! ”
42008026	They sailed over to the country of the Gerasenes , which is on the opposite side of the Galilee .
42008027	A demon-plagued man from the town met Yeshua as He was coming out onto the land . The man hadn’t worn any clothing for a long time and was living not in a house but in the tombs .
42008028	Seeing Yeshua , he cried out and fell down before Yeshua , and with a loud voice said , “ What’s between You and me , Yeshua , Ben El Elyon ? I’m begging You , do not torment me ! ”
42008029	For Yeshua commanded the defiling spirit to come out of the man . For many times it had seized him so that , even though he was restrained and bound with chains and shackles , he would break the chains and be driven by the demons into the desert .
42008030	Yeshua questioned him , “ What is your name ? ” “ Legion , ” he said , for many demons had entered him .
42008031	They kept begging Him not to command them to depart into the abyss .
42008032	Now a large herd of pigs was feeding on the mountain . The demons urged Yeshua to let them enter these pigs , and He gave them permission .
42008033	Then the demons came out of the man and entered into the pigs . The herd rushed down the cliff into the lake and was drowned .
42008034	But when the herdsmen saw what happened , they ran away and reported it in the town and countryside .
42008035	People went out to see what had happened . They came to Yeshua and found the man from whom the demons had gone — clothed and in his right mind , sitting at the feet of Yeshua . And they were frightened .
42008036	Now those who had seen it reported how the demon-plagued man had been restored .
42008037	And all the people from the region surrounding the Gerasenes asked Yeshua to go away from them because they were overcome by great fear . So He got into a boat and returned .
42008038	The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with Yeshua . But Yeshua sent him away , saying ,
42008039	“ Return to your home , and describe all that God has done for you . ” So he went away , proclaiming throughout the whole town all that Yeshua had done for him .
42008040	As Yeshua returned , the crowd welcomed Him , for they were all expecting Him .
42008041	And here came a man named Jairus , a leader in the synagogue . Falling at Yeshua’s feet , he begged Him to come to his house ,
42008042	because his only daughter , about twelve years old , was dying . But as He made His way , the masses were crushing in upon Him .
42008043	And there was a woman with a blood flow for twelve years , who could not be healed by anyone .
42008044	She came up from behind and touched the tzitzit of Yeshua’s garment . Immediately , her blood flow stopped .
42008045	Yeshua said , “ Who touched Me ? ” When everyone denied it , Peter said , “ Master , the crowds are surrounding You and pressing in ! ”
42008046	But Yeshua said , “ Someone touched Me , for I recognized power going out from Me . ”
42008047	Then seeing that she did not escape notice , the woman came trembling and fell prostrate before Him . In the presence of all the people , she confessed why she had touched Him and how she had been healed immediately .
42008048	He said to her , “ Daughter , your faith has made you well . Go in shalom . ”
42008049	While He was still speaking , someone comes from the house of the synagogue leader , saying , “ Your daughter has died . Don’t bother the Teacher anymore . ”
42008050	But hearing this , Yeshua replied to him , “ Do not fear — just keep trusting , and she shall be restored . ”
42008051	When Yeshua came into the house , He didn’t let anyone enter with Him except Peter , John , Jacob , and the child’s father and mother .
42008052	And everyone was weeping and lamenting her ; but He said , “ Don’t weep , for she didn’t die but is sleeping . ”
42008053	But they were ridiculing Him , knowing she had died .
42008054	But Yeshua , took her by the hand and called out , saying , “ Child , get up ! ”
42008055	Her spirit returned , and she arose immediately . Yeshua ordered food to be given to her to eat .
42008056	Her parents were utterly astonished , but He ordered them to say nothing of what had happened .
42009001	Now when Yeshua called the twelve together , He gave them power and authority over all the demons and to heal diseases .
42009002	He sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal .
42009003	And He said to them , “ Take nothing for the journey — no walking stick , no travel bag , no bread , no money , nor even to have two shirts .
42009004	Whatever house you enter , stay there and depart from there .
42009005	And whoever does not receive you , when you leave that town , shake off the dust from your feet as a witness against them . ”
42009006	So they went out and began traveling throughout the villages , proclaiming the Good News and healing everywhere .
42009007	Now Herod the tetrarch heard all that was happening . He was very confused , because some were saying that John had been raised from the dead ,
42009008	but others that Elijah had appeared , and others that some prophet from among the ancients had arisen .
42009009	But Herod said , “ I beheaded John , but who is this about whom I hear such things ? ” And he kept trying to see Him .
42009010	When the shlichim returned , they described to Yeshua all they had done . Then He took them along and withdrew privately to a city named Bethsaida .
42009011	But the crowds found out and followed Him . So Yeshua welcomed them and began speaking to them about the kingdom of God and curing those in need of healing .
42009012	Now the day began to wind down , and the twelve came and said to Yeshua , “ Send the crowd away , so they might go into the nearby villages and countryside and find food and lodging ; for we are in a desolate place here . ”
42009013	But Yeshua said to them , “ You give them something to eat ! ” But they said , “ We have no more than five loaves of bread and two fish , unless we go to buy food for all these people . ”
42009014	For there were about five thousand men . Then Yeshua said to His disciples , “ Have the people recline in groups of about fifty each . ”
42009015	They did so , and all reclined .
42009016	And He took the five loaves and the two fish ; and looking up to heaven , He offered the bracha and broke them . And He kept giving them to the disciples to set before the crowd .
42009017	Then they all ate and were satisfied . And what was left over was picked up , twelve baskets of the fragments .
42009018	Once when Yeshua was praying alone and His disciples were near , He put a question to them , saying , “ Who do the crowds say that I am ? ”
42009019	They replied , “ John the Immerser , but others Elijah , and others that some prophet from among the ancients has arisen . ”
42009020	Then He said to them , “ But who do you that say I am ? ” Then Peter answered and said , “ The Messiah of God . ”
42009021	But Yeshua warned them , and He ordered them not to tell this to anyone ,
42009022	saying , “ The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and ruling kohanim and Torah scholars , and be killed , and on the third day be raised . ”
42009023	Then Yeshua was saying to everyone , “ If anyone wants to follow Me , he must deny himself , take up his cross every day , and follow Me .
42009024	For whoever wants to save his life will lose it , but whoever loses his life for My sake will save it .
42009025	“ For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world but loses or forfeits himself ?
42009026	For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words , the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when He comes in His glory and the glory of the Father and the holy angels .
42009027	But I tell you truthfully , there are some standing here who will never taste death until they see the kingdom of God . ”
42009028	About eight days after these teachings , Yeshua took Peter , John , and Jacob with Him and went up the mountain to pray .
42009029	While He was praying , the appearance of His face changed , and His clothing flashed like white lightning .
42009030	And behold , two men were talking with Him , Moses and Elijah .
42009031	Appearing in glory , they were speaking of Yeshua’s departure , which was about to take place in Jerusalem .
42009032	Now Peter and those with him were overcome with sleep . But when they awakened , they saw Yeshua’s glory and the two men standing with Him .
42009033	And as they were leaving Yeshua , Peter said to Him , “ Master , it’s good for us to be here . Let’s make three sukkot : one for You , and one for Moses , and one for Elijah ” — not knowing what he was saying .
42009034	While he was yet saying these things , a cloud came and overshadowed them ; and they were afraid as they entered the cloud .
42009035	Then a voice came out of the cloud , saying , “ This is My Son , the One I have chosen . Listen to Him ! ”
42009036	And after the voice happened , Yeshua was found alone . They kept quiet and told no one in those days any of the things they had seen .
42009037	On the next day as they came down from the mountain , a large crowd met Yeshua .
42009038	Suddenly a man from the crowd shouted out loudly , saying , “ Teacher , I’m begging You to look at my son , for he’s my only child !
42009039	You see , a spirit takes hold of him , and he immediately screams . It throws him into convulsions with frothing . It hardly ever leaves him — it’s crushing him !
42009040	I begged Your disciples to drive it out , but they couldn’t . ”
42009041	Then answering , Yeshua said , “ O faithless and twisted generation , how long shall I be with you and put up with you ? Bring your son here . ”
42009042	And while the boy was still approaching Yeshua , the demon knocked him down to the ground and threw him into convulsions . But Yeshua rebuked the unclean spirit , healed the boy , and restored him to his father .
42009043	And all were amazed at the mighty power of God . But as everyone was marveling at all He was doing , He said to His disciples ,
42009044	“ Put these words into your ears : the Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men . ”
42009045	But they did not understand this statement ; it was yet concealed from them so they could not grasp it . And they were afraid to ask Him about this statement .
42009046	Now a dispute began between the disciples as to who might be the greatest among them .
42009047	But Yeshua , knowing the reasoning of their heart , took a child and set him by His side .
42009048	He said to them , “ Whoever welcomes this child in My name , welcomes Me . And whoever welcomes Me , welcomes the One who sent Me . The one who is the least among all of you is the one who is great . ”
42009049	John replied , “ Master , we saw someone driving out demons in Your name , and we tried to stop him because he doesn’t follow along with us . ”
42009050	Yeshua said to him , “ Do not stop him , for he who is not against you is for you . ”
42009051	When the days were approaching for Him to be taken up , Yeshua was determined to go up to Jerusalem .
42009052	He sent messengers before Him , and they went and entered a Samaritan village to make His arrangements .
42009053	But they did not receive Him , because He was focused on going up to Jerusalem .
42009054	When His disciples Jacob and John saw this , they said , “ Master , do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them ? ”
42009055	But Yeshua turned and rebuked them .
42009056	Then they moved on to another village .
42009057	As they were traveling on the road , someone said to Him , “ I will follow You wherever You go . ”
42009058	But Yeshua said to him , “ Foxes have dens and birds of the air have nests , but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head . ”
42009059	He said to another , “ Follow Me . ” But that one said , “ First let me go and bury my father . ”
42009060	But Yeshua said to him , “ Let the dead bury their own dead . But you , go and proclaim the kingdom of God . ”
42009061	Then another also said , “ I will follow You , Master , but first let me say goodbye to those in my home . ”
42009062	But Yeshua said to him , “ No one who has put his hand to the plow and looked back is fit for the kingdom of God . ”
42010001	Now after these things , the Lord assigned seventy others and sent them out by twos before Him into every town and place where He Himself was about to go .
42010002	And He was telling them , “ The harvest is plentiful , but the workers are few . Therefore , beg the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into His harvest .
42010003	“ Go forth ! Look , I am sending you as lambs in the midst of wolves .
42010004	Do not be burdened with a money belt , travel bag , or shoes ; and do not greet anyone along the way .
42010005	Whatever home you enter , first say , “ Shalom be on this home . ”
42010006	If a son of shalom is there , your shalom will rest on him ; but if not , it will return to you .
42010007	And remain in this same home , eating and drinking the things they offer , for the worker is deserving of his wage . Do not keep moving from house to house .
42010008	“ Whatever town you enter and they welcome you , eat what they set before you .
42010009	Then heal the sick in that town , and say to them , ‘ The kingdom of God has come near to you . ’
42010010	But if you enter a town and they do not welcome you , then go out into its streets and say ,
42010011	‘ Even the dust of your town sticking to our feet , we wipe off as a witness to you . But know this ! The kingdom of God has come near . ’
42010012	I tell you , it will be more tolerable for Sodom on that day than for that town .
42010013	“ Woe to you , Chorazin ! Woe to you , Bethsaida ! For if the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon , they would have turned long ago , sitting in sackcloth and ashes .
42010014	Yet it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon at the Judgment than for you !
42010015	And you , Capernaum ? You won’t be lifted up to heaven , will you ? No , you will go down as far as Sheol .
42010016	The one who listens to you hears Me , and the one who rejects you rejects Me , and the one who rejects Me rejects the One who sent Me . ”
42010017	Then the seventy returned with joy , saying , “ Master , even the demons submit to us in Your name ! ”
42010018	And Yeshua said to them , “ I was watching satan fall like lightning from heaven .
42010019	Behold , I have given you authority to trample upon serpents and scorpions , and over all the power of the enemy ; nothing will harm you .
42010020	Nevertheless , do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you , but rejoice that your names have been written in the heavens . ”
42010021	In that very hour , He was overjoyed in the Ruach ha-Kodesh and said , “ I praise You , Father , Master of the universe , that You have hidden these things from the wise and discerning and revealed them to infants . Yes , Father , for this way was pleasing to You .
42010022	All things have been handed over to Me by My Father . No one knows who the Son is except the Father , and who the Father is except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him . ”
42010023	Then turning to the disciples , He said privately , “ Blessed are the eyes that see what you see !
42010024	For I tell you , many prophets and kings desired to see what you are seeing yet did not see , and to hear what you are hearing yet did not hear . ”
42010025	Now a certain Torah lawyer stood up to entrap Yeshua , saying , “ Teacher , what should I do to gain eternal life ? ”
42010026	Then Yeshua said to him , “ What has been written in the Torah ? How do you read it ? ”
42010027	And he replied , “ You shall love Adonai your God with all your heart , and with all your soul , and with all your strength , and with all your mind ; and your neighbor as yourself . ”
42010028	Yeshua said to him , “ You have answered correctly . Do this and you will live . ”
42010029	But wanting to vindicate himself , he said to Yeshua , “ Then who is my neighbor ? ”
42010030	Yeshua replied , “ A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho . He was attacked by robbers , who stripped him and beat him . Then they left , abandoning him as half dead .
42010031	And by chance , a kohen was going down that road ; but when he saw the man , he passed by on the opposite side .
42010032	Likewise a Levite also , when he came to the place and saw him , passed by on the opposite side .
42010033	But a Samaritan who was traveling came upon him ; and when he noticed the man , he felt compassion .
42010034	He went up to him and bandaged his wounds , pouring on olive oil and wine . Then setting him on his own animal , he brought him to a lodge for travelers and took care of him .
42010035	The next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper , saying , ‘ Take care of him . And whatever else you spend , upon my return I will repay you myself . ’
42010036	Which of these three seems to you a neighbor to the one attacked by robbers ? ”
42010037	And he said , “ The one who showed mercy to him . ” Then Yeshua said to him , “ Go , and you do the same . ”
42010038	Now while they were traveling , Yeshua entered a certain village ; and a woman named Martha welcomed Him into her house .
42010039	She had a sister called Miriam , who was seated at the Master’s feet , listening to His teaching .
42010040	But Martha was distracted with much serving ; so she approached Yeshua and said , “ Master , doesn’t it concern you that my sister has left me to serve alone ? Then tell her to help me ! ”
42010041	But answering her , the Lord said , “ Martha , Martha , you are anxious and bothered about many things ;
42010042	but only one thing is necessary . For Miriam has chosen the good part , which will not be taken away from her . ”
42011001	Now Yeshua was praying in a certain place . When He finished , one of His disciples said to Him , “ Master , teach us to pray , just as John taught his disciples . ”
42011002	Then Yeshua said to them , “ When you pray , say , ‘ Father , sanctified be Your Name , Your kingdom come .
42011003	Give us each day our daily bread .
42011004	And forgive us our sins , for we also forgive everyone indebted to us . And lead us not into temptation . ”
42011005	Then Yeshua said to them , “ Which of you has a friend and will go to him in the middle of the night and say to him , ‘ Friend , lend me three loaves of bread ,
42011006	because a friend of mine has come to me on his journey and I have nothing to set before him . ’
42011007	Then from within he may answer , saying , ‘ Don’t bother me . The door is already locked , and my children and I are in bed . I can’t get up to give you anything . ’
42011008	I tell you , even if the friend will not get up and give him anything out of friendship , yet because of the man’s persistence he will get up and give him as much as he needs .
42011009	“ So I say to you , ‘ Ask , and it shall be given to you . Seek , and you shall find . Knock , and it shall be opened to you .
42011010	For everyone who asks receives , and the one who seeks finds , and to the one who knocks it will be opened . ’
42011011	What father , if his son asks for a fish , will give him a snake instead ?
42011012	And if he asks for an egg , will he give him a scorpion ?
42011013	If you then , being evil , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will your heavenly Father give the Ruach ha-Kodesh to those who ask Him ! ”
42011014	Now Yeshua was driving out a demon , and it was mute . When the demon had gone out , the mute one spoke and the crowds were amazed .
42011015	But some among them said , “ By beelzebul , the ruler of demons , He drives out demons . ”
42011016	Others , testing Him , were demanding from Him a sign from heaven .
42011017	But Yeshua , knowing their thoughts , said to them , “ Every kingdom divided against itself is destroyed , and a house against a house falls .
42011018	Now if satan is divided against himself , how will his kingdom stand ? For you say by beelzebul I drive out the demons .
42011019	But if by beelzebul I drive out demons , by whom do your sons drive them out ? For this reason , they will be your judges .
42011020	But if by the finger of God I drive out demons , then the kingdom of God has come to you .
42011021	“ When a strong one , fully-armed , protects his own estate , his possessions are safe .
42011022	But as soon as someone stronger than he attacks and overpowers him , then he takes away the armor that he had trusted in and divides up his plunder .
42011023	He who is not with Me is against Me , and he who does not gather with Me scatters .
42011024	“ When an unclean spirit goes out of a man , it passes through waterless places looking for rest . Not finding any , it says , ‘ I will return to my house where I came from . ’
42011025	And when it comes , it finds the house swept and put in order .
42011026	Then it goes and takes along seven other spirits more evil than itself , and they go in and settle there . And that man’s last condition becomes worse than the first . ”
42011027	Then as Yeshua was saying these things , a certain woman in the crowd , raising her voice , said to Him , “ Blessed is the womb that carried You and the breasts that nursed You ! ”
42011028	But He said , “ Rather , blessed are those who hear the word of God and obey it . ”
42011029	With the crowds increasing , Yeshua began to say , “ This generation is a wicked generation . It demands a sign , yet no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah .
42011030	For just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites , so also the Son of Man will be to this generation .
42011031	The Queen of the South will rise up at the Judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them , for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon . And behold , something greater than Solomon is here .
42011032	The men of Nineveh will rise at the judgment with this generation and will condemn it , because they repented at Jonah’s proclamation . And indeed , one greater than Jonah is here .
42011033	“ No one lighting a lamp puts it in a cellar or under a basket , but on the lampstand so that those entering may see the light .
42011034	Your eye is the lamp of your body . When your eye is healthy , your whole body is full of light . But when it is sick , your body is full of darkness .
42011035	Therefore , watch out that the light in you is not darkness .
42011036	If then your body is full of light , with no part of it dark , it will be as full of light as when a lamp gives you light with its gleam . ”
42011037	As He spoke , a Pharisee asked Yeshua to eat with him , so He entered and sat down .
42011038	But the Pharisee was surprised when he saw that Yeshua did not do the ritual handwashing before the meal .
42011039	But the Lord said to him , “ You Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and plate , but inside you are full of greed and wickedness .
42011040	Fools ! Didn’t He who created the outside also create the inside ?
42011041	But give as tzedakah those things that are within , and indeed everything is pure to you .
42011042	“ But woe to you Pharisees , for you tithe mint , rue , and every garden herb , yet bypass justice and the love of God . It is necessary to do these things without neglecting the others .
42011043	Woe to you Pharisees , for you love the best seats in the synagogues and the greetings in the marketplaces .
42011044	Woe to you , for you are like unmarked tombs , and people walk over them without knowing . ”
42011045	But answering , one of the Torah lawyers says to Him , “ Teacher , when You say these things , You insult us too . ”
42011046	Then Yeshua said , “ Woe to you Torah lawyers as well , for you weigh the people down with burdens hard to carry , yet you yourselves will not touch the burdens with even a finger .
42011047	“ Woe to you , for you build the tombs of the prophets whom your own fathers killed !
42011048	So you are witnesses and approve the deeds of your fathers , for indeed they killed them and you are building their tombs .
42011049	“ For this reason also the wisdom of God said , ‘ I will send them prophets and shlichim , and some of them they will kill and persecute ,
42011050	so that the blood of the prophets shed since the foundation of the world might be required from this generation —
42011051	from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah , the one who perished between the altar and the house of God . Yes , I tell you , it will be required from this generation . ’
42011052	“ Woe to you , Torah lawyers , for you have taken away the key of knowledge . You yourselves did not enter , and you stood in the way of those entering . ”
42011053	When Yeshua left there , the Torah scholars and the Pharisees began to be very hostile and to interrogate Him on many issues ,
42011054	plotting against Him to catch Him in His words .
42012001	Meanwhile , when thousands of people had gathered , so many that they were trampling one another , Yeshua began speaking first to His disciples , “ Be on guard yourselves against the hametz of the Pharisees , which is hypocrisy .
42012002	There is nothing covered up that will not be revealed , and nothing hidden that will not be made known .
42012003	Therefore , whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the light , and what you have spoken in private rooms will be proclaimed from the housetops .
42012004	“ I say to you , My friends , you should not be afraid of those who kill the body , since after this they have nothing more they can do .
42012005	But I will show you whom you should fear . Fear the One who , after the killing , has authority to cast into Gehenna . Yes , I tell you , fear this One !
42012006	“ Aren’t five sparrows being sold for two pennies ? Yet not one of them is forgotten before God .
42012007	Indeed , even the hairs of your head are all numbered . So do not fear ; you are more valuable than many sparrows .
42012008	Now I tell you , whoever acknowledges Me before men , the Son of Man also will acknowledge him before the angels of God .
42012009	But the one who denies Me before men will be denied before the angels of God .
42012010	And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven , but the one who slanders the Ruach ha-Kodesh will not be forgiven .
42012011	And when they bring you to the synagogues , rulers , and authorities , do not worry about how you should defend yourself or what you should say ,
42012012	because the Ruach ha-Kodesh will teach you at that time what is necessary to say . ”
42012013	Then someone from the crowd said to him , “ Teacher , tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me . ”
42012014	But Yeshua said to him , “ Man , who made Me a judge or arbitrator over you ? ”
42012015	Then He said to them , “ Watch out ! Be on guard against all kinds of greed , because one’s life does not consist in the abundance of the material goods he possesses . ”
42012016	And Yeshua told them a parable , saying , “ The land of a certain rich man produced good crops .
42012017	And he began thinking to himself , saying , ‘ What shall I do ? I don’t have a place to store my harvest ! ’
42012018	And he said , ‘ Here’s what I’ll do ! I’ll tear down my barns and build larger ones , and there I’ll store all my grain and my goods .
42012019	And I’ll say to myself , ’ O my soul , you have plenty of goods saved up for many years ! So take it easy ! Eat , drink , and be merry . ” ’
42012020	But God said to him , ‘ You fool ! Tonight your soul is being demanded back from you ! And what you have prepared , whose will that be ? ’
42012021	So it is with the one who stores up treasure for himself and is not rich in God . ”
42012022	Then Yeshua said to His disciples , “ So I say to you , do not worry about life , what you will eat ; nor about the body , what you will wear .
42012023	For life is more than food and the body more than clothing .
42012024	Consider the ravens . They do not sow or reap , they have no storeroom or barn , yet God feeds them . How much more valuable you are than birds !
42012025	“ And which of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life ?
42012026	So if you cannot do even something very little , why do you worry about other things ?
42012027	Consider the lilies , how they grow . They neither toil nor spin . Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these .
42012028	But if God so clothes the grass in the field — which is here today and thrown into the furnace tomorrow — then how much more will He clothe you , O you of little faith ?
42012029	“ So do not seek what you will eat and what you will drink , and do not keep worrying .
42012030	For all the nations of the world strive after these things . But your Father knows that you need these things .
42012031	Instead , seek His kingdom , and these things shall be added to you .
42012032	Do not be afraid , little flock , for your Father chose to give you the kingdom .
42012033	“ Sell your possessions and do tzedakah . Make money pouches for yourselves that do not get old — a treasure in the heavens that never runs out , where no thief approaches and no moth destroys .
42012034	For where your treasure is , there will your heart be also .
42012035	“ Have your belt strapped on and lamps burning .
42012036	Be like people waiting for their master to return from a wedding feast , so that when he comes and knocks , they may open to him immediately .
42012037	“ Happy are those slaves whose master finds them alert when he comes . Amen , I tell you , he will prepare himself and have them recline at table , and will come and serve them .
42012038	” And if he comes in the second or even the third watch and finds them so , they will be happy .
42012039	But understand this , that if the master of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming , he would not have allowed his house to be broken into .
42012040	You also must be ready , for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you don’t expect . ”
42012041	Then Peter said , “ Master , are You telling this parable for us , or for everyone ? ”
42012042	And the Lord said , “ Who then is the faithful and wise manager , whom the master will put in charge of his servants , to give them their food portion at the proper time ?
42012043	Blessed is that servant whose master finds him so doing when he comes .
42012044	Truly I tell you , his master will put him in charge of all his possessions .
42012045	“ But if that servant says in his heart , ‘ My master is taking a long time to come , ’ and he begins to beat the young slave boys and girls and to eat and drink and get drunk ,
42012046	the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know . And he will cut him in two and assign him a place with the unfaithful .
42012047	“ That slave who knew his master’s will but did not prepare or act according to his desire will be harshly whipped .
42012048	But the one who did not know and did things worthy of a beating will be whipped lightly . From everyone given much , much will be required ; and from the one for whom more is provided , all the more they will ask of him .
42012049	“ I came to pour out fire on the earth , and how I wish it were already ablaze !
42012050	But I have an immersion to endure , and how distressed I am until it is finished !
42012051	“ Do you suppose that I have come to bring shalom on earth ? No , I tell you , but rather division .
42012052	From now on there will be five in one house in opposition , three against two and two against three .
42012053	They will be divided , father against son and son against father , mother against daughter and daughter against mother , mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law . ”
42012054	Then He also was saying to the crowds , “ When you see a cloud rising in the west , instantly you say , ‘ A rainstorm is coming ’ — and so it is .
42012055	And when a south wind is blowing , you say , ‘ It will be a scorcher ’ — and so it is .
42012056	Hypocrites ! The surface of the earth and sky you know how to interpret yet you don’t know how to interpret this present time ?
42012057	Why can’t you judge for yourselves what is right ?
42012058	For while you are going with your accuser to the authorities , make an effort to come to a settlement with him — so he doesn’t drag you before the judge , and the judge hand you over to the officer of the court , and the officer of the court throw you into prison .
42012059	I tell you , you will never get out of there until you have paid back the last little bit . ”
42013001	Now there were some present at the same time who told Yeshua about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices .
42013002	He answered and said to them , “ Do you suppose that these Galileans are worse sinners than the rest of the Galileans because they have suffered these things ?
42013003	No , I tell you ! But unless you repent , you all will perish the same way .
42013004	“ Or those eighteen upon whom the tower in Siloam fell and were killed , do you suppose that they are worse sinners than all the people living in Jerusalem ?
42013005	No , I tell you ! But unless you repent , you all will perish the same way .
42013006	Then Yeshua began telling this parable : “ A man had a fig tree he had planted in his vineyard , and he came looking for fruit on it and found none .
42013007	So he said to the gardener , ‘ Indeed , for three years I ‘ ve come searching for fruit on this fig tree and found none . Remove it ! Why does it use up the ground ? ’
42013008	“ But answering , the gardener said to him , ‘ Master , leave it alone for this year also , until I dig around it and apply fertilizer .
42013009	And if it bears fruit , good . But if not , cut it down . ’ ”
42013010	Now Yeshua was teaching in one of the synagogues on Shabbat .
42013011	And behold , there was a woman with a disabling spirit for eighteen years , bent over and completely unable to stand up straight .
42013012	When Yeshua saw her , He called out to her and said , “ Woman , you are set free from your disability . ”
42013013	Then He laid hands on her , and instantly she stood up straight and began praising God .
42013014	But the synagogue leader , indignant that Yeshua had healed on Shabbat , started telling the crowd , “ There are six days in which work should be done — so come to be healed on those days and not on Yom Shabbat ! ”
42013015	But the Lord answered him and said , “ Hypocrites ! On Shabbat doesn’t each of you untie his ox or donkey from the stall and lead it away to give it drink ?
42013016	So this one , a daughter of Abraham incapacitated by satan for eighteen years , shouldn’t she be set free from this imprisonment on Yom Shabbat ? ”
42013017	When Yeshua said these things , all His opponents were put to shame ; but the whole crowd was rejoicing at all the glorious things done by Him .
42013018	So Yeshua was saying , “ What is the kingdom of God like ? To what shall I compare it ?
42013019	It is like a mustard seed , which a man took and dropped into his own garden . It grew and became a tree , and the birds of the air nested in its branches . ”
42013020	Again He said , “ To what shall I compare the kingdom of God ?
42013021	It is like hametz , which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour , until it was all leavened .
42013022	And He continued on His journey through the towns and villages , teaching and making His way to Jerusalem .
42013023	And someone said to Him , “ Master , are only a few being saved ? ” Then Yeshua said to them ,
42013024	“ Make every effort to enter through the narrow door ; for many , I tell you , will try to enter and will not be able .
42013025	Once the Master of the household gets up and shuts the door , and you’re standing outside and begin knocking on the door , saying , ‘ Master , open up for us , ’ then He will say to you , ‘ I don’t know where you come from . ’
42013026	Then you will start to say , ‘ We ate and drank in Your company , and You taught in our streets . ’
42013027	But He will say , ‘ I tell you , I don’t know where you come from . Get away from Me , all of you evildoers ! ’ ”
42013028	“ There will be weeping and the gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God , but you yourselves thrown out .
42013029	And they will come from the east and west and from the north and south , and they will recline at table in the kingdom of God .
42013030	And indeed , some are last who shall be first , and some are first who shall be last . ”
42013031	In that hour , some Pharisees came up and said to Yeshua , “ Get out and leave from here , because Herod wants to kill You ! ”
42013032	But Yeshua said to them , “ Go and tell that fox , ‘ Indeed , I’m driving out demons and performing healings today and tomorrow , and on the third day I will reach My goal . ’
42013033	But I must keep going today and tomorrow because it just can’t be that a prophet would perish outside Jerusalem .
42013034	“ O Jerusalem , Jerusalem who kills the prophets and stones those sent to her ! How often I longed to gather your children together , as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings , but you were not willing .
42013035	Look , your house is left to you desolate ! For I tell you , you will never see Me until you say , ‘ Baruch ha-ba b’shem Adonai . Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord ! ’ ”
42014001	Now when Yeshua went into the home of one of the leaders of the Pharisees to eat a meal on Shabbat , they were watching Him closely .
42014002	And there before Him was a man swollen with fluid .
42014003	So Yeshua said to the Torah lawyers and the Pharisees , “ Is it permitted to heal on Shabbat , or not ? ”
42014004	But they kept silent . So Yeshua took hold of him and healed him , and He sent him away .
42014005	Then He said to them , “ Which of you , with a son or an ox falling into a well on Yom Shabbat , will not immediately pull him out ? ”
42014006	And they could not reply to these things .
42014007	Yeshua began telling a parable to those who had been invited , when He noticed how they were choosing the seats of honor . He said to them ,
42014008	“ When you are invited by someone to a wedding , don’t take the seat of honor , for someone more highly esteemed than you may have been invited by him .
42014009	Then the one who invited both of you will come to you and say , ‘ Give up this seat . ’ And with shame , you would proceed to take the lowest seat .
42014010	But when you are invited , go and recline in the lowest seat so that when the one who invited you comes , he may say to you , ‘ Friend , move up higher . ’ Then you shall be honored in the presence of all those who are dining with you .
42014011	For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled , and the one who humbles himself will be exalted . ”
42014012	Then Yeshua was also saying to the one who invited Him , “ When you host a luncheon or dinner , don’t invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors . Otherwise they might invite you in return as your payback .
42014013	But when you host a banquet , invite the poor , the crippled , the lame , and the blind ;
42014014	and you will be blessed , since they cannot repay you . You will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous . ”
42014015	Now hearing this , one of those dining with Yeshua said to Him , “ Blessed is he who eats bread in the kingdom of God . ”
42014016	But Yeshua said to him , “ A certain man was hosting a large banquet , and he invited many .
42014017	At the time for the banquet , he sent his slave to tell those who had been invited , ‘ Come , everything is already prepared . ’
42014018	“ But every one of them began to beg off . The first said to him , ‘ I bought a farm , and I’m obligated to go out to see it . I’m asking you to have me excused . ’
42014019	Then another one said , ‘ I’ve purchased five teams of oxen , and I’m going to check them out . I’m asking you to have me excused . ’
42014020	Still another said , ‘ I’ve married a wife , so I cannot come . ’
42014021	“ The slave came and reported these things to his master . Then the master of the house got angry and said to his slave , ‘ Quickly go out into the squares and alleys of the city and bring here the poor , the maimed , the blind , and the lame . ’
42014022	“ And the slave said , ‘ Master , I have done as you instructed , and still there is room . ’
42014023	“ So the master said to the slave , ‘ Go out into the thoroughfares and fenced areas , and press them to come in so my home may be filled .
42014024	For I tell you , none of those men who were invited will taste my banquet . ’ ”
42014025	Now great crowds were traveling with Yeshua ; and He turned and said to them ,
42014026	“ If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his own father , mother , wife , children , brothers , and sisters — and yes , even his own life — he cannot be My disciple .
42014027	Whoever does not carry his own cross and follow Me cannot be My disciple .
42014028	“ For which of you , wanting to build a tower , doesn’t first sit down and figure out the cost , to see if he has enough to finish it ?
42014029	Otherwise , when he has laid a foundation and isn’t able to finish everything , all who see it begin to mock him , saying , ‘ This man began to build and wasn’t able to finish ! ’
42014031	“ Or what king , going to make war against another king , won’t first sit down to consider whether he is able with ten thousand to confront the one coming against him with twenty thousand ?
42014032	If not , while the other is still far away , he sends an ambassador and asks for peace .
42014033	So in the same way , whoever does not renounce all that he has , cannot be My disciple .
42014034	“ Therefore , salt is good ; but if the salt should lose its flavor , how shall it be made salty again ?
42014035	It is not suitable for the soil or for a manure heap — it is thrown out . The one who has ears to hear , let him hear . ”
42015001	Now all the tax collectors and sinners were drawing near to hear Yeshua .
42015002	The Pharisees and the Torah scholars began to complain , saying , ‘ This man welcomes sinners and eats with them . ”
42015003	So He told this parable to them , saying ,
42015004	“ Which man among you , if he has a hundred sheep and loses one of them , will not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the lost one until he finds it ?
42015005	When he has found it , he puts it on his shoulders , rejoicing .
42015006	And when he comes home , he calls together his friends and neighbors and says , ‘ Rejoice with me , for I’ve found my sheep that was lost ! ’
42015007	I tell you , in the same way there will be more joy in heaven over one repenting sinner than over the ninety-nine righteous people who have no need of repentance . ”
42015008	“ Or which woman , if she has ten silver coins and loses one coin , does not light a lamp , sweep the house , and search thoroughly until she finds it ?
42015009	When she has found it , she calls together her friends and neighbors , saying , ‘ Rejoice with me , for I’ve found the coin I had lost ! ’
42015010	In the same way , I tell you , there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents . ”
42015011	Then Yeshua said , “ A certain man had two sons ,
42015012	and the younger of them said to the father , ‘ Father , give me the share of the property that comes to me . ’ So he divided his wealth between them .
42015013	“ Not many days later , the younger son gathered everything and traveled to a far country , and there he squandered his inheritance on wild living .
42015014	Now when he had spent everything , a severe famine came against that country , and he began to be in need .
42015015	So he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country , who sent him into his fields to feed pigs .
42015016	And he was longing to fill up on the carob pods the pigs were eating , but no one was giving him any .
42015017	“ But when he came to his senses , he said , ‘ How many of my father’s hired workers have food overflowing , but here I am dying of hunger !
42015018	I’ll get up and go to my father , and I’ll say to him , ‘ Father , I have sinned against heaven and in your presence .
42015019	I am no longer worthy to be called your son . Make me like one of your hired workers .
42015020	“ And he got up and went to his own father . But while he was still far away , his father saw him and felt compassion . He ran and fell on his neck and kissed him .
42015021	Then the son said to him , ‘ Father , I have sinned against heaven and in your presence . I am no longer worthy to be called your son . ’
42015022	“ But the father said to his slaves , ‘ Quick ! Bring out the best robe and put it on him ! Put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet .
42015023	Bring the fattened calf and kill it ! Let’s celebrate with a feast !
42015024	For this son of mine was dead and has come back to life — he was lost and is found ! ’ Then they began to celebrate .
42015025	“ Now his older son was out in the field . And as he came near the house , he heard music and dancing .
42015026	And he called out to one of the servants and began to ask what these things could be .
42015027	“ The servant said to him , ‘ Your brother has come , and your father has killed the fattened calf because he got him back safe and sound . ’
42015028	“ But the older son was angry and didn’t want to go in . So his father came outside and pleaded with him .
42015029	But he answered and said to his father , ‘ Look , so many years I’ve slaved away for you — not once did I ignore your order . Yet you’ve never given me a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends .
42015030	But when this son of yours came — the one who has squandered your wealth with prostitutes — for him you killed the fattened calf ! ”
42015031	“ Then the father said to him , ‘ Son , you are always with me , and everything that is mine is yours .
42015032	But it was right to celebrate and rejoice , because this brother of yours was dead but has come back to life ! He was lost , but is found . ’ ”
42016001	Now Yeshua was also saying to the disciples , “ There was a rich man who had a household manager , and this manager was accused of squandering his belongings .
42016002	So he called the manager and said to him , ‘ What’s this I hear about you ? Give an accounting of your management , because you cannot be manager any longer . ’
42016003	“ Then the manager said to himself , ‘ What shall I do , since my master is taking the management away from me ? I’m not strong enough to dig ; I’m ashamed to beg .
42016004	I know what I’ll do , so that when I’m put out of management others will welcome me into their homes . ’
42016005	So he called in each one of his master’s debtors , and he said to the first , ‘ How much do you owe my master ? ’
42016006	“ He said , ‘ One hundred units of olive oil . ’ “ The manager said to him , ‘ Take your bill , sit down quickly , and write fifty . ’
42016007	Then he said to another , ‘ Now how much do you owe ? ’ “ He said , ‘ A hundred units of wheat . ’ “ The manager said to him , ‘ Take your bill and write eighty . ’
42016008	“ Now the master praised the crooked manager because he had acted shrewdly , for the sons of this age are smarter when dealing with their own generation than the sons of light .
42016009	I say to you , make friends for yourselves from the wealth of the world , so when it runs out , they will welcome you into the eternal shelters .
42016010	“ One who is faithful in the smallest matters is also faithful in much , and the one unjust in the smallest matters will likewise be unjust in much .
42016011	So then , if you cannot be trusted with unjust wealth , who will trust you with true wealth ?
42016012	Now if you have not been trustworthy with what belongs to another , who will give you anything of your own ?
42016013	No servant can serve two masters ; for either he will hate the one and love the other , or he will stick by one and look down on the other . You cannot serve God and money . ”
42016014	Now all those Pharisees who were lovers of money were listening to all these things and sneering at Yeshua .
42016015	But He said to them , “ You are the ones who justify yourselves before the people , but God knows your hearts . For what is prized among men is detestable in God’s sight . ”
42016016	“ The Torah and the Prophets were proclaimed until John . Since then , the Good News of the kingdom of God is being proclaimed , and everyone tries forcing his way in .
42016017	But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for a single serif of the Torah to fail .
42016018	Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery . And he who marries one who is divorced from a husband commits adultery .
42016019	“ Now there was a rich man dressed in purple and fine linen , living it up in luxury every day .
42016020	But a poor man named Lazarus had been laid at his gate , covered with sores
42016021	and longing to be fed with what fell from the rich man’s table . Besides , even the dogs were coming to lick his sores .
42016022	“ It happened that the poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham’s side . Then the rich man also died and was buried .
42016023	And from Sheol , as he was in torment , he raised his eyes . And he sees Abraham far off , and Lazarus at his side .
42016024	So he cried out and said , ‘ Father Abraham , have mercy on me ! And send Lazarus so he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool off my tongue , because I am suffering torment in this flame . ’
42016025	“ But Abraham said , ‘ Son , remember that in your life you received your good things , even as Lazarus received the bad things . But now he is comforted here , and you are tormented .
42016026	Besides all this , between us and you a great chasm is firmly set , so that those who want to cross over to you cannot , nor can those from there cross over to us .
42016027	“ Then the rich man said , ‘ I beg you then , Father Abraham , send Lazarus to my father’s house !
42016028	For I have five brothers to warn , so that they will not also come to this place of torment . ’
42016029	“ But Abraham says , ‘ They have Moses and the Prophets . Let them listen to them . ’
42016030	“ But he said , ‘ No , Father Abraham , but if someone from the dead goes to them , they will repent . ’
42016031	“ But Abraham said , ‘ If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets , neither will they be convinced even if someone rises from the dead ! ’ ”
42017001	Then Yeshua said to His disciples , “ Stumbling blocks are bound to come , but woe to the one by whom they come !
42017002	It would be better for him to have a millstone put around his neck and to be hurled into the sea , than for him to cause one of these little ones to stumble .
42017003	“ Keep yourselves alert ! If your brother sins , rebuke him ; and if he repents , forgive him .
42017004	Even if he sins against you seven times a day , and seven times returns to you , saying , ‘ I repent , ’ you shall forgive him . ”
42017005	Then the shlichim said to the Lord , “ Increase our faith ! ”
42017006	Then the Lord said , “ If you have faith like a mustard seed , you could say to this mulberry tree , ‘ Be uprooted and planted in the sea , ’ and it would obey you .
42017007	But if you have a slave who is plowing or tending sheep , who among you will say to him when he comes in from the field , ‘ Come right in , and recline at table ’ ?
42017008	But won’t he instead say to him , ‘ Prepare something for me to eat ! Dress yourself and wait on me while I eat and drink ; and afterward , you may eat and drink ’ ?
42017009	He doesn’t thank the slave because he did what he was commanded , does he ?
42017010	So you too , when you’ve done everything you are commanded , say , ‘ We are unworthy slaves . We have done only what we were supposed to do . ’ ”
42017011	Now while going up to Jerusalem , Yeshua was passing between Samaria and the Galilee .
42017012	As He entered a certain village , ten men with tzara’at came toward Him . They stood some distance away
42017013	and raised their voices , saying , “ Yeshua , Master , have mercy on us ! ”
42017014	When He saw them , He said to them , “ Go and show yourselves to the kohanim . ” And as they went , they were cleansed .
42017015	Now one of them , when he saw that he was healed , came back , glorifying God with a loud voice .
42017016	And he fell at Yeshua’s feet , facedown , giving Him thanks . And he was a Samaritan .
42017017	Then Yeshua answered and said , “ Weren’t ten cleansed ? But where are the nine ?
42017018	Weren’t any found who came back to give glory to God except this foreigner ? ”
42017019	Then Yeshua said to the man , “ Stand up and go ! Your faith has made you well . ”
42017020	Now when Yeshua was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come , He answered them and said , “ The kingdom of God does not come with signs to be seen .
42017021	Nor will they say , ‘ Look , here ! ’ or ‘ There ! ’ For behold , the kingdom of God is in your midst . ”
42017022	Then Yeshua said to the disciples , “ The days will come when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man , and you will not see it .
42017023	They will say to you , ‘ Look , there ! ’ or ‘ Look , here ! ’ Do not go and chase after them .
42017024	For just as the lightning flashes from one part of the sky and lights up another part , so will the Son of Man be in His day .
42017025	But first He must suffer much and be rejected by this generation .
42017026	As it was in the days of Noah , so will it also be in the days of the Son of Man .
42017027	They were eating , drinking , marrying , and being given in marriage , until the day Noah entered the ark . Then the flood came and destroyed them all .
42017028	“ It was just the same in the days of Lot . They were eating , drinking , buying , selling , planting , building .
42017029	But on the day Lot left Sodom , it rained fire and sulfur from heaven and destroyed them all .
42017030	Things will be the same on the day when the Son of Man is made fully known .
42017031	In that day , the one who is on the roof , and his possessions in the house , must not go down to take them away . In the same way , the one who is in the field must not turn back .
42017032	Remember Lot’s wife !
42017033	Whoever tries to keep his life will lose it ; but whoever loses his life will preserve it .
42017034	“ I tell you , on that night there will be two in one bed . One will be taken along and the other left .
42017035	There will be two women grinding at the same place . One will be taken and the other left . ” ( 36 )
42017037	“ Where , Lord ? ” they replied . And He said to them , “ Where there is a corpse , there also will the vultures be gathered . ”
42018001	Then Yeshua told them a parable to show that they should always pray and not be discouraged ,
42018002	He said , “ There was a judge in a certain city who neither feared God nor respected people .
42018003	And there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him , saying , ‘ Give me justice against my opponent . ’
42018004	“ He was unwilling at the time . But afterward he said to himself , ‘ Although I don’t fear God or respect people ,
42018005	yet because this widow keeps bothering me , I will give her justice so she won’t wear me out by her incessant coming . ’ ”
42018006	Then the Lord said , “ Hear what the unjust judge is saying .
42018007	Won’t God do justice for His chosen ones , who cry out to Him day and night ? Will He be slow to help them ?
42018008	I tell you , He will quickly give them justice . But when the Son of Man comes , will He find faith on the earth ? ”
42018009	Then Yeshua spoke this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous , while holding others in contempt .
42018010	“ Two men went up to the Temple to pray , one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector .
42018011	The Pharisee stood and was praying this to himself : ‘ O God , I thank You that I am not like other people — thieving , unjust , adulterers , or even like this tax collector .
42018012	I fast twice a week and tithe on all that I get . ’
42018013	“ But the tax collector , standing some distance away , wouldn’t even lift his eyes toward heaven , but beat his chest , saying , ‘ God , be merciful to me , the sinner ! ’
42018014	I tell you , this man , rather than the other , went down to his home declared righteous . For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled , but the one who humbles himself will be exalted . ”
42018015	Now they were bringing even their babies to Yeshua , so He might touch them . But when the disciples saw this , they began rebuking them .
42018016	But Yeshua called for them , saying , “ Let the little children come to Me and do not hinder them , for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these .
42018017	Amen , I tell you , whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it . ”
42018018	And a religious leader inquired of Yeshua , saying , “ Good Teacher , what shall I do to inherit eternal life ? ”
42018019	“ Why are you calling Me good ? ” Yeshua said to him . “ No one is good except One — that is God .
42018020	You know the commandments : ‘ Do not commit adultery , do not murder , do not steal , do not give false testimony , honor your father and mother . ’ ”
42018021	The man said , “ All these I have kept since my youth . ”
42018022	When Yeshua heard this , He said to him , “ One thing you still lack . Sell all , as much as you have , and distribute to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven . Then come , follow Me . ”
42018023	But upon hearing these things , he became deeply distressed , for he was very rich .
42018024	Gazing at him , Yeshua said , “ How hard it is for the rich to enter into the kingdom of God !
42018025	It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God . ”
42018026	Then those who heard said , “ Then who can be saved ? ”
42018027	But Yeshua said , “ What is impossible with men is possible with God . ”
42018028	Then Peter said , “ Look , we’ve left everything of our own to follow You . ”
42018029	And Yeshua said to them , “ Amen , I tell you , there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children , for the sake of the kingdom of God ,
42018030	who will not receive many times as much in this age ; and in the olam ha-ba , eternal life . ”
42018031	Then Yeshua took the twelve aside and said to them , “ Look , we’re going up to Jerusalem , and everything written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be carried out .
42018032	He will be handed over to the Gentiles , and He will be mocked and insulted and spat upon .
42018033	After they have scourged Him , they will kill Him . Yet on the third day , He will rise again . ”
42018034	But they understood none of these things ; this message was hidden from them , and they did not understand what He was saying .
42018035	Now as Yeshua was approaching Jericho , a certain blind man was sitting by the road , begging .
42018036	But when he heard the crowd going by , he asked what was happening .
42018037	They told him that Yeshua ha-Natzrati was passing by .
42018038	And he cried out , saying , “ Yeshua , Ben-David , have mercy on me ! ”
42018039	And those leading the way were scolding him , so he would be quiet . But he kept shouting all the more , “ Ben-David , have mercy on me ! ”
42018040	So Yeshua stopped and ordered the blind man to be brought to Him . And when he came near , Yeshua asked him ,
42018041	“ What do you want Me to do for you ? ” And he said , “ Master , I want to see again ! ”
42018042	Yeshua said to him , “ Receive your sight . Your faith has made you well . ”
42018043	Immediately the man received his sight and began following Yeshua , glorifying God . And when all the people saw it , they also gave praise to God .
42019001	Now Yeshua entered Jericho and was passing through .
42019002	And here was a man by the name of Zacchaeus ; he was a chief tax collector , and he was rich .
42019003	Zacchaeus was trying to see who Yeshua was , but he couldn’t because of the crowd , for he was short in height .
42019004	So he ran ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see Yeshua , for He was about to pass through that way .
42019005	When Yeshua came to the place , He looked up and said to him , “ Zacchaeus , hurry and come down , for I must stay at your house today . ”
42019006	Zacchaeus hurried and came down and welcomed Him joyfully .
42019007	But when everyone saw it , they began to grumble , saying , “ Yeshua has gone to be the guest of a sinner ! ”
42019008	But Zacchaeus stood there and said to the Lord . “ Look , Master , half of my possessions I give to the poor , and if I have somehow cheated anyone , I repay four times as much ! ”
42019009	Then Yeshua said to him , “ Today salvation has come to this home , because he also is a son of Abraham .
42019010	For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost . ”
42019011	As they were listening to this , Yeshua went on to tell a parable , because He was near Jerusalem and they supposed that the kingdom of God was about to appear at once .
42019012	Therefore He said , “ A certain nobleman went to a faraway land to receive for himself a kingdom and then return .
42019013	And calling ten of his own slaves , he gave them ten minas and said to them , ‘ Do business until I come back . ’
42019014	But his citizens detested him and they sent a delegation after him , saying , ‘ We don’t want this fellow to reign over us ! ’
42019015	When he returned after receiving the kingdom , he called for those slaves to whom he had given the money . He wanted to know how much business they had done .
42019016	Now the first appeared , saying , ‘ Master , your one mina has made ten . ’
42019017	The master said to him , ‘ Well done , good slave ! Because you were faithful with so little , take charge over ten cities . ’
42019018	Also , the second slave came , saying , ‘ Your mina , Master , made five . ’
42019019	Then he also said to this one , ‘ You are likewise over five cities . ’
42019020	But another came , saying , ‘ Master , here is your mina . I was keeping it safe in a handkerchief ,
42019021	for I was afraid of you because you are a strict man . You take what you did not make and reap what you did not sow . ’
42019022	He said to him , ‘ By the words of your own mouth I will judge you , you wicked slave ! You knew that I am strict , taking what I did not make and reaping what I did not sow ?
42019023	Then why didn’t you put my money in the bank , so that when I came back I could have collected it with interest ? ’
42019024	Then to the bystanders he said , ‘ Take the mina from him , and give it to the one who has ten minas . ’
42019025	But they said to him , ‘ Sir , he has ten minas ! ’
42019026	‘ I tell you , to everyone who has , more shall be given . But from the one who doesn’t have , even what he does have shall be taken away .
42019027	But those hostile to me , who didn’t want me to reign over them , bring them here and execute them before me . ’ ”
42019028	After saying these things , Yeshua was going on ahead , up to Jerusalem .
42019029	When He got near Bethphage and Bethany , at the Mount of Olives , He sent two of the disciples ,
42019030	saying , “ Go into the village ahead . As you enter , you will find a colt tied up , that no one has ever sat upon . Untie it and bring it .
42019031	And if anyone asks you , ‘ Why are you untying it ? ’ you shall say , ‘ The Master needs it . ’ ”
42019032	Those who were headed out found things just as He told them .
42019033	Then as they were untying the colt , his owners said to them , “ Why are you untying the colt ? ”
42019034	They said , “ The Master needs it . ”
42019035	Then they brought it to Yeshua , threw their cloaks on the colt , and set Yeshua on it .
42019036	And as He went along , the people were spreading their cloaks on the road .
42019037	When Yeshua came near the slope of the Mount of Olives , the whole crowd of disciples began to rejoice . They praised God with a loud voice for all the miracles they had seen ,
42019038	saying , “ Blessed is the King who comes in the name of Adonai ! Shalom in heaven and glory in the highest ! ”
42019039	Some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to Him , “ Teacher , rebuke Your disciples ! ”
42019040	But answering , Yeshua said , “ I tell you that if these keep silent , the stones will shout out ! ”
42019041	As He drew near and saw Jerusalem , He wept over her ,
42019042	saying , “ If only you had recognized this day the things that lead to shalom ! But now they are hidden from your eyes .
42019043	For the days will come upon you when your enemies will surround you with barricades and hem you in on all sides .
42019044	And they will smash you to the ground — you and your children within you . And they won’t leave within you one stone upon another , because you did not recognize the time of your visitation . ”
42019045	Then Yeshua entered the Temple and began to drive out the merchants ,
42019046	saying to them , “ It is written , ‘ My house shall be a house of prayer , ’ but you have made it a ‘ den of thieves . ’ ”
42019047	And He was teaching every day in the Temple . The ruling kohanim and the Torah scholars , even the leaders of the people , were trying to destroy Him ;
42019048	but they could not find any way to do it , because all the people were hanging on His words .
42020001	On one of the days while Yeshua was teaching the people in the Temple and proclaiming the Good News , the ruling kohanim and the Torah scholars , together with the elders , confronted Him .
42020002	And they spoke , saying to Him , “ Tell us by what authority are You doing these things ? Or who is the one who gave You this authority ? ”
42020003	But answering , Yeshua said to them , “ I also will ask you a question , and you tell Me :
42020004	the immersion of John — was it from heaven or from men ? ”
42020005	They reasoned among themselves , saying , “ If we say , ‘ From heaven , ’ He will say , ‘ Why didn’t you believe him ? ’
42020006	But if we say , ‘ From men , ’ then all the people will stone us , because they are convinced that John is a prophet . ”
42020007	So they answered that they didn’t know where it came from .
42020008	And Yeshua said to them , “ Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things . ”
42020009	Then He began to tell the people this parable : “ A man planted a vineyard , leased it to tenant farmers , and went on a journey for a long time .
42020010	And at the season , he sent a servant to the tenants so that they would give him part of the vineyard’s fruit . But the tenants beat him up and sent him away empty-handed .
42020011	So he proceeded to send another servant . They beat him too and treated him shamefully , and they sent him away empty-handed .
42020012	And he proceeded to send a third one . They wounded this one too , and they threw him out .
42020013	“ Now the master of the vineyard said , ‘ What shall I do ? I will send my son , whom I love . Probably they will show him respect . ’
42020014	But when the tenants saw him , they discussed the matter among themselves , saying , ‘ This is the heir ! Let’s kill him so the inheritance will be ours . ’
42020015	So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him . What then will the master of the vineyard do to them ?
42020016	He will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others . ” But when they heard this , they said , “ May it never happen ! ”
42020017	Then Yeshua looked right at them and said , “ Then what is this that has been written , ‘ The stone which the builders rejected , this has become the chief cornerstone ’ ?
42020018	Everyone who falls on that stone will be shattered ; but the one upon whom it falls , it will crush him . ”
42020019	The Torah scholars and the ruling kohanim tried to grab Him that very hour , because they realized that He spoke this parable against them — but they feared the people .
42020020	Now they watched Him and sent spies who pretended to be righteous , in order to trap Him in His words so they could hand Him over to the power and authority of the governor .
42020021	And they asked Him , saying , “ Teacher , we know that You tell it straight and You teach it straight . You show no partiality , but teach the way of God according to the truth .
42020022	Is it permitted for us to pay taxes to Caesar , or not ? ”
42020023	But carefully considering their treachery , Yeshua said to them ,
42020024	“ Show me a denarius . Whose image and inscription does it have ? ” And they said , “ Caesar’s . ”
42020025	Then He said to them , “ Well then , give to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s , and to God the things that are God’s . ”
42020026	And they could not trap Him in His words in the presence of the people . Astonished by His answer , they kept silent .
42020027	Then some of the Sadducees ( who deny there is a resurrection ) came and questioned Yeshua .
42020028	“ Teacher , ” they said , “ Moses wrote for us that ‘ if a man’s brother dies’ having a wife ‘ but no children , then his brother should take the widow and father children for his brother . ’
42020029	Now there were seven brothers , and the first took a wife and died childless ;
42020030	and the second
42020031	and the third took her , but in this same way , each of the seven brothers died and left no children .
42020032	Finally the woman died too .
42020033	So in the resurrection , whose wife is she ? For all seven had married her . ”
42020034	Yeshua said to them , “ The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage .
42020035	But those considered worthy to reach the olam ha-ba and the resurrection of the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage .
42020036	For they can no longer die , because they are like angels and are sons of God , being sons of the resurrection .
42020037	But at the burning bush even Moses revealed that the dead are raised , when he calls Adonai ‘ the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . ’
42020038	Now He is God not of the dead but of the living , for to Him they all are living . ”
42020039	Some of the Torah scholars replied , “ Teacher , You have said it well . ”
42020040	For they no longer dared to question Him about anything .
42020041	Then Yeshua said to them , “ How can they say that the Messiah is Ben-David ?
42020042	For David himself says in the Book of Psalms , ‘ Adonai said to my Lord , “ Sit at My right hand ,
42020043	until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet . ” ’
42020044	David then calls Him ‘ Lord ’ ; so how is He his son ? ”
42020045	Then with all the people listening , Yeshua said to the disciples ,
42020046	“ Beware of the Torah scholars , who like to walk around in long robes . They love greetings in the marketplaces , the best seats in the synagogues , and places of honor at feasts .
42020047	They devour widows’ houses and make long prayers as a show . These men will receive greater condemnation ! ”
42021001	Then Yeshua looked up and saw the rich dropping their gifts into the treasury box .
42021002	He also saw a poor widow dropping in two small copper coins .
42021003	And He said , “ Truly I say to you , this poor widow has put in more than all the rest .
42021004	For all these put in their gifts from their surplus . But she , out of her poverty , put in all she had to live on . ”
42021005	And while some were talking about the Temple , how it was decorated with beautiful stones and offerings , Yeshua said ,
42021006	“ As for these things you are looking at , the days will come when not one stone will be left upon another . Every one will be torn down ! ”
42021007	And they questioned Him , saying , “ Teacher , so when will these things happen ? What will be the sign that these things are about to take place ? ”
42021008	And He said , “ Watch out that you are not led astray ! For many will come in My name , saying , ‘ I am He ’ and ‘ The time is near ! ’ Do not follow them .
42021009	And when you hear of wars and chaos , do not be terrorized . For these things need to happen first , but the end will not come at once . ”
42021010	Then He continued telling them , “ Nation will rise up against nation , and kingdom against kingdom .
42021011	There will be great earthquakes along with famines and epidemics in various places , and there will be terrors along with great signs from heaven .
42021012	But before all these things , they will grab you and persecute you , handing you over to the synagogues and prisons , and leading you away to kings and governors on account of My name .
42021013	This will lead you to be a witness .
42021014	So make up your minds not to prepare ahead of time to defend yourselves —
42021015	for I Myself will give you speech and wisdom that none of your opponents will be able to resist or refute .
42021016	But you will be handed over even by parents , brothers , relatives , and friends — and they will put some of you to death .
42021017	And you will be hated by all because of My name .
42021018	Yet not a hair of your head will be lost .
42021019	By your endurance , you will gain your souls .
42021020	“ But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies , then recognize that her desolation is near .
42021021	Then those in Judea must flee to the mountains , and those inside the city must get out , and those in the countryside must not enter her .
42021022	For these are the days of punishment , to fulfill all that has been written .
42021023	“ Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days ! For there will be great distress in the land and wrath on this people .
42021024	They will fall by the edge of the sword and be led away captive into all the nations . Jerusalem will be trampled by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled .
42021025	“ There will be signs in the sun and moon and stars . And upon the earth nations will be confused by the roaring of the sea and its waves .
42021026	People will lose heart from fear and anticipation of what is overtaking the earth , for the powers of the heavens will be shaken .
42021027	And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory .
42021028	Now when these things begin to happen , stand straight and lift up your heads , because your salvation is near ! ”
42021029	Then Yeshua told them a parable : “ Look at the fig tree and all the trees .
42021030	As soon as they sprout their leaves , you see it and you know at once that summer is near .
42021031	So also , when you see these all these things happening , know that the kingdom of God is near .
42021032	Amen , I tell you , this generation will not pass away until all these things happen .
42021033	Heaven and earth will pass away , but My words will never pass away .
42021034	“ But watch out so your hearts are not weighed down by carousing , strong drink , and the worries of life . Do not let that day come upon you suddenly like a trap .
42021035	For it will come rushing upon all who live on the face of the whole earth .
42021036	But stay alert at all times , praying that you may have the strength to escape all these things about to happen , and to stand before the Son of Man . ”
42021037	So during the days Yeshua was teaching in the Temple , but in the nights He went out and stayed on the Mount of Olives .
42021038	And all the people would come early in the morning to hear Him in the Temple .
42022001	Now the Feast of Matzah , which is called Passover , was approaching .
42022002	The ruling kohanim and Torah scholars were searching for a way to do away with Yeshua , for they were afraid of the people .
42022003	Then satan entered into Judah , the one from Kriot , one of the twelve .
42022004	And he went away and talked with the ruling kohanim and officers of the Temple guard about how he might deliver Yeshua over to them .
42022005	They were delighted and agreed to give him money .
42022006	So he agreed and began looking for a chance to hand Yeshua over to them without a crowd .
42022007	Then came the day of matzah when the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed .
42022008	Now Yeshua sent Peter and John , saying , “ Go and prepare the Passover for us , so we may eat . ”
42022009	Then they said to Him , “ Where do You want us to prepare ? ”
42022010	And He said to them , “ Behold , when you have entered the city , a man carrying a jar of water will meet you . Follow him into the house that he enters .
42022011	And say to the owner of the house , ‘ The Teacher says to you , “ Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with My disciples ? ” ’
42022012	And with that , he will show you a large upper room , fully furnished . Make preparations there . ”
42022013	So they left and found just what Yeshua had told them , and they prepared the Passover .
42022014	When the hour came , Yeshua reclined at table , and the shlichim with Him .
42022015	And He said to them , “ I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer .
42022016	For I tell you , I will never it eat again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God . ”
42022017	And when He had taken a cup and offered the bracha , He said , “ Take this and share it among yourselves .
42022018	For I tell you that I will never drink of the fruit of the vine from now on , until the kingdom of God comes . ”
42022019	And when He had taken matzah and offered the bracha , He broke it and gave it to them , saying , “ This is My body , given for you . Do this in memory of Me . ”
42022020	In the same way , He took the cup after the meal , saying , “ This cup is the new covenant in My blood , which is poured out for you .
42022021	But look , the hand of the one betraying Me is with Mine on the table .
42022022	For indeed , the Son of Man is going as has been predetermined ; but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed ! ”
42022023	So they began to discuss among themselves which of them it might be who would do this thing .
42022024	But there was also a quarrel among them about which of them is considered the greatest .
42022025	And Yeshua said to them , “ The kings of the nations have mastery over them , and those exercising authority over them are called ‘ benefactors . ’
42022026	But with you , it is not so . Rather , let the one who is greatest among you become like the youngest , and the one who leads like the one who serves .
42022027	For who is greater , the one who reclines or the one who serves ? Is it not the one who reclines ? But I am among you as one who serves .
42022028	“ You are the ones who have remained with Me in My times of testing .
42022029	And just as My Father has granted Me a kingdom , so I grant to you
42022030	that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom , and you shall sit upon thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
42022031	“ Simon , Simon ! Indeed , satan has demanded to sift you all like wheat .
42022032	But I have prayed for you , Simon , that your faith will not fail . And when you have turned back , strengthen your brethren . ”
42022033	But Simon said to Him , “ Master , I am ready to go with You even to prison and to death ! ”
42022034	But Yeshua said , “ I tell you , Peter , a rooster will not crow today until you have denied three times that you know Me . ”
42022035	And He said to them , “ When I sent you out without a money pouch and travel bag and sandals , you didn’t lack anything , did you ? ” They said , “ No , nothing . ”
42022036	Then He said to them , “ But now , whoever has a money pouch must carry it as well as a travel bag . And whoever does not own a sword must sell his cloak and buy one .
42022037	For I tell you that this which is written must be fulfilled in Me : ‘ And he was counted with the lawless . ’ For what is written about Me is being fulfilled . ”
42022038	But they said , “ Master , look here ! Two swords ! ” And He said to them , “ It is enough . ”
42022039	And Yeshua came out and went as usual to the Mount of Olives , and the disciples followed Him .
42022040	When he reached the place , He said to them , “ Pray that you will not enter into temptation . ”
42022041	And He pulled back about a stone’s throw from them , got on His knees , and began to pray ,
42022042	saying , “ Father , if You are willing , take this cup from Me ; yet not My will , but Yours be done . ”
42022043	Now an angel from heaven appeared to Him and strengthened Him .
42022044	And in His anguish , He was praying fervently ; and His sweat was like drops of blood falling down on the ground .
42022045	When He rose up from prayer , He came to the disciples and found them asleep , exhausted from grief .
42022046	And He said to them , “ Why are you sleeping ? Get up and pray , so that you won’t enter into temptation . ”
42022047	While Yeshua was speaking , suddenly a crowd came , and the one called Judah , one of the Twelve , approached Yeshua to kiss Him .
42022048	But Yeshua said to him , “ Judah , with a kiss you betray the Son of Man ? ”
42022049	When those around Him saw what was going to happen , they said to Him , “ Master , shall we strike with the sword ? ”
42022050	And one of them struck the servant of the kohen gadol and cut off his right ear .
42022051	But Yeshua answered and said , “ Stop this now ! ” And He touched the man’s ear and healed him .
42022052	Then Yeshua said to the ruling kohanim , officers of the Temple guard , and the elders who had come against Him , , “ Have you come out with swords and clubs as you would against a revolutionary ?
42022053	Every day I was with you in the Temple , yet you did not lay a finger on Me . But this is yours — the hour and the power of darkness . ”
42022054	Then they seized Yeshua and led Him away and brought Him into the house of the kohen gadol . But Peter was following from a distance .
42022055	Now they had lit a fire in the center of the courtyard and sat down together , and Peter was sitting among them .
42022056	Then a servant girl saw him sitting at the fire . She looked straight at him and said , “ This one was with Him too ! ”
42022057	But he denied it , saying , “ Woman , I don’t know Him ! ”
42022058	A little later , another saw him and said , “ You too are one of them . ” But Peter said , “ Man , I am not ! ”
42022059	And about an hour later , another began to insist , saying , “ Certainly this fellow was with Him , for he too is a Galilean ! ”
42022060	But Peter said , “ Man , I don’t know what you’re talking about ! ” And immediately , while he was still speaking , a rooster crowed .
42022061	And the Lord turned and looked straight at Peter . Then Peter remembered the word of the Lord , how He had told him , ‘ Before the rooster crows today , you will deny Me three times . ’
42022062	And Peter went out and wept bitterly .
42022063	Now the men who were guarding Yeshua began mocking and beating Him .
42022064	They blindfolded Him and kept asking Him , saying , “ Prophesy ! Who is the one who hit You ? ”
42022065	And reviling Him , they were saying many other things against Him .
42022066	As it become day , the elders of the people gathered together , both ruling kohanim and Torah scholars , and they led Him away to their council , saying ,
42022067	“ If You are Mashiach , tell us . ” But Yeshua said to them , “ If I tell you , you will never believe ;
42022068	and if I ask you , you will never answer .
42022069	But from now on , the Son of Man is seated at the right hand of the power of God . ”
42022070	Then they all said , “ Are You then Ben-Elohim ? ” And to them He said , “ You say that I am . ”
42022071	Then they said , “ What further need do we have for testimony ? For we have heard it ourselves from His own mouth ! ”
42023001	Then the entire assembly got up and brought Yeshua to Pilate .
42023002	And they began to accuse Him , saying , “ We found this fellow subverting our nation , forbidding payment of taxes to Caesar and saying that He Himself is Messiah — a king . ”
42023003	So Pilate questioned Him , saying , “ Are You the King of the Jews ? ” “ As you say , ” Yeshua replied .
42023004	Then Pilate said to the ruling kohanim and the crowds , “ I find no case against this Man . ”
42023005	But they kept insisting , saying , “ He stirs up the people , teaching throughout all Judea , starting from the Galilee to as far as here . ”
42023006	But when Pilate heard this , he asked whether the Man was a Galilean .
42023007	And when he learned that Yeshua was from Herod’s jurisdiction , he sent Him to Herod , who was also in Jerusalem at that time .
42023008	Now Herod was overjoyed when he saw Yeshua , for he had wanted to see Him for a long time , because he had heard about Him and was hoping to see some miracle done by Him .
42023009	He was questioning Yeshua on many issues , but Yeshua did not answer at all .
42023010	And the ruling kohanim and the Torah scholars stood their ground , strongly accusing Him .
42023011	Now Herod together with his soldiers were treating Him with contempt and mocking Him . They put splendid clothing on Him and sent Him back to Pilate .
42023012	And Herod and Pilate became friends with one another from that very day , for previously they had been enemies with one another .
42023013	Now Pilate called together the ruling kohanim , the leaders , and the people .
42023014	And he said to them , “ You brought this Man to me as one who incites the people to revolt . But having examined Him in your presence , I have found no case against this Man regarding what you accuse Him of doing .
42023015	Nor did Herod , for he sent Him back to us . Indeed , He has done nothing that is worthy of death .
42023016	Therefore I will scourge Him and release Him . ” ( 17 )
42023018	But they shouted out all together , saying , “ Take this fellow away ! Release to us Bar-Abba ! ”
42023019	( He was someone who had been thrown into prison for a rebellion in the city and murder . )
42023020	Again Pilate addressed them , wanting to release Yeshua ;
42023021	but they kept shouting out , saying , “ Execute , execute Him ! ”
42023022	And a third time he spoke to them , “ Why ? What evil has this One done ? I have found in Him no fault deserving of death . Therefore , I will scourge and release Him . ”
42023023	But they were insistent , demanding with loud shouts that He be executed . And their voices prevailed .
42023024	So Pilate decreed that their demand be put into effect .
42023025	And He released the one they were asking for , the one thrown in jail for insurrection and murder . But he handed over Yeshua to their will .
42023026	As they led Him away , they grabbed a man , Simon of Cyrene , coming in from the countryside . They placed on him the cross-beam , to carry behind Yeshua .
42023027	Now a great multitude of people was following Him , including women who were mourning and singing dirges for Him .
42023028	But Yeshua , turning to them , said , “ Daughters of Jerusalem , do not weep for Me , but for yourselves and your children .
42023029	For indeed , the days are coming when they will say , ‘ Blessed are barren , and the wombs that never gave birth , and the breasts that did not feed . ’
42023030	” Then they will begin to say to the mountains , ‘ Fall on us ! ’ and to the hills , ‘ Cover us ! ’
42023031	” For if they do these things when the wood is green , what will happen when it is dry ? ”
42023032	Others , two evildoers , were also led away to be put to death with Him .
42023033	When they came to the place called the Skull , there they crucified Him and the evildoers , one on His right and the other on His left .
42023034	But Yeshua was saying , “ Father , forgive them , for they do not know what they are doing . ” Then they cast lots , dividing up His clothing .
42023035	The people stood there watching . And even the leaders were sneering at Him , saying , “ He saved others ; let Him save Himself if He is the Messiah of God , the Chosen One ! ”
42023036	The soldiers likewise mocked Him , coming up and bringing Him sour wine ,
42023037	and saying , “ If You are the King of the Jews , save Yourself . ”
42023038	Now there was also an inscription over Him : THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS .
42023039	One of the evildoers hanging there was jeering at Him , saying , “ Aren’t You the Messiah ? Save Yourself — and us ! ”
42023040	But the other one , rebuking him , replied , “ Don’t you fear God , since you are under the same sentence ?
42023041	We’re getting what we deserve for our actions , and rightly so — but this One has done nothing wrong . ”
42023042	And he said , “ Yeshua , remember me when You come into Your kingdom . ”
42023043	Yeshua said to him , “ Amen , I tell you , today you shall be with Me in Paradise . ”
42023044	It was now about the sixth hour , and darkness fell over the whole land until the ninth hour ,
42023045	for the sun died out . And the curtain of the Temple was torn in two .
42023046	And Yeshua , crying out with a loud voice , said , “ Father , ‘ into Your hands I entrust My spirit . ’ ” When He had said this , He breathed His last .
42023047	Now when the centurion saw what had happened , he began glorifying God , saying , “ Truly this was a righteous Man . ”
42023048	And all the crowds assembled for this spectacle , when they saw what had happened , began to turn back , beating their breasts .
42023049	But all Yeshua’s acquaintances , and the women who were following Him from the Galilee , were standing at a distance , watching these things .
42023050	Now there was a man named Joseph , a council member , a good and righteous man .
42023051	( He had not been in agreement with the council and their action . ) He was from the Judean town of Arimathea , and he was waiting for the kingdom of God .
42023052	This man went to Pilate and asked for Yeshua’s body .
42023053	And he took it down , wrapped it in a linen cloth , and laid Him in a tomb cut out of the rock , where no one had ever yet been laid .
42023054	Now it was the Day of Preparation , and Shabbat was approaching .
42023055	The women who had come with Him from the Galilee followed , and they saw the tomb and how His body was laid .
42023056	Then they returned and prepared spices and perfumes . But on Shabbat they rested according to the commandment .
42024001	Now on the first day of the week , at daybreak , the women came to the tomb , carrying the spices they had prepared .
42024002	They found the stone had been rolled away from the tomb ;
42024003	but when they entered , they did not find the body of the Lord Yeshua .
42024004	And while they were perplexed about this , suddenly two men in dazzling clothes stood beside them .
42024005	The women were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground , but the men said to them , “ Why do you search for the living among the dead ?
42024006	He is not here , but He is risen ! Remember what He told you when He was still in the Galilee ,
42024007	saying that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men , and be executed , and on the third day rise up . ”
42024008	And they were reminded of His words .
42024009	And when they returned from the tomb , they told all these things to the eleven and to everyone else .
42024010	Now it was Miriam from Magdala , Joanna , the Miriam of Jacob and others together with them who were telling these things to the shlichim .
42024011	But these words appeared to them as nonsense , and they would not believe them .
42024012	But Peter got up and ran to the tomb . Leaning in , he sees only the linen cloths . And he went away to his home , marveling at what had happened .
42024013	Now behold , two of them on that very day were traveling to a village named Emmaus , a distance of about seven miles from Jerusalem .
42024014	They were speaking with one another about all the things that had been happening .
42024015	While they were talking and discussing , Yeshua Himself approached and began traveling with them .
42024016	But their eyes were kept from recognizing Him .
42024017	Then He said to them , “ What are these things you are discussing with one another as you are walking along ? ” They stood still , looking gloomy .
42024018	Then the one named Cleopas answered and said to Him , “ Are You the only one visiting Jerusalem who doesn’t know the things that happened there in these days ? ”
42024019	Yeshua said to them , “ What kind of things ? ” And they said to Him , “ The things about Yeshua from Natzeret , who was a Prophet , powerful in deed and word before God and all the people —
42024020	how the ruling kohanim and our leaders handed Him over to be sentenced to death , and they executed Him .
42024021	But we were hoping that He was the One about to redeem Israel . Besides all this , today is the third day since these things happened .
42024022	“ But also some women among us amazed us . Early in the morning they were at the tomb .
42024023	When they didn’t find His body , they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels , who said He is alive !
42024024	Some of those with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women said , but they did not see Him . ”
42024025	Yeshua said to them , “ Oh foolish ones , so slow of heart to put your trust in all that the prophets spoke !
42024026	Was it not necessary for Messiah to suffer these things and to enter into His glory ? ”
42024027	Then beginning with Moses and all the Prophets , He explained to them the things written about Himself in all the Scriptures .
42024028	They approached the village where they were going , and He acted as though He were going farther on .
42024029	But they urged Him , saying , “ Stay with us , for it is nearly evening and the day is already gone . ” So He went in to stay with them .
42024030	And it happened that when He was reclining at the table with them , He took the matzah , offered a bracha and , breaking it , gave it to them .
42024031	Then their eyes were opened and they recognized Him , and He disappeared from them .
42024032	They said to one another , “ Didn’t our heart burn within us while He was speaking with us on the road , while He was explaining the Scriptures to us ? ”
42024033	And they got up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem . They found the eleven and others with them gathered together ,
42024034	saying , “ The Lord is risen indeed ! He has appeared to Simon ! ”
42024035	Then they began telling about the events on the road and how He became recognized by them in the breaking of the matzah .
42024036	While they were speaking of these things , Yeshua Himself stood in the midst of them and said , “ Shalom Aleichem ! ”
42024037	But they were startled and terrified , thinking they were seeing a ghost .
42024038	Then He said to them , “ Why are you so shaken ? And why do doubts arise in your heart ?
42024039	Look at My hands and My feet — it is I Myself ! Touch Me and see ! For a spirit doesn’t have flesh and bones , as you see I have . ”
42024040	And when He had said this , He showed them His hands and His feet .
42024041	But while they were still in disbelief due to joy and wonder , He said to them , “ Do you have anything to eat here ? ”
42024042	They gave Him a piece of broiled fish ,
42024043	and He took it and ate it in their presence .
42024044	Then He said to them , “ These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you — everything written concerning Me in the Torah of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled .
42024045	Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures ,
42024046	and He said to them , “ So it is written , that the Messiah is to suffer and to rise from the dead on the third day ,
42024047	and that repentance for the removal of sins is to be proclaimed in His name to all nations , beginning from Jerusalem .
42024048	You are witnesses of these things .
42024049	And behold , I am sending the promise of My Father upon you ; but you are to stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high . ”
42024050	Then Yeshua led them out as far as Bethany , and He lifted up His hands and blessed them .
42024051	And while blessing them , He departed from them from them and was taken up into heaven .
42024052	After worshiping Him , they returned to Jerusalem with great joy .
42024053	And they were continually in the Temple , praising God .
43001001	In the beginning was the Word . The Word was with God , and the Word was God .
43001002	He was with God in the beginning .
43001003	All things were made through Him , and apart from Him nothing was made that has come into being .
43001004	In Him was life , and the life was the light of men .
43001005	The light shines in the darkness , and the darkness has not overpowered it .
43001006	There came a man sent from God , whose name was John .
43001007	He came as a witness to testify about the light , so that through him everyone might believe .
43001008	He was not the light , but he came to bear witness concerning the light .
43001009	The true light , coming into the world , gives light to every man .
43001010	He was in the world , and the world was made through Him ; but the world did not know Him .
43001011	He came to His own , but His own did not receive Him .
43001012	But whoever did receive Him , those trusting in His name , to these He gave the right to become children of God .
43001013	They were born not of a bloodline , nor of human desire , nor of man’s will , but of God .
43001014	And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us . We looked upon His glory , the glory of the one and only from the Father , full of grace and truth .
43001015	John testifies about Him . He cried out , saying , “ This is He of whom I said , ‘ The One who comes after me is above me , because He existed before me . ’ ”
43001016	Out of His fullness , we have all received grace on top of grace .
43001017	Torah was given through Moses ; grace and truth came through Yeshua the Messiah .
43001018	No one has ever seen God ; but the one and only God , in the Father’s embrace , has made Him known .
43001019	This is John’s testimony , when the Judean leaders sent kohanim and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him , “ Who are you ? ”
43001020	He openly admitted and did not deny ; he admitted , “ I am not the Messiah . ”
43001021	“ What then ? Are you Elijah ? ” they asked him . “ I am not , ” said John . “ Are you the Prophet ? ” “ No , ” he answered .
43001022	So they said to him , “ Who are you ? Give us an answer for those who sent us . What do you say about yourself ? ”
43001023	He said , “ I am ‘ the voice of one crying in the wilderness , “ Make straight the way of Adonai , ” ’ as the prophet Isaiah said . ”
43001024	Now those sent were from the Pharisees .
43001025	They asked him , “ If you’re not the Messiah , Elijah , or the Prophet , why then are you immersing ? ”
43001026	“ I immerse in water , ” John answered . “ Among you stands One you do not know ,
43001027	coming after me , whose sandals I’m not worthy to untie . ”
43001028	These things happened in Bethany beyond the Jordan , where John was immersing .
43001029	The next day , John sees Yeshua coming to him and says , “ Behold , the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world !
43001030	This is the One about whom I told you , ‘ He who comes after me is above me , because He was before me . ’
43001031	I didn’t know Him , but I came immersing with water so that He might be revealed to Israel . ”
43001032	Then John testified , “ I have seen the Ruach coming down like a dove out of heaven , and it remained on Him .
43001033	I did not know Him ; but the One who sent me to immerse in water said to me , ‘ The One on whom you see the Ruach coming down and remaining , this is the One who immerses in the Ruach ha-Kodesh . ’
43001034	And I have seen and testified that this is Ben-Elohim . ”
43001035	Again the next day , John was standing with two of his disciples
43001036	and watched Yeshua walking by . He said , “ Behold , the Lamb of God ! ”
43001037	The two disciples heard him say this , and they followed Yeshua .
43001038	Yeshua turned around and saw them following . He said to them , “ What are you looking for ? ” They said to Him , “ Rabbi ” ( which is translated Teacher ) , “ where are you staying ? ”
43001039	“ Come and see , ” Yeshua tells them . So they came and saw where He was staying , and they spent that day with Him . It was about the tenth hour .
43001040	Andrew , the brother of Simon Peter , was one of the two who heard John speak and followed Yeshua .
43001041	First he finds his own brother Simon and tells him , “ We’ve found the Messiah ! ” ( which is translated Anointed One ) .
43001042	Andrew brought Simon to Yeshua . Yeshua looked at him and said , “ You are Simon , son of John . You shall be called Kefa ( which is translated Peter ) . ”
43001043	The next day , Yeshua decided to go to the Galilee . He finds Philip and says to him , “ Follow Me ! ”
43001044	Now Philip was from Bethsaida , the same town as Andrew and Peter .
43001045	Philip finds Nathanael and tells him , “ We’ve found the One that Moses in the Torah , and also the prophets , wrote about — Yeshua of Natzeret , the son of Joseph ! ”
43001046	“ Natzeret ! ” Nathanael answered . “ Can anything good come from there ? ” Philip said to him , “ Come and see . ”
43001047	Yeshua saw Nathanael coming toward Him . He said , “ Look , a true Israelite ! There’s nothing false in him . ”
43001048	Nathanael said to Him , “ How do you know me ? ” Yeshua answered , “ Before Philip called you , when you were under the fig tree , I saw you . ”
43001049	“ Rabbi , ” Nathanael answered , “ You are Ben-Elohim ! You are the King of Israel ! ”
43001050	“ Because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree , you believe ? ” Yeshua replied to him . “ You will see greater things than that ! ”
43001051	And He said , “ Amen , amen I tell you , you will see heaven opened and the angels of God going up and coming down on the Son of Man ! ”
43002001	On the third day , there was a wedding at Cana in the Galilee . Yeshua’s mother was there ,
43002002	and Yeshua and His disciples were also invited to the wedding .
43002003	When the wine ran out , Yeshua’s mother said to Him , “ They don’t have any wine ! ”
43002004	Yeshua said to her , “ Woman , what does this have to do with you and Me ? My hour hasn’t come yet . ”
43002005	His mother said to the servants , “ Do whatever He tells you . ”
43002006	Now there were six stone jars , used for the Jewish ritual of purification , each holding two to three measures .
43002007	Yeshua said to them , “ Fill the jars with water ! ” So they filled them up to the top .
43002008	Then He said to them , “ Take some water out , and give it to the headwaiter . ” And they brought it .
43002009	Now the headwaiter did not know where it had come from , but the servants who had drawn the water knew . As the headwaiter tasted the water that had become wine , he calls the bridegroom
43002010	and says to him , “ Everyone brings out the good wine first , and whenever they are drunk , then the worse . But you’ve reserved the good wine until now ! ”
43002011	Yeshua did this , the first of the signs , in Cana of the Galilee — He revealed His glory , and His disciples believed in Him .
43002012	After this Yeshua went down to Capernaum with His mother , brothers , and disciples , and they stayed there a few days .
43002013	The Jewish feast of Passover was near , so Yeshua went up to Jerusalem .
43002014	In the Temple , He found the merchants selling oxen , sheep , and doves ; also the moneychangers sitting there .
43002015	Then He made a whip of cords and drove them all out of the Temple , both the sheep and oxen . He dumped out the coins of the moneychangers and overturned their tables .
43002016	To those selling doves , He said , “ Get these things out of here ! Stop making My Father’s house a marketplace ! ”
43002017	His disciples remembered that it is written , “ Zeal for your House will consume Me ! ”
43002018	The Judean leaders responded , “ What sign do You show us , since You are doing these things ? ”
43002019	“ Destroy this Temple , ” Yeshua answered them , “ and in three days I will raise it up . ”
43002020	The Judean leaders then said to Him , “ Forty-six years this Temple was being built , and You will raise it up in three days ? ”
43002021	But He was talking about the temple of His body .
43002022	So after He was raised from the dead , His disciples remembered that He was talking about this . Then they believed the Scripture and the word that Yeshua had spoken .
43002023	Now when He was in Jerusalem for the Passover , during the feast , many believed in His name , seeing the signs He was doing .
43002024	But Yeshua did not entrust Himself to them , because He knew all men .
43002025	He did not need anyone to testify about man , for He knew what was in man .
43003001	Now there was a man , a Pharisee named Nicodemus , a ruler of the Jewish people .
43003002	He came to Yeshua at night and said , “ Rabbi , we know that You , a teacher , have come from God . For no one can perform these signs which You do unless God is with Him ! ”
43003003	Yeshua answered him , “ Amen , amen I tell you , unless one is born from above , he cannot see the kingdom of God . ”
43003004	“ How can a man be born when he is old ? ” Nicodemus said to Him . “ He cannot enter his mother’s womb a second time and be born , can he ? ”
43003005	Yeshua answered , “ Amen , amen I tell you , unless one is born of water and spirit , he cannot enter the kingdom of God .
43003006	What is born of the flesh is flesh , and what is born of the Ruach is spirit .
43003007	Do not be surprised that I said to you , ‘ You all must be born from above . ’
43003008	The wind blows where it wishes and you hear its sound , but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes . So it is with everyone born of the Ruach . ”
43003009	“ How can these things happen ? ” Nicodemus said .
43003010	Yeshua answered him , “ You’re a teacher of Israel and you do not understand these things ?
43003011	Amen , amen I tell you , We speak about what We know and testify about what We have seen . Yet you all do not receive Our testimony !
43003012	If you do not believe the earthly things I told you , how will you believe when I tell you about heavenly things ?
43003013	No one has gone up into heaven except the One who came down from heaven — the Son of Man .
43003014	Just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert , so the Son of Man must be lifted up ,
43003015	so that whoever believes in Him may have eternal life !
43003016	“ For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son , that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life .
43003017	God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world , but in order that the world might be saved through Him .
43003018	The one who believes in Him is not condemned ; but whoever does not believe has been condemned already , because he has not put his trust in the name of the one and only Ben-Elohim .
43003019	“ Now this is the judgment , that the light has come into the world and men loved the darkness instead of the light , because their deeds were evil .
43003020	For everyone who does evil hates the light and does not come to the light , so that their deeds will not be exposed .
43003021	But whoever practices the truth comes to the light , so that it may be made known that his deeds have been accomplished in God . ”
43003022	Afterwards , Yeshua and His disciples came to the land of Judea . There He was staying with them and immersing .
43003023	Now John also was immersing at Aenon near Salim , because much water was there and many were coming and being immersed ;
43003024	for John had not yet been thrown into prison .
43003025	Now an argument came up between John’s disciples and a Judean concerning purification .
43003026	They came to John and said , “ Rabbi , the One who was with you beyond the Jordan , the One you testified about — look , He is immersing , and all are coming to Him ! ”
43003027	John answered , “ A man can receive nothing unless it has been given to him from heaven .
43003028	You yourselves testify that I said , ‘ I am not the Messiah , ’ but rather , ‘ I am sent before Him . ’
43003029	The one who has the bride is the bridegroom , but the best man rejoices when he stands and hears the bridegroom’s voice . So now my joy is complete !
43003030	He must increase , while I must decrease . ”
43003031	The One who comes from above is above all . The one who is from the earth is of the earth , and of the earth he speaks . The One who comes from heaven is above all .
43003032	And what He has seen and heard , He testifies to that ; yet no one receives His testimony .
43003033	Whoever receives His testimony has certified that God is true .
43003034	The One whom God has sent speaks the words of God , for God gives the Ruach without limit .
43003035	The Father loves the Son and has given everything into His hand .
43003036	He who trusts in the Son has eternal life . He who does not obey the Son will not see life , but the wrath of God remains on him .
43004001	Now Yeshua knew that the Pharisees heard that He was making and immersing more disciples than John .
43004002	( Although Yeshua Himself was not immersing , His disciples were . )
43004003	So He left Judea and went back again to the Galilee .
43004004	But He needed to pass through Samaria .
43004005	So He comes to a Samaritan town called Shechem , near the plot of land that Jacob gave to his son Joseph .
43004006	Now Jacob’s well was there . So Yeshua , exhausted from the journey , was sitting by the well . It was midday .
43004007	A Samaritan woman comes to draw water . “ Give me a drink , ” Yeshua tells her ,
43004008	for His disciples had gone away to the town to buy food .
43004009	Then the Samaritan woman tells Him , “ How is it that You , a Jew , ask me , a Samaritan woman , for a drink ? ” ( For Jewish people don’t deal with Samaritans . )
43004010	Yeshua replied to her , “ If you knew the gift of God , and who it is who is saying to you , ‘ Give Me a drink , ’ you would have asked Him , and He would have given you living water . ”
43004011	“ Sir , ” the woman tells Him , “ You don’t have a bucket , and the well is deep . Then from where do You get this living water ?
43004012	You’re not greater than our father Jacob , are You ? He gave us this well . He drank out of it himself , with his sons and his cattle . ”
43004013	Yeshua replied to her , “ Everyone who drinks from this water will get thirsty again .
43004014	But whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall never be thirsty . The water that I give him will become a fountain of water within him , springing up to eternal life ! ”
43004015	“ Sir , ” the woman tells Him , “ give me this water , so I won’t get thirsty or have to come all the way here to draw water ! ”
43004016	He tells her , “ Go call your husband , and then come back here . ”
43004017	“ I don’t have a husband , ” the woman replied . Yeshua tells her , “ You’ve said it right , ‘ I have no husband . ’
43004018	For you’ve had five husbands , and the man you have now isn’t your husband . This you’ve spoken truthfully ! ”
43004019	“ Sir , ” the woman tells Him , “ I see that You are a prophet !
43004020	Our fathers worshiped on this mountain , but you all say that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem . ”
43004021	Yeshua tells her , “ Woman , believe Me , an hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem .
43004022	You worship what you do not know ; we worship what we know , for salvation is from the Jews .
43004023	But an hour is coming — it is here now — when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth , for the Father is seeking such people as His worshipers .
43004024	God is Spirit , and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth . ”
43004025	The woman tells Him , “ I know that Messiah is coming ( He who is called the Anointed One . ) When He comes , He will explain everything to us . ”
43004026	Yeshua tells her , “ I — the One speaking to you — I am . ”
43004027	At this moment , His disciples came back . They were amazed that He was speaking with a woman . Yet no one said , “ What do You want ? ” or “ Why are You speaking with her ? ”
43004028	So the woman left her water jar and went back to the town . She tells the people ,
43004029	“ Come see a man who told me everything I ever did ! He couldn’t be the Messiah , could He ? ”
43004030	The people left the town and began coming to Him .
43004031	Meanwhile , the disciples were pressing Him , “ Rabbi , eat ! ”
43004032	But He said to them , “ I have food to eat that you know nothing about . ”
43004033	So the disciples were saying to each other , “ No one brought Him food to eat , did they ? ”
43004034	Yeshua tells them , “ My food is to do the will of the One who sent Me and to accomplish His work .
43004035	Don’t you say , ‘ Four more months , and then comes the harvest ’ ? Look , I tell you , lift up your eyes and look at the fields ! They are white and ready for harvest .
43004036	“ The reaper receives a reward and gathers fruit for eternal life , so that the sower and reaper may rejoice together .
43004037	For the saying is true , ‘ One sows and another reaps . ’
43004038	I sent you to reap what you haven’t worked for . Others have worked hard , and you have joined in their work . ”
43004039	Many of the Samaritans from that town put their trust in Him because of the word of the woman testifying , “ He told me everything I ever did ! ”
43004040	So when the Samaritans came to Him , they kept asking Him to stay with them . He stayed there two days ,
43004041	and many more believed because of His word .
43004042	They kept telling the woman , “ It’s no longer because of your words that we believe . We’ve heard for ourselves ! Now we know that this really is the Savior of the world ! ”
43004043	After the two days , He went on from there into the Galilee .
43004044	Now Yeshua Himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country .
43004045	But when He came into the Galilee , they welcomed Him . For they had seen all He had done at the feast in Jerusalem , since they also had gone up to celebrate .
43004046	So He went again to Cana of the Galilee , where He had turned the water into wine . Now there was a nobleman whose son was sick in Capernaum .
43004047	When he heard that Yeshua had come from Judea to the Galilee , he went to Him and begged Him to come down and heal his son ; for he was about to die .
43004048	Then Yeshua said to him , “ Unless you all see signs and wonders , you’ll never believe ! ”
43004049	The nobleman said to Him , “ Sir , come down before my child dies ! ”
43004050	Yeshua tells him , “ Go ! Your son lives ! ” The man believed the word that Yeshua said to him and started off .
43004051	While on his way down , his servants met him , saying that his son was living .
43004052	So he asked them the hour when the boy began to get better . They said , “ The fever left him yesterday at about the seventh hour . ”
43004053	Then the father realized that it was the same hour Yeshua said to him , “ Your son lives ! ” Now he himself believed , along with his whole household .
43004054	Yeshua did this as the second sign , after He had come again from Judea into the Galilee .
43005001	After this there was a Jewish feast , and Yeshua went up to Jerusalem .
43005002	Now in Jerusalem there is a pool by the sheep gate , called Bethzatha in Aramaic , which has five porches .
43005003	In these a crowd of invalids was lying around — blind , lame , disabled . ( 4 )
43005005	Now a certain man had been an invalid there for thirty-eight years .
43005006	Seeing him lying there and knowing he had been that way a long time , Yeshua said to him , “ Do you want to get well ? ”
43005007	The invalid answered Him , “ Sir , I have nobody to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up . While I’m trying to get in , somebody else steps down before me ! ”
43005008	Yeshua tells him , “ Get up ! Pick up your mat and walk ! ”
43005009	Immediately , the man was healed ! He took up his mat and started walking around . Now that day was Shabbat ,
43005010	so Judean leaders were saying to the man who was healed , “ It’s Shabbat ! It’s not permitted for you to carry your mat . ”
43005011	But he answered them , “ The man who made me well told me , ‘ Pick up your mat and walk . ’ ”
43005012	They asked him , “ Who is the man who told you , ‘ Pick up your mat and walk ’ ? ”
43005013	But the man who had been healed didn’t know who it was , for Yeshua had slipped away into the crowd in that place .
43005014	Afterwards , Yeshua finds him in the Temple . He said to him , “ Look , you’ve been healed ! Stop sinning , so nothing worse happens to you . ”
43005015	The man left and told the Judean leaders that it was Yeshua who had made him well .
43005016	Because Yeshua was doing these things on Shabbat , the Judean leaders started persecuting Him .
43005017	But Yeshua said to them , “ My Father is still working , and I also am working . ”
43005018	So for this reason the Judean leaders kept trying even harder to kill Him — because He was not only breaking Shabbat , but also calling God His own Father , making Himself equal with God .
43005019	Therefore Yeshua answered them , “ Amen , amen I tell you , the Son cannot do anything by Himself . He can do only what He sees the Father doing . Whatever the Father does , the Son does likewise .
43005020	For the Father loves the Son and shows Him everything He does . He will show Him even greater works than these , so that you will be amazed .
43005021	For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life , so also the Son gives life to whomever He wants .
43005022	The Father does not judge anyone , but has handed over all judgment to the Son
43005023	so that all should honor the Son , just as they honor the Father . Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him .
43005024	“ Amen , amen I tell you , whoever hears My word and trusts the One who sent Me has eternal life . He does not come into judgment , but has passed over from death into life .
43005025	Amen , amen I tell you , an hour is coming and is now here , when the dead will hear the voice of Ben-Elohim . Those who hear will live !
43005026	For just as the Father has life in Himself , so also He has granted the Son to have life in Himself .
43005027	Also He has given the Son authority to judge , because He is the Son of Man .
43005028	“ Do not be amazed at this , for an hour is coming when all who are in their graves will hear His voice
43005029	and come out ! Those who have done good will come to a resurrection of life , and those who have done evil will come to a resurrection of judgment .
43005030	I can do nothing on My own . Just as I hear , I judge ; and My judgment is just , for I do not seek My own will , but the will of the One who sent Me . ”
43005031	“ If I testify about Myself , My witness is not valid .
43005032	There is another who testifies about Me , and I know that the testimony He gives is true .
43005033	You have sent to John , and he has testified to the truth .
43005034	I do not receive the testimony of man , but I say these things so that you may be saved .
43005035	He was the lamp that was burning and shining , and you wanted to rejoice for a while in his light .
43005036	“ But the testimony I have is greater than that from John . The works the Father has given Me to finish — the very works I am doing — testify about Me , that the Father has sent Me .
43005037	And the Father who sent Me has testified concerning Me . You have never heard His voice nor seen His form .
43005038	Nor do you have His Word living in you , because you do not trust the One He sent .
43005039	You search the Scriptures because you suppose that in them you have eternal life . It is these that testify about Me .
43005040	Yet you are unwilling to come to Me so that you may have life !
43005041	“ I do not accept glory from men .
43005042	But I know you , that you do not have the love of God in yourselves .
43005043	I have come in My Father’s name , and you do not receive Me . But if another comes in his own name , you will receive him .
43005044	How can you believe , when you receive glory from one another and you do not seek the glory that comes from God alone ?
43005045	“ Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father . The one who accuses you is Moses , in whom you have put your hope .
43005046	For if you were believing Moses , you would believe Me — because he wrote about Me .
43005047	But since you do not believe his writings , how will you believe My words ? ”
43006001	Afterwards , Yeshua went away to the other side of the Sea of Galilee , also known as the Sea of Tiberias .
43006002	A large crowd kept following Him , because they were watching the signs He was performing on the sick .
43006003	Then Yeshua went up the mountainside and sat down there with His disciples .
43006004	Passover , the Jewish feast , was near .
43006005	Lifting up His eyes and seeing a large crowd coming to Him , Yeshua said to Philip , “ Where will we buy bread so these may eat ? ”
43006006	Now Yeshua was saying this to test him , for He knew what He was about to do .
43006007	Philip answered Him , “ Two hundred denarii isn’t enough to buy bread for each to get a little bit ! ”
43006008	One of His disciples , Andrew , Simon Peter’s brother , said to Him ,
43006009	“ There’s a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish — but what’s that for so many ? ”
43006010	Yeshua said , “ Make the people recline . ” There was much grass in the area . So the men reclined , about five thousand in number .
43006011	Then Yeshua picked up the loaves . And having given thanks , He distributed bread to everyone who was reclining . He did the same with the fish , as much as they wanted .
43006012	When the people were full , Yeshua said to His disciples , “ Gather up the leftovers , so nothing is wasted . ”
43006013	So they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves , which were left over by those who had finished eating .
43006014	When the people saw the sign that Yeshua performed , they began to say , “ This is most certainly the Prophet who is to come into the world ! ”
43006015	Realizing that they were about to come and seize Him by force to make Him king , Yeshua withdrew again to the mountain , Himself alone .
43006016	Now when evening came , Yeshua’s disciples went down to the sea .
43006017	Getting into a boat , they set out to cross the sea toward Capernaum . By now it had become dark , and still Yeshua had not come to them .
43006018	A great wind began to blow , stirring up the sea .
43006019	After they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia , they catch sight of Yeshua walking on the sea , approaching the boat . They were terrified !
43006020	But Yeshua says to them , “ I am . Don’t be afraid . ”
43006021	Then they wanted to take Him into the boat , and right away the boat reached the shore where they were headed .
43006022	The next day , the crowd remaining on the other side of the sea realized that no other boat had been there except the one , and that Yeshua hadn’t gone into the boat with His disciples , but that His disciples had gone away alone .
43006023	Some other boats from Tiberias came close to the place where they had eaten the bread after the Master had given thanks .
43006024	So when the crowd realized that neither Yeshua nor His disciples were there , they got into the boats and set off for Capernaum to find Him .
43006025	When they found Him on the other side of the sea , they said , “ Rabbi , when did You get here ? ”
43006026	Yeshua responded to them , “ Amen , amen I tell you , you seek Me not because you saw signs , but because you ate all the bread and were filled .
43006027	Don’t work for food that spoils , but for the food that endures to eternal life , which the Son of Man will give to you . For on Him , God the Father has put the seal of approval . ”
43006028	Then they said to Him , “ What shall we do to perform the works of God ? ”
43006029	Yeshua answered them , “ This is the work of God , to trust in the One He sent . ”
43006030	So they said to Him , “ Then what sign do You perform , so that we may see and believe You ? What work do You do ?
43006031	Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness ; as it is written , ‘ Out of heaven He gave them bread to eat . ’ ”
43006032	Yeshua answered them , “ Amen , amen I tell you , it isn’t Moses who has given you bread from heaven , but My Father gives you the true bread from heaven .
43006033	For the bread of God is the One coming down from heaven and giving life to the world . ”
43006034	So they said to Him , “ Sir , give us this bread from now on ! ”
43006035	Yeshua said to them , “ I am the bread of life . Whoever comes to Me will never be hungry , and whoever believes in Me will never be thirsty .
43006036	But I told you that you have seen Me , yet you do not believe .
43006037	Everyone the Father gives Me will come to Me , and anyone coming to Me I will never reject .
43006038	For I have come down from heaven not to do My own will but the will of the One who sent Me .
43006039	“ Now this is the will of the One who sent Me , that I lose not one of all He has given Me , but raise each one on the last day .
43006040	For this is the will of My Father , that everyone who sees the Son and trusts in Him may have eternal life ; and I will raise him up on the last day . ”
43006041	Some of the Judeans started to grumble about Him , because He said , “ I am the bread that came down from heaven . ”
43006042	They were saying , “ Isn’t this Yeshua the son of Joseph , whose father and mother we know ? How can He now say , ‘ I have come down from heaven ’ ? ”
43006043	Yeshua answered , “ Stop grumbling among yourselves !
43006044	No one can come to Me unless My Father who sent Me draws him — and I will raise him up on the last day .
43006045	It is written in the Prophets , ‘ They will all be taught by God . ’ Everyone who has listened and learned from the Father comes to Me .
43006046	Not that anyone has seen the Father except the One who is from God — He has seen the Father .
43006047	“ Amen , amen I tell you , he who believes has eternal life .
43006048	I am the bread of life .
43006049	Your fathers ate the manna in the desert , yet they died .
43006050	This is the bread that comes down from heaven , so that one may eat and not die .
43006051	I am the living bread , which came down from heaven . If anyone eats this bread , he will live forever . This bread is My flesh , which I will give for the life of the world . ”
43006052	Then the Jews began arguing with one another , “ How can this man give us His flesh to eat ? ”
43006053	So Yeshua said to them , “ Amen , amen I tell you , unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood , you have no life in yourselves .
43006054	He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life , and I will raise him up on the last day .
43006055	“ For My flesh is real food and My blood is real drink .
43006056	He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me , and I in him .
43006057	Just as the living Father sent Me and I live because of the Father , so the one who eats of Me will also live because of Me .
43006058	This is the bread that came down from heaven — not like the bread your fathers ate and then died . He who eats this bread will live forever . ”
43006059	He said these things while teaching at the synagogue in Capernaum .
43006060	So when many of His disciples heard this , they said , “ This is a hard teaching . Who can listen to it ? ”
43006061	But Yeshua knew His disciples were murmuring , so He said to them , “ Does this offend you ?
43006062	Then what if you see the Son of Man going back up to the place where He was before ?
43006063	It is the Ruach who gives life ; the flesh is of no benefit . The words I have spoken to you are Ruach and are life !
43006064	Yet some of you do not trust . ” Yeshua knew from the beginning who were the ones who did not trust , as well as which one would betray Him .
43006065	Then He told them , “ For this reason I’ve told you that no one can come to Me unless it has been granted to him by the Father . ”
43006066	From this time , many of His disciples left and quit walking with Him .
43006067	So Yeshua said to the Twelve , “ You don’t want to leave also , do you ? ”
43006068	Simon Peter answered Him , “ Lord , to whom shall we go ? You have the words of eternal life !
43006069	We have trusted and have come to know that you are the Holy One of God . ”
43006070	Yeshua answered them , “ Didn’t I choose you , the Twelve ? Yet one of you is the adversary ! ”
43006071	Now He was speaking of Judah , the son of Simon of Kriot — for he , one of the Twelve , was about to betray Him .
43007001	After these events , Yeshua was walking about in the Galilee . He did not want to walk in Judea , because the Judean leaders wanted to kill Him .
43007002	Now the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles was near .
43007003	Therefore His brothers said to Him , “ Leave here and go to Judea , so Your disciples also may see the works You are doing .
43007004	No one who wants to be well known does everything in secret . If You are doing these things , show Yourself to the world ! ”
43007005	For not even His brothers were trusting in Him .
43007006	Therefore Yeshua said to them , “ My time has not yet come , but your time is always at hand .
43007007	The world cannot hate you , but it hates Me because I testify that its works are evil .
43007008	You go on up to the Feast . I’m not going to this Feast , because My time hasn’t yet fully come . ”
43007009	After saying these things , He stayed in the Galilee .
43007010	But after His brothers went to the Feast , He also went , not openly but secretly .
43007011	Then the Judean leaders were searching for Him at the Feast and kept asking , “ Where is that fellow ? ”
43007012	There was a lot of murmuring about Him in the crowds . Some were saying , “ He is good . ” But others were saying , “ Not so ! He leads the people astray . ”
43007013	Yet no one spoke openly about Him for fear of the Judean leaders .
43007014	About halfway through the Feast , Yeshua went up to the Temple and began teaching .
43007015	Then the Judean leaders were amazed , saying , “ How does this man know so much , having never been taught ? ”
43007016	Yeshua answered , “ My teaching is not from Me , but from Him who sent Me .
43007017	If anyone wants to do His will , he will know whether My teaching comes from God or it is Myself speaking .
43007018	Whoever speaks from himself seeks his own glory ; but He who seeks the glory of the One who sent Him , He is true and there is no unrighteousness in Him .
43007019	Hasn’t Moses given you the Torah ? Yet none of you keeps it . Why are you trying to kill Me ? ”
43007020	The crowd answered , “ You have a demon ! Who’s trying to kill you ? ”
43007021	Yeshua answered , “ I did one good work , and all of you are amazed .
43007022	Because Moses has given you circumcision ( though it is not from Moses , but from the patriarchs ) , you circumcise a man on Shabbat .
43007023	If a man receives circumcision on Shabbat so that the Torah of Moses may not be broken , why are you angry that I healed a man’s whole body on Shabbat ?
43007024	Do not judge by appearance , but judge righteously . ”
43007025	Then some of the people from Jerusalem were saying , “ Isn’t this the person they’re trying to kill ?
43007026	Look , He speaks openly and they’re saying nothing to Him . Can it be that the leaders know He is the Messiah ?
43007027	But we know where this person is from . But the Messiah , whenever He may come , no one knows where He is from . ”
43007028	Then , while teaching in the Temple courts , Yeshua cried out , “ You know both who I am and where I am from ! I have not come on My own , but the One who sent Me is true . You do not know Him ,
43007029	but I know Him because I am from Him and He sent Me . ”
43007030	Then they were trying to seize Him ; but no one laid a hand on Him , because His hour had not yet come .
43007031	Yet many from the crowd believed in Him and were saying , “ When the Messiah comes , He won’t perform more signs than this person has , will He ? ”
43007032	The Pharisees heard people in the crowd murmuring these things about Him , and the ruling kohanim and Pharisees sent guards to arrest Him .
43007033	Yeshua said , “ I am with you only a little while longer , and then I am going to the One who sent Me .
43007034	You will look for Me but will not find Me . Where I am , you cannot come . ”
43007035	The Judean leaders then said among themselves , “ Where is this person about to go that we shall not find Him ? He’s not going to the Diaspora to teach the Greeks , is He ?
43007036	What did He mean by saying , ‘ You will look for Me but will not find Me . Where I am , you cannot come ’ ? ”
43007037	On the last and greatest day of the Feast , Yeshua stood up and cried out loudly , “ If anyone is thirsty , let him come to Me and drink .
43007038	Whoever believes in Me , as the Scripture says , ‘ out of his innermost being will flow rivers of living water . ’ ”
43007039	Now He said this about the Ruach , whom those who trusted in Him were going to receive ; for the Ruach was not yet given , since Yeshua was not yet glorified .
43007040	When they heard these words , some of the crowd said , “ This man really is the Prophet . ”
43007041	Others were saying , “ This is the Messiah . ” Still others were saying , “ The Messiah doesn’t come from the Galilee , does He ?
43007042	Didn’t the Scripture say that the Messiah comes from the seed of David and from Bethlehem , David’s town ? ”
43007043	So a division arose in the crowd because of Yeshua .
43007044	Some wanted to capture Him , but no one laid hands on Him .
43007045	Then the guards returned to the ruling kohanim and Pharisees , who asked them , “ Why didn’t you bring Him ? ”
43007046	“ Never has anyone spoken like this man , ” the guards answered .
43007047	The Pharisees responded , “ You haven’t been led astray also , have you ?
43007048	Have any of the rulers or Pharisees believed in Him ?
43007049	No , but this mob that doesn’t know the Torah — they are cursed ! ”
43007050	Nicodemus , the one who had come to Yeshua before and was one of them , said to them ,
43007051	“ Our Torah doesn’t judge a man unless it first hears from him and knows what he’s doing , does it ? ”
43007052	They answered him , “ You aren’t from the Galilee too , are you ? Search , and see that no prophet comes out of the Galilee ! ”
43007053	Then everyone went to his own house .
43008001	But Yeshua went to the Mount of Olives .
43008002	At dawn , He came again into the Temple . All the people were coming to Him , and He sat down and began to teach them .
43008003	The Torah scholars and Pharisees bring in a woman who had been caught in adultery . After putting her in the middle ,
43008004	they say to Yeshua , “ Teacher , this woman has been caught in the act of committing adultery .
43008005	In the Torah , Moses commanded us to stone such women . So what do You say ? ”
43008006	Now they were saying this to trap Him , so that they would have grounds to accuse Him . But Yeshua knelt down and started writing in the dirt with His finger .
43008007	When they kept asking Him , He stood up and said , “ The sinless one among you , let him be the first to throw a stone at her . ”
43008008	Then He knelt down again and continued writing on the ground .
43008009	Now when they heard , they began to leave , one by one , the oldest ones first , until Yeshua was left alone with the woman in the middle .
43008010	Straightening up , Yeshua said to her , “ Woman , where are they ? Did no one condemn you ? ”
43008011	“ No one , Sir , ” she said . “ Then neither do I condemn you , ” Yeshua said . “ Go , and sin no more . ”
43008012	Yeshua spoke to them again , saying , “ I am the light of the world . The one who follows Me will no longer walk in darkness , but will have the light of life . ”
43008013	Then the Pharisees said to Him , “ You are testifying about Yourself , so Your testimony is not valid . ”
43008014	Yeshua answered them , “ Even if I testify about Myself , My testimony is valid . For I know where I came from and where I am going . But you don’t know where I come from or where I am going .
43008015	You judge according to the flesh , but I do not judge anyone .
43008016	Yet even if I do judge , My judgment is true , because it is not I alone but I with the Father who sent Me .
43008017	Even in your Torah it is written that the testimony of two men is true .
43008018	I am one witness for Myself , and the Father who sent Me bears witness for Me . ”
43008019	Then they said to Him , “ Where is your Father ? ” Yeshua answered , “ You know neither Me nor My Father . If you knew Me , you would also know My Father . ”
43008020	He spoke these words in the treasury while teaching in the Temple , but no one arrested Him because His hour had not yet come .
43008021	Then again Yeshua spoke to them , “ I am going away . You will look for Me and die in your sin . Where I am going , you cannot come . ”
43008022	“ He won’t kill Himself , will He ? ” the Judeans asked . “ Is that why He says , ‘ Where I am going , you cannot come ’ ? ”
43008023	Yeshua said , “ You are from below ; I am from above . You are of this world ; I am not of this world .
43008024	Therefore I told you that you will die in your sins . If you don’t believe that I am , you will die in your sins . ”
43008025	So they asked Him , “ Who are you ? ” Yeshua replied , “ What have I been telling you from the beginning ?
43008026	I have much to say and judge about you . But the One who sent Me is true , and I tell the world what I heard from Him . ”
43008027	They didn’t understand that He was talking to them about the Father .
43008028	So Yeshua said , “ When you have lifted up the Son of Man , then you will know who I am . I do nothing by Myself , but speak just what the Father has taught Me .
43008029	The One who sent Me is with Me . He has not left Me alone , because I always do what is pleasing to Him . ”
43008030	As He was speaking these things , many people put their trust in Him .
43008031	Then Yeshua said to the Judeans who had trusted Him , “ If you abide in My word , then you are truly My disciples .
43008032	You will know the truth , and the truth will set you free ! ”
43008033	They answered Him , “ We are Abraham’s children and have never been slaves to anyone ! How can you say , ‘ You will become free ’ ? ”
43008034	Yeshua answered them , “ Amen , amen I tell you , everyone who sins is a slave to sin .
43008035	Now the slave does not remain in the household forever ; the son abides forever .
43008036	So if the Son sets you free , you will be free indeed !
43008037	I know you are Abraham’s children ; yet you are trying to kill Me , because My word has no place in you .
43008038	I tell of what I have seen with the Father ; so also you do what you heard from the Father . ”
43008039	“ Abraham is our father , ” they replied to Him . Yeshua said to them , “ If you are Abraham’s children , do the deeds of Abraham .
43008040	But now you are seeking to kill Me — a Man who has told you the truth , which I heard from God . This Abraham did not do !
43008041	You are doing the deeds of your father . ” They said to Him , “ We were not born as illegitimate children — we have one Father , God Himself ! ”
43008042	Yeshua said to them , “ If God were your Father , you would love Me , for from God I came and now I am here . For I have not come on My own , but He sent Me .
43008043	Why don’t you understand My speech ? Because you’re not able to hear My word !
43008044	You are of your father the devil , and you want to do the desires of your father . He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth , because there is no truth in him . Whenever he speaks lies he is just being himself — for he is a liar and the father of lies .
43008045	“ But because I speak the truth , you do not believe Me .
43008046	Which one of you convicts Me of sinning ? If I am telling the truth , why don’t you believe Me ?
43008047	He who belongs to God hears the words of God . The reason you don’t hear is because you do not belong to God . ”
43008048	The Judean leaders responded , “ Aren’t we right to say you are a Samaritan and have a demon ? ”
43008049	Yeshua answered , “ I do not have a demon ! I honor My Father , yet you dishonor Me .
43008050	But I do not seek My own glory ; there is One who is seeking and judging .
43008051	Amen , amen I tell you , if anyone keeps My word , he will never see death . ”
43008052	“ Now we know You have a demon ! ” the Judean leaders said to Him . “ Abraham and the prophets died . Yet You say , ‘ If anyone keeps My word , he will never taste death . ’
43008053	You are not greater than our father Abraham who died , are You ? The prophets also died ! Who do You make Yourself out to be ? ”
43008054	Yeshua answered , “ If I glorify Myself , My glory is nothing . It is My Father who gives Me glory — the One of whom you say , ‘ He is our God . ’
43008055	Yet you do not know Him , but I know Him . If I say I do not know Him , I will be a liar like you . Yet I do know Him and keep His Word .
43008056	Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day ; he saw it and was thrilled . ”
43008057	Then the Judeans said to Him , “ You’re not even fifty years old and you’ve seen Abraham ? ”
43008058	Yeshua answered , “ Amen , amen I tell you , before Abraham was , I am ! ”
43008059	Then they picked up stones to throw at Him , but Yeshua hid Himself and went out from the Temple .
43009001	As Yeshua was passing by , He saw a man who had been blind since birth .
43009002	His disciples asked Him , “ Rabbi , who sinned , this man or his parents , that he should be born blind ? ”
43009003	Yeshua answered , “ Neither this man nor his parents sinned . This happened so that the works of God might be brought to light in him .
43009004	We must do the work of the One who sent Me , so long as it is day ! Night is coming when no one can work .
43009005	While I am in the world , I am the light of the world . ”
43009006	Having said these things , He spat on the ground , made mud with the saliva , and spread the mud on the blind man’s eyes .
43009007	He told him , “ Go , wash in the Pool of Siloam ” ( which is translated Sent ) . So he went away , washed , and came back seeing .
43009008	Therefore his neighbors and those who had seen him as a beggar kept saying , “ Isn’t this the one who used to sit and beg ? ”
43009009	“ This is the one ! ” some said . “ No , but it looks like him , ” said others . But the man himself kept saying , “ I am ! ”
43009010	So they asked him , “ Then how were your eyes opened ? ”
43009011	He answered , “ The Man who is called Yeshua made mud , rubbed it on my eyes , and said to me , ‘ Go to Siloam and wash . ’ So I went away and washed , and then I received my sight ! ”
43009012	“ Where is He ? ” they asked him . “ I don’t know , ” he said .
43009013	They bring to the Pharisees the man who once was blind .
43009014	Now the day was Shabbat when Yeshua made the mud and opened the man’s eyes .
43009015	So again the Pharisees were asking him how he received his sight . He responded , “ He put mud on my eyes , and I washed , and I see ! ”
43009016	So some of the Pharisees began saying , “ This man isn’t from God , because He doesn’t keep Shabbat ! ” But others were saying , “ How can a sinner perform such signs ? ” So there was a split among them .
43009017	Again they say to the blind man , “ What do you say about Him , since He opened your eyes ? ” And he said , “ He’s a prophet . ”
43009018	So the Judean leaders didn’t believe that he had been blind and received his sight until they called his parents .
43009019	They questioned them , “ Is this your son , whom you say was born blind ? Then how does he see now ? ”
43009020	Then his parents answered , “ We know that this is our son and that he was born blind .
43009021	We don’t know how he now sees , nor do we know who opened his eyes . Ask him — he’s old enough . He will speak for himself . ”
43009022	His parents said this because they were afraid of the Judean leaders . For the Judean leaders had already agreed that anyone who professed Yeshua to be Messiah would be thrown out of the synagogue .
43009023	That’s why his parents said , “ He’s old enough — ask him . ”
43009024	So a second time they called the man who had been blind and said , “ Give glory to God ! We know that this man is a sinner ! ”
43009025	The man replied , “ I don’t know whether He’s a sinner . One thing I do know is that I was blind , but now I see ! ”
43009026	So they asked him , “ What did He do to you ? How did He open your eyes ? ”
43009027	“ I told you already and you didn’t listen ! ” the man responded . “ What , do you want to hear it again ? You don’t want to become His disciples too , do you ? ”
43009028	They railed at him and said , “ You’re a disciple of that One , but we’re disciples of Moses !
43009029	We know that God has spoken to Moses ; but as for this fellow , we don’t know where He is from . ”
43009030	The man replied to them , “ That’s amazing ! You don’t know where He is from , yet He opened my eyes !
43009031	We know that God doesn’t listen to sinners ; but if anyone fears Him and does His will , He hears this one .
43009032	Since the beginning of the world , no one has ever heard that anyone has opened the eyes of a man born blind .
43009033	If this man were not from God , He couldn’t do anything . ”
43009034	They replied to him , “ You were born completely in sin , and you’re teaching us ? ” And they threw him out .
43009035	Yeshua heard that they had thrown him out . Finding him , He said , “ Do you believe in the Son of Man ? ”
43009036	The man answered , “ Who is He , Sir ? Tell me , so that I may believe in Him ! ”
43009037	Yeshua said , “ You have seen Him — He is the One speaking with you . ”
43009038	He said , “ Lord , I believe ! ” And he worshiped Him .
43009039	Yeshua said , “ For judgment I came into this world , so that those who don’t see may see , and the ones who do see may become blind . ”
43009040	Some of the Pharisees who were with Him heard Him say this and asked , “ We’re not blind too , are we ? ”
43009041	Yeshua said to them , “ If you were blind , you would have no sin . But now you say , ‘ We see . ’ So your sin remains . ”
43010001	“ Amen , amen I tell you , he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door , but climbs in some other way , is a thief and a robber .
43010002	But he who enters through the door is the shepherd of the sheep .
43010003	To him the doorkeeper opens , and the sheep hear his voice . The shepherd calls his own sheep by name and leads them out .
43010004	“ When he has brought out all his own , he goes ahead of them ; and the sheep follow him because they know his voice .
43010005	They will never follow a stranger , but will run away from him , for they do not know the voice of strangers . ”
43010006	Yeshua told them this parable , but they did not understand what He was telling them .
43010007	So Yeshua said again , “ Amen , amen I tell you , I am the gate for the sheep .
43010008	All those who came before Me are thieves and robbers , but the sheep did not listen to them .
43010009	I am the gate ! If anyone comes in through Me , he will be saved . He will come and go and find pasture .
43010010	The thief comes only to steal , slaughter , and destroy . I have come that they might have life , and have it abundantly !
43010011	“ I am the Good Shepherd . The Good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep .
43010012	The hired worker is not the shepherd , and the sheep are not his own . He sees the wolf coming and abandons the sheep and flees . Then the wolf snatches and scatters the sheep .
43010013	The man is only a hired hand and does not care about the sheep .
43010014	“ I am the Good Shepherd . I know My own and My own know Me ,
43010015	just as the Father knows Me and I know the Father . And I lay down My life for the sheep .
43010016	I have other sheep that are not from this fold ; those also I must lead , and they will listen to My voice . So there shall be one flock , one Shepherd .
43010017	“ For this reason the Father loves Me , because I lay down My life , so that I may take it up again .
43010018	No one takes it away from Me , but I lay it down on My own . I have the authority to lay it down , and I have the authority to take it up again . This command I received from My Father . ”
43010019	Again a division arose among the Judeans because of these words .
43010020	Many of them were saying , “ He has a demon . He’s insane ! Why listen to Him ? ”
43010021	Others said , “ These are not the sayings of someone who is plagued by a demon . A demon cannot open the eyes of the blind , can it ? ”
43010022	Then came Hanukkah ; it was winter in Jerusalem .
43010023	Yeshua was walking in the Temple around Solomon’s Colonnade .
43010024	Then the Judean leaders surrounded Him , saying , “ How long will You hold us in suspense ? If You are the Messiah , tell us outright ! ”
43010025	Yeshua answered them , “ I told you , but you don’t believe ! The works I do in My Father’s name testify concerning Me .
43010026	But you don’t believe , because you are not My sheep .
43010027	My sheep hear My voice . I know them , and they follow Me .
43010028	I give them eternal life ! They will never perish , and no one will snatch them out of My hand .
43010029	My Father , who has given them to Me , is greater than all . And no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand .
43010030	I and the Father are one . ”
43010031	Again the Judean leaders picked up stones to stone Him .
43010032	Yeshua answered them , “ I’ve shown you many good works from the Father . For which of these are you going to stone Me ? ”
43010033	The Judean leaders answered , “ We aren’t stoning you for a good work , but for blasphemy . Though You are a man , You make Yourself God ! ”
43010034	Yeshua answered them , “ Isn’t it written in your Writings , ‘ I have said you are gods’ ?
43010035	If he called them ‘ gods , ’ to whom the Word of God came ( and the Scripture cannot be broken ) ,
43010036	do you say of Him , the One the Father set apart and sent into the world , ‘ You speak blasphemy , ’ because I said , ‘ I am Ben-Elohim ’ ?
43010037	“ If I don’t do the works of My Father , don’t believe Me !
43010038	But if I do , even if you don’t trust Me , trust the deeds . Then you may come to know and continue to understand that the Father is in Me , and I am in the Father . ”
43010039	Therefore they tried to capture Him again , but He escaped from their hand .
43010040	Again He went back across the Jordan to the place where John first started immersing , and He stayed there .
43010041	Many people came to Him and were saying , “ John performed no sign , but all John said about this man was true . ”
43010042	And many trusted in Him there .
43011001	Now a man named Lazarus was sick . He was from Bethany , the village of Miriam and her sister Martha .
43011002	This was the same Miriam who anointed the Master with perfume and wiped His feet with her hair . It was her brother Lazarus who was sick .
43011003	So the sisters sent a word to Yeshua , saying , “ Master , the one you love is sick ! ”
43011004	When Yeshua heard this , He said , “ This sickness will not end in death . It is for God’s glory , so that Ben-Elohim may be glorified through it . ”
43011005	Now Yeshua loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus .
43011006	However , when He heard that Lazarus was sick , He stayed where He was for two more days .
43011007	Then after this , He said to His disciples , “ Let’s go up to Judea again . ”
43011008	“ Rabbi , ” the disciples say to Him , “ just now the Judean leaders were trying to stone You ! And You’re going back there again ? ”
43011009	Yeshua answered , “ Aren’t there twelve hours in the day ? If a man walks in the day , he doesn’t stumble , because he sees the light of the world .
43011010	But if a man should walk around at night , he stumbles , because the light is not in him . ”
43011011	After He said this , He tells them , “ Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep , but I’m going there to wake him up . ”
43011012	So the disciples said to Him , “ Master , if he has fallen asleep , he will get better . ”
43011013	Now Yeshua had spoken about his death , but they thought He was talking about ordinary sleep .
43011014	Then Yeshua told them clearly , “ Lazarus is dead !
43011015	I’m glad for your sake I wasn’t there , so that you may believe . Anyway , let’s go to him ! ”
43011016	Then Thomas called the Twin said to the other disciples , “ Let’s go too , so that we may die with Him ! ”
43011017	So when Yeshua arrived , He discovered that Lazarus had been in the tomb already for four days .
43011018	Bethany was less than two miles from Jerusalem ,
43011019	and many of the Judeans had come to Martha and Miriam to console them about their brother .
43011020	When Martha heard that Yeshua was coming , she went out to meet Him ; but Miriam sat in the house .
43011021	Martha said to Yeshua , “ Master , if You had been here , my brother wouldn’t have died !
43011022	But I know , even now , that whatever You may ask of God , He will give You . ”
43011023	Yeshua said to her , “ Your brother will rise again . ”
43011024	Martha said to Him , “ I know , he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day . ”
43011025	Yeshua said to her , “ I am the resurrection and the life ! Whoever believes in Me , even if he dies , shall live .
43011026	And whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die . Do you believe this ? ”
43011027	She says to Him , “ Yes , Lord , I believe that you are the Messiah , Ben-Elohim who has come into the world . ”
43011028	After she said this , she left and secretly told her sister Miriam , “ The Teacher is here , and He’s calling for you . ”
43011029	As soon as Miriam heard , she quickly got up and was coming to Him .
43011030	Now Yeshua had not yet come into the village , but was still in the place where Martha had met Him .
43011031	The Judeans , who were with Miriam in the house and comforting her , seeing how quickly she got up and went out , followed her . They thought she was going to the tomb to weep there .
43011032	So when Miriam came to where Yeshua was , she saw Him and fell at His feet , saying to Him , “ Master , if You had been here , my brother would not have died ! ”
43011033	When Yeshua saw her weeping , and the Judeans who came with her weeping , He was deeply troubled in spirit and Himself agitated .
43011034	“ Where have you laid him ? ” He asked . “ Come and see , Master , ” they tell Him .
43011035	Yeshua wept .
43011036	So the Judeans said , “ See how He loved him ! ”
43011037	But some of them said , “ Couldn’t this One , who opened the eyes of the blind man , have also kept this man from dying ? ”
43011038	So Yeshua , again deeply troubled within Himself , comes to the tomb . It was a cave , and a stone was lying against it .
43011039	Yeshua says , “ Roll away the stone ! ” Martha , the dead man’s sister , said to Him , “ Master , by this time he stinks ! He’s been dead for four days ! ”
43011040	Yeshua says to her , “ Didn’t I tell you that if you believed , you would see the glory of God ? ”
43011041	So they rolled away the stone . Yeshua lifted up His eyes and said , “ Father , I thank you that you have heard Me .
43011042	I knew that You always hear Me ; but because of this crowd standing around I said it , so that they may believe that You sent Me . ”
43011043	And when He had said this , He cried out with a loud voice , “ Lazarus , come out ! ”
43011044	He who had been dead came out , wrapped in burial clothes binding his hands and feet , with a cloth over his face . And Yeshua tells them , “ Cut him loose , and let him go ! ”
43011045	Therefore many of the Judeans , who had come to Miriam and had seen what Yeshua had done , put their trust in Him .
43011046	But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Yeshua had done .
43011047	So the ruling kohanim and Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin . “ What are we doing ? ” they asked . “ This Man is performing many signs !
43011048	If we let Him go on like this , everyone will believe in Him , and the Romans will come and take away both our holy place and our nation . ”
43011049	But one of them , Caiaphas , who was kohen gadol that year , said to them , “ You know nothing !
43011050	You don’t take into account that it is better for you that one man die for the people rather than for the whole nation to be destroyed . ”
43011051	Now he did not say this by himself ; but as the kohen gadol that year , he prophesied that Yeshua would die for the nation .
43011052	And not for the nation only , but also so that He might gather together into one the scattered children of God .
43011053	So from that day on , they plotted to kill Him .
43011054	Therefore Yeshua no longer walked openly among the Judeans , but went from there to the country near the wilderness , to a city called Ephraim . He stayed there with His disciples .
43011055	Now the Jewish Passover was near ; and many people went up out of the regions to Jerusalem before Passover , to purify themselves .
43011056	So they were searching for Yeshua , saying to one another as they stood in the Temple , “ What do you think ? Won’t He come to the feast at all ? ”
43011057	Now the ruling kohanim and Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where He was , he should report it so that they might arrest Him .
43012001	Six days before Passover , Yeshua came to Bethany , where Lazarus was , whom Yeshua had raised from the dead .
43012002	So they prepared a dinner there for Yeshua . Martha was serving , and Lazarus was one of those reclining at the table with Him .
43012003	Then Miriam took a pound of very expensive oil of pure nard and anointed Yeshua’s feet , and she wiped His feet dry with her hair . Now the house was filled with the fragrance of the oil .
43012004	But Judah from Kriot , one of His disciples , the one who was about to betray Him , said ,
43012005	“ Why wasn’t this oil sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor ? ”
43012006	Now he said this not because he cared about the poor , but because he was a thief . Since he had the moneybox , he used to steal from what was put in it .
43012007	Therefore Yeshua said , “ Leave her alone ! She set it aside for the day of My burial .
43012008	You will always have the poor among you , but you will not always have Me . ”
43012009	Now a large crowd of Judeans knew He was there and came , not only for Yeshua but also to see Lazarus , whom He had raised from the dead .
43012010	So the ruling kohanim made plans to kill Lazarus also ,
43012011	because on account of him many of the Jewish people were going and putting their trust in Yeshua .
43012012	The next day , the huge crowd that had come up for the feast heard that Yeshua was coming to Jerusalem .
43012013	So they took palm branches and went out to meet Him , shouting , “ ‘ Hoshia-na ! Baruch ha-ba b’shem Adonai ! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord ! ’ The King of Israel ! ”
43012014	Finding a young donkey , Yeshua sat on it , as it is written ,
43012015	“ Fear not , Daughter of Zion ! Look ! Your King is coming , sitting on a donkey’s colt . ”
43012016	His disciples did not understand these things at first . But when Yeshua was glorified , then they remembered that these things were written about Him and that the crowd had done these things for Him .
43012017	So the crowd , which had been with Yeshua when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead , kept on telling everyone about it .
43012018	It was also for this reason that the crowd came out to meet Him , because they heard that He had performed this sign .
43012019	So the Pharisees said to each other , “ You see that you can’t do anything . Look , the whole world has taken off after Him ! ”
43012020	Now there were some Greeks among those who were going up to worship at the feast .
43012021	These came to Philip , who was from Bethsaida in the Galilee . “ Sir , ” they said , “ we want to see Yeshua . ”
43012022	Philip comes and tells Andrew ; Andrew and Philip come and tell Yeshua .
43012023	Yeshua answers them , saying , “ The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified !
43012024	Amen , amen I tell you , unless a grain of wheat falls to the earth and dies , it remains alone . But if it dies , it produces much fruit .
43012025	He who loves his life will lose it , and the one who hates his life in this world will keep it forever .
43012026	If any man serves Me , he must follow Me ; and where I am , there also will My servant be . If anyone serves Me , the Father will honor him .
43012027	“ Now My soul is troubled . And what shall I say ? ‘ Father , save Me from this hour ’ ? But it was for this reason I came to this hour .
43012028	Father , glorify Your name ! ” Then a voice came out of heaven , “ I have glorified it , and again I will glorify it ! ”
43012029	Therefore the crowd that was standing there and heard it was saying that it had thundered . Others were saying , “ An angel has spoken to Him . ”
43012030	Yeshua responded , “ This voice hasn’t come for My sake , but for yours .
43012031	Now is the judgment of this world ! Now the prince of this world will be driven out !
43012032	And as I am lifted up from the earth , I will draw all to Myself . ”
43012033	He said this to show the kind of death He was about to die .
43012034	The crowd answered Him , “ We’ve heard from Scripture that the Messiah remains forever . How can You say , ‘ The Son of Man must be lifted up ’ ? Who is this Son of Man ? ”
43012035	Therefore Yeshua said to them , “ The light is with you for a little longer . Walk while you have the light , so that the darkness will not overtake you . The one who walks in darkness doesn’t know where he is going .
43012036	While you have the light , believe in the light so that you may become sons of light . ” Yeshua spoke these things , then left and hid Himself from them .
43012037	But even though He had performed so many signs before them , they weren’t trusting in Him .
43012038	This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet , who said , “ Adonai , who has believed our report ? To whom has the arm of Adonai been revealed ? ”
43012039	For this reason they could not believe , for Isaiah also said ,
43012040	“ He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts , so they might not see with their eyes nor understand with their hearts and turn back , and I would heal them . ”
43012041	Isaiah said these things because he saw His glory and spoke of Him .
43012042	Nevertheless many , even among the leaders , put their trust in Him . But because of the Pharisees , they were not confessing Yeshua , so they would not be thrown out of the synagogue ;
43012043	for they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God .
43012044	Yeshua cried out , “ Whoever puts trust in Me believes not in Me but in the One who sent Me !
43012045	And whoever beholds Me beholds the One who sent Me .
43012046	As light I have come into the world , so that everyone who trusts in Me should not remain in darkness .
43012047	“ If anyone hears My words but doesn’t keep them , I do not judge him ; for I came to save the world , not to judge the world .
43012048	The one who rejects Me and doesn’t receive My words has a judge ; the word I spoke will judge him on the last day .
43012049	For I did not speak on My own , but the Father Himself who sent Me has commanded Me what to say and speak .
43012050	And I know that His commandment is life everlasting . Therefore what I say , I say just as the Father has told Me . ”
43013001	Now it was just before the feast of Passover . Yeshua knew that His hour had come to depart from this world to the Father . Having loved His own who were in the world , He loved them until the end .
43013002	While the seder meal was happening , the devil had already put in the heart of Judah from Kriot that he should hand over Yeshua .
43013003	Yeshua knew that the Father had given all things into His hands , and that He had come from God and was returning to God .
43013004	So He gets up from the meal and lays aside His outer garment ; and taking a towel , He wrapped it around His waist .
43013005	Then He pours water into a basin . He began to wash the disciples’ feet , drying them with the towel wrapped around Him .
43013006	Then He comes to Simon Peter , who says to Him , “ Master , are You going to wash my feet ? ”
43013007	Yeshua responded , “ You don’t know what I am doing now , but you will understand after these things . ”
43013008	Peter said to Him , “ You shall never wash my feet ! ” Yeshua answered him , “ If I don’t wash you , you have no part with Me . ”
43013009	Simon Peter said to Him , “ Master , then not only my feet , but also my hands and my head ! ”
43013010	Yeshua said to him , “ He who has bathed has no need to wash , except the feet ; he is completely clean . And you all are clean , though not every one . ”
43013011	He knew who was betraying Him ; for this reason , He said , “ Not all of you are clean . ”
43013012	So after He had washed their feet and put His robe back on and reclined again , He said to them , “ Do you understand what I have done for you ?
43013013	You call Me ‘ Teacher ’ and ‘ Master ’ — and rightly you say , for I am .
43013014	So if I , your Master and Teacher , have washed your feet , you also ought to wash each other’s feet .
43013015	I have given you an example — you should do for each other what I have done for you .
43013016	“ Amen , amen I tell you , a servant isn’t greater than his master , and the one who is sent isn’t greater than the one who sent him .
43013017	If you know these things , you are blessed if you do them ! ”
43013018	“ I am not speaking to all of you — I know whom I have chosen . But so the Scripture may be fulfilled , ‘ He who eats My bread has lifted up his heel against Me . ’
43013019	From now on I am telling you , before it happens , so that when it happens you may believe that I am .
43013020	Amen , amen I tell you , he who receives the one I send , receives Me ; and he who receives Me , receives the One who sent Me . ”
43013021	After He said these things , Yeshua was agitated in spirit and testified , “ Amen , amen I tell you , one of you will betray Me ! ”
43013022	The disciples began looking at each other , perplexed — who was He talking about ?
43013023	One of His disciples , whom Yeshua loved , was reclining at His side .
43013024	Simon Peter nods to him and says , “ Ask Him — who is He talking about ? ”
43013025	Then he who leaned on Yeshua’s chest says to Him , “ Master , who is it ? ”
43013026	Yeshua answers , “ It’s the one I will give this bit of matzah to , after I dip it . ” After dipping the matzah , He takes it and gives it to Judah from Kriot , the son of Simon .
43013027	And with that bit , satan entered into him . Then Yeshua tells him , “ What you’re about to do , do quickly ! ”
43013028	But no one reclining at the table knew why Yeshua said this to him .
43013029	Since Judah had the moneybox , some thought Yeshua was telling him , “ Buy what we need for the feast , ” or that he should give something to the poor .
43013030	So after Judah received the bit of matzah , he left immediately . Now it was night .
43013031	Then when Judah had gone out , Yeshua said , “ Now the Son of Man is glorified , and God is glorified in Him !
43013032	If God is glorified in Him , God will glorify Him in Himself , and will glorify Him at once .
43013033	Little children , I am with you only a little longer . You will search for Me ; and just as I told the Judean leaders , so I say to you now , ‘ Where I am going , you cannot come . ’
43013034	“ I give you a new commandment , that you love one another . Just as I have loved you , so also you must love one another .
43013035	By this all will know that you are My disciples , if you have love for one another . ”
43013036	“ Master , where are You going ? ” Simon Peter said to Him . Yeshua answered , “ Where I am going , you cannot follow Me now ; but you will follow Me later . ”
43013037	Peter said to Him , “ Master , why can’t I follow You now ? I’ll lay down my life for You ! ”
43013038	Yeshua answers , “ Will you lay down your life for Me ? Amen , amen I tell you , before the rooster crows , you will deny Me three times ! ”
43014001	“ Do not let your heart be troubled . Trust in God ; trust also in Me .
43014002	In My Father’s house there are many dwelling places . If it were not so , would I have told you that I am going to prepare a place for you ?
43014003	If I go and prepare a place for you , I will come again and take you to Myself , so that where I am you may also be .
43014004	And you know the way to where I am going . ”
43014005	Thomas said to Him , “ Master , we don’t know where You are going . How can we know the way ? ”
43014006	Yeshua said to him , “ I am the way , the truth , and the life ! No one comes to the Father except through Me .
43014007	If you have come to know Me , you will know My Father also . From now on , you do know Him and have seen Him . ”
43014008	Philip said to Him , “ Master , show us the Father , and it is enough for us . ”
43014009	Yeshua said to him , “ Have I been with you for so long a time , and you haven’t come to know Me , Philip ? He who has seen Me has seen the Father . How can you say , ‘ Show us the Father ’ ?
43014010	Don’t you believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me ? The words I say to you , I do not speak on My own ; but the Father dwelling in Me does His works .
43014011	Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me — or at least believe because of the works themselves .
43014012	“ Amen , amen I tell you , he who puts his trust in Me , the works that I do he will do ; and greater than these he will do , because I am going to the Father .
43014013	And whatever you ask in My name , that I will do , so that the Father may be glorified in the Son .
43014014	If you ask Me anything in My name , I will do it . ”
43014015	“ If you love Me , you will keep My commandments .
43014016	I will ask the Father , and He will give you another Helper so He may be with you forever —
43014017	the Ruach of truth , whom the world cannot receive , because it does not behold Him or know Him . You know Him , because He abides with you and will be in you .
43014018	I will not abandon you as orphans ; I will come to you .
43014019	In a little while , the world will no longer behold Me , but you will behold Me . Because I live , you also will live !
43014020	“ In that day , you will know that I am in My Father , you are in Me , and I am in you .
43014021	He who has My commandments and keeps them is the one who loves Me . He who loves Me will be loved by My Father , and I will love him and reveal Myself to him . ”
43014022	Judah ( not the one from Kriot ) said to Him , “ Master , what has happened , that You are about to reveal Yourself to us and not the world ? ”
43014023	Yeshua answered and said to him , “ If anyone loves Me , he will keep My word . My Father will love him , and We will come to him and make Our dwelling with him .
43014024	He who does not love Me does not keep My words . And the word you hear is not Mine , but the Father’s who sent Me .
43014025	These things I have spoken to you while dwelling with you .
43014026	But the Helper , the Ruach ha-Kodesh whom the Father will send in My name , will teach you everything and remind you of everything that I said to you .
43014027	“ Shalom I leave you , My shalom I give to you ; but not as the world gives ! Do not let your heart be troubled or afraid .
43014028	You’ve heard Me say , ‘ I am going away and I am coming back to you . ’ If you loved Me , you would rejoice that I am going to the Father , because the Father is greater than I .
43014029	I have told you now before it happens , so that when it happens you may believe !
43014030	“ I will not talk with you much longer , for the ruler of this world is coming . He has nothing on Me .
43014031	But in order that the world may know that I love the Father , I do exactly as the Father commanded Me . “ Get up , let’s go from here ! ”
43015001	“ I am the true vine , and My Father is the gardener .
43015002	Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit , He takes away ; and every branch that bears fruit , He trims so that it may bear more fruit .
43015003	You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you .
43015004	Abide in Me , and I will abide in you . The branch cannot itself produce fruit , unless it abides on the vine . Likewise , you cannot produce fruit unless you abide in Me .
43015005	“ I am the vine ; you are the branches . The one who abides in Me , and I in him , bears much fruit ; for apart from Me , you can do nothing .
43015006	If anyone does not abide in Me , he is thrown away like a branch and is dried up . Such branches are picked up and thrown into the fire and burned .
43015007	“ If you abide in Me and My words abide in you , ask whatever you wish , and it shall be done for you .
43015008	In this My Father is glorified , that you bear much fruit and so prove to be My disciples . ”
43015009	“ Just as the Father has loved Me , I also have loved you . Abide in My love !
43015010	If you keep My commandments , you will abide in My love , just as I have kept My Father’s commandments and abide in His love .
43015011	These things I have spoken to you so that My joy may be in you , and your joy may be full .
43015012	“ This is My commandment , that you love one another just as I have loved you .
43015013	No one has greater love than this : that he lay down his life for his friends .
43015014	You are My friends if you do what I command you .
43015015	“ I am no longer calling you servants , for the servant does not know what his master is doing . Now I have called you friends , because everything I have heard from My Father I have made known to you .
43015016	“ You did not choose Me , but I chose you . I selected you so that you would go and produce fruit , and your fruit would remain . Then the Father will give you whatever you ask in My name .
43015017	“ These things I command you , so that you may love one another . ”
43015018	“ If the world hates you , know that it has hated Me before you .
43015019	If you were of the world , the world would love you as its own . But you are not of the world , since I have chosen you out of the world ; therefore the world hates you .
43015020	“ Remember the word I spoke to you : ‘ A servant is not greater than his master . ’ If they persecuted Me , they will persecute you also . If they kept My word , they will keep yours also .
43015021	“ But all these things they will do to you for the sake of My name , because they do not know the One who sent Me .
43015022	If I had not come and spoken to them , they would have no sin . But now they have no excuse for their sin .
43015023	“ He who hates Me also hates My Father .
43015024	If I had not done works among them that no one else did , they would have no sin . But now they have seen and have hated both Me and My Father .
43015025	So is fulfilled the word written in their Scripture , ‘ They hated Me for no reason . ’
43015026	“ When the Helper comes — whom I will send to you from the Father , the Ruach of truth who goes out from the Father — He will testify about Me .
43015027	And you also testify , because you have been with Me from the beginning . ”
43016001	“ I have spoken these things to you so that you may be kept from stumbling .
43016002	They will throw you out of the synagogues . Yes , an hour is coming when whoever kills you will think he is offering service to God .
43016003	They will do these things because they have never known the Father or Me .
43016004	But I have spoken these things to you so that when their hour comes , you may remember that I told you of them . I did not tell you these things from the beginning , because I was with you . ”
43016005	“ But now I am going to the One who sent Me , and not one of you is asking Me , ‘ Where are you going ? ’
43016006	Because I have spoken these things to you , grief has filled your heart .
43016007	But I tell you the truth , it is to your advantage that I go away ! For if I do not go away , the Helper will not come to you ; but if I go , I will send Him to you .
43016008	“ When He comes , He will convict the world about sin , righteousness , and judgment :
43016009	concerning sin , because they do not believe in Me ;
43016010	concerning righteousness , because I am going to the Father and you will no longer see Me ;
43016011	and concerning judgment , because the ruler of this world has been judged .
43016012	“ I still have much more to tell you , but you cannot handle it just now .
43016013	But when the Spirit of truth comes , He will guide you into all the truth . He will not speak on His own ; but whatever He hears , He will tell you . And He will declare to you the things that are to come .
43016014	He will glorify Me , because He will take from what is Mine and declare it to you .
43016015	Everything that the Father has is Mine . For this reason I said the Ruach will take from what is Mine and declare it to you . ”
43016016	“ A little while , and you will no longer see Me ; and again in a little while , you will see Me . ”
43016017	Then some of His disciples said to one other , “ What does He mean by telling us , ‘ A little while , and you will no longer see Me ; and again in a little while , you will see Me ’ ? And , ‘ Because I am going to the Father ’ ? ”
43016018	They kept on saying , “ What’s this He’s saying , ‘ A little while ’ ? We don’t know what He’s talking about ! ”
43016019	Yeshua knew that they wanted to question Him , so He said to them , “ Are you asking each other about this , that I said , ‘ A little while , and you will no longer see Me ; and again in a little while , you will see Me ’ ?
43016020	Amen , amen I tell you , you will weep and mourn , but the world will celebrate . You will be filled with sorrow , but your sorrow will turn to joy !
43016021	“ When a woman is in labor , she has pain because her hour has come . But when she gives birth to the child , she no longer remembers the anguish , because of the joy that a human being has been born into the world .
43016022	So also you have sorrow now ; but I will see you again , and your heart will rejoice , and no one will take your joy away from you !
43016023	“ In that day , you will ask Me nothing . Amen , amen I tell you , whatever you ask the Father in My name , He will give you .
43016024	Up to now , you have not asked for anything in My name . Ask and you will receive , so that your joy may be full .
43016025	“ These things I have spoken to you in metaphors . An hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in metaphors , but will tell you plainly about the Father .
43016026	In that day , you will ask in My name — and I’m not telling you that I will ask the Father on your behalf .
43016027	For the Father Himself loves you , because you have loved Me and have believed that I came forth from God .
43016028	I came forth from the Father and have come into the world . Again I am leaving the world and going to the Father . ”
43016029	His disciples say , “ See , now You’re speaking plainly and not in metaphors .
43016030	Now we know that You know everything and have no need to be asked anything . By this we believe that You came forth from God . ”
43016031	Yeshua answered them , “ Do you now believe ?
43016032	Look , the hour is coming — indeed has come — when you will be scattered , each to his own , and you will abandon Me . Yet I am not alone , because the Father is with Me .
43016033	These things I have spoken to you , so that in Me you may have shalom . In the world you will have trouble , but take heart ! I have overcome the world ! ”
43017001	Yeshua spoke these things ; then , lifting up His eyes to heaven , He said , “ Father , the hour has come . Glorify Your Son , so the Son may glorify You .
43017002	Even as You gave Him authority over all flesh , so may He give eternal life to all those You have given Him .
43017003	And this is eternal life , that they may know You , the only true God , and Yeshua the Messiah , the One You sent .
43017004	I glorified You on earth by finishing the work that You have given Me to do .
43017005	Now , Father , glorify Me together with Yourself , with the glory which I had with You before the world came to be . ”
43017006	“ I have made Your name known to the men of this world that You gave Me . They were Yours ; You gave them to Me , and they have kept Your word .
43017007	Now they have come to know that everything You have given Me is from You .
43017008	The words , which You gave Me , I have given to them . They received them and truly understood that I came from You , and they believed that You sent Me .
43017009	I ask on their behalf . Not on behalf of the world do I ask , but on behalf of those You have given Me , for they are Yours .
43017010	All Mine are Yours , and Yours are Mine ; and I have been glorified in them .
43017011	I am no longer in the world ; but they are in the world , and I am coming to You . Holy Father , keep them in Your name that You have given Me , so that they may be one just as We are .
43017012	While I was with them , I was keeping them in Your name that You have given Me . I guarded them , and not one of them was lost except the son of destruction , so that the Scripture would be fulfilled .
43017013	“ But now I am coming to You . I say these words while I am still in the world , so that they may have My joy made full in themselves .
43017014	I have given them Your word ; and the world hated them , because they are not of the world just as I am not of the world .
43017015	I am not asking that You take them out of the world , but that You keep them from the evil one .
43017016	They are not of the world , just as I am not of the world .
43017017	“ Make them holy in the truth . Your word is truth .
43017018	Just as You sent Me into the world , so I have sent them into the world .
43017019	And for their sakes I make Myself holy , so that they also may be made holy in truth . ”
43017020	“ I pray not on behalf of these only , but also for those who believe in Me through their message ,
43017021	that they all may be one . Just as You , Father , are in Me and I am in You , so also may they be one in Us , so the world may believe that You sent Me .
43017022	The glory that You have given to Me I have given to them , that they may be one just as We are one —
43017023	I in them and You in Me — that they may be perfected in unity , so that the world may know that You sent Me and loved them as You loved Me .
43017024	“ Father , I also want those You have given Me to be with Me where I am , so that they may see My glory — the glory You gave Me , for You loved Me before the foundation of the world .
43017025	Righteous Father , the world did not know You , but I knew You ; and these knew that You sent Me .
43017026	I made your Name known to them , and will continue to make it known , so that the love with which You loved Me may be in them , and I in them . ”
43018001	When Yeshua had said these things , He went out with His disciples across the Kidron Valley , where there was a garden , which He and His disciples entered .
43018002	Now Judah , who was betraying Him , also knew the place , because Yeshua had often met there with His disciples .
43018003	So Judah , having taken a band of soldiers and some officers from the ruling kohanim and Pharisees , comes there with lanterns , torches , and weapons .
43018004	Then Yeshua , knowing all the things coming upon Him , went forward . He said to them , “ Who are you looking for ? ”
43018005	“ Yeshua ha-Natzrati , ” they answered Him . Yeshua tells them , “ I am . ” Now Judah , the one betraying Him , was also standing with them .
43018006	So when Yeshua said to them , “ I am , ” they drew back and fell to the ground .
43018007	So again He asked them , “ Who are you looking for ? ” And they said , “ Yeshua ha-Natzrati . ”
43018008	Yeshua answered , “ I told you , I am ! If you’re looking for Me , let these men go their way . ”
43018009	This was so the word would be fulfilled that He spoke : “ I did not lose one of those You have given Me . ”
43018010	Then Simon Peter , who had a sword , drew it and struck the servant of the kohen gadol , and cut off his right ear . Now the servant’s name was Malchus .
43018011	So Yeshua said to Peter , “ Put the sword into the sheath ! The cup the Father has given Me — shall I never drink it ? ”
43018012	Then the band of soldiers , with the captain and the officers of the Judeans , seized Yeshua and tied Him up .
43018013	They led Him first to Annas , for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas , the kohen gadol that year .
43018014	Now Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Judean leaders that it was better for one man to die on behalf of the people .
43018015	Simon Peter was following Yeshua with another disciple . Now that disciple was known to the kohen gadol , so he went with Yeshua into the court of the kohen gadol .
43018016	But Peter was left standing outside by the door . So the other disciple , who was known to the kohen gadol , went out and spoke to the doorkeeper and brought Peter in .
43018017	The maidservant at the door says to Peter , “ Aren’t you one of this Man’s disciples too ? ” He says , “ No , I’m not . ”
43018018	The servants and officers were standing around a fire they had made , because it was cold and they were warming themselves . And Peter was also with them , standing and warming himself .
43018019	The kohen gadol then questioned Yeshua about His disciples and His teaching .
43018020	“ I have spoken openly to the world , ” Yeshua answered him . “ I always taught in the synagogues and the Temple , where all the Jewish people come together . I spoke nothing in secret .
43018021	Why question Me ? Ask those who have heard what I spoke to them . Look , they know what I said . ”
43018022	When He had said this , one of the officers standing nearby gave Yeshua a slap , saying , “ Is that the way you answer the kohen gadol ? ”
43018023	Yeshua answered him , “ If I have spoken wrongly , give evidence of the wrong ; but if rightly , why hit Me ? ”
43018024	Then Annas sent Him , still tied up , to Caiaphas , the kohen gadol .
43018025	Now Simon Peter was standing outside and warming himself . So they said to him , “ Aren’t you one of His disciples too ? ” He denied it and said , “ No , I’m not ! ”
43018026	One of the servants of the kohen gadol , a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off , said , “ Didn’t I see you in the garden with Him ? ”
43018027	Again Peter denied it , and immediately a rooster crowed .
43018028	Then they led Yeshua from Caiaphas to the Praetorium . It was early . They themselves did not enter the Praetorium , so they would not become unclean but might eat the Passover .
43018029	Therefore Pilate came out to them and said , “ What charge do you bring against this man ? ”
43018030	They answered , “ If He weren’t an evildoer , we wouldn’t have handed Him over to you . ”
43018031	Then Pilate said to them , “ Take Him yourselves , and judge Him by your Torah ! ” The Judean leaders responded , “ We are not authorized to put anyone to death . ”
43018032	This happened so that the word Yeshua spoke would be fulfilled , signifying what kind of death He was about to die .
43018033	So Pilate went back into the Praetorium , called for Yeshua , and asked Him , “ Are you the King of the Jews ? ”
43018034	“ Are you saying this on your own , ” Yeshua answered , “ or did others tell you about Me ? ”
43018035	Pilate answered , “ I’m not a Jew , am I ? Your own nation and ruling kohanim handed You over to me ! What have You done ? ”
43018036	Yeshua answered , “ My kingdom is not of this world . If My kingdom were of this world , then My servants would be fighting so that I wouldn’t be handed over to the Judean leaders . But as it is , My kingdom is not from here . ”
43018037	So Pilate said to Him , “ Are you a king , then ? ” Yeshua answered , “ You say that I am a king . For this reason I was born , and for this reason I came into the world , so that I might testify to the truth . Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice . ”
43018038	Pilate said to Him , “ What is truth ? ” After he said this , he went out again to the Judean leaders . He said to them , “ I find no case against Him .
43018039	But it’s your custom that I release someone for you at Passover . So do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews ? ”
43018040	They shouted back , “ Not this One , but Bar-Abba ! ” Now Bar-Abba was a revolutionary .
43019001	Then Pilate took Yeshua and had Him scourged .
43019002	The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on His head , and dressed Him in a purple robe .
43019003	They kept coming up to Him , saying , “ Hail , King of the Jews ! ” and slapping Him over and over .
43019004	Pilate came out again . He said to them , “ Look , I’m bringing Him out to you , to let you know that I find no case against Him . ”
43019005	So Yeshua came out , wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe . “ Behold , the Man ! ” Pilate said to them .
43019006	When the ruling kohanim and officers saw Him , they yelled out , “ Execute Him ! Execute Him ! ” Pilate said to them , “ Take Him yourselves and execute Him ! For I don’t find a case against Him . ”
43019007	The Judean leaders answered him , “ We have a law , and according to the Torah He must die , because He claimed to be Ben-Elohim ! ”
43019008	When Pilate heard this word , he became even more fearful .
43019009	He went into the Praetorium again and said to Yeshua , “ Where are You from ? ” But Yeshua gave him no answer .
43019010	So Pilate said to Him , “ You aren’t speaking to me ? Don’t You know that I have the authority to release You , and I have the authority to crucify You ? ”
43019011	Yeshua answered , “ You would have no authority over Me if it hadn’t been given to you from above . For this reason , the one who handed Me over to you has the greater sin . ”
43019012	Pilate tried to let Him go after this ; but the Judean leaders cried out , saying , “ If you release this Man , you are no friend of Caesar . Everyone who makes himself a king opposes Caesar ! ”
43019013	So when Pilate heard these words , he brought Yeshua out and sat down on the judge’s seat at a place called the Stone Pavement ( but in Aramaic , Gabbatha ) .
43019014	It was the Day of Preparation for Passover , about the sixth hour . And Pilate said to the Judean leaders , “ Behold , your king ! ”
43019015	They shouted back , “ Take Him away ! Take Him away ! Execute Him ! ” Pilate said to them , “ Should I execute your king ? ” The ruling kohanim answered , “ We have no king but Caesar ! ”
43019016	Finally , Pilate handed Yeshua over to be crucified .
43019017	Then they took Yeshua . He went out , carrying His own crossbar , to the Place of a Skull , which in Aramaic is called Golgotha .
43019018	There they crucified Him , and with Him two others , one on each side and Yeshua in between .
43019019	Pilate also wrote a sign and put it on the execution stake . It was written , “ YESHUA HA-NATZRATI , THE KING OF THE JEWS . ”
43019020	Many Judeans read this sign , because the place where Yeshua was executed was near the city ; it was written in Hebrew , Latin , and Greek .
43019021	The ruling kohanim of the Judeans were saying to Pilate , “ Don’t write , ‘ The King of the Jews , ’ but that He said , ‘ I am King of the Jews . ’ ”
43019022	“ What I have written , I have written , ” Pilate answered .
43019023	So the soldiers , when they executed Yeshua , took His outer garments and made four parts , a part for each soldier . They took His tunic also , but it was seamless , woven top to bottom in one piece .
43019024	So they said to one another , “ Let’s not tear it , but cast lots for it to see whose it will be . ” This was so the Scripture would be fulfilled , “ They divided My garments among them , and for My clothing they cast lots . ” So the soldiers did these things .
43019025	Standing near the execution stake of Yeshua were His mother , His mother’s sister , Miriam the wife of Clopas , and Miriam from Magdala .
43019026	Yeshua saw His mother and the disciple whom He loved standing nearby . He tells His mother , “ Woman , behold , your son ! ”
43019027	Then He tells the disciple , “ Behold , your mother ! ” From that very hour , the disciple took her into his own home .
43019028	After this , when Yeshua knew that all things were now completed , to fulfill the Scripture He said , “ I am thirsty . ”
43019029	A jar full of sour wine was sitting there , so they put a sponge soaked with the sour wine on a hyssop branch and brought it to His mouth .
43019030	When Yeshua tasted the sour wine , He said , “ It is finished ! ” And He bowed His head and gave up His spirit .
43019031	It was the Day of Preparation , and the next day was a festival Shabbat . So that the bodies should not remain on the execution stake during Shabbat , the Judean leaders asked Pilate to have the legs broken and to have the bodies taken away .
43019032	So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and then the other who had been executed with Yeshua .
43019033	Now when they came to Yeshua and saw that He was already dead , they did not break His legs .
43019034	But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear , and immediately blood and water came out .
43019035	He who has seen it has testified , and his testimony is true . He knows that he is telling the truth , so that you also may believe .
43019036	These things happened so that the Scripture would be fulfilled , “ Not a bone of His shall be broken . ”
43019037	And again another Scripture says , “ They shall look on Him whom they have pierced . ”
43019038	After these things , Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate if he could take Yeshua’s body away . Joseph was a disciple of Yeshua , but secretly for fear of the Judean leaders . Pilate gave permission , so Joseph came and took the body away .
43019039	Nicodemus , who had first visited Yeshua at night , also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes , about a hundred pounds .
43019040	Then they took the body of Yeshua and wrapped it in linen with the spices , as is the Jewish burial custom .
43019041	Now in the place where He was executed , there was a garden . In the garden was a new tomb where no one had yet been buried .
43019042	Because it was the Jewish Day of Preparation and the tomb was nearby , they laid Yeshua there .
43020001	Early in the morning on the first day of the week , while it is still dark , Miriam from Magdala comes to the tomb . She sees that the stone had been rolled away from the tomb .
43020002	So she comes running to Simon Peter and the other disciple , the one Yeshua loved . She tells them , “ They’ve taken the Master out of the tomb , and we don’t know where they’ve put Him ! ”
43020003	Then Peter and the other disciple set out , going to the tomb .
43020004	The two were running together , but the other disciple outran Peter and arrived at the tomb first .
43020005	Leaning in , he sees the linen strips lying there . But he didn’t go in .
43020006	Then Simon Peter comes following him , and he entered the tomb . He looks upon the linen strips lying there ,
43020007	and the face cloth that had been on His head . It was not lying with the linen strips , but was rolled up in a place by itself .
43020008	So then the other disciple , who had reached the tomb first , also entered . He saw and believed .
43020009	For they did not yet understand from Scripture that Yeshua must rise from the dead .
43020010	So the disciples went back to their own homes .
43020011	But Miriam stood outside the tomb weeping . As she was weeping , she bent down to look into the tomb .
43020012	She sees two angels in white sitting , one at the head and one at the feet , where Yeshua’s body had been lying .
43020013	“ Woman , why are you crying ? ” they say to her . She says to them , “ Because they took away my Master , and I don’t know where they’ve put Him . ”
43020014	After she said these things , she turned around . And she sees Yeshua standing there . Yet she didn’t know that it was Yeshua .
43020015	Yeshua says to her , “ Woman , why are you weeping ? Who are you looking for ? ” Thinking He’s the gardener , she says to Him , “ Sir , if You’ve carried Him away , tell me where You’ve put Him , and I will take Him away . ”
43020016	Yeshua says to her , “ Miriam ! ” Turning around , she says to Him in Aramaic , “ Rabboni ! ” ( which means Teacher ) .
43020017	Yeshua says to her , “ Stop clinging to Me , for I have not yet gone up to the Father . Go to My brothers and tell them , ‘ I am going up to My Father and your Father , to My God and your God . ’ ”
43020018	Miriam from Magdala comes , announcing to the disciples , “ I’ve seen the Lord , ” and what He had said to her .
43020019	It was evening on that day , the first of the week . When the doors were locked where the disciples were , for fear of the Judean leaders , Yeshua came and stood in their midst ! And He said to them , “ Shalom aleichem ! ”
43020020	After He said this , He showed them His hands and His side . Then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord .
43020021	Yeshua said to them again , “ Shalom aleichem ! As the Father has sent Me , I also send you . ”
43020022	And after He said this , He breathed on them . And He said to them , “ Receive the Ruach ha-Kodesh !
43020023	If you forgive anyone’s sins , they are forgiven ; but if you hold back , they are held back . ”
43020024	One of the Twelve , Thomas called the Twin , was not with them when Yeshua came .
43020025	The other disciples were saying to him , “ We’ve seen the Lord ! ” But he replied to them , “ Unless I see the nail prints in His hands , and put my finger into the mark of the nails , and put my hand in His side , I will never believe ! ”
43020026	Eight days later the disciples were again inside , and Thomas was with them . Yeshua comes , despite the locked doors . He stood in their midst and said , “ Shalom aleichem ! ”
43020027	Then He said to Thomas , “ Put your finger here , and look at My hands . Reach out your hand and put it into My side . Stop doubting and believe ! ”
43020028	Thomas answered and said to Him , “ My Lord and my God ! ”
43020029	Yeshua said to Him , “ Because you have seen Me , you have believed ? Blessed are the ones who have not seen and yet have believed ! ”
43020030	Yeshua performed many other signs in the presence of the disciples , which are not written in this book .
43020031	But these things have been written so that you may believe that Yeshua is Mashiach Ben-Elohim , and that by believing you may have life in His name .
43021001	After these things , Yeshua revealed Himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias . Now here is how He appeared .
43021002	Simon Peter , Thomas called the Twin , Nathanael of Cana in the Galilee , the sons of Zebedee , and two of the other disciples were together .
43021003	Simon Peter said to them , “ I’m going fishing . ” “ We’re coming with you too , ” they said . They went out and got into the boat , and that night they caught nothing .
43021004	At dawn , Yeshua stood on the beach ; but the disciples didn’t know that it was Yeshua .
43021005	So Yeshua said to them , “ Boys , you don’t happen to have any fish , do you ? ” “ No , ” they answered Him .
43021006	He said to them , “ Throw the net off the right side of the boat , and you’ll find some . ” So they threw the net , and they were not able to haul it in because of the great number of fish .
43021007	Therefore the disciple whom Yeshua loved said to Peter , “ It’s the Lord ! ” When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord , he tied his outer garment around himself — for he was stripped down for work — and threw himself into the sea .
43021008	But the other disciples came in the boat from about two hundred cubits offshore , dragging the net full of fish .
43021009	So when they got out onto the land , they saw a charcoal fire with fish placed on it , and bread .
43021010	Yeshua said to them , “ Bring some of the fish you’ve just caught . ”
43021011	Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net to shore . There were 153 fish , many of them big ; but the net was not broken .
43021012	Yeshua said to them , “ Come , have breakfast . ” None of the disciples dared ask Him , “ Who are You ? ” — knowing it was the Lord .
43021013	Yeshua comes and takes the bread and gives it to them , and likewise the fish .
43021014	This was now the third time that Yeshua was revealed to the disciples after He was raised from the dead .
43021015	When they had finished breakfast , Yeshua said to Simon Peter , “ Simon , son of John , do you love Me more than these ? ” “ Yes , Lord , ” he said to Him , “ You know that I love you . ” He said to him , “ Feed My lambs ! ”
43021016	He said to him again a second time , “ Simon , son of John , do you love Me ? ” “ Yes , Lord , ” he said , “ You know that I love You . ” He said to him , “ Take care of My sheep ! ”
43021017	He said to him a third time , “ Simon , son of John , do you love Me ? ” Peter was grieved because He said to him for a third time , “ Do you love Me ? ” And he said to Him , “ Lord , You know everything ! You know that I love You ! ” Yeshua said to him , “ Feed My sheep ! ”
43021018	“ Amen , amen I tell you , when you were younger , you used to dress yourself and walk wherever you wanted ; but when you grow old , you will stretch out your hands , and someone else will dress you and carry you where you do not want to go . ”
43021019	Now this He said to indicate by what kind of death Peter was going to glorify God . And after this , Yeshua said to him , “ Follow Me ! ”
43021020	Peter , turning around , sees the disciple following . This was the one whom Yeshua loved , who also had reclined against Yeshua’s chest at the seder meal and said , “ Master , who is the one who is betraying You ? ”
43021021	Seeing him , Peter said to Yeshua , “ Lord , what about him ? ”
43021022	Yeshua said to him , “ If I want him to remain until I come , what is that to you ? You follow Me ! ”
43021023	Therefore this saying went out among the brethren , that this disciple would not die . Yet Yeshua did not say to him that he would not die , but , “ If I want him to remain until I come , what is that to you ? ”
43021024	This is the disciple who is an eyewitness of these things and wrote these things . We know that his testimony is true .
43021025	There are also many other things that Yeshua did . If all of them were to be written one by one , I suppose that not even the world itself will have room for the books being written !
44001001	I wrote the first volume , Theophilus , about all that Yeshua began to do and teach —
44001002	up to the day He was taken up , after He had given orders by the Ruach ha-Kodesh to the shlichim He had chosen .
44001003	To them He showed Himself to be alive after His suffering through many convincing proofs , appearing to them for forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God .
44001004	Now while staying with them , He commanded them not to leave Jerusalem , but to wait for what the Father promised — which , He said , “ you heard from Me .
44001005	For John immersed with water , but you will be immersed in the Ruach ha-Kodesh not many days from now . ”
44001006	So when they gathered together , they asked Him , “ Lord , are You restoring the kingdom to Israel at this time ? ”
44001007	He said to them , “ It is not your place to know the times or seasons which the Father has placed under His own control .
44001008	But you will receive power when the Ruach ha-Kodesh has come upon you ; and you will be My witnesses in Jerusalem , and through all Judah , and Samaria , and to the end of the earth . ”
44001009	After saying all this — while they were watching — He was taken up , and a cloud received Him out of their sight .
44001010	While they were staring into heaven as He went up , suddenly two men stood with them in white clothing .
44001011	They said , “ Men of Galilee , why do you keep standing here staring into heaven ? This Yeshua , who was taken up from you into heaven , will come in the same way as you saw Him go into heaven . ”
44001012	Then they returned to Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives ( which is near Jerusalem , a Shabbat day’s journey ) .
44001013	When they had entered , they went up to the upper room where they were staying — Peter and John and Jacob and Andrew ; Philip and Thomas , Bartholomew and Matthew ; Jacob son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot and Judah son of Jacob .
44001014	All these with one mind were continuing together in prayer — along with the women and Miriam , Yeshua’s mother , and His brothers .
44001015	In those days , Peter stood up among the brethren ( the number of names all together was about a hundred and twenty ) and said ,
44001016	“ Brethren , the Scripture had to be fulfilled , which the Ruach ha-Kodesh foretold by the mouth of David , concerning Judah — who became a guide to those who seized Yeshua .
44001017	For he was counted among us and received his share of this office . ”
44001018	( Now this man Judah bought a field with the reward of his wickedness . Falling headfirst , he burst open in the middle and his intestines splattered out .
44001019	And it became known to all those living in Jerusalem , so in their own language that field was called Akeldama — that is , ‘ Field of Blood . ’ )
44001020	For it is written in the Book of Psalms , ‘ Let his dwelling place become desolate , and let there be no one living in it ’ and ‘ Let another take his position . ’
44001021	“ Therefore one of the men who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Yeshua went in and out among us —
44001022	beginning with His immersion by John until the day He was taken up from us — must become a witness with us of His resurrection . ”
44001023	So they nominated two — Joseph , called Barsabbas ( also called Justus ) , and Matthias .
44001024	And they prayed and said , “ You , O Lord , who knows the hearts of all men , show us which of these two You have chosen
44001025	to take the position in this office as shaliach , from which Judah turned aside to go to his own place . ”
44001026	Then they cast lots for them , and the lot fell upon Matthias ; and he was added to the eleven shlichim .
44002001	When the day of Shavuot had come , they were all together in one place .
44002002	Suddenly there came from heaven a sound like a mighty rushing wind , and it filled the whole house where they were sitting .
44002003	And tongues like fire spreading out appeared to them and settled on each one of them .
44002004	They were all filled with the Ruach ha-Kodesh and began to speak in other tongues as the Ruach enabled them to speak out .
44002005	Now Jewish people were staying in Jerusalem , devout men from every nation under heaven .
44002006	And when this sound came , the crowd gathered . They were bewildered , because each was hearing them speaking in his own language .
44002007	And they were amazed and astonished , saying , “ All these who are speaking — aren’t they Galileans ?
44002008	How is it that we each hear our own birth language ?
44002009	Parthians and Medes and Elamites and those living in Mesopotamia , Judea and Cappadocia , Pontus and Asia ,
44002010	Phrygia and Pamphylia , Egypt and parts of Libya toward Cyrene , and visitors from Rome
44002011	( both Jewish people and proselytes ) , Cretans and Arabs — we hear them declaring in our own tongues the mighty deeds of God ! ”
44002012	And they were all amazed and perplexed , saying to each other , “ What does this mean ? ”
44002013	Others , poking fun , were saying , “ They are full of sweet new wine ! ”
44002014	But Peter , standing with the Eleven , raised his voice and addressed them : “ Fellow Judeans and all who are staying in Jerusalem , let this be known to you , and pay attention to my words .
44002015	These men are not drunk , as you suppose — for it’s only the third hour of the day !
44002016	But this is what was spoken about through the prophet Joel :
44002017	‘ And it shall be in the last days , ’ says God , ‘ that I will pour out My Ruach on all flesh . Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy , your young men shall see visions , and your old men shall dream dreams .
44002018	Even on My slaves , male and female , I will pour out My Ruach in those days , and they shall prophesy .
44002019	And I will give wonders in the sky above and signs on the earth beneath — blood , and fire , and smoky vapor .
44002020	The sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the great and glorious Day of Adonai comes .
44002021	And it shall be that everyone who calls on the name of Adonai shall be saved . ’
44002022	“ Men of Israel , hear these words ! Yeshua ha-Natzrati — a Man authenticated to you by God with mighty deeds and wonders and signs God performed through Him in your midst , as you yourselves know —
44002023	this Yeshua , given over by God’s predetermined plan and foreknowledge , nailed to the cross by the hand of lawless men , you killed .
44002024	But God raised Him up , releasing Him from the pains of death , since it was impossible for Him to be held by it .
44002025	For David says about Him , ‘ I saw Adonai always before me , for He is at my right hand so that I might not be shaken .
44002026	Therefore my heart was glad and my tongue rejoiced ; moreover , my body also will live in hope ,
44002027	because You will not abandon my soul to Sheol or let Your Holy One see decay .
44002028	You have made known to me the paths of life ; You will fill me with joy in Your presence . ’
44002029	“ Brethren , I can confidently tell you that the patriarch David died and was buried — his tomb is with us to this day .
44002030	So because he was a prophet and knew God had sworn with an oath to him to seat one of his descendants on his throne ,
44002031	David saw beforehand and spoke of Messiah’s resurrection — that He was not abandoned to Sheol , and His body did not see decay .
44002032	“ This Yeshua God raised up — we all are witnesses !
44002033	Therefore , being exalted to the right hand of God and receiving from the Father the promise of the Ruach ha-Kodesh , He poured out this — what you now see and hear .
44002034	For David did not ascend into the heavens ; yet he himself says , ‘ Adonai said to my Lord , “ Sit at my right hand ,
44002035	until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet . ” ’
44002036	“ Therefore let the whole house of Israel know for certain that God has made Him — this Yeshua whom you had crucified — both Lord and Messiah ! ”
44002037	Now when they heard this , they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the rest of the shlichim , “ Fellow brethren , what shall we do ? ”
44002038	Peter said to them , “ Repent , and let each of you be immersed in the name of Messiah Yeshua for the removal of your sins , and you will receive the gift of the Ruach ha-Kodesh .
44002039	For the promise is for you and your children , and for all who are far away — as many as Adonai our God calls to Himself . ”
44002040	With many other words he warned them and kept urging them , saying , “ Save yourselves from this twisted generation ! ”
44002041	So those who received his message were immersed , and that day about three thousand souls were added .
44002042	They were devoting themselves to the teaching of the shlichim and to fellowship , to breaking bread and to prayers .
44002043	Fear lay upon every soul , and many wonders and signs were happening through the shlichim .
44002044	And all who believed were together , having everything in common .
44002045	They began selling their property and possessions and sharing them with all , as any had need .
44002046	Day by day they continued with one mind , spending time at the Temple and breaking bread from house to house . They were sharing meals with gladness and sincerity of heart ,
44002047	praising God and having favor with all the people . And every day the Lord was adding to their number those being saved .
44003001	Now Peter and John were going up to the Temple at the ninth hour , the time of prayer .
44003002	A man lame from birth was being carried — every day they used to put him at the Temple gate called Beautiful , so he could beg for tzedakah from those entering the Temple .
44003003	When he saw Peter and John about to go into the Temple , he began asking to receive tzedakah .
44003004	But Peter , along with John , looked straight at him and said , “ Look at us ! ”
44003005	So he gave them his attention , expecting to receive something from them .
44003006	But Peter said , “ Silver and gold I do not have , but what I do have I give to you — in the name of Yeshua ha-Mashiach ha-Natzrati , get up and walk ! ”
44003007	Then grabbing him by the right hand , he raised him up ; and immediately the man’s feet and ankles were made strong .
44003008	Jumping up , he stood and began walking ; and he went with them into the Temple , walking and leaping and praising God !
44003009	Now all the people saw him walking and praising God .
44003010	They began to realize he was the one who used to sit begging for tzedakah at the Beautiful Gate of the Temple , and they were filled with wonder and astonishment over what had happened to him .
44003011	While he was clinging to Peter and John , all the people together came running toward them in the place called Solomon's Portico .
44003012	But when Peter saw , he responded to the people , “ Men of Israel , why are you amazed at this ? Why do you stare at us — as if by our own power or godliness we had made this man walk ?
44003013	The God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob , the God of our fathers , has glorified His Servant Yeshua — the One you handed over and disowned before Pilate , though he had decided to release Him .
44003014	But you rejected the Holy and Righteous One and asked for a murderer to be granted to you .
44003015	You killed the Author of life — the One God raised from the dead ! We are witnesses of it .
44003016	Now through faith in the name of Yeshua , His name has strengthened this man whom you see and know . Indeed , the faith through Yeshua has given this man perfect health in front of you all .
44003017	“ Now brethren , I know that you acted in ignorance , just as your leaders did .
44003018	But what God foretold through the mouth of all His prophets — that His Messiah was to suffer — so He has fulfilled .
44003019	Repent , therefore , and return — so your sins might be blotted out ,
44003020	so times of relief might come from the presence of Adonai and He might send Yeshua , the Messiah appointed for you .
44003021	Heaven must receive Him , until the time of the restoration of all the things that God spoke about long ago through the mouth of His holy prophets .
44003022	Moses said , ‘ Adonai your God will raise up for you a Prophet like me from among your brethren . Hear and obey Him in all that He shall say to you .
44003023	And it shall be that every soul that will not listen to that Prophet shall be completely cut off from the people . ’
44003024	Indeed , all the prophets who have spoken from Samuel on have announced these days .
44003025	You are the sons of the prophets and also of the covenant that God cut with your fathers , saying to Abraham , ‘ In your seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed . ’
44003026	God raised up His Servant and sent Him first to you , to bless you all by turning each of you from your wicked ways . ”
44004001	As Peter and John were speaking to the people , the kohanim and the captain of the Temple and the Sadducees came up to them .
44004002	They were indignant because Peter and John were teaching the people and announcing in Yeshua the resurrection of the dead .
44004003	So they grabbed them and put them in jail until the next day , for it was already evening .
44004004	But many who heard the message believed , and the number of the men came to about five thousand .
44004005	On the next day , the rulers and elders and Torah scholars were gathered together in Jerusalem .
44004006	Annas the kohen gadol was there , and Caiaphas and John and Alexander , and all those who were of high-priestly descent .
44004007	When they had placed Peter and John in their midst , they began to inquire , “ By what power or in what name did you do this ? ”
44004008	Then Peter , filled with the Ruach ha-Kodesh , said to them , “ Rulers and elders of the people !
44004009	If we are on trial today for a mitzvah done for a sick man , as to how this fellow was healed ,
44004010	let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel , that by the name of Yeshua ha-Mashiach ha-Natzrati — whom you had crucified , whom God raised from the dead — this one stands before you whole .
44004011	This Yeshua is ‘ the stone — rejected by you , the builders — that has become the chief cornerstone . ’
44004012	There is salvation in no one else , for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved ! ”
44004013	Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John and figured out they were laymen without training , they were amazed . They began to realize that these men had been with Yeshua .
44004014	But seeing the healed man standing with them , they had nothing to say in response .
44004015	When they had ordered Peter and John to go out of the council chamber , they began to confer with one another ,
44004016	saying , “ What shall we do with these men ? For indeed , it’s obvious to everyone living in Jerusalem that a remarkable miracle has happened through them , and we cannot deny it .
44004017	But so it won’t spread any further among the people , let’s warn them not to speak anymore to anyone in this name . ”
44004018	So they called them in and ordered them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Yeshua .
44004019	But Peter and John replied , “ Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God , you decide .
44004020	For we cannot stop speaking about what we have seen and heard . ”
44004021	After threatening them again , they let them go — finding no way they could punish them on account of the people , because they all were glorifying God for what had happened .
44004022	For the man in whom this miracle of healing had happened was more than forty years old .
44004023	As soon as they were released , Peter and John went to their own people and reported all that the ruling kohanim and elders had said to them .
44004024	When they heard it , they lifted their voices together to God and said , “ O Sovereign Master , ‘ You made heaven and earth and the sea , and everything in them . ’
44004025	You said by the Ruach ha-Kodesh , through the mouth of our father David Your servant , ‘ Why did the nations rage and the peoples plot foolish things ?
44004026	The kings of the earth took their stand and the rulers were gathered together against Adonai and against His Anointed One . ’
44004027	“ For truly both Herod and Pontius Pilate , along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel , were gathered together in this city against Your holy Servant Yeshua , whom You anointed .
44004028	They did whatever Your hand and Your purpose predetermined to happen .
44004029	And now , Lord , look at their threats , and grant Your servants to speak Your word with utmost courage —
44004030	while You stretch out Your hand to heal , and signs and wonders take place through the name of Your holy Servant Yeshua . ”
44004031	When they had prayed , the place where they were gathered was shaken . And they were all filled with the Ruach ha-Kodesh and began to speak the word of God with boldness .
44004032	Now the whole group of those who believed was one in heart and mind . No one would say anything he owned was his own , but they had everything in common .
44004033	With great power the shlichim were giving witness to the resurrection of the Lord Yeshua , and abundant favor was upon them all .
44004034	No one among them was needy , for all who were owners of lands or houses would sell them and bring the proceeds
44004035	and set them at the feet of the shlichim . And the proceeds were distributed according to the need each one had .
44004036	Now Joseph , also called Barnabas by the shlichim ( which is translated Son of Encouragement ) , was a Levite and native of Cyprus .
44004037	He sold a field that he owned and brought the money and laid it at the feet of the shlichim .
44005001	On the other hand , a man named Ananias together with his wife , Sapphira , sold a property .
44005002	He kept back some of the proceeds , with his wife’s full knowledge , and brought part of it and set it at the feet of the shlichim .
44005003	But Peter said , “ Ananias , why has satan filled your heart to lie to the Ruach ha-Kodesh and keep back part of the proceeds of the land ?
44005004	While it remained unsold , it was your own , wasn’t it ? And after it was sold , wasn’t it at your disposal ? How did this deed get into your heart ? You haven’t lied to men but to God . ”
44005005	As soon as he heard these words , Ananias fell down and died . Great fear came upon all who heard about it .
44005006	The young men got up and wrapped him in a shroud , then carried him out and buried him .
44005007	After an interval of about three hours , his wife came in , not knowing what had happened .
44005008	Peter responded to her , “ Tell me if you sold the land for this much . ” She said , “ Yes , for that much . ”
44005009	Then Peter said to her , “ How did you agree to test the Ruach Adonai ? Look , the feet of those who buried your husband are at the door — they will carry you out , too ! ”
44005010	Immediately she fell down at his feet and died . When the young men came back in , they found her dead and carried her out and buried her beside her husband .
44005011	And great fear came over the whole community and all who heard these things .
44005012	Meanwhile , through the hands of the shlichim many signs and wonders were happening among the people . And they were all together in Solomon's Portico .
44005013	But no one else dared to join them , though the people continued to think highly of them .
44005014	Yet more than ever those trusting in the Lord were added — large numbers of men and women .
44005015	They even carried the sick into the streets and laid them on stretchers and cots , so that when Peter passed by at least his shadow might fall on some of them .
44005016	Crowds were also gathering from the towns around Jerusalem , bringing those who were sick or tormented by unclean spirits , and they were all being healed .
44005017	But the kohen gadol rose up , and all those with him ( that is , the sect of the Sadducees ) , and they were filled with jealousy .
44005018	They grabbed the shlichim and put them in a public jail .
44005019	But during the night an angel of Adonai opened the prison doors , and leading them out he said ,
44005020	“ Go , stand in the Temple and speak to the people the whole message about this Life . ”
44005021	Now when they heard that , they entered the Temple at daybreak and began teaching . When the kohen gadol and those with him arrived , they called together the Sanhedrin , even the council of elders of B’nei-Israel , and sent to the prison to have the prisoners brought in .
44005022	But when the officers came , they did not find them in the prison . So they returned and reported ,
44005023	saying , “ We found the prison locked with maximum security and the guards standing at the doors ; but when we opened up , we found no one inside . ”
44005024	When the captain of the Temple and the ruling kohanim heard these words , they were perplexed about them , wondering where this would lead .
44005025	But someone came and reported to them , “ The men you put in prison are standing in the Temple and teaching the people ! ”
44005026	Then the captain went off with the officers and brought the shlichim — but not with force , because they feared they might be stoned by the people .
44005027	When they had brought them , they placed them before the Sanhedrin . The kohen gadol questioned them ,
44005028	saying , “ We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name — and look , you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching , and you intend to bring on us the blood of this Man ! ”
44005029	Peter and the shlichim replied , “ We must obey God rather than men .
44005030	The God of our fathers raised up Yeshua , whom you seized and had crucified .
44005031	This One God exalted at His right hand as Leader and Savior , to give repentance to Israel and removal of sins .
44005032	And we are witnesses of these events — as is the Ruach ha-Kodesh , whom God has given to those who obey Him . ”
44005033	Now when they heard this , they became enraged and wanted to kill them .
44005034	But a certain Pharisee named Gamaliel , a teacher of the Torah respected by all the people , stood up in the Sanhedrin and gave orders to put the men outside for a little while .
44005035	Then he said to them , “ Men of Israel , be careful what you are about to do with these men .
44005036	For some time ago Theudas rose up , claiming to be somebody ; and a number of men , maybe four hundred , joined up with him . He was killed , and all who followed him were scattered and came to nothing .
44005037	After this fellow , Judah the Galilean rose up in the days of the census and got people to follow him . He also perished , and all who followed him were scattered .
44005038	So now I tell you , stay away from these men and leave them alone . For if this plan or undertaking is of men , it will come to an end ;
44005039	but if it is of God , you will not be able to stop them . You might even be found fighting against God . ” They took his advice ,
44005040	called in the shlichim , flogged them , ordered them not to continue speaking in the name of Yeshua , and let them go .
44005041	So they left the presence of the Sanhedrin , rejoicing that they were considered worthy to be dishonored on account of His name .
44005042	And every day , in the Temple and from house to house , they never stopped teaching and proclaiming Yeshua as the Messiah .
44006001	Now in those days , when the disciples were multiplying , grumbling arose among the Hellenists against the Hebrews , because their widows were being overlooked in the daily support .
44006002	So the Twelve called together the whole group of the disciples and said , “ It is not right for us to neglect the word of God in order to serve tables .
44006003	So , brethren , select from among you seven reputable men , full of the Ruach and wisdom , whom we may put in charge of this duty .
44006004	But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the service of the Word . ”
44006005	The statement pleased the whole group ; and they chose Stephen , a man full of faith and the Ruach ha-Kodesh , and Philip , Prochorus , Nicanor , Timon , Parmenas , and Nicolas , a proselyte from Antioch .
44006006	They placed these men before the shlichim ; and after praying , they laid hands on them .
44006007	The word of God kept on spreading , and the number of disciples in Jerusalem greatly multiplied ; even a great number of the kohanim were becoming obedient to the faith .
44006008	Now Stephen , full of grace and power , was doing great wonders and signs among the people .
44006009	But some men from what was called the Synagogue of the Freedmen — both Cyrenians and Alexandrians , as well as some from Cilicia and Asia — stood up and began arguing with Stephen .
44006010	But they could not withstand the wisdom and the Ruach by whom he was speaking .
44006011	Then they secretly instigated men into saying , “ We have heard him speaking blasphemous words against Moses and against God ! ”
44006012	They also incited the people , the elders , and the Torah scholars ; and they rushed at Stephen , seized him , and led him away to the Sanhedrin .
44006013	They set up false witnesses who said , “ This man never stops speaking words against this holy place and the Torah .
44006014	For we have heard him saying that this Yeshua ha-Natzrati will destroy this place and change the customs that Moses handed down to us . ”
44006015	Watching him intently , everyone who was sitting in the Sanhedrin saw that his face was like the face of an angel .
44007001	Then the kohen gadol said , “ Are these things so ? ”
44007002	Stephen declared , “ Brethren and fathers , listen . The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia , before he lived in Haran .
44007003	He said to him , ‘ Leave your country and your relatives , and come here to the land that I will show you . ’
44007004	Then he left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran . From there , after his father died , God moved him to this land where you now live .
44007005	He gave him no inheritance in it — not even a foothold — yet He promised ‘ to give it to him as a possession to him and to his descendants after him , ’ even though he had no child .
44007006	“ But God spoke in this way , that his ‘ descendants would be foreigners in a land belonging to others , and they would enslave and mistreat them for four hundred years .
44007007	But I will judge the nation they serve as slaves , ’ God said , ‘ and afterward they shall come out and serve Me in this place . ’
44007008	“ Then God gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision . So he became the father of Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day , and so Isaac with Jacob , and Jacob with the twelve patriarchs .
44007009	The patriarchs became jealous of Joseph and sold him into Egypt . Yet God was with him .
44007010	He rescued him out of all his troubles and granted him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh , king of Egypt , who made him governor over Egypt and all his household .
44007011	“ Famine and great suffering came over all Egypt and Canaan , and our fathers could find no food .
44007012	But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt , he sent our fathers there the first time .
44007013	On the second visit , Joseph made himself known to his brothers , and his family became known to Pharaoh .
44007014	So Joseph sent and called for Jacob and all his relatives — seventy-five persons .
44007015	Jacob went down to Egypt and died , he and our fathers .
44007016	They were carried to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor in Shechem .
44007017	“ But as the time drew near for the promise God had sworn to Abraham , the people increased and multiplied in Egypt —
44007018	until ‘ there arose another king over Egypt who knew nothing about Joseph . ’
44007019	Dealing with our people with cruel cunning , this king mistreated our fathers and forced them to abandon their infants so they would not survive .
44007020	“ At this time Moses was born — extraordinary before God . For three months he was nurtured in his father's house .
44007021	And when he was set outside , Pharaoh's daughter took him and raised him as her own son .
44007022	Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians , and he was powerful in his words and deeds .
44007023	“ When he was approaching forty years of age , it came into his heart to visit his brethren , B’nei-Israel .
44007024	When he saw one of them being treated unjustly , he went to the defense of the oppressed man and avenged him by striking down the Egyptian .
44007025	He was assuming that his brethren understood that by his hand God was delivering them , but they did not understand .
44007026	So on the next day he appeared to them as they were fighting . He tried to reconcile them in shalom , saying , ‘ Men , you are brothers . Why do you wrong one another ? ’
44007027	“ But the one doing wrong to his neighbor pushed him away , saying , ‘ Who appointed you ruler and judge over us ?
44007028	You don’t want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday , do you ? ’
44007029	At this remark , Moses fled and became an exile in the land of Midian , where he became the father of two sons .
44007030	“ When forty years had passed , an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai in the flame of a burning bush .
44007031	When Moses saw it , he was amazed at the sight . But when he came up to look , there came the voice of Adonai :
44007032	‘ I am the God of your fathers , the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob . ’ “ Moses trembled in fear and did not dare to look .
44007033	But Adonai said to him , ‘ Take the sandals off your feet , for the place where you are standing is holy ground .
44007034	I have surely seen the oppression of my people in Egypt and have heard their groaning , and I have come down to deliver them . Now come — let Me send you to Egypt . ’
44007035	“ This Moses — whom they rejected , saying , ‘ Who appointed you as ruler and judge ? ’ — is the one whom God sent as both ruler and redeemer , by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush .
44007036	This man led them out , performing wonders and signs in the land of Egypt , and at the Red Sea , and in the wilderness for forty years .
44007037	This is the Moses who said to B’nei-Israel , ‘ God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your brethren . ’
44007038	“ This is the one who was in the community in the wilderness , with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai , and with our fathers . He received living words to pass on to us .
44007039	Our fathers did not want to be obedient to him , but shoved him aside . And in their hearts they turned back to Egypt ,
44007040	saying to Aaron , ‘ Make gods for us who will go before us . For this Moses who led us out of the land of Egypt — we have no idea what has happened to him . ’
44007041	“ And they made a calf in those days , offered a sacrifice to the idol , and were rejoicing in the works of their hands .
44007042	But God turned and gave them over to serve the host of heaven , just as it is written in the book of the Prophets : ‘ It was not to Me that you brought sacrifices and offerings for forty years in the wilderness , was it , O House of Israel ?
44007043	You also took up the tent of Moloch and the star of your god Rephan , the images you made to worship . And I will deport you beyond Babylon . ’
44007044	“ Our fathers had the Tent of Witness in the wilderness — just as the One speaking to Moses had directed him to make it according to the design he had seen .
44007045	Our fathers received it in turn and brought it in with Joshua when they took possession of the land of the nations that God drove out before our fathers . So it remained until the days of David ,
44007046	who found favor in God’s sight . He asked to find a dwelling place for the God of Jacob .
44007047	But Solomon built a house for Him .
44007048	However , the Elyon does not dwell in man-made houses . As the prophet says ,
44007049	‘ Heaven is My throne , and the earth is the footstool of My feet . What kind of house will you build for Me , says Adonai , or what is the place of My rest ?
44007050	Did not My Hand make all these things ? ’
44007051	“ O you stiff-necked people ! You uncircumcised of heart and ears ! You always resist the Ruach ha-Kodesh ; just as your fathers did , you do as well .
44007052	Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute ? They killed the ones who foretold the coming of the Righteous One . Now you have become His betrayers and murderers —
44007053	you who received the Torah by direction of angels and did not keep it ! ”
44007054	When they heard these things , they became enraged and began gnashing their teeth at him .
44007055	But Stephen , full of the Ruach ha-Kodesh , gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God — and Yeshua standing at the right hand of God .
44007056	And he said , “ Look , I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God ! ”
44007057	But they covered their ears ; and crying out with a loud voice , they rushed at him with one impulse .
44007058	Driving him out of the city , they began stoning him , and the witnesses laid down their cloaks at the feet of a young man named Saul .
44007059	They went on stoning Stephen as he was calling out , “ Lord Yeshua , receive my spirit ! ”
44007060	Then he fell on his knees and cried out with a loud voice , “ Lord , do not hold this sin against them ! ” After he said this , he died .
44008001	Now Saul was in agreement with Stephen’s execution . On that day a great persecution arose against Messiah’s community in Jerusalem , and they were all scattered throughout the region of Judea and Samaria , except the shlichim .
44008002	Some devout men buried Stephen and mourned deeply for him .
44008003	But Saul was destroying Messiah’s community , entering house after house ; and dragging off men and women , he was throwing them into prison .
44008004	Now those who had been scattered went around proclaiming the Word .
44008005	Philip went down to the main city of Samaria and proclaimed the Messiah to them .
44008006	The crowds were paying close attention to what Philip was saying — as they both heard and saw the signs that he was doing .
44008007	For unclean spirits were coming out of many who were plagued , shrieking with a loud voice . Many paralyzed and crippled were healed also .
44008008	So there was great joy in that city .
44008009	Now a man named Simon had been practicing magic in the city and astonishing the people of Samaria , saying he was someone great .
44008010	They all were paying special attention to him , saying , “ This man is the power of God that is called ‘ Great . ’ ”
44008011	And they kept paying attention to him , because for a long time he had astonished them with his magical arts .
44008012	But when they believed Philip proclaiming the Good News about the kingdom of God and the name of Messiah Yeshua , both men and women were immersed .
44008013	Even Simon himself believed ; and after being immersed , he continued with Philip . And when he saw signs and great miracles happening , he was continually amazed .
44008014	Now when the shlichim in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the message of God , they sent Peter and John to them .
44008015	They came down and prayed for them to receive the Ruach ha-Kodesh .
44008016	For He had not yet come upon them ; they had only been immersed in the name of the Lord Yeshua .
44008017	Then they began laying their hands on them , and they were receiving the Ruach ha-Kodesh .
44008018	Now when Simon saw that the Ruach ha-Kodesh was given through the laying on of hands by the shlichim , he offered them money ,
44008019	saying , “ Give this power to me , too — so that anyone on whom I lay hands may receive the Ruach ha-Kodesh . ”
44008020	Peter said to him , “ May your silver go to ruin , and you with it — because you thought you could buy God’s gift with money !
44008021	You have no part or share in this matter , because your heart is not right before God .
44008022	Therefore repent of this wickedness of yours , and pray to the Lord that , if possible , the intent of your heart may be pardoned .
44008023	For I see in you the poison of bitterness and the bondage of unrighteousness ! ”
44008024	Simon replied , “ Pray for me , so that none of what you have said may come upon me . ”
44008025	So when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord , they returned to Jerusalem , proclaiming the Good News to many Samaritan villages .
44008026	Now an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip , saying , “ Get up , and go south on the road going down from Jerusalem to Gaza . ” ( This is a desert road . )
44008027	So he got up and went . And behold , an Ethiopian eunuch — an official who was responsible for all the treasure of Candace , queen of the Ethiopians — had traveled to Jerusalem to worship
44008028	and was now returning . Sitting in his chariot , he was reading the prophet Isaiah .
44008029	The Ruach said to Philip , “ Go , catch up with this chariot . ”
44008030	Philip ran up and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah and said , “ Do you understand what you are reading ? ”
44008031	“ How can I , ” he said , “ unless someone guides me ? ” So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him .
44008032	Now the passage of Scripture that he was reading was this : “ He was led as a sheep to slaughter ; and as a lamb before its shearer is silent , so He opens not His Mouth .
44008033	In His humiliation justice was denied Him . Who shall recount His generation ? For His life is taken away from the earth . ”
44008034	The eunuch replied to Philip , “ Please tell me , who is the prophet talking about — himself or someone else ? ”
44008035	Then Philip opened his mouth , and beginning with this Scripture he proclaimed the Good News about Yeshua .
44008036	Now as they were going down the road , they came to some water . The eunuch said , “ Look , water ! What’s to prevent me from being immersed ? ”
44008038	He ordered the chariot to stop . They both got down into the water , Philip and the eunuch , and Philip immersed him .
44008039	When they came up out of the water , the Ruach Adonai snatched Philip away . The eunuch saw no more of him , for he went on his way , rejoicing .
44008040	But Philip found himself at Azotus . And as he passed through , he kept proclaiming the Good News to all the towns until he came to Caesarea .
44009001	Now Saul , still breathing out threats and murder against the Lord’s disciples , went to the kohen gadol .
44009002	He requested letters of introduction from him to the synagogues in Damascus , so that if he found any men or women belonging to the Way , he might bring them as prisoners to Jerusalem .
44009003	As he was traveling , approaching Damascus , suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him .
44009004	Falling to the ground , he heard a voice saying to him , “ Saul , Saul , why are you persecuting Me ? ”
44009005	“ Who are You , Lord ? ” Saul said . “ I am Yeshua — whom you are persecuting .
44009006	But get up and go into the city , and you will be told what you must do . ”
44009007	The men travelling with him stood speechless , hearing the voice but seeing no one .
44009008	Saul got up from the ground — but opening his eyes , he could see nothing . They led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus .
44009009	For three days he could not see , and he did not eat or drink .
44009010	Now there was a disciple named Ananias in Damascus . The Lord said to him , “ Ananias . ” He said , “ Here I am , Lord . ”
44009011	The Lord said to him , “ Get up and go to the street named Straight , and ask in the house of Judah for someone from Tarsus named Saul . For look , he is praying ;
44009012	and in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias coming in and laying his hands on him , so that he might regain his sight . ”
44009013	But Ananias answered , “ Lord , I have heard from many about this man — how much harm he has done to your kedoshim in Jerusalem .
44009014	And here he has authority from the ruling kohanim to tie up all who call on Your name . ”
44009015	But the Lord said to him , “ Go , for he is a choice instrument to carry My name before nations and kings and B’nei-Israel .
44009016	For I will show him how much he must suffer for My name’s sake . ”
44009017	So Ananias left and entered into the house . Laying hands on Saul , he said , “ Brother Saul , the Lord — Yeshua , the One who appeared to you on the road by which you were coming — has sent me , so that you might regain your sight and be filled with the Ruach ha-Kodesh . ”
44009018	Immediately , something like scales fell from Saul’s eyes , and he regained his sight . Then he got up and was immersed ;
44009019	and when he had taken food , he was strengthened . Now for several days , he was with the disciples in Damascus .
44009020	Immediately he began proclaiming Yeshua in the synagogues , saying , “ He is Ben-Elohim . ”
44009021	All those hearing him were amazed . They were saying , “ Isn’t this the one who made havoc in Jerusalem for all those who call on this name ? And hasn’t he come here to bring them as prisoners before the ruling kohanim ? ”
44009022	But Saul kept growing stronger , and he was confounding the Jewish people living in Damascus by proving that Yeshua is the Messiah .
44009023	When many days had passed , these Jewish people plotted to kill him —
44009024	but their plot became known to Saul . They were watching the gates day and night , to kill him .
44009025	But the disciples took Saul by night and let him down over the wall , lowering him in a basket .
44009026	When Saul arrived in Jerusalem , he made attempts to join up with the disciples — but they were all afraid of him , not believing that he was a disciple .
44009027	But Barnabas took him in and brought him to the shlichim . He described to them how Saul had seen the Lord on the road and the Lord had spoken to him , and how he had spoken boldly in the name of Yeshua .
44009028	So Saul was with them , going in and out in Jerusalem , speaking boldly in the name of the Lord .
44009029	He was speaking and arguing with the Hellenists , but they were trying to kill him .
44009030	When the brethren found out , they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus .
44009031	So Messiah’s community throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had shalom and was built up . Walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Ruach ha-Kodesh , it kept multiplying .
44009032	Peter went here and there among them all . He came down as well to the kedoshim living in Lydda .
44009033	There he found a man named Aeneas , who had been bedridden for eight years — he was paralyzed .
44009034	Peter said to him , “ Aeneas , Messiah Yeshua heals you . Get up and pack up your bed . ” Immediately , he got up !
44009035	All who lived in Lydda and the Plain of Sharon saw him , and they turned to the Lord .
44009036	In Joppa , there was a disciple named Tabitha ( which translates as Dorcas ) . She was full of mitzvot and tzedakah , which she continually did .
44009037	In those days , she became ill and died . When they had washed her for burial , they placed her in an upstairs room .
44009038	Since Lydda was near Joppa , the disciples — hearing that Peter was there — sent two men to him , begging him , “ Please come to us without delay ! ”
44009039	So Peter got up and went with them . When he arrived , they took him to the upstairs room . All the widows were crying , showing all the tunics and other clothing Dorcas had made while she was with them .
44009040	But Peter sent them all outside , and he got down on his knees and prayed . Then , turning to the body , he said “ Tabitha , get up ! ” She opened her eyes , and when she saw Peter , she sat up .
44009041	He gave her his hand and raised her up . Then he called the kedoshim and widows and presented her alive .
44009042	It became known throughout Joppa , and many came to believe in the Lord .
44009043	So it happened that Peter stayed on in Joppa for several days with Simon , a tanner .
44010001	Now in Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius , a centurion of what was called the Italian Cohort .
44010002	He was a devout man , revering God with all his household . He gave tzedakah generously to the people and prayed to God continually .
44010003	About the ninth hour of the day , he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God coming and saying to him , “ Cornelius ! ”
44010004	He stared at him in terror and said , “ What is it , Lord ? ” The angel said to him , “ Your prayers and tzedakah have gone up as a memorial offering before God .
44010005	Now send men to Joppa and call for Simon , also named Peter .
44010006	He is being entertained as a guest by Simon the tanner , whose house is beside the sea . ”
44010007	When the angel speaking to him had left , he called two of his servants and a soldier from among those attached to his command .
44010008	After he explained everything to them , he sent them to Joppa .
44010009	The next day , as the soldiers were traveling and approaching the city , Peter went up to the rooftop to pray , at about the sixth hour .
44010010	Now he became very hungry and wanted to eat ; but while they were preparing something , he fell into a trance .
44010011	He saw the heavens opened , and something like a great sheet coming down , lowered by its four corners to the earth .
44010012	In it were all sorts of four-footed animals and reptiles and birds of the air .
44010013	A voice came to him , “ Get up , Peter . Kill and eat . ”
44010014	But Peter said , “ Certainly not , Lord ! For never have I eaten anything unholy or unclean . ”
44010015	Again a voice came to him , a second time : “ What God has made clean , you must not consider unholy . ”
44010016	This happened three times , and the sheet was immediately taken up to heaven .
44010017	Now while Peter was puzzling about what the vision he had seen might mean , behold , the men sent by Cornelius found Simon’s house and appeared before the gate .
44010018	They called out and began to ask whether Simon , also called Peter , was staying in this place as a guest .
44010019	Now while Peter was mulling over the vision , the Ruach said to him , “ Look here , three men are looking for you .
44010020	But get up , go downstairs , and go with them without hesitating , because I Myself have sent them . ”
44010021	Going down to the men , Peter said , “ Here , I’m the one you’re looking for . What is the reason for your coming ? ”
44010022	And they said , “ Cornelius , a centurion , a righteous and God-fearing man well-spoken of by all the Jewish people , was directed by a holy angel to summon you to his house and to hear a message from you . ”
44010023	So Peter invited them in to be his guests . The next day he got up and went with them , and some of the brethren from Joppa accompanied him .
44010024	The following day he entered Caesarea . Cornelius was waiting for them and had called together his relatives and close friends .
44010025	As Peter entered , Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshiped him .
44010026	But Peter pulled him up , saying , “ Stand up ! I too am just a man . ”
44010027	Talking with him , Peter went inside and found many people gathered .
44010028	He said to them , “ You yourselves know that it is not permitted for a Jewish man to associate with a non-Jew or to visit him . Yet God has shown me that I should call no one unholy or unclean .
44010029	So I came without objection when I was sent for . I ask , then , what is the reason why you sent for me ? ”
44010030	Cornelius declared , “ Four days ago at this hour , I was praying minchah in my house . Suddenly , a man stood in front of me in shining clothes .
44010031	He says , ‘ Cornelius , your prayer has been heard and your tzedakah remembered before God .
44010032	Therefore send to Joppa and ask for Simon , who is also called Peter . He is staying in the house of Simon the tanner , by the sea . ’
44010033	So I sent for you immediately , and you have been kind enough to come . Now then , we are all here before God to hear all that you have been commanded by the Lord . ”
44010034	Then Peter opened his mouth and said , “ I truly understand that God is not one to show favoritism ,
44010035	but in every nation the one who fears Him and does what is right is acceptable to Him .
44010036	You know the message He sent to B’nei-Israel , proclaiming shalom through Messiah Yeshua — He is Lord of all .
44010037	You know the message that has spread throughout all Judea , beginning from Galilee after the immersion that John proclaimed .
44010038	You know how God anointed Y eshua of Natzeret with the Ruach ha-Kodesh and power — how He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil , because God was with Him .
44010039	We are witnesses to all He did , both in the Judean countryside and in Jerusalem . They put Him to death by hanging Him on a tree ,
44010040	but God raised Him up on the third day and caused Him to be visible —
44010041	not to all the people , but to us , witnesses who were chosen beforehand by God . We ate and drank with Him after He rose from the dead .
44010042	And He commanded us to proclaim to the people and to testify that He is the One ordained by God as Judge of the living and the dead .
44010043	All the prophets testify about Him — that everyone who puts his trust in Him receives forgiveness of sins through His name . ”
44010044	While Peter was still speaking these words , the Ruach ha-Kodesh fell on all those hearing the message .
44010045	All the circumcised believers who came with Peter were astonished , because the gift of the Ruach ha-Kodesh had been poured out even on the Gentiles .
44010046	For they were hearing them speaking in tongues and magnifying God . Then Peter answered ,
44010047	“ Can anyone refuse water for these to be immersed , who have received the Ruach ha-Kodesh just as we did ? ”
44010048	So he commanded them to be immersed in the name of Messiah Yeshua . Then they asked him to stay for a few days .
44011001	Now the shlichim and brethren throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God .
44011002	But when Peter went up to Jerusalem , those of the circumcision took issue with him ,
44011003	saying , “ You went to uncircumcised men and ate with them ! ”
44011004	So Peter began explaining to them point by point , saying ,
44011005	“ I was in the city of Joppa praying , and in a trance I saw a vision — something like a great sheet coming down , being lowered from heaven by its four corners , and it came right to me .
44011006	I looked inside , considering it carefully , and saw four-footed creatures of the earth , wild animals , reptiles , and birds of the air .
44011007	I also heard a voice saying , ‘ Get up , Peter . Kill and eat . ’
44011008	“ But I said , ‘ Certainly not , Lord ! For never has anything unholy or unclean entered my mouth . ’
44011009	But a voice from heaven answered a second time , ‘ What God has made clean , you must not consider unholy . ’
44011010	This happened three times , and then everything was pulled up to heaven .
44011011	“ At that very moment , three men arrived at the house where we were , sent to me from Caesarea .
44011012	The Ruach told me to go with them without hesitating . These six brethren also went with me , and we entered the man's house .
44011013	He reported to us how he had seen an angel standing in his house and saying , ‘ Send to Joppa and bring Simon called Peter .
44011014	He will speak words to you by which you will be saved — you and all your household . ’
44011015	“ As I began to speak , the Ruach ha-Kodesh fell on them , just as on us at the beginning .
44011016	And I remembered the word of the Lord , how He used to say , ‘ John immersed with water , but you will be immersed in the Ruach ha-Kodesh . ’
44011017	Therefore if God gave them the same gift as also to us after we put our trust in the Lord Messiah Yeshua , who was I to stand in God’s way ? ”
44011018	When they heard this they became quiet , and they glorified God , saying , “ Then even to the Gentiles God has granted repentance leading to life ! ” Discipling in Diaspora
44011019	Now those scattered because of the persecution that happened in connection with Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch , telling the message only to Judeans .
44011020	However , there were some of them , men of Cyprus and Cyrene , who came to Antioch and began speaking to the Hellenists also , proclaiming the Lord Yeshua .
44011021	The hand of the Lord was with them , and a great number who believed turned to the Lord .
44011022	News about these things reached the ears of the community in Jerusalem , and they sent Barnabas to Antioch .
44011023	When he arrived and saw the grace of God , he was thrilled . He encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with heartfelt devotion .
44011024	For Barnabas was a good man , full of the Ruach ha-Kodesh and faith . And a large number was added to the Lord .
44011025	Then Barnabas left for Tarsus to look for Saul ,
44011026	and when he had found him , he brought him to Antioch . For a whole year they met together with Messiah’s community and taught a large number . Now it was in Antioch that the disciples were first called “ Christianoi . ”
44011027	Now in these days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch .
44011028	One of them , named Agabus , stood up and predicted through the Ruach that there was going to be a great famine over all the world . ( This took place during the reign of Claudius . )
44011029	So the disciples decided to send relief to those brethren living in Judea , each according to his ability .
44011030	This they did , sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul .
44012001	Now at that time Herod the king seized some from Messiah’s community to do them harm .
44012002	He had Jacob , John's brother , put to death with the sword .
44012003	Seeing it pleased the Judean leaders , he proceeded to capture Peter as well . This was during the Days of Matzah .
44012004	After seizing him , he put him in prison , handing him over to four squads with four soldiers each to guard him . He was intending to bring him before the people after Passover .
44012005	So Peter was kept in prison , but prayer for him was being offered fervently to God by Messiah’s community .
44012006	Now that very night when Herod was about to bring him out , Peter was sleeping — bound with two chains between two soldiers , while guards before the gate were keeping watch over the prison .
44012007	Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared , and a light shone in the cell . He poked Peter on the side and woke him up , saying , “ Get up ! Quick ! ” And the chains fell off his hands .
44012008	Then the angel said to him , “ Get dressed and put on your sandals , ” and he did so . Then he tells him , “ Put on your cloak and follow me . ”
44012009	Peter went out and kept following him — he didn’t know that what was happening with the angel was real , but thought he was seeing a vision .
44012010	After they passed a first guard and a second , they came to the iron gate leading into the city . It opened for them by itself . They went out and walked along a narrow street . Suddenly the angel left him .
44012011	When Peter came to himself , he said , “ Now I know for real that the Lord has sent His angel and delivered me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Judean people were expecting . ”
44012012	When he realized this , he went to the house of Miriam , the mother of John ( also called Mark ) , where many were assembled together and praying .
44012013	When he knocked on the door of the entrance gate , a maid named Rhoda came to answer .
44012014	Although she recognized Peter's voice , out of joy she did not open the gate but ran in and announced that Peter was standing in front of the gate .
44012015	They said to her , “ You're crazy ! ” But she kept insisting it was so . But they were saying , “ It is his angel . ”
44012016	But Peter kept on knocking . When they opened the gate , they saw him and were amazed !
44012017	But he motioned with his hand for them to be silent , and he explained to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison . He said , “ Go tell these things to Jacob and the brethren . ” Then he left and went to another place .
44012018	When day came , there was no small commotion among the soldiers as to what had become of Peter .
44012019	After Herod made a search for him and did not find him , he interrogated the guards and commanded that they be led away to execution . Then he went down from Judea and stayed in Caesarea .
44012020	Now it happened that Herod was furious with the people of Tyre and Sidon . So they came to him , united . Having won over Blastus , the king’s personal aide , they began asking for peace — because their country was supplied with food from the king’s country .
44012021	On an appointed day , Herod donned his royal robes and , taking his seat upon the throne , began to make a speech to them .
44012022	The people were shouting , “ The voice of a god and not a human ! ”
44012023	Immediately , an angel of the Lord struck him down — because he did not give God the glory . And he was eaten by worms and died .
44012024	But the word of God kept on growing and multiplying .
44012025	And Barnabas and Saul returned to Jerusalem when they had fulfilled their service , taking along John ( who was also called Mark ) .
44013001	Now in the Antioch community , there were prophets and teachers : Barnabas , Simeon called Niger , Lucius the Cyrenian , Manaen ( brought up since childhood with Herod the Tetrarch ) , and Saul .
44013002	While they were serving the Lord and fasting , the Ruach ha-Kodesh said , “ Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them . ”
44013003	Then after fasting , praying , and laying hands on them , they sent them off .
44013004	So , sent out by the Ruach ha-Kodesh , they went down to Seleucia , and from there they sailed to Cyprus .
44013005	When they arrived at Salamis , they began to proclaim the word of God in the Jewish synagogues . They also had John as a helper .
44013006	When they had gone throughout the whole island as far as Paphos , they found a man who was a magician — a Jewish false prophet , whose name was Bar-Yeshua .
44013007	He was with the proconsul , Sergius Paulus , an intelligent man . This man summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God .
44013008	But Elymas the magician ( for so his name is translated ) was opposing them , seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith .
44013009	But Saul , who is also Paul , filled with the Ruach ha-Kodesh , fixed his gaze on him
44013010	and said , “ O you , full of all deceit and trickery , son of the devil , enemy of all righteousness — will you not stop making crooked the straight paths of the Lord ?
44013011	Now , behold , the hand of the Lord is upon you , and you shall be blind and not see the sun for awhile . ” Immediately , cloudiness and darkness fell upon him , and he went about seeking people to lead him by the hand .
44013012	When he saw what had happened , the proconsul believed , because he was astonished at the teaching about the Lord .
44013013	Setting sail from Paphos , Paul's company came to Perga in Pamphylia . John left them and returned to Jerusalem .
44013014	But they passed on from Perga and came to Antioch of Pisidia . Entering the synagogue on the Shabbat , they sat down .
44013015	After the reading of the Torah and the Prophets , the synagogue leaders sent to them , saying , “ Brethren , if you have any word of encouragement for the people , speak . ”
44013016	So Paul , standing up and motioning with his hand , said , “ Men of Israel and God-fearers , listen .
44013017	The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt , and with an outstretched arm He led them out of there .
44013018	For about forty years He put up with them in the wilderness .
44013019	And when He had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan , He gave their land as an inheritance —
44013020	all of this took about 450 years . After that , he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet .
44013021	Then they asked for a king , and God gave them Saul , son of Kish , of the tribe of Benjamin , for forty years .
44013022	After removing him , He raised up David to be their king . He also testified about him and said , ‘ I have found David , the son of Jesse , a man after My heart , who will do My will . ’
44013023	“ From this man’s seed , in keeping with His promise , God brought to Israel a Savior — Yeshua .
44013024	Before His coming , John had proclaimed an immersion of repentance to all the people of Israel .
44013025	As John was completing his service , he said , ‘ What do you suppose me to be ? I am not He . But behold , One is coming after me , whose sandal I’m not worthy to untie . ’
44013026	“ Brethren , sons of the family of Abraham and those among you who are God-fearers , it is to us the message of this salvation has been sent .
44013027	For those who live in Jerusalem and their rulers — not recognizing Him or the sayings of the Prophets that are read every Shabbat — fulfilled these words by condemning Him .
44013028	Though they found no charge worthy of a death sentence , they asked Pilate to have Him executed .
44013029	When they had carried out all that had been written about Him , they took Him down from the tree and laid Him in a tomb .
44013030	But God raised Him from the dead !
44013031	For many days He appeared to those who had come up from the Galilee to Jerusalem , who are now His witnesses to the people .
44013032	“ And we proclaim to you Good News — the promise to the fathers has arrived !
44013033	For God has fulfilled this promise to the children — to us — by raising up Yeshua , as it is also written in the second psalm : ‘ You are My Son . Today I have become Your Father . ’
44013034	“ But since He raised Him up from the dead , never to return to decay , He has spoken in this way , ‘ I will give you the holy and sure mercies of David . ’
44013035	Therefore He also says in another psalm , ‘ You will not permit Your Holy One to see decay . ’
44013036	For after David had served God’s purpose in his own generation , he went to sleep and was laid with his fathers and saw decay .
44013037	But the One whom God raised up did not see decay .
44013038	“ Therefore , let it be known to you , brethren , that through this One is proclaimed to you the removal of sins , including all those from which you could not be set right by the Torah of Moses .
44013039	Through this One everyone who keeps trusting is made righteous .
44013040	“ Be careful , then , so that what is said in the Prophets may not come upon you :
44013041	‘ Look , you scoffers , be amazed and vanish away . For I am doing a work in your days — a work you will never believe , even if someone tells it to you in detail . ’ ”
44013042	As Paul and Barnabas were going out , the people kept begging them to speak these things to them the next Shabbat .
44013043	When the synagogue meeting broke up , many of the Jewish people and God-fearing inquirers followed Paul and Barnabas , who were speaking with them and trying to persuade them to continue in the grace of God .
44013044	The following Shabbat , almost the entire city came together to hear the word of the Lord .
44013045	When the Jewish leaders saw the crowds , they were filled with jealousy and tried to contradict what Paul was saying by reviling him .
44013046	Both Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly and said , “ It was necessary for the word of God to be spoken to you first . Since you reject it and judge yourselves unfit for eternal life — behold , we turn to the Gentiles .
44013047	For so the Lord has commanded us , ‘ I have placed you as a light to the nations , so that you may bring salvation to the end of the earth . ’ ”
44013048	When the Gentiles heard this , they were thrilled and glorified the word of the Lord ; and as many as had been inscribed for eternal life believed .
44013049	Now the word of the Lord spread throughout the whole region .
44013050	But the Jewish leaders incited the God-fearing women of high standing and the leading men of the city . They stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas , and they drove them out of their district .
44013051	But Paul and Barnabas shook the dust off their feet against them , and they went on to Iconium .
44013052	And the disciples were filled with joy and the Ruach ha-Kodesh .
44014001	Now in Iconium , the same thing happened — they entered as usual into the Jewish synagogue and spoke in such a way that a large number of Jewish and Greek people believed .
44014002	But the Jewish people who would not believe stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brethren .
44014003	So they stayed there a considerable time , speaking boldly in the Lord — who was testifying to the message of His grace , granting signs and wonders to come about by their hands .
44014004	But the population of the city split ; some were with the Jewish leaders and some were with the shlichim .
44014005	Now it happened that an attempt was made by both the Gentiles and Jewish people , along with their rulers , to abuse and stone them .
44014006	But they found out about it and fled to the Lycaonian cities of Lystra and Derbe and the surrounding countryside .
44014007	There they proclaimed the Good News .
44014008	Now a man was sitting in Lystra without strength in his feet , lame from birth , who had never walked .
44014009	This man heard Paul speaking . When Paul looked intently at him and saw that he had faith to be healed ,
44014010	he said with a loud voice , “ Stand right up ! On your feet ! ” And the man leaped up and began to walk around !
44014011	Now the crowd , seeing what Paul had done , lifted up their voices , saying in Lycaonian , “ The gods have become like men and come down to us ! ”
44014012	And they began calling Barnabas “ Zeus ” and Paul “ Hermes ” ( because he was the main speaker ) .
44014013	The priest of Zeus , whose temple was before the front gate of the city , brought bulls and garlands ; he wanted to offer a sacrifice with the people .
44014014	But when the shlichim Barnabas and Paul heard of it , they tore their clothes and rushed out among the crowd , crying out
44014015	and saying , “ Men , why are you doing these things ? We too are human , just like you ! We proclaim the Good News to you , telling you to turn from these worthless things to the living God , who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them .
44014016	In past generations He allowed all the nations to go their own ways .
44014017	Yet He did not leave Himself without a witness — He did good by giving you rain from heaven and fruitful seasons , filling your hearts with joy and gladness . ”
44014018	Even saying these things , they barely restrained the crowd from sacrificing to them .
44014019	But Jewish people came from Antioch and Iconium ; and after they won the crowd over and stoned Paul , they were dragging him out of the city , supposing him to be dead .
44014020	But while the disciples surrounded him , he got up and went back into the city . On the next day he left with Barnabas for Derbe .
44014021	After proclaiming the Good News to that city and making many disciples , they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch .
44014022	They were strengthening the souls of the disciples , encouraging them to persevere in faith , and saying , “ It is through many persecutions that we must enter the kingdom of God . ”
44014023	When they had handpicked elders for them in every community , and prayed with fasting , they placed them in the care of the Lord — in whom they had put their trust .
44014024	Then they passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphyllia .
44014025	After speaking the message in Perga , they went down to Attalia .
44014026	From there they sailed back to Antioch ( where they had been entrusted to the gracious care of God for the work now completed ) .
44014027	When they arrived and gathered together Messiah’s community , they began to report all that God had done in helping them and that He had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles .
44014028	And they stayed quite awhile with the disciples .
44015001	Now some men coming down from Judea were teaching the brethren , “ Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses , you cannot be saved . ”
44015002	When Paul and Barnabas had a big argument and debate with them , the brethren appointed Paul and Barnabas with some others from among them to go up to Jerusalem to the shlichim and elders about this issue .
44015003	So they were sent on their way by the Antioch community . They were passing through both Phoenicia and Samaria , describing in detail the conversion of the Gentiles , and they were bringing great joy to all the brethren .
44015004	When they arrived in Jerusalem , they were welcomed by the community and the shlichim and the elders . They reported all that God had done in helping them .
44015005	But some belonging to the party of the Pharisees who had believed stood up , saying , “ It is necessary to circumcise them and to command them to keep the Torah of Moses . ”
44015006	The shlichim and elders were gathered together to examine this issue .
44015007	After much debate , Peter stood up and said to them , “ Brethren , you know that in the early days God chose from among you , that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the message of the Good News and believe .
44015008	And God , who knows the heart , testified to them by giving them the Ruach ha-Kodesh — just as He also did for us .
44015009	He made no distinction between us and them , purifying their hearts through faith .
44015010	Why then do you put God to the test by putting a yoke on the neck of the disciples — which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear ?
44015011	But instead , we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Yeshua , in the same way as they are . ”
44015012	Then the whole group became silent and were listening to Barnabas and Paul as they were describing in detail all the signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles .
44015013	After they finished speaking , Jacob answered , “ Brethren , listen to me .
44015014	Simon has described how God first showed His concern by taking from the Gentiles a people for His Name .
44015015	The words of the Prophets agree , as it is written :
44015016	‘ After this I will return and rebuild the fallen tabernacle of David . I will rebuild its ruins and I will restore it ,
44015017	so that the rest of humanity may seek the Lord — namely all the Gentiles who are called by My name — says Adonai , who makes these things
44015018	known from of old . ’
44015019	Therefore , I judge not to trouble those from among the Gentiles who are turning to God —
44015020	but to write to them to abstain from the contamination of idols , and from sexual immorality , and from what is strangled , and from blood .
44015021	For Moses from ancient generations has had in every city those who proclaim him , since he is read in all the synagogues every Shabbat . ”
44015022	Then it seemed good to the shlichim and elders , with the whole community , to choose men from among themselves to send to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas . They sent Judah ( also called Barsabbas ) and Silas , leading men among the brethren ,
44015023	and this letter along with them : “ The shlichim and the elders , your brethren , To the Gentile brethren of Antioch , Syria , and Cilicia : Greetings !
44015024	Since we have heard that some from among us have troubled you with words disturbing to your souls , although we gave them no such authorization ,
44015025	it seemed good to us , having come to one accord , to select men to send to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul —
44015026	men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah .
44015027	We therefore have sent to you Judah and Silas , who themselves will report to you the same things by word of mouth .
44015028	It seemed good to the Ruach ha-Kodesh and to us not to place on you any greater burden than these essentials :
44015029	that you abstain from things offered to idols , from blood , from things strangled , and from sexual immorality . By keeping away from these things , you will do well . Shalom ! ”
44015030	So when they were sent off , they went down to Antioch ; and when they had gathered the whole group together , they delivered the letter .
44015031	The people read it and rejoiced over its encouragement .
44015032	Judah and Silas , prophets themselves , encouraged the brethren with a long message and strengthened them .
44015033	After spending some time there , they were sent off with shalom by the brethren to those who had sent them .
44015035	But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch , teaching and proclaiming the word of the Lord with many others .
44015036	After some days Paul said to Barnabas , “ Let’s return and visit the brethren in every city where we have proclaimed the word of the Lord , to see how they are . ”
44015037	Barnabas was planning to take along John , called Mark .
44015038	But Paul was insisting that they shouldn’t take him along — the one who had deserted them in Pamphylia , not accompanying them in the work .
44015039	A sharp disagreement took place , so that they split off from one another . Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus .
44015040	But Paul selected Silas and went out , being entrusted by the brethren to the gracious care of the Lord .
44015041	He went through Syria and Cilicia , strengthening the communities .
44016001	Now Paul came to Derbe and Lystra . There was a disciple there named Timothy , son of a woman who was a Jewish believer and a Greek father ,
44016002	who was well-spoken of by the brethren at Lystra and Iconium .
44016003	Paul wanted this man to accompany him , and he took him and circumcised him for the sake of the Jewish people in those places — for they all knew that his father was Greek .
44016004	As they were traveling through the cities , they were handing down the rulings that had been decided upon by the shlichim and elders in Jerusalem , for them to keep .
44016005	So Messiah’s communities were strengthened in the faith and kept increasing daily in number .
44016006	They went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia , having been forbidden by the Ruach ha-Kodesh to speak the word in Asia .
44016007	When they came to Mysia , they were trying to proceed into Bithynia , but the Ruach of Yeshua would not allow them .
44016008	So they passed by Mysia and went down to Troas .
44016009	Now a vision appeared to Paul in the night . A man from Macedonia was standing and pleading with him , saying , “ Come over to Macedonia and help us ! ”
44016010	As soon as he had seen the vision , immediately we tried to go to Macedonia , concluding that God had called us to proclaim the Good News to them .
44016011	So we put out to sea from Troas and made a straight course for Samothrace , the next day on to Neapolis ,
44016012	and from there to Philippi — which is a leading city of the district of Macedonia as well as a Roman colony . We stayed in this city for several days .
44016013	On Yom Shabbat , we went outside the gate to the river , where we expected a place of prayer to be . We sat down and began speaking with the women who had gathered .
44016014	A woman named Lydia — a seller of purple cloth from the city of Thyatira , a God-fearer — was listening . The Lord opened her heart to respond to what Paul was saying .
44016015	When she was immersed , along with her household , she urged us , saying , “ If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord , come and stay at my house . ” And she insisted .
44016016	It so happened that as we were going to prayer , we met a slave girl who had a spirit of divination , who was bringing her masters much profit from her fortune-telling .
44016017	Following after Paul and us , she kept shouting , saying , “ These men are servants of El Elyon , who are proclaiming to you the way of salvation . ”
44016018	She kept doing this for many days . But Paul was irritated and turned and said to the spirit , “ I command you in the name of Messiah Yeshua to come out of her ! ” And it came out of her that very moment .
44016019	But when her masters saw that the hope of profit was gone , they grabbed Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the authorities .
44016020	And when they brought them to the chief authorities , they said , “ These men are throwing our city into an uproar ! Being Jewish ,
44016021	they advocate customs which are not permitted for us to accept or practice , being Romans . ”
44016022	Then the crowd joined in the attack on them . So the chief authorities ripped their clothes off them and commanded them to be beaten with rods .
44016023	After inflicting many blows on them , they threw them into prison , ordering the jailer to guard them securely .
44016024	Having received this charge , he threw them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks .
44016025	But about midnight , Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God , and the prisoners were listening to them .
44016026	Suddenly there was such a great earthquake that the foundations of the prison were shaken . Immediately all the doors were unlocked , and everyone’s chains came loose .
44016027	When the jailer woke up and saw the prison doors opened , he drew his sword and was about to kill himself , supposing the prisoners had escaped .
44016028	But Paul cried out with a loud voice , saying , “ Don’t harm yourself ! We’re all here ! ”
44016029	The jailer called for lights and rushed in ; and trembling with fear , he fell down before Paul and Silas .
44016030	After he brought them out , he said , “ Sirs , what must I do to be saved ? ”
44016031	They said , “ Put your trust in the Lord Yeshua and you will be saved — you and your household ! ”
44016032	Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him , along with everyone in his household .
44016033	He took them that very hour and washed their wounds , and at once he was immersed — he and all his household .
44016034	The jailer brought them to his house and set food before them , and he was overjoyed that he with his entire household had put their trust in God .
44016035	When day came , the chief authorities sent their police officers , saying , “ Release those men . ”
44016036	But the jailer reported these words to Paul , saying , “ The chief authorities have sent orders to release you . So come out now , and go in shalom . ”
44016037	But Paul said to the officers , “ They have beaten us publicly without a trial — men who are Roman citizens — and have thrown us into prison . And now they are sending us away secretly ? No ! Let them come themselves and lead us out ! ”
44016038	The police officers reported these words to the chief authorities . They became afraid when they heard they were Romans ,
44016039	so they came and apologized to them . After they escorted them out , they kept begging them to leave the city .
44016040	When Paul and Silas went out of the prison , they visited Lydia’s house . And when they saw the brethren , they encouraged them and then departed .
44017001	After passing through Amphipolis and Apollonia , they came to Thessalonica , where there was a Jewish synagogue .
44017002	As was his custom , Paul went to the Jewish people ; and for three Shabbats , he debated the Scriptures with them .
44017003	He opened them and gave evidence that Messiah had to suffer and rise from the dead , saying , “ This Yeshua , whom I declare to you , is the Messiah . ”
44017004	Some of them were convinced and became attached to Paul and Silas , as were a large number of the God-fearing Greeks and no small number of the leading women .
44017005	But some of the Jewish people became jealous . Taking some wicked fellows of the marketplace and gathering a crowd , they stirred the city into an uproar . They attacked Jason’s house , trying to bring Paul and Silas out to the mob .
44017006	When they did not find them , they instead began dragging Jason and some of the brethren before the city officials , shouting , “ These men who have upset the world have come here too ,
44017007	and Jason has welcomed them ! They are all acting against the decrees of Caesar , saying there is another king , Yeshua . ”
44017008	Hearing these things , the crowd and the city officials were confused .
44017009	But after receiving bail from Jason and the rest , they released them .
44017010	As soon as it was night , the brethren sent Paul and Silas to Berea . Upon arrival , they made their way to the Jewish synagogue .
44017011	Now these were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica , because they received the message with goodwill , searching the Scriptures each day to see whether these things were true .
44017012	Therefore many of them believed , as well as quite a few prominent Greek women and men .
44017013	But when the Jewish people of Thessalonica learned that the word of God had been proclaimed by Paul in Berea , they came there too , agitating and inciting the people .
44017014	Then the brethren immediately sent Paul away to the sea , but Silas and Timothy remained there .
44017015	Those escorting Paul brought him as far as Athens . After receiving an order for Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible , they left .
44017016	Now while Paul was waiting for them in Athens , his spirit was aroused within him when he saw that the city was full of idols .
44017017	So he was debating in the synagogue with the Jewish people and the God-fearers , as well as in the marketplace every day with all who happened to be there .
44017018	Also some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers were conversing with him . Some were saying , “ What’s this babbler trying to say ? ” while others , “ He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign deities ” — because he was proclaiming the Good News of Yeshua and the resurrection .
44017019	So they took Paul to the Aereopagus , saying , “ May we know what this new teaching is that you are talking about ?
44017020	For you are bringing some strange things to our ears , so we want to know what these things mean . ”
44017021	Now all the Athenians and foreigners visiting there used to pass their time doing nothing but telling or hearing something new .
44017022	So Paul stood in the middle of the Aereopagus and said , “ Men of Athens , I see that in all ways you are very religious .
44017023	For while I was passing through and observing the objects of your worship , I even found an altar with this inscription : ‘ To an Unknown God . ’ Therefore what you worship without knowing , this I proclaim to you .
44017024	The God who made the world and all things in it , since He is Lord of heaven and earth , does not live in temples made by hands .
44017025	Nor is He served by human hands , as if He needed anything , since He Himself gives to everyone life and breath and all things .
44017026	From one He made every nation of men to live on the face of the earth , having set appointed times and the boundaries of their territory .
44017027	They were to search for Him , and perhaps grope around for Him and find Him . Yet He is not far from each one of us ,
44017028	for ‘ In Him we live and move and have our being . ’ As some of your own poets have said , ‘ For we also are His offspring . ’
44017029	Since we are His offspring , we ought not to suppose the Deity is like gold or silver or stone , an engraved image of human art and imagination .
44017030	Although God overlooked the periods of ignorance , now He commands everyone everywhere to repent .
44017031	For He has set a day on which He will judge the world in righteousness , through a Man whom He has appointed . He has brought forth evidence of this to all men , by raising Him from the dead . ”
44017032	Now when they heard about the resurrection of the dead , some began scoffing . But others said , “ We will hear from you again about this . ”
44017033	So Paul left from their midst .
44017034	But some men joined with him and believed — among them Dionysius ( a member of the council of the Areopagus ) , a woman named Damaris , and others with them .
44018001	After these things , Paul left Athens and went to Corinth .
44018002	There he found a Jewish man named Aquila — a native of Pontus having recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla , because Claudius had commanded all Jewish people to leave Rome . Paul went to see them ;
44018003	and because he was of the same trade , he stayed with them and began working , for by trade they were tent-makers .
44018004	And he was debating every Shabbat in the synagogue , trying to persuade both Jewish and Greek people .
44018005	Now when Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia , Paul became occupied with the message , urgently testifying to the Jewish people that Yeshua is the Messiah .
44018006	But when they resisted and reviled him , he shook out his garments and said , “ Your blood be upon your own heads — I am clean ! From now on , I will go to the Gentiles . ”
44018007	After leaving there , Paul went into the house of a man named Titius Justus , a God-fearer whose house was next door to the synagogue .
44018008	Crispus , the synagogue leader , put his faith in the Lord , along with his whole household . And many of the Corinthians , upon hearing , were believing and being immersed .
44018009	Now the Lord said to Paul through a vision in the night , “ Do not be afraid , but speak and do not be silent !
44018010	For I am with you and no one shall attack you to harm you — many people in this city are for Me . ”
44018011	So he stayed a year and six months , teaching the word of God among them .
44018012	But while Gallio was proconsul of Achaia , the Jewish leaders made a united attack against Paul and brought him before the judgment seat ,
44018013	saying , “ This man persuades men to worship God contrary to the Torah . ”
44018014	But when Paul was about to open his mouth , Gallio said to the Jewish people , “ If it were a matter of wrongdoing or a vicious crime , there would be a reason to put up with you , O Jews .
44018015	But since it is issues about words , names , and your own law , see to it yourselves . I do not wish to be a judge of these . ”
44018016	And he drove them from the judgment seat .
44018017	Then they all grabbed Sosthenes , the synagogue leader , and began beating him in front of the judgment seat . But Gallio paid no attention to these things .
44018018	Paul , having stayed many more days , said farewell to the brethren and set sail to Syria , and with him were Priscilla and Aquila . At Cenchrea Paul had his hair cut off , for he was keeping a vow .
44018019	When they arrived at Ephesus , Paul left Priscilla and Aquila there . But he himself went into the synagogue and debated with the Jewish people .
44018020	When they asked him to stay longer , he declined ,
44018021	instead taking leave of them while saying , “ God willing , I'll return to you again . ” He set sail from Ephesus .
44018022	After landing at Caesarea , he went up and greeted Messiah’s community ; then he went down to Antioch .
44018023	After spending some time there , he departed and went one place after another throughout the region of Galatia and Phrygia , strengthening all the disciples . Discipling New Leaders
44018024	Now a Jewish man named Apollos , a native of Alexandria , came to Ephesus . He was a learned man , well versed in the Scriptures .
44018025	He had been instructed in the way of the Lord . With a fervent spirit , he was speaking and teaching accurately the facts about Yeshua — while only being acquainted with the immersion of John .
44018026	This man began speaking out boldly in the synagogue . But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him , they took him aside and explained the way of God more accurately .
44018027	When Apollos wanted to cross over to Achaia , the brethren encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him . Upon arrival , he greatly helped those who by grace had believed .
44018028	For he powerfully refuted the Jewish people in public , demonstrating through the Scriptures that the Messiah was Yeshua .
44019001	While Apollos was at Corinth , Paul traveled through the upper region and came to Ephesus . He found some disciples
44019002	and said to them , “ Did you receive the Ruach ha-Kodesh when you believed ? ” They replied to him , “ No , we’ve never even heard that there is a Ruach ha-Kodesh .
44019003	He said , “ Into what were you immersed ? ” They said , “ Into John's immersion . ”
44019004	Paul said , “ John immersed with an immersion of repentance , telling the people that they should believe in the One coming after him — that is , in Yeshua . ”
44019005	When they heard this , they were immersed in the name of the Lord Yeshua .
44019006	And when Paul laid hands upon them , the Ruach ha-Kodesh came upon them , and they began speaking in tongues and prophesying .
44019007	In all , there were about twelve men .
44019008	Paul went into the synagogue and for three months spoke boldly , debating and persuading them about the kingdom of God .
44019009	But when they were hardening and refusing to believe , speaking evil of the Way before the whole group , he withdrew from them , taking the disciples with him , debating daily in the hall of Tyrannus .
44019010	This continued for two years , so that all the residents of Asia heard the word of the Lord — Jewish as well as Greek people .
44019011	God was doing extraordinary miracles by Paul’s hands ,
44019012	so that even handkerchiefs and aprons that touched his skin were brought to the sick , and the diseases left them and the evil spirits went out of them .
44019013	But some traveling Jewish exorcists also tried to invoke the name of the Lord Yeshua , saying , “ I charge you by the Yeshua whom Paul preaches . ”
44019014	Seven sons of a Jewish ruling kohen named Sceva were doing this .
44019015	But the evil spirit answered them , “ I know Yeshua and I know about Paul , but who are you ? ”
44019016	Then the man with the evil spirit sprang at them , subduing and overpowering all of them , so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded .
44019017	This became known to all who lived in Ephesus , both Jewish and Greek people . Fear fell upon them all , and the name of the Lord Yeshua was being magnified .
44019018	Many also of those who had believed came confessing and recounting their practices .
44019019	And many of those who practiced magic arts brought their books together in a heap , burning them before everyone . They totaled the value of the books and found it to be about fifty thousand pieces of silver .
44019020	So the word of the Lord was growing in power and prevailing . Idol-Makers Start a Riot
44019021	Now after these things were accomplished , Paul resolved in the Ruach to go to Jerusalem after passing through Macedonia and Achaia , saying , “ After I have been there , I must also see Rome . ”
44019022	So after sending two who were assisting him , Timothy and Erastus , he himself stayed in Asia for a while .
44019023	Around that time , there arose no small uproar concerning the Way .
44019024	For a man named Demetrius — a silversmith , a maker of silver shrines of Artemis — was providing no small amount of business to the craftsmen .
44019025	He gathered these together , along with those of related occupations , and he said , “ Men , you know that our wealth is from this business .
44019026	You see and hear that not only in Ephesus but also throughout all Asia , Paul has persuaded and perverted a considerable crowd , saying that handmade gods are not gods at all .
44019027	Not only is there a danger that this trade of ours might come into disrepute , but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis might be considered as nothing . She whom all Asia and the world worships might even be thrown down from her majesty . ”
44019028	When they heard , they were filled with fury and began shouting , “ Great is Artemis of the Ephesians ! ”
44019029	The city was filled with confusion . They rushed into the theater , dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus , Macedonians who were travel companions of Paul .
44019030	Paul was wishing to enter among the crowd , but the disciples would not let him .
44019031	Some of the chiefs of Asia , being his friends , sent to him and begged him not to surrender himself in the theater .
44019032	Now some cried out one thing , some another , for the assembly was in confusion . Most did not know why they had come together .
44019033	Some of the crowd solicited Alexander , whom the Jewish people put forward . Alexander motioned with his hand . He wished to offer a defense to the crowd .
44019034	But recognizing that he was Jewish , for about two hours they all with one voice cried out , “ Great is Artemis of the Ephesians ! ”
44019035	After the town clerk quieted the crowd , he said , “ Men of Ephesus , what man is there who doesn’t know that the city of the Ephesians is temple keeper of the great Artemis and of her image fallen from heaven ?
44019036	Since these things are undeniable , you must be calm and do nothing reckless .
44019037	For you have brought these men here who are neither sacrilegious nor revilers of our goddess .
44019038	If Demetrius and the craftsmen with him have a complaint against anyone , the courts are open and there are proconsuls . Let them accuse them .
44019039	But if you seek anything further , it will be settled in the lawful assembly .
44019040	For we are in danger of being charged with rioting today , there being no reason which we are able to give to justify this mob . ” Upon saying this , he dismissed the assembly .
44019041	
44020001	After the uproar ended , Paul sent for the disciples ; and when he had encouraged them and said farewell , he departed to go to Macedonia .
44020002	When he had passed through these parts and given them a great word of encouragement , he came to Greece ,
44020003	where he spent three months . When a plot was formed against him by the Jewish leaders as he was about to sail to Syria , he decided to return via Macedonia .
44020004	Sopater of Berea , son of Pyrrhus , accompanied him ; as well as Aristarchus and Secundus of Thessalonica ; Gaius of Derbe , and Timothy ; Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia .
44020005	These went on ahead and were waiting for us at Troas .
44020006	But we sailed from Philippi after the Days of Matzah . In five days we came to them in Troas , where we stayed for seven days .
44020007	Now on the first day of the week , we gathered to break bread . Paul was talking with them , intending to leave the next day , so he prolonged his speech till midnight .
44020008	There were many lamps in the upper chamber where we were meeting .
44020009	Now a young man named Eutychus was sitting in a windowsill , sinking into a deep sleep as Paul kept on talking . Overcome by sleep , he fell from the third story and was picked up — dead .
44020010	But Paul went down , fell on him and threw his arms around him . He said , “ Don’t be upset , for his life is within him . ”
44020011	After he went back up and broke the bread and ate , he talked with them a long while until daybreak and then left .
44020012	So they took the boy away alive , greatly relieved . Prophetic Warnings
44020013	But we went on ahead to the ship and set sail for Assos , intending to take Paul aboard there — for so he had arranged , intending himself to travel there by land .
44020014	When he met us at Assos , we took him on board and went to Mitylene .
44020015	Sailing from there , we arrived the next day opposite Chios ; the next day we crossed over to Samos , and the day after that we came to Miletus .
44020016	For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus so that he might not spend much time in Asia , because he was hurrying to be in Jerusalem , if possible , by the day of Shavuot .
44020017	From Miletus , dispatching someone to Ephesus , he called for the elders of the community .
44020018	When they came to him , he said to them , “ You yourselves know how I behaved among you all the time from the first day I set foot in Asia ,
44020019	serving the Lord with all humility and tears and trials which fell upon me through the plots of the Jewish leaders .
44020020	I did not shrink back from proclaiming to you anything that was profitable , teaching you publicly as well as from house to house ,
44020021	testifying to both Jewish and Greek people repentance to God and trust in our Lord Yeshua .
44020022	“ And now , look , bound by the Ruach , I am going to Jerusalem — not knowing what will happen to me there ,
44020023	except that the Ruach ha-Kodesh bears witness to me from city to city , saying that bondage and afflictions await me .
44020024	However , I don't consider my life of any value , except that I might finish my course and the office I received from the Lord Yeshua , to declare the Good News of the grace of God .
44020025	“ Now , look ! I know that none of you , among whom I have gone proclaiming the kingdom , will ever see my face again .
44020026	Therefore , I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all .
44020027	For I did not shrink back from declaring to you the whole purpose of God .
44020028	“ Take care of yourselves and all the flock of which the Ruach ha-Kodesh has made you overseers , to shepherd the community of God — which He obtained with the blood of His own .
44020029	I know that after my departure , savage wolves will come in among you , not sparing the flock .
44020030	Even from among yourselves will arise men speaking perversions , to draw the disciples away after themselves .
44020031	Therefore be alert , remembering that night and day for three years I did not stop warning you with tears .
44020032	“ Now I commit you to God and the word of His grace , which is strong to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all who have been made holy .
44020033	I coveted no one’s silver or gold or clothing .
44020034	You yourselves know that these hands of mine have provided for my own needs as well as for those with me .
44020035	In all things I have shown you an object lesson — that by hard work one must help the weak , remembering the words of the Lord Yeshua , that He Himself said , ‘ It is more blessed to give than to receive . ’ ”
44020036	When he had said these things , he knelt down and prayed with them all .
44020037	They all began weeping and falling upon Paul’s neck and kissing him ,
44020038	grieving most of all over the statement he made that they would never see his face again . Then they accompanied him to the ship .
44021001	After tearing ourselves away from them and setting sail , we set a straight course to Cos , the next day to Rhodes , and from there to Patara .
44021002	Finding a ship crossing to Phoenicia , we went aboard and set sail .
44021003	When we came in sight of Cyprus , passing it by on the left , we kept sailing to Syria and landed at Tyre — for there the ship was to unload the cargo .
44021004	We looked up the disciples and stayed there seven days . They kept telling Paul through the Ruach not to set foot in Jerusalem .
44021005	When our days there were over , we departed and went on our journey . They all , with wives and children , accompanied us until we were outside the city . After kneeling down on the shore and praying ,
44021006	we said farewell to one another . Then we boarded the ship , and they returned home .
44021007	When we had finished the trip from Tyre , we arrived at Ptolemais . We greeted the brethren and stayed with them for one day .
44021008	On the next day , we departed and came to Caesarea . We entered the home of Philip , the proclaimer of Good News , who was one of the seven , and we stayed with him .
44021009	Now this man had four virgin daughters who prophesied .
44021010	While we stayed there for a number of days , a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea .
44021011	He came to us , took Paul’s belt , tied his own hands and feet , and said , “ The Ruach ha-Kodesh says this : ‘ In this way shall the Jewish people in Jerusalem bind the man who owns this belt and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles . ’ ”
44021012	When we heard these things , both we and the local people urged Paul not to go up to Jerusalem .
44021013	Then Paul responded , “ What are you doing , weeping and breaking my heart ? For I am ready not only to be bound but to die for the name of the Lord Yeshua ! ”
44021014	Since he would not be persuaded , we fell silent , saying only , “ May the Lord’s will be done . ”
44021015	After these days , we packed and started going up to Jerusalem .
44021016	Some of the disciples from Caesarea also went with us , bringing us to Mnason of Cyprus — one of the early disciples by whom we might be hosted .
44021017	When we arrived in Jerusalem , the brethren welcomed us gladly .
44021018	On the next day , Paul went in with us to Jacob ; all the elders were present .
44021019	After greeting them , he reported to them in detail what God had done among the Gentiles through his service .
44021020	And when they heard , they began glorifying God . They said , “ You see , brother , how many myriads there are among the Jewish people who have believed — and they are all zealous for the Torah .
44021021	They have been told about you — that you teach all the Jewish people among the Gentiles to forsake Moses , telling them not to circumcise their children or to walk according to the customs .
44021022	What’s to be done then ? No doubt they will hear that you have come .
44021023	“ So do what we tell you . We have four men who have a vow on themselves .
44021024	Take them , and purify yourself along with them and pay their expenses , so that they may shave their heads . That way , all will realize there is nothing to the things they have been told about you , but that you yourself walk in an orderly manner , keeping the Torah .
44021025	“ As for Gentiles who have believed , however , we have written by letter what we decided — for them to abstain from what is offered to idols , and from blood , and from what is strangled , and from immorality . ”
44021026	The next day Paul took the men , purifying himself along with them . He went into the Temple , announcing when the days of purification would be completed and the sacrifice would be offered for each one of them .
44021027	When the seven days were about to be completed , the Jewish leaders from Asia saw Paul in the Temple and began stirring up the whole crowd . They grabbed him ,
44021028	shouting , “ Men of Israel , help ! This is the man who is teaching all men everywhere against our people and the Torah and this place . Besides , he has even brought Greeks into the Temple and defiled this holy place ! ”
44021029	For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him , and they assumed that Paul had brought him into the Temple .
44021030	The whole city was stirred up , and the people rushed together . They grabbed Paul and dragged him out of the Temple , and the gates were shut at once .
44021031	As they were trying to kill him , news came to the commander of the cohort that all Jerusalem was in chaos .
44021032	Immediately he took soldiers and centurions and rushed down to them . Upon seeing the commander and the soldiers , they stopped beating Paul .
44021033	Then the commander came up , arrested Paul , ordered him to be bound with two chains , and began investigating what he had done .
44021034	Some in the crowd shouted one thing , and some another . As he could not determine the facts because of the uproar , he ordered him to be brought into headquarters .
44021035	When he came to the steps , he had to be carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd .
44021036	For the multitude of people that followed kept shouting , “ Away with him ! ”
44021037	As Paul was about to be brought into the headquarters , he said to the commander , “ Can I say something to you ? ” The commander said , “ You know Greek ?
44021038	Then you’re not the Egyptian who stirred up a rebellion some time ago — and led four thousand men of the Assassins out into the desert ? ”
44021039	Paul said , “ I am a Jewish man from Tarsus in Cilicia , a citizen of no insignificant city . I beg you , let me speak to the people . ”
44021040	When the commander had given him permission , Paul stood on the steps and motioned to the people with his hand . When there was a great hush , he spoke to them in Aramaic , saying :
44022001	“ Brethren and fathers , listen to my defense which I now present to you . ”
44022002	When they heard that Paul was addressing them in Aramaic , they became even more quiet . Then he said ,
44022003	“ I am a Jewish man , born in Tarsus of Cilicia but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel , trained strictly according to the Torah of our fathers , being zealous for God just as all of you are today .
44022004	I persecuted this Way to the death , arresting both men and women and throwing them in prisons —
44022005	as the kohen gadol and all the council of elders can testify about me . I also received letters from them to the brethren , and I went to Damascus to bring back to Jerusalem even those who were there in chains — to be punished .
44022006	“ But it happened that as I was traveling and drawing near to Damascus , about noon a great light from heaven suddenly flashed all around me .
44022007	I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me , ‘ Saul , Saul , why do you persecute Me ? ’
44022008	“ I answered , ‘ Who are you , Lord ? ’ “ He said to me , ‘ I am Yeshua ha-Natzrati , whom you are persecuting . ’
44022009	“ Now those who were with me saw the light , but did not understand the voice of the One who was speaking to me .
44022010	So I said , ‘ What shall I do , Lord ? ’ “ And the Lord said to me , ‘ Get up , and go to Damascus . There you will be told all that you have been appointed to do . ’
44022011	“ But since I could not see because of the brilliance of that light , I was led by the hand by those who were with me and came into Damascus .
44022012	Then a certain Ananias — a devout man according to the Torah , well spoken of by all the Jewish people living there —
44022013	came to me . Standing before me , he said to me , ‘ Brother Saul , look up ! ’ In that very moment , I looked and saw him !
44022014	“ And he said , ‘ The God of our fathers handpicked you to know His will — to see the Righteous One and to hear an utterance from His mouth .
44022015	For you will be a witness for Him to all people of what you have seen and heard .
44022016	Now why are you waiting ? Get up and be immersed , and wash away your sins , calling on His Name . ’
44022017	“ It happened that when I returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the Temple , I fell into a trance ;
44022018	and I saw Him saying to me , ‘ Hurry ! Get out of Jerusalem quickly , because they will not accept your witness about Me . ’
44022019	“ And I said , ‘ Lord , they themselves know that in one synagogue after another , I was imprisoning and beating those trusting in You .
44022020	Even when the blood of Your witness Stephen was spilled , I too was standing by and approving , and guarding the clothing of those who were killing him . ’
44022021	“ And he said to me , ‘ Go ! For I will send you far away to the Gentiles . ’ ”
44022022	Up to this statement they listened to him . Then they raised their voices , saying , “ Away from the earth with this fellow ! For he’s not fit to live ! ”
44022023	As they were crying out and flinging off their cloaks and throwing dust into the air ,
44022024	the commander ordered Paul to be brought into headquarters . He said Paul should be examined by lashing , so that he might find out why they were shouting against him so .
44022025	But when they stretched him out with straps , Paul said to the centurion standing there , “ Is it legal for you to scourge a man who is a Roman citizen without due process ? ”
44022026	Now when the centurion heard this , he went to the commander and reported it , saying , “ What are you going to do ? For this man is Roman . ”
44022027	The commander came and said to him , “ Tell me , are you Roman ? ” And he said , “ Yes . ”
44022028	The commander answered , “ I bought this citizenship for a large sum . ” Paul said , “ But I was born so . ”
44022029	Therefore , those who were about to interrogate him instantly drew back from him . And the commander also was afraid when he found out that Paul was a Roman and that he had bound him .
44022030	But on the next day , desiring to know exactly why Paul had been accused by the Judeans , he released him and commanded the ruling kohanim and all the Sanhedrin to meet together . And he brought Paul and set him before them .
44023001	Paul , looking intently at the Sanhedrin , said , “ Brethren , I have lived my life in all good conscience for God up to this day . ”
44023002	But the kohen gadol Ananias ordered those standing by him to strike him on the mouth .
44023003	Then Paul said to him , “ God is going to strike you on the mouth , you whitewashed wall ! Do you sit judging me according to the Torah , and yet in violation of the Torah you order me to be struck ? ”
44023004	Those standing nearby said , “ Do you insult God’s kohen gadol ? ”
44023005	Paul said , “ I didn't know , brethren , that he is the kohen gadol . For it has been written , ‘ You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people . ’ ”
44023006	But recognizing that one group was Sadducees and the other Pharisees , Paul began crying out in the Sanhedrin , “ Brethren , I am a Pharisee , a son of Pharisees ! I am on trial because of the hope of the resurrection of the dead ! ”
44023007	When he said this , a dispute broke out between the Pharisees and Sadducees , and the assembly was divided .
44023008	For the Sadducees say there is no resurrection or angel or spirit , but the Pharisees affirm them all .
44023009	Then there was a great uproar . Some of the Torah scholars of the Pharisees’ party stood up and protested sharply , “ We find nothing wrong with this man ! What if a spirit or angel has spoken to him ? ”
44023010	As a big dispute was developing , the commander was afraid that Paul would be torn to pieces by them . So he ordered the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them and to bring him into headquarters .
44023011	The following night the Lord stood beside Paul and said , “ Take courage ! For just as you have testified about Me in Jerusalem , so you must also testify in Rome ! ”
44023012	When it was day , the Judean leaders formed a conspiracy . They bound themselves by an oath not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul .
44023013	There were more than forty who formed this plot .
44023014	They went to the ruling kohanim and elders and said , “ We have bound ourselves with a solemn oath to taste nothing until we have killed Paul .
44023015	So now you and the Sanhedrin serve notice to the commander to bring him down to you — like you are about to investigate his case more thoroughly . But we are ready to kill him before he comes near . ”
44023016	But the son of Paul’s sister heard of their ambush . He went into the headquarters and told Paul .
44023017	Paul called one of the centurions and said , “ Take this young man to the commander , for he has a message for him . ”
44023018	So the centurion took him and led him to the commander and said , “ The prisoner Paul called me and asked me to bring this young man to you , as he has something to say to you . ”
44023019	The commander took him by the hand , stepped aside , and began asking him privately , “ What is it that you have to report to me ? ”
44023020	And he said , “ The Judean leaders have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the Sanhedrin tomorrow — as if they are about to investigate more thoroughly about him .
44023021	But do not give in to them , for more than forty of them have bound themselves by an oath not to eat or drink until they have killed him . Even now , they are ready and waiting for your consent . ”
44023022	So the commander dismissed the young man , charging him , “ Tell no one that you have informed me about these things . ”
44023023	Calling two of his centurions , he said , “ At the third hour of the night , prepare two hundred soldiers , along with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen , to proceed as far as Caesarea .
44023024	Also provide mounts for Paul to ride , so that he might be brought safely to Felix the governor . ”
44023025	He wrote a letter to this effect :
44023026	“ Claudius Lysias , To the Most Excellent Governor Felix : Greetings !
44023027	This man was seized by the Judean leaders and was about to be killed by them , when I came on the scene with the soldiers and rescued him , having learned that he is a Roman citizen .
44023028	Desiring to know the charge of which they were accusing him , I brought him down to their Sanhedrin .
44023029	I found that he was accused concerning issues of their law , but charged with nothing worthy of death or imprisonment .
44023030	When I was informed that there was a plot against the man , I sent him to you immediately , also ordering his accusers to state before you what they have against him . ”
44023031	So the soldiers , in keeping with their orders , took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris .
44023032	On the next day , they returned to headquarters , leaving the horsemen to go on with him .
44023033	When they came to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor , they also presented Paul before him .
44023034	Upon reading the letter , the governor asked what province he was from . When he learned that Paul was from Cilicia ,
44023035	he said , “ I will give you a hearing when your accusers have arrived also . ” Then he gave orders for Paul to be guarded in Herod’s Praetorium .
44024001	After five days , the kohen gadol Ananias came down with some of the elders and an attorney named Tertullus . They brought formal charges against Paul before the governor .
44024002	When Paul was called in , Tertullus began to accuse him , saying , “ We are enjoying much peace through you , and reforms are introduced for this nation because of your foresight .
44024003	We acknowledge this , most excellent Felix , in every way and every place with all gratitude .
44024004	“ But in order that I may not weary you any longer , I beg you in your kindness to hear us briefly .
44024005	For we have found this man to be a pest , stirring up riots among all the Jewish people throughout the world , and a ringleader of the sect of the Natzratim .
44024006	He even tried to defile the Temple , but we seized him .
44024008	By examining him yourself , you will be able to learn from him all these things about which we accuse him . ”
44024009	The Judean leaders also joined in the attack , affirming that these things were true .
44024010	When the governor nodded for him to speak , Paul responded : “ Knowing that you have been judge over this nation for many years , I gladly make my own defense .
44024011	As you can verify , it is no more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship .
44024012	They did not find me arguing with anyone or inciting a riot — not in the Temple or in the synagogues or anywhere else in the city .
44024013	Nor can they prove to you the charges they now bring against me .
44024014	“ But this I confess to you , that according to the Way ( which they call a sect ) , I worship the God of our fathers , believing everything written in the Torah and the Prophets .
44024015	In God I have a hope — which these men also wait for — that there will surely be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous .
44024016	“ Therefore I do my best always to have a clear conscience before both God and men .
44024017	Now after several years , I came to bring tzedakah to my country for the poor and to present offerings .
44024018	As I was doing this , they found me in the Temple , having been purified — without any crowd or uproar .
44024019	But there were some Jewish people from Asia , who ought to be here before you to press charges if they have anything against me .
44024020	Or let these men themselves tell what wrongdoing they found when I stood before the Sanhedrin —
44024021	except for this one cry I shouted out while standing among them : ‘ It is about the resurrection of the dead that today I am on trial before you . ’ ”
44024022	But Felix , having a rather extensive knowledge of the Way , put them off , saying , “ When Lysias the commander comes down , I will rule on your case . ”
44024023	Then he gave the centurion orders for Paul to be kept in custody and yet have some freedom , and not to prevent any of his friends from attending to his needs .
44024024	Now some days later Felix came with his wife Drusilla , who was Jewish . He sent for Paul and listened to him speak about faith in Messiah Yeshua .
44024025	But as he was arguing about righteousness , self-control , and the coming judgment , Felix became afraid and said , “ Go away for now ! When I find time , I will summon you . ”
44024026	At the same time too , he was hoping that money would be given to him by Paul ; so he sent for him frequently and would talk with him .
44024027	But after two years had passed , Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus ; and wishing to do the Judean leaders a favor , Felix left Paul in prison .
44025001	Three days after Festus arrived in the province , he went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea .
44025002	There the ruling kohanim and the leading Judeans brought charges against Paul . They were urging him ,
44025003	asking a favor — to have Paul sent to Jerusalem , planning an ambush to kill him on the road .
44025004	Festus then answered that Paul was being guarded at Caesarea , and that he himself was about to go there shortly .
44025005	“ So then , ” he said , “ let the prominent men among you go down with me ; and if there is any wrong in the man , let them accuse him . ”
44025006	After spending not more than eight to ten days with them , he went down to Caesarea . The next day , he sat on the judgment seat and ordered Paul to be brought in .
44025007	When he arrived , the Judeans who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him , bringing against him many serious charges which they could not prove .
44025008	Paul said in his defense , “ I have committed no offense against the Torah of the Jewish people , or against the Temple , or against Caesar . ”
44025009	But Festus , wanting to do the Jewish leaders a favor , said to Paul , “ Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem to be tried before me ? ”
44025010	But Paul said , “ I am standing before Caesar's judgment seat , where I ought to be tried . I have done no wrong to the Judeans , as you very well know .
44025011	If then I am in the wrong and have committed anything worthy of death , I do not seek to escape death . But if there is nothing to their charges , no one can turn me over to them . I appeal to Caesar ! ”
44025012	Then when Festus had consulted with the council , he responded , “ You have appealed to Caesar — to Caesar you shall go ! ”
44025013	Now after several days had passed , King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea to pay their respects to Festus .
44025014	While they were staying there several days , Festus laid Paul’s case before the king , saying , “ There is a man left behind as a prisoner by Felix .
44025015	When I was in Jerusalem , the ruling kohanim and elders of the Judeans brought charges against him , asking for a judgment against him .
44025016	I answered them that it is not Roman practice to turn over anyone before the accused meets his accusers face to face and has an opportunity to make his defense concerning the charges .
44025017	So when they came together here , I did not delay , but on the next day sat on the judgment seat and ordered the man to be brought in .
44025018	When the accusers stood up , they were not bringing a charge of what crimes I suspected .
44025019	Instead , they had certain issues with him about their own religion and about a certain Yeshua , who had died , whom Paul claimed to be alive .
44025020	“ Since I was at a loss as to how to investigate these matters , I asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem to be tried there in regard to them .
44025021	But when Paul appealed to be held in custody for the decision of His Majesty the Emperor , I ordered him to be held until I could send him to Caesar . ”
44025022	Then Agrippa said to Festus , “ I would like to hear the man myself . ” “ Tomorrow , ” he said , “ you shall hear him . ”
44025023	So on the next day , Agrippa and Bernice came with great pageantry . They entered the audience hall with the commanders and the most prominent men of the city . Then at the order of Festus , Paul was brought in .
44025024	Festus said , “ King Agrippa and all present with us , you see this man about whom the whole Judean population petitioned me , both in Jerusalem and here , shouting out that he ought not live any longer .
44025025	But I found that he had done nothing deserving of death ; and when he himself appealed to His Majesty the Emperor , I decided to send him .
44025026	Yet I have nothing specific to write to my lord about him . Therefore I have brought him before you — and especially before you , King Agrippa — so that after the investigation has taken place , I might have something to write .
44025027	For it seems illogical to me when sending a prisoner , not to report also the charges against him . ”
44026001	Agrippa said to Paul , “ It is permitted for you to speak for yourself . ” Then Paul stretched out his hand and began his defense .
44026002	“ Concerning all I am accused of by the Judean leaders , I consider myself fortunate , King Agrippa , that it is before you that I am about to make my defense today —
44026003	since you are especially knowledgeable about all Jewish customs and issues . Therefore I beg you to listen patiently to me .
44026004	“ Now all the Jewish people have known my manner of life ever since my youth , starting from the beginning in my own nation and also in Jerusalem .
44026005	They have known about me for a long time — if they were willing to testify — that according to the strictest sect of our religion , I lived as a Pharisee .
44026006	“ Yet now I stand here being judged for the hope in the promise made by God to our fathers .
44026007	It is the promise that our twelve tribes hope to attain , as they earnestly worship night and day . And for this hope I am accused by Jewish people , O King !
44026008	Why is it judged incredible by any of you that God raises the dead ?
44026009	“ In fact , I myself thought it was necessary to do many things in opposition to the name of Yeshua ha-Natzrati .
44026010	And that is what I did in Jerusalem . Not only did I lock up many of the kedoshim in prisons by the authority I received from the ruling kohanim , but I cast my vote against them when they were being condemned to death .
44026011	I tried to cause them to blaspheme by punishing them often in the synagogues . In furious rage against them , I persecuted them even in foreign cities .
44026012	“ While journeying to Damascus with the authority and commission of the ruling kohanim ,
44026013	at midday , O King , I saw on the road a light from heaven , brighter than the sun , shining around me and those traveling with me .
44026014	When we had all fallen to the ground , I heard a voice saying to me in Aramaic , ‘ Saul , Saul , why are you persecuting Me ? It is hard for you to kick against goads ! ’
44026015	“ Then I said , ‘ Who are you , Lord ? ’ “ And the Lord said , ‘ I am Yeshua — whom you are persecuting .
44026016	But get up , and stand on your feet . For I have appeared to you for this purpose — to appoint you as a servant and witness to the things you have seen as well as to the things I will yet reveal to you .
44026017	I will rescue you from your own people , and from the Gentiles to whom I am sending you ,
44026018	to open their eyes — so they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of satan to God , that they may receive release from sins as well as a place among those who are made holy through trusting in Me . ’
44026019	“ Therefore , O King Agrippa , I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision .
44026020	Rather , I kept declaring — first to those in Damascus , and then Jerusalem and throughout all the region of Judea , and also the Gentiles — that they should repent and turn to God , performing deeds consistent with that repentance .
44026021	“ For this reason some Judeans seized me in the Temple and tried to put me to death .
44026022	Since I have had God’s help , to this day I have stood here testifying to both small and great . I am saying nothing but what the Prophets and Moses said was going to happen —
44026023	that the Messiah was to suffer and that , being first to rise from the dead , He would proclaim light both to our people and to the nations . ”
44026024	As Paul was thus making his defense , Festus says with a loud voice , “ You’re crazy , Paul ! Your great learning is driving you insane ! ”
44026025	But Paul declares , “ I am not insane , most noble Festus ! Rather I am speaking the sober truth .
44026026	For the king knows about these things , and I speak freely to him , since I am convinced that none of these things escape his notice — for this was not done in a corner .
44026027	King Agrippa , do you believe the Prophets ? I know that you do believe ! ”
44026028	Agrippa said to Paul , “ In a short time you are trying to persuade me to be Messianic ! ”
44026029	And Paul said , “ Whether short or long , I would pray to God that not only you , but also all who hear me today would be such as I am — except for these chains ! ”
44026030	Then the king stood up , as well as the governor , Bernice , and those sitting with them .
44026031	When they had gone away , they began talking among themselves , saying , “ This man is doing nothing deserving of death or chains . ”
44026032	Then Agrippa said to Festus , “ This man could have been set free , if he had not appealed to Caesar . ”
44027001	When it was decided that we should sail for Italy , they handed Paul and some other prisoners over to a centurion named Julius , of the Augustan Cohort .
44027002	So we boarded a ship from Adramyttium , which was about to sail to the ports along the coast of Asia , and we set out to sea — accompanied by Aristarchus , a Macedonian from Thessalonica .
44027003	The next day we set down at Sidon . Julius , treating Paul kindly , let him go to his friends to receive care .
44027004	Setting out to sea from there , we sailed under the shelter of Cyprus , because the winds were against us .
44027005	When we had sailed across the open sea along the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia , we came down to Myra in Lysia .
44027006	There the centurion found a ship from Alexandria sailing for Italy and put us on board .
44027007	Sailing slowly for a number of days , with difficulty we made it to Cnidus . As the wind did not allow us to go further , we sailed under the shelter of Crete , off Salmone .
44027008	Coasting along it with difficulty , we came to a place called Fair Havens , near the city of Lasea .
44027009	Since considerable time had passed and the voyage was already dangerous because the Fast had already gone by , Paul kept warning them ,
44027010	telling them , “ Men , I can see that the voyage is about to end in disaster and great loss — not only of the cargo and the ship , but also of our lives ! ”
44027011	But the centurion was persuaded more by the pilot and the captain of the ship than by what was said by Paul .
44027012	And because the harbor was unsuitable for wintering , the majority reached a decision to set out to sea from there — if somehow they might reach Phoenix , a harbor of Crete facing northeast and southeast , and spend the winter there .
44027013	When the south wind blew gently , supposing they had obtained their purpose , they raised the anchor and started coasting along the shore by Crete .
44027014	But before long , a hurricane-force wind called “ the Northeaster ” swept down from the island .
44027015	When the ship was caught and could not face into the wind , we gave way to it and were driven along .
44027016	As we ran under the shelter of a small island called Cauda , we were barely able to get control of the dinghy .
44027017	When the crew had hoisted it up , they made use of ropes to undergird the ship . Then fearing they might run aground on the Syrtis , they let down the anchor and so were driven along .
44027018	But as we were violently battered by the storm , the next day they began throwing cargo overboard .
44027019	On the third day , they threw out the ship’s gear with their own hands .
44027020	With neither sun nor stars appearing for many days , and no small storm pressing on us , all hope of our survival was vanishing .
44027021	As they had long been without food , Paul stood up in their midst and said , “ Men , you should have listened to me and not sailed from Crete , to avoid this disaster and loss .
44027022	Yet now I urge you to take heart , for there will be no loss of life among you — but only of the ship .
44027023	For this very night , there came to me an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve .
44027024	He said , ‘ Do not fear , Paul . You must stand before Caesar ; and indeed , God has granted you all who are sailing with you . ’
44027025	So take heart , men , for I trust God that it will be exactly as I have been told .
44027026	But we must run aground on some island . ”
44027027	Now when the fourteenth night had come , as we were drifting across the Adriatic Sea , about midnight the sailors began to sense that they were nearing some land .
44027028	So they took soundings and found the water was twenty fathoms deep . A bit farther along , they took another sounding and found it was fifteen fathoms deep .
44027029	Fearing that we might run aground on the rocks , they threw out four anchors from the stern . They were longing for day to come .
44027030	Now the sailors were trying to escape from the ship and had lowered the dinghy into the sea , pretending they were going to put out anchors from the bow .
44027031	Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers , “ Unless these men remain on the ship , you cannot be saved ! ”
44027032	Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the dinghy and let it drift away .
44027033	As day was about to dawn , Paul urged them all to take some food , saying , “ Today is the fourteenth day that you have kept waiting and going without food , having taken nothing .
44027034	Therefore , I urge you to take some food — for this is for your survival , since not one of you will lose a hair from his head . ”
44027035	And when he had said these things , he took bread , gave thanks to God before them all , broke it , and began to eat .
44027036	Then all were encouraged and took some food themselves .
44027037	( In all we were 276 persons on the ship . )
44027038	When they had eaten enough , they began to lighten the ship , throwing the wheat into the sea .
44027039	Then when daylight came , they did not recognize the land ; but they noticed a bay with a beach , where they planned to run the ship aground if they could .
44027040	So they cut off the anchors and left them in the sea , while loosening the ropes of the rudders at the same time . Then , hoisting the forward sail to the wind , they made for the beach .
44027041	But they struck a sandbar between the seas and ran the ship aground . The bow stuck fast and remained immovable , and the stern began to break up by the pounding of the waves .
44027042	The plan of the soldiers was to kill the prisoners , so that none of them would escape by swimming away .
44027043	But the centurion , wanting to save Paul , kept them from carrying out their plan . He ordered those able to swim to throw themselves overboard first and get to land —
44027044	and the rest to get there on boards and pieces of the ship . And in this way all were brought safely to land .
44028001	Once safely ashore , we learned that the island was called Malta .
44028002	The natives showed us unusual kindness . Because it had started raining and it was cold , they kindled a fire and welcomed us all .
44028003	But when Paul had gathered a bundle of brushwood and placed it on the fire , a viper came out because of the heat and fastened on his hand .
44028004	When the natives saw the snake hanging from his hand , they began saying to one another , “ No doubt this man is a murderer ! Though he has been saved from the sea , Justice has not allowed him to live . ”
44028005	However , Paul shook the snake off into the fire and suffered no harm .
44028006	They were expecting him to swell up or suddenly fall down dead — but after they waited a long time and saw no harm come to him , they changed their minds and began to say he was a god .
44028007	Now in the vicinity around that place were lands belonging to the most prominent man of the island , named Publius . He welcomed us and hosted us warmly for three days .
44028008	It so happened that the father of Publius was lying in bed sick with a fever and dysentery . Paul visited him and , when he had prayed and laid hands on him , he healed him .
44028009	After this happened , the rest of the sick on the island started coming and getting healed .
44028010	They also heaped honors on us ; and when we sailed , they put on board all the supplies we needed .
44028011	After three months , we set sail in a ship from Alexandria that had wintered at the island , with the Twin Brothers as its figurehead .
44028012	Setting down at Syracuse , we stayed there three days .
44028013	From there we got underway and reached Rhegium ; and a day later a south wind came up , and on the second day we came to Puteoli .
44028014	There we found some brethren , and we were invited to stay with them for seven days . And in this way we came to Rome .
44028015	Now the brethren there , when they heard about us , came as far as the Forum of Appius and the Three Taverns to meet us . When Paul saw them , he gave thanks to God and took courage .
44028016	When we entered Rome , Paul was permitted to remain in his own quarters , with a soldier guarding him . Paul Keeps Spreading the Good News
44028017	It happened that after three days , Paul called together those who were the prominent Jewish leaders . When they had gathered he said to them , “ Brethren , although I had done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers , I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans .
44028018	When they examined me , they wanted to release me because there was no basis for the death penalty .
44028019	But when the Judean leaders protested , I was forced to appeal to Caesar — not that I had any charge to bring against my own nation .
44028020	For this reason , therefore , I have requested to see you and to speak with you — since it is for the hope of Israel that I am bearing this chain . ”
44028021	They said to him , “ We have received no letters from Judea about you , and none of the brethren coming here has reported or spoken any evil about you .
44028022	But we think it appropriate to hear from you about what you think . For indeed , it is known to us that regarding this sect , it is spoken against everywhere . ”
44028023	They set a day to meet Paul and came to him at his quarters in large numbers . From morning until evening he was explaining everything to them , testifying about the kingdom of God and trying to persuade them about Yeshua from both the Torah of Moses and the Prophets .
44028024	Some were convinced by what he said , while others refused to believe .
44028025	So when they disagreed among themselves , they began leaving after Paul had said one last statement : “ The Ruach ha-Kodesh rightly spoke through Isaiah the prophet to your fathers ,
44028026	saying , ‘ Go to this people and say , “ You will keep on hearing but will never understand ; you will keep looking , but will never see .
44028027	For the heart of this people has become dull , their ears can barely hear , and they have shut their eyes . Otherwise they might see with their eyes , hear with their ears , and understand with their hearts . Then they would turn back , and I would heal them . ” ’
44028028	Therefore let it be known to you that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles , and they will listen ! ”
44028030	Paul remained two whole years in his own rented quarters and continued to welcome all who came to him —
44028031	proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Yeshua the Messiah with all boldness and without hindrance .
45001001	Paul , a slave of Messiah Yeshua , called to be a shaliach and set apart for the Good News of God ,
45001002	which He announced beforehand through His prophets in the Holy Scriptures .
45001003	Concerning His Son , He came into being from the seed of David according to the flesh .
45001004	He was appointed Ben-Elohim in power according to the Ruach of holiness , by the resurrection from the dead . He is Messiah Yeshua our Lord .
45001005	Through Him we have received grace and the office of shaliach , to bring about obedience of faith among all the nations on behalf of His name .
45001006	And you also are called to Yeshua the Messiah .
45001007	To all those in Rome , loved by God , called to be kedoshim : Grace to you and shalom from God our Father and the Lord Yeshua the Messiah !
45001008	First , I thank my God through Messiah Yeshua for all of you , because your faithfulness is made known throughout the whole world .
45001009	For God is my witness , whom I serve with my spirit in the Good News of His Son . How unceasingly I make mention of you ,
45001010	always pleading in my prayers , if somehow by God’s will now at last I will be granted a good journey to come to you .
45001011	For I long to see you , so I may share with you some spiritual gift to strengthen you .
45001012	That is to say , we would be encouraged together by one another’s faithfulness — both yours and mine .
45001013	I do not want you to be unaware , brethren , that many times I planned to come to you ( though I was prevented until now ) — so I might have some fruit among you also , just as I have among the rest of the nations .
45001014	I have an obligation to both Greeks and barbarians , to both the wise and the foolish .
45001015	So I am eager to proclaim the Good News also to you who are in Rome .
45001016	For I am not ashamed of the Good News , for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who trusts — to the Jew first and also to the Greek .
45001017	In it the righteousness of God is revealed , from trust to trust . As it is written , “ But the righteous shall live by emunah . ”
45001018	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men . In unrighteousness they suppress the truth ,
45001019	because what can be known about God is plain to them — for God has shown it to them .
45001020	His invisible attributes — His eternal power and His divine nature — have been clearly seen ever since the creation of the world , being understood through the things that have been made . So people are without excuse —
45001021	for even though they knew God , they did not glorify Him as God or give Him thanks . Instead , their thinking became futile , and their senseless hearts were made dark .
45001022	Claiming to be wise , they became fools .
45001023	They exchanged the glory of the immortal God for an image in the form of mortal man and birds and four-footed beasts and creeping things .
45001024	Therefore God gave them over in the evil desires of their hearts to impurity , to dishonor their bodies with one another .
45001025	They traded the truth of God for a lie and worshiped and served the creation rather than the Creator , who is blessed forever . Amen .
45001026	For this reason God gave them up to shameful passions . Even their women exchanged natural relations for what is against nature .
45001027	Likewise the men abandoned natural relations with women and were burning with passion toward one another — men committing shameful acts with other men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error .
45001028	And just as they did not see fit to recognize God , God gave them over to a depraved mind , to do what is not fitting .
45001029	They became filled with all unrighteousness , wickedness , greed , evil . They are full of envy , murder , strife , deceit , malice . They are gossips ,
45001030	slanderers , God-haters , insolent , haughty , boastful , inventors of evil , disobedient to parents .
45001031	They are foolish , faithless , heartless , ruthless .
45001032	Though they know God’s righteous decree — that those who practice such things deserve death — they not only do them but also approve of others who practice the same .
45002001	Therefore you are without excuse , O man — every one of you who is judging . For by whatever you judge another , you condemn yourself . For you who judge practice the same things .
45002002	We know that God’s judgment on those who practice such things is based on truth .
45002003	But you , O man — judging those practicing such things yet doing the same — do you suppose that you will escape the judgment of God ?
45002004	Or do you belittle the riches of His kindness and tolerance and patience — not realizing that God’s kindness leads you to repentance ?
45002005	But by your hard and unrepentant heart , you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath , when God’s righteous judgment is revealed .
45002006	He will pay back each person according to his deeds .
45002007	To those who by perseverance in doing good are seeking glory , honor , and immortality — eternal life .
45002008	But to those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth , but obey unrighteousness — wrath and fury .
45002009	There will be trouble and hardship for every human soul that does evil — to the Jew first and also to the Greek .
45002010	But there will be glory , honor , and shalom to everyone who does good — to the Jew first and also to the Greek .
45002011	For there is no partiality with God .
45002012	For all who have sinned outside of Torah will also perish outside of Torah , and all who have sinned according to Torah will be judged by Torah .
45002013	For it is not the hearers of Torah who are righteous before God ; rather , it is the doers of Torah who will be justified .
45002014	For when Gentiles , who do not have the Torah , do by nature the things of the Torah , they are a law to themselves even though they do not have the Torah .
45002015	They show that the work of the Torah is written in their hearts , their conscience bearing witness and their thoughts switching between accusing or defending them
45002016	on the day when God judges the secrets of men according to my Good News through Messiah Yeshua .
45002017	But if you call yourself Jewish and rely upon the Torah and boast in God
45002018	and know His will and determine what matters because you are instructed from the Torah —
45002019	and you are sure that you are a guide to the blind , a light to those who are in darkness ,
45002020	a corrector of the foolish , a teacher of the immature , having in the Torah the embodiment of knowledge and the truth —
45002021	you then who teach another , do you not teach yourself ? You who preach not to steal , do you steal ?
45002022	You who say not to commit adultery , do you commit adultery ? You who detest idols , do you rob temples ?
45002023	You who take pride in the Torah , through your violation of the Torah , do you dishonor God ?
45002024	For as it is written , “ the name of God is slandered among the nations because of you . ”
45002025	Circumcision is indeed worthwhile if you keep the Torah ; but if you break the Torah , your circumcision has become uncircumcision .
45002026	Therefore , if the uncircumcised keeps the righteous decrees of the Torah , will not his uncircumcision be counted as circumcision ?
45002027	Indeed , the one not circumcised physically who fulfills the Torah will judge you who — even with the written code and circumcision — break the Torah .
45002028	For one is not a Jew who is one outwardly , nor is circumcision something visible in the flesh .
45002029	Rather , the Jew is one inwardly , and circumcision is of the heart — in Ruach not in letter . His praise is not from men , but from God .
45003001	Then what is the advantage of being Jewish ? Or what is the benefit of circumcision ?
45003002	Much in every way . First of all , they were entrusted with the sayings of God .
45003003	So what if some did not trust ? Will their lack of faith nullify God’s faithfulness ?
45003004	May it never be ! Let God be true even if every man is a liar , as it is written , “ that You may be righteous in Your words and prevail when You are judged . ”
45003005	But if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God , what shall we say ? God is not unrighteous to inflict wrath , is He ? ( I am speaking in human terms . )
45003006	May it never be ! For otherwise , how will God judge the world ?
45003007	But if by my lie the truth of God abounds to His glory , why am I still judged as a sinner ?
45003008	And why not say , “ Let us do evil , so that good may come ” — just as we are being slandered and as some claim that we say . Their condemnation is deserved !
45003009	What then ? Are we better than they ? No , not at all . For we have already made the case that all — both Jewish and Greek people — are under sin .
45003010	As it is written , “ There is no one righteous — no , not one .
45003011	There is no one who understands , no one who seeks after God .
45003012	All have turned aside ; together they have become worthless . There is no one who does good — no , not even one !
45003013	Their throat is an open grave ; with their tongues they keep deceiving . The poison of vipers is under their lips .
45003014	Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness .
45003015	Their feet are swift to shed blood .
45003016	Ruin and misery are in their paths ,
45003017	and the way of shalom they have not known .
45003018	There is no fear of God before their eyes . ”
45003019	Now we know that whatever the Torah says , it says to those within the Torah , so that every mouth may be shut and the whole world may become accountable to God .
45003020	For no human , on the basis of Torah observance , will be set right in His sight — for through the Torah comes awareness of sin .
45003021	But now God’s righteousness apart from the Torah has been revealed , to which the Torah and the Prophets bear witness —
45003022	namely , the righteousness of God through putting trust in Messiah Yeshua , to all who keep on trusting . For there is no distinction ,
45003023	for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God .
45003024	They are set right as a gift of His grace , through the redemption that is in Messiah Yeshua .
45003025	God set forth Yeshua as an atonement , through faith in His blood , to show His righteousness in passing over sins already committed .
45003026	Through God’s forbearance , He demonstrates His righteousness at the present time — that He Himself is just and also the justifier of the one who puts his trust in Yeshua .
45003027	Where , then , is boasting ? It is excluded . By what principle ? Of works ? No , but by the principle of faith .
45003028	For we consider a person to be set right apart from Torah observance .
45003029	Is God the God of the Jewish people only ? Is He not also the God of the Gentiles ? Yes , of the Gentiles also .
45003030	Since God is One , He will set right the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith .
45003031	Do we then nullify the Torah through faithfulness ? May it never be ! On the contrary , we uphold the Torah .
45004001	What then shall we say that Abraham , our forefather according to the flesh , has found ?
45004002	For if Abraham was set right by works , he has something to boast about — but not before God .
45004003	For what does the Scripture say ? “ Abraham believed God , and it was credited to him as righteousness . ”
45004004	Now to the one who works , the pay is not credited as a gift , but as what is due .
45004005	But to the one who does not work , but trusts in Him who justifies the ungodly , his trust is credited as righteousness —
45004006	just as David also speaks of the blessing on the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works :
45004007	“ Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven and whose sins are covered .
45004008	Blessed is the man whose sin Adonai will never count against him . ”
45004009	Is this blessing then only on the circumcised , or also on the uncircumcised ? For we say , “ trust was credited to Abraham as righteousness . ”
45004010	In what state then was it credited ? While circumcised , or uncircumcised ? Not while circumcised , but while uncircumcised !
45004011	And he received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness of the trust he had while he was uncircumcised , so he might be the father of all who are trusting while uncircumcised — that righteousness might be credited to them as well .
45004012	Also he is the father of the circumcised , to those not only circumcised but also walking in the footsteps of the trust of our father Abraham before his circumcision .
45004013	For the promise to Abraham or to his seed — to become heir of the world — was not through law , but through the righteousness based on trust .
45004014	For if those who are of the Torah are heirs , trust has become empty and the promise is made ineffective .
45004015	For the Torah brings about wrath ; but where there is no law , neither is there a violation .
45004016	For this reason it depends on trust , so that the promise according to grace might be guaranteed to all the offspring — not only to those of the Torah but also to those of the faith of Abraham . He is the father of us all
45004017	( as it is written , “ I have made you a father of many nations ” ) . He is our father in the sight of God in whom he trusted , who gives life to the dead and calls into existence that which does not exist .
45004018	In hope beyond hope , he trusted that he would become the father of many nations according to what was spoken — “ So shall your descendants be . ”
45004019	And without becoming weak in faith , he considered his own body — as good as dead , since he was already a hundred years old — and the deadness of Sarah’s womb .
45004020	Yet he did not waver in unbelief concerning the promise of God . Rather , he was strengthened in faith , giving glory to God .
45004021	He was fully convinced that what God has promised , He also is able to do .
45004022	That is why “ it was credited to him as righteousness . ”
45004023	Now not only for his sake was it written that it was credited to him ,
45004024	but for our sake as well . It is credited to us as those who trust in Him who raised Yeshua our Lord from the dead .
45004025	He was handed over for our transgressions and raised up for the sake of setting us right .
45005001	Therefore , having been made righteous by trusting , we have shalom with God through our Lord Yeshua the Messiah .
45005002	Through Him we also have gained access by faith into this grace in which we stand and boast in the hope of God’s glory .
45005003	And not only that , but we also boast in suffering — knowing that suffering produces perseverance ;
45005004	and perseverance , character ; and character , hope .
45005005	And hope does not disappoint , because God’s love has been poured into our hearts through the Ruach ha-Kodesh who was given to us .
45005006	For while we were still helpless , at the right time Messiah died for the ungodly .
45005007	For rarely will anyone die for a righteous man — though perhaps for a good man someone might even dare to die .
45005008	But God demonstrates His own love toward us , in that while we were yet sinners , Messiah died for us .
45005009	How much more then , having now been set right by His blood , shall we be saved from God’s wrath through Him .
45005010	For if , while we were yet enemies , we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son , how much more , having been reconciled , shall we be saved by His life .
45005011	And not only that , but we also boast in God through our Lord Yeshua the Messiah , through whom we have now received reconciliation .
45005012	So then , just as sin came into the world through one man and death through sin , in the same way death spread to all men because all sinned .
45005013	For up until the Torah , sin was in the world ; but sin does not count as sin when there is no law .
45005014	Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses , even over those who had not sinned in a manner similar to the violation of Adam , who is a pattern of the One to come .
45005015	But the gracious gift is not like the transgression . For if many died because of the transgression of one man , how much more did the grace of God overflow to many through the gift of one Man — Yeshua the Messiah .
45005016	Moreover , the gift is not like what happened through the one who sinned . For on the one hand , the judgment from one violation resulted in condemnation ; but on the other hand , the gracious gift following many transgressions resulted in justification .
45005017	For if by the one man’s transgression , death reigned through the one , how much more shall those who receive the overflow of grace and the gift of righteousness reign in life through the One , Messiah Yeshua .
45005018	So then , through the transgression of one , condemnation came to all men ; likewise , through the righteousness of one came righteousness of life to all men .
45005019	For just as through the disobedience of one man , many were made sinners , so also through the obedience of one man , many will be set right forever .
45005020	Now the Torah came in so that transgression might increase . But where sin increased , grace overflowed even more —
45005021	so that just as sin reigned in death , so also grace might reign through righteousness , to eternal life through Messiah Yeshua our Lord .
45006001	What shall we say then ? Are we to continue in sin so that grace may abound ?
45006002	May it never be ! How can we who died to sin still live in it ?
45006003	Or do you not know that all of us who were immersed into Messiah Yeshua were immersed into His death ?
45006004	Therefore we were buried together with Him through immersion into death — in order that just as Messiah was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father , so we too might walk in newness of life .
45006005	For if we have become joined together in the likeness of His death , certainly we also will be joined together in His resurrection —
45006006	knowing our old man was crucified with Him so that the sinful body might be done away with , so we no longer serve sin .
45006007	For he who has died is set free from sin .
45006008	Now if we have died with Messiah , we believe that we shall also live with Him .
45006009	We know that Messiah , having been raised from the dead , no longer dies ; death no longer is master over Him .
45006010	For the death He died , He died to sin once for all ; but the life He lives , He lives to God .
45006011	So also continually count yourselves both dead to sin and alive to God in Messiah Yeshua .
45006012	Therefore do not let sin rule in your mortal body so that you obey its desires .
45006013	And do not keep yielding your body parts to sin as tools of wickedness ; but yield yourselves to God as those alive from the dead , and your body parts as tools of righteousness to God .
45006014	For sin shall not be master over you , for you are not under law but under grace .
45006015	What then ? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace ? May it never be !
45006016	Do you not know that to whatever you yield yourselves as slaves for obedience , you are slaves to what you obey — whether to sin resulting in death , or to obedience resulting in righteousness ?
45006017	But thanks be to God that though you were slaves of sin , you wholeheartedly obeyed the form of teaching under which you were placed ;
45006018	and after you were set free from sin , you became enslaved to righteousness .
45006019	I speak in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh . For just as you yielded your body parts as slaves to uncleanness and lawlessness , leading to more lawlessness , so now yield your body parts as slaves to righteousness , resulting in holiness .
45006020	For when you were slaves of sin , you were free with regard to righteousness .
45006021	So then , what outcome did you have that you are now ashamed of ? For the end of those things is death .
45006022	But now , having been set free from sin and having become enslaved to God , you have your fruit resulting in holiness . And the outcome is eternal life .
45006023	For sin’s payment is death , but God’s gracious gift is eternal life in Messiah Yeshua our Lord .
45007001	Or do you not know , brethren ( for I speak to those who know law ) , that the law is master over a person as long as he lives ?
45007002	For the married woman is bound by law to her husband while he lives ; but if the husband dies , she is released from the law concerning the husband .
45007003	So then , if she is joined to another man while her husband is living , she will be called an adulteress . But if her husband dies , she is free from the law — so she is not an adulteress , though she is joined to another man .
45007004	Therefore , my brethren , you also were made dead to the Torah through the body of Messiah , so that you might be joined to another — the One who was raised from the dead — in order that we might bear fruit for God .
45007005	For when we were in the flesh , the sinful passions that came through the Torah were working in our body parts to bear fruit for death .
45007006	But now we have been released from the law , having died to what confined us , so that we serve in the new way of the Ruach and not in the old way of the letter .
45007007	What shall we say then ? Is the Torah sin ? May it never be ! On the contrary , I would not have known sin except through the Torah . For I would not have known about coveting if the Torah had not said , “ You shall not covet . ”
45007008	But sin , taking an opportunity , worked in me through the commandment all kinds of coveting . For apart from the Torah , sin is dead .
45007009	Once I was alive apart from the Torah ; but when the commandment came , sin came to life
45007010	and I died . The commandment meant for life was found to cause death .
45007011	Sin , taking an opportunity through the commandment , deceived me and through it killed me .
45007012	So then , the Torah is holy , and the commandment is holy and righteous and good .
45007013	Therefore did that which is good become death to me ? May it never be ! Rather it was sin working death in me — through that which is good — so that sin might be shown to be sin , and that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful .
45007014	For we know that the Torah is spiritual ; but I am of the flesh , sold to sin .
45007015	For I do not understand what I am doing — for what I do not want , this I practice ; but what I hate , this I do .
45007016	But if I do what I do not want to do , then I agree with the Torah — that it is good .
45007017	So now it is no longer I doing it , but sin dwelling in me .
45007018	For I know that nothing good dwells in me — that is , in my flesh . For to will is present in me , but to do the good is not .
45007019	For the good that I want , I do not do ; but the evil that I do not want , this I practice .
45007020	But if I do what I do not want , it is no longer I doing it , but sin that dwells in me .
45007021	So I find the principle — that evil is present in me , the one who wants to do good .
45007022	For I delight in the Torah of God with respect to the inner man ,
45007023	but I see a different law in my body parts , battling against the law of my mind and bringing me into bondage under the law of sin which is in my body parts .
45007024	Miserable man that I am ! Who will rescue me from this body of death ?
45007025	Thanks be to God — it is through Messiah Yeshua our Lord ! So then , with my mind I myself serve the Torah of God ; but with my flesh , I serve the law of sin .
45008001	Therefore , there is now no condemnation for those who are in Messiah Yeshua .
45008002	For the law of the Ruach of life in Messiah Yeshua has set you free from the law of sin and death .
45008003	For what was impossible for the Torah — since it was weakened on account of the flesh — God has done . Sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and as a sin offering , He condemned sin in the flesh —
45008004	so that the requirement of the Torah might be fulfilled in us , who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Ruach .
45008005	For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh , but those who live according to the Ruach set their minds on the things of the Ruach .
45008006	For the mindset of the flesh is death , but the mindset of the Ruach is life and shalom .
45008007	For the mindset of the flesh is hostile toward God , for it does not submit itself to the law of God — for it cannot .
45008008	So those who are in the flesh cannot please God .
45008009	However , you are not in the flesh but in the Ruach — if indeed the Ruach Elohim dwells in you . Now if anyone does not have the Ruach of Messiah , he does not belong to Him .
45008010	But if Messiah is in you , though the body is dead because of sin , yet the spirit is alive because of righteousness .
45008011	And if the Ruach of the One who raised Yeshua from the dead dwells in you , the One who raised Messiah Yeshua from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Ruach who dwells in you .
45008012	So then , brethren , we do not owe anything to the flesh , to live according to the flesh .
45008013	For if you live according to the flesh , you must die ; but if by the Ruach you put to death the deeds of the body , you shall live .
45008014	For all who are led by the Ruach Elohim , these are sons of God .
45008015	For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall again into fear ; rather , you received the Ruach of adoption , by whom we cry , “ Abba ! Father ! ”
45008016	The Ruach Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God .
45008017	And if children , also heirs — heirs of God and joint-heirs with Messiah — if indeed we suffer with Him so that we may also be glorified with Him .
45008018	For I consider the sufferings of this present time not worthy to be compared with the coming glory to be revealed to us .
45008019	For the creation eagerly awaits the revelation of the sons of God .
45008020	For the creation was subjected to futility — not willingly but because of the One who subjected it — in hope
45008021	that the creation itself also will be set free from bondage to decay into the glorious freedom of the children of God .
45008022	For we know that the whole creation groans together and suffers birth pains until now —
45008023	and not only creation , but even ourselves . We ourselves , who have the firstfruits of the Ruach , groan inwardly as we eagerly wait for adoption — the redemption of our body .
45008024	For in hope we were saved . But hope that is seen is not hope . For who hopes for what he sees ?
45008025	But if we hope for what we do not see , then we eagerly wait for it with perseverance .
45008026	In the same way , the Ruach helps in our weakness . For we do not know how to pray as we should , but the Ruach Himself intercedes for us with groans too deep for words .
45008027	And He who searches the hearts knows the mind of the Ruach , because He intercedes for the kedoshim according to the will of God .
45008028	Now we know that all things work together for good for those who love God , who are called according to His purpose .
45008029	For those whom He foreknew He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son , so that He might be the firstborn among many brethren .
45008030	And those whom He predestined , He also called ; and those whom He called , He also justified ; and those whom He justified , He also glorified .
45008031	What then shall we say in view of these things ? If God is for us , who can be against us ?
45008032	He who did not spare His own Son but gave Him up for us all , how shall He not also with Him freely give us all things ?
45008033	Who shall bring a charge against God’s elect ? It is God who justifies .
45008034	Who is the one who condemns ? It is Messiah , who died , and moreover was raised , and is now at the right hand of God and interceding for us .
45008035	Who shall separate us from the love of Messiah ? Shall tribulation , or distress , or persecution , or famine , or nakedness , or danger , or sword ?
45008036	As it is written , “ For Your sake we are being put to death all day long ; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter . ”
45008037	But in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us .
45008038	For I am convinced that neither death nor life , nor angels nor principalities , nor things present nor things to come , nor powers ,
45008039	nor height nor depth , nor any other created thing will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Messiah Yeshua our Lord .
45009001	I tell the truth in Messiah — I do not lie , my conscience assuring me in the Ruach ha-Kodesh —
45009002	that my sorrow is great and the anguish in my heart unending .
45009003	For I would pray that I myself were cursed , banished from Messiah for the sake of my people — my own flesh and blood ,
45009004	who are Israelites . To them belong the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the Torah and the Temple service and the promises .
45009005	To them belong the patriarchs — and from them , according to the flesh , the Messiah , who is over all , God , blessed forever . Amen .
45009006	But it is not as though the word of God has failed . For not all those who are descended from Israel are Israel ,
45009007	nor are they all children because they are Abraham’s seed ; rather , “ Your seed shall be called through Isaac . ”
45009008	That is , it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God ; rather , the children of the promise are counted as seed .
45009009	For the word of promise is this : “ At this time I will come , and Sarah shall have a son . ”
45009010	And not only this , but also Rebecca having twins , from one act with our father Isaac .
45009011	Yet before the sons were even born and had not done anything good or bad — so that God’s purpose and choice might stand not because of works but because of Him who calls —
45009012	it was said to her , “ The older shall serve the younger . ”
45009013	As it is written , “ Jacob I loved , but Esau I hated . ”
45009014	What shall we say then ? There is no injustice with God , is there ? May it never be !
45009015	For to Moses He says , “ I will have mercy on whom I have mercy , and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion . ”
45009016	So then it does not depend on the one who wills or the one who strives , but on God who shows mercy .
45009017	For the Scripture says to Pharaoh , “ For this very purpose I raised you up — to demonstrate My power in you , so My name might be proclaimed in all the earth . ”
45009018	So then He has mercy on whom He wills , and He hardens whom He wills .
45009019	You will say to me then , “ Why does He still find fault ? For who has resisted His will ? ”
45009020	But who in the world are you , O man , who talks back to God ? Will what is formed say to the one who formed it , “ Why did you make me like this ? ”
45009021	Does the potter have no right over the clay , to make from the same lump one vessel for honor and another for common use ?
45009022	Now what if God , willing to demonstrate His wrath and to make His power known , endured with much patience vessels of wrath designed for destruction ?
45009023	And what if He did so to make known the riches of His glory on vessels of mercy , which He prepared beforehand for glory ?
45009024	Even us He called — not only from the Jewish people , but also from the Gentiles —
45009025	as He says also in Hosea , “ I will call those who were not My people , ‘ My people , ’ and her who was not loved , ‘ Beloved . ’
45009026	And it shall be that in the place where it was said to them , ‘ You are not My people , ’ there they shall be called sons of the living God . ”
45009027	Isaiah cries out concerning Israel , “ Though the number of B’nei-Israel be as the sand of the sea , only the remnant shall be saved .
45009028	For Adonai will carry out His word upon the earth , bringing it to an end and finishing quickly . ”
45009029	And just as Isaiah foretold , “ Unless Adonai-Tzva’ot had left us seed , we would have become like Sodom and resembled Gomorrah . ”
45009030	What shall we say then ? That Gentiles , who did not pursue righteousness , attained righteousness — that is , a righteousness of faith .
45009031	But Israel , who pursued a Torah of righteousness , did not reach the Torah .
45009032	Why ? Because they pursued it not by faith , but as if it were from works . They stumbled over the stone of stumbling ,
45009033	just as it is written , “ Behold , I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense , and whoever believes in Him shall not be put to shame . ”
45010001	Brethren , my heart’s desire and my prayer to God for Israel is for their salvation .
45010002	For I testify about them that they have zeal for God — but not based on knowledge .
45010003	For being ignorant of God's righteousness and seeking to establish their own , they did not submit themselves to the righteousness of God .
45010004	For Messiah is the goal of the Torah as a means to righteousness for everyone who keeps trusting .
45010005	For Moses writes about the righteousness that is based on Torah , “ The man who does these things shall live by them . ”
45010006	But the righteousness based on faith speaks in this way : “ Do not say in your heart , ‘ Who will go up into heaven ? ’ ( that is , to bring Messiah down ) ,
45010007	or , ‘ Who will go down into the abyss ? ’ ( that is , to bring Messiah up from the dead ) . ”
45010008	But what does it say ? “ The word is near you , in your mouth and in your heart ” — that is , the word of faith that we are proclaiming .
45010009	For if you confess with your mouth that Yeshua is Lord , and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead , you will be saved .
45010010	For with the heart it is believed for righteousness , and with the mouth it is confessed for salvation .
45010011	For the Scripture says , “ Whoever trusts in Him will not be put to shame . ”
45010012	For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek , for the same Lord is Lord of all — richly generous to all who call on Him .
45010013	For “ Everyone who calls upon the name of Adonai shall be saved . ”
45010014	How then shall they call on the One in whom they have not trusted ? And how shall they trust in the One they have not heard of ? And how shall they hear without someone proclaiming ?
45010015	And how shall they proclaim unless they are sent ? As it is written , “ How beautiful are the feet of those who proclaim good news of good things ! ”
45010016	But not all heeded the Good News . For Isaiah says , “ Adonai , who has believed our report ? ”
45010017	So faith comes from hearing , and hearing by the word of Messiah .
45010018	But I say , have they never heard ? Indeed they have , for “ Their voice has gone out into all the earth , and their words to the ends of the world . ”
45010019	But I say , did Israel not understand ? First Moses says , “ I will provoke you to jealousy by those who are not a nation , with a nation empty of understanding I will vex you . ”
45010020	And Isaiah is so bold as to say , “ I was found by those who did not seek Me ; I became visible to those who did not ask for Me . ”
45010021	But about Israel He says , “ All day long I stretched forth my hands to a disobedient and contrary people . ”
45011001	I say then , God has not rejected His people , has He ? May it never be ! For I too am an Israelite , of the seed of Abraham , of the tribe of Benjamin .
45011002	God has not rejected His people whom He knew beforehand . Or do you not know what the Scripture says about Elijah , how he pleads with God against Israel ?
45011003	“ Adonai , they have killed your prophets , they have destroyed your altars ; I alone am left , and they are seeking my life . ”
45011004	But what is the divine response to him ? “ I have kept for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal . ”
45011005	So in the same way also at this present time there has come to be a remnant according to God’s gracious choice .
45011006	But if it is by grace , it is no longer by works ; otherwise grace would no longer be grace .
45011007	What then ? What Israel is seeking , it has not obtained ; but the elect obtained it , and the rest were hardened —
45011008	just as it is written , “ God gave them a spirit of stupor , eyes not to see and ears not to hear , until this very day . ”
45011009	And David says , “ Let their table become a snare and a trap , a stumbling block and a retribution for them .
45011010	Let their eyes be darkened so they do not see , and bend their back continually . ”
45011011	I say then , they did not stumble so as to fall , did they ? May it never be ! But by their false step salvation has come to the Gentiles , to provoke Israel to jealousy .
45011012	Now if their transgression leads to riches for the world , and their loss riches for the Gentiles , then how much more their fullness !
45011013	But I am speaking to you who are Gentiles . Insofar as I am a shaliach to the Gentiles , I spotlight my ministry
45011014	if somehow I might provoke to jealousy my own flesh and blood and save some of them .
45011015	For if their rejection leads to the reconciliation of the world , what will their acceptance be but life from the dead ?
45011016	If the firstfruit is holy , so is the whole batch of dough ; and if the root is holy , so are the branches .
45011017	But if some of the branches were broken off and you — being a wild olive — were grafted in among them and became a partaker of the root of the olive tree with its richness ,
45011018	do not boast against the branches . But if you do boast , it is not you who support the root but the root supports you .
45011019	You will say then , “ Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in . ”
45011020	True enough . They were broken off because of unbelief , and you stand by faith . Do not be arrogant , but fear —
45011021	for if God did not spare the natural branches , neither will He spare you .
45011022	Notice then the kindness and severity of God : severity toward those who fell ; but God's kindness toward you , if you continue in His kindness ; otherwise you too will be cut off !
45011023	And they also , if they do not continue in their unbelief , will be grafted in ; for God is able to graft them in again .
45011024	For if you were cut out of that which by nature is a wild olive tree , and grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree , how much more will these natural branches be grafted into their own olive tree ?
45011025	For I do not want you , brethren , to be ignorant of this mystery — lest you be wise in your own eyes — that a partial hardening has come upon Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in ;
45011026	and in this way all Israel will be saved , as it is written , “ The Deliverer shall come out of Zion . He shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob .
45011027	And this is My covenant with them , when I take away their sins . ”
45011028	Concerning the Good News , they are hostile for your sake ; but concerning chosenness , they are loved on account of the fathers —
45011029	for the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable .
45011030	For just as you once were disobedient to God but now have been shown mercy because of their disobedience ,
45011031	in like manner these also have now been disobedient with the result that , because of the mercy shown to you , they also may receive mercy .
45011032	For God has shut up all in disobedience , so that He might show mercy to all .
45011033	O the depth of the riches , both of the wisdom and knowledge of God ! How unsearchable are His judgments and how incomprehensible His ways !
45011034	For “ who has known the mind of Adonai , or who has been His counselor ? ”
45011035	Or “ who has first given to Him , that it shall be repaid to him ? ”
45011036	For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things . To Him be the glory forever ! Amen .
45012001	I urge you therefore , brethren , by the mercies of God , to present your bodies as a living sacrifice — holy , acceptable to God — which is your spiritual service .
45012002	Do not be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind , so that you may discern what is the will of God — what is good and acceptable and perfect .
45012003	For through the grace given me , I say to everyone among you not to think more highly of yourself than you ought to think — but to use sound judgment , as God has assigned to each person a measure of faith .
45012004	For just as we have many parts in one body — and all the parts do not have the same function —
45012005	so we , who are many , are one body in Messiah and everyone parts of one another .
45012006	We have gifts that differ according to the grace that was given to us — if prophecy , in proportion to our faith ;
45012007	if service , in our serving ; or the one who teaches , in his teaching ;
45012008	or the one who exhorts , in his exhortation ; the one who gives , in generosity ; the one who leads , with diligence ; the one who shows mercy , with cheerfulness .
45012009	Let love be without hypocrisy — detesting what is evil , holding fast to the good .
45012010	Be tenderly devoted to one another in brotherly love ; outdo one another in giving honor .
45012011	Do not be lagging in zeal ; be fervent in spirit . Keep serving the Lord ,
45012012	rejoicing in hope , enduring in distress , persisting in prayer ,
45012013	contributing to the needs of the kedoshim , extending hospitality .
45012014	Bless those who persecute you — bless and do not curse .
45012015	Rejoice with those who rejoice ; weep with those who weep .
45012016	Live in harmony with one another ; do not be proud , but associate with the lowly . Do not be wise in your own eyes .
45012017	Repay no one evil for evil ; give thought to what is good in the eyes of all people .
45012018	If possible , so far as it depends on you , live in shalom with all people .
45012019	Never take your own revenge , loved ones , but give room for God’s wrath — for it is written , “ Vengeance is Mine ; I will repay , ” says Adonai .
45012020	Rather , “ If your enemy is hungry , feed him ; if he is thirsty , give him a drink . For by doing so you will heap coals of fire upon his head . ”
45012021	Do not be overcome by evil , but overcome evil with good .
45013001	Let every person submit himself to the governing authorities . For there is no authority except from God , and those that exist are put in place by God .
45013002	So whoever opposes the authority has resisted God’s direction , and those who have resisted will bring judgment on themselves .
45013003	For leaders cause no fear for good behavior , but for bad . Now if you do not want to fear the authority , do what is good and you will get his approval —
45013004	for he is God’s servant to you for your good . But if you do evil , be afraid — for he does not carry the sword for no reason ; for he is God’s servant , an avenger who inflicts punishment on the evildoer .
45013005	Therefore it is necessary to be in submission — not only because of punishment but also because of conscience .
45013006	For this reason you also pay taxes , for the authorities are God’s servants , attending diligently to this very thing .
45013007	Pay to everyone what is due them — tribute to whom tribute is due ; tax to whom tax is due ; respect to whom respect is due ; honor to whom honor is due .
45013008	Owe no one anything except to love one another , for the one who loves another has fulfilled the Torah .
45013009	For the commandments — “ You shall not commit adultery , you shall not murder , you shall not steal , you shall not covet , ” and any other commandment — are summed up in this word : “ You shall love your neighbor as yourself . ”
45013010	Love does no harm to a neighbor ; therefore love is the fullness of the Torah .
45013011	Besides this , you know the time — that it is already the hour for you to awaken from sleep ; for now our salvation is nearer than when we first came to trust .
45013012	The night is almost gone and the day is near , so let us put off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light .
45013013	Let us walk properly as in the day — not in carousing and drunkenness , not in sexual promiscuity and sensuality , not in strife and envy .
45013014	Instead , put on the Lord Messiah Yeshua , and stop making provision for the flesh — for its cravings .
45014001	Now accept the one who is weak in faith , but not for the purpose of disputes about opinions .
45014002	One person has faith to eat anything , but the weak eats only vegetables .
45014003	Don’t let the one who eats disparage the one who does not eat , and don’t let the one who does not eat judge the one who eats , for God has accepted him .
45014004	Who are you to judge another’s servant ? Before his own master he stands or falls . Yes , he shall stand , for the Lord is able to make him stand .
45014005	One person esteems one day over another while another judges every day alike . Let each be fully convinced in his own mind .
45014006	The one who observes that day does so to the Lord . The one who eats , eats to the Lord , for he gives thanks to God ; and the one who abstains , abstains to the Lord , and he gives thanks to God .
45014007	For none of us lives for himself , and none dies for himself .
45014008	For if we live , we live for the Lord ; and if we die , we die for the Lord . So whether we live or die , we belong to the Lord .
45014009	For this reason Messiah died and lived again , so that He might be Lord of both the dead and the living .
45014010	But you , why do you judge your brother ? Or you too , why do you look down on your brother ? For we all will stand before the judgment seat of God .
45014011	For it is written , “ As I live , says Adonai , every knee shall bow to Me , and every tongue shall give praise to God . ”
45014012	So then each one of us shall give account of himself to God .
45014013	Therefore let us not judge one another from now on , but rather decide this — not to put a stumbling block or a trap in the way of a brother .
45014014	I know , and am persuaded in the Lord Yeshua , that nothing is unholy in itself ; but it is unholy for the one who considers it unholy .
45014015	For if your brother is grieved on account of food , you are no longer walking according to love . Do not destroy by your food the one for whom Messiah died .
45014016	Therefore do not let what is good for you be spoken of as evil —
45014017	for the kingdom of God is not about eating and drinking , but righteousness and shalom and joy in the Ruach ha-Kodesh .
45014018	For the one who serves Messiah in this manner is pleasing to God and approved by men .
45014019	So then let us pursue what makes for shalom and for the building up of one another .
45014020	Stop tearing down the work of God for the sake of food . Indeed all things are clean , but wrong for the man who by eating causes stumbling .
45014021	It is good not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything by which your brother stumbles .
45014022	The faith you have , keep it to yourself before God . How fortunate is the one who does not condemn himself for what he approves .
45014023	But the one who has doubts is condemned if he eats , because it is not of faith . And whatever is not of faith is sin .
45015001	Now we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of the powerless and not just please ourselves .
45015002	Let each of us please his neighbor for his good , for building him up .
45015003	For even Messiah did not please Himself , but as it is written , “ The insults of those who insulted You have fallen on Me . ”
45015004	For whatever was written before was written for our instruction , so that through patience and the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope .
45015005	Now may the God of patience and encouragement grant you to be like-minded with one another in the manner of Messiah Yeshua ,
45015006	so that together with one voice you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah .
45015007	Therefore accept one another just as Messiah also accepted you , to the glory of God .
45015008	For I declare that Messiah has become a servant to the circumcised for the sake of God’s truth , in order to confirm the promises given to the patriarchs
45015009	and for the Gentiles to glorify God for His mercy . As it is written , “ For this reason I will give You praise among the Gentiles , and I will sing to Your name . ”
45015010	And again it says , “ Rejoice , O Gentiles , with His people . ”
45015011	And again , “ Praise Adonai all you Gentiles , and let all the peoples praise Him . ”
45015012	And again , Isaiah says , “ There shall be a shoot of Jesse ; and the One who arises to rule the Gentiles , in Him shall the Gentiles hope . ”
45015013	Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and shalom in trusting , so you may overflow with hope in the power of the Ruach ha-Kodesh .
45015014	Now I myself am convinced about you , my brethren , that you also are full of goodness , filled with all knowledge and also able to counsel one another .
45015015	But I have written rather boldly to you on some points as a reminder — because of the grace given to me by God
45015016	to be a servant of Messiah Yeshua to the Gentiles , in priestly service to the Good News of God — so that the offering up of the Gentiles might be pleasing , made holy by the Ruach ha-Kodesh .
45015017	So in Messiah Yeshua , I have reason to boast before God .
45015018	For I will not dare to speak of anything except what Messiah accomplished through me , to bring about the obedience of the Gentiles by word and deed ,
45015019	in the power of signs and wonders , in the power of the Spirit of God . So from Jerusalem and around even to Illyricum , I have fully proclaimed the Good News of Messiah .
45015020	In this way I make it my aim to proclaim the Good News not where Messiah was already named , lest I build on another person’s foundation ,
45015021	but as it is written , “ Those who have never been told shall see , and those who have not heard shall understand . ”
45015022	For this reason I was often hindered from coming to you .
45015023	But now with no place in these regions , and since I have had a desire for many years to come to you ,
45015024	I hope to see you while traveling through when I go to Spain — and to be helped on my journey there by you , if first I may enjoy your company for a bit .
45015025	But now I am going to Jerusalem , bringing aid to the kedoshim .
45015026	For Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make some contribution for the poor among the believers in Jerusalem .
45015027	Yes , they were pleased to do so , and they are under obligation to them . For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual blessings , they also ought to serve them in material blessings .
45015028	So when I have finished delivering the collection safely to them , I will head for Spain by way of you .
45015029	Now I know that when I come to you , I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Messiah .
45015030	Now I urge you , brethren , through our Lord Yeshua the Messiah and through the love of the Ruach , to press on together with me — with prayers to God on my behalf .
45015031	Pray that I might be rescued from the unbelieving Judeans , and that my service for Jerusalem might be acceptable to the kedoshim .
45015032	Then , God willing , I may come to you in joy , and together with you find rest .
45015033	Now may the God of shalom be with you all . Amen .
45016001	Now I recommend to you our sister Phoebe — who is a shammashit of Messiah’s community at Cenchrea —
45016002	so you may receive her in the Lord , in a way worthy of kedoshim , and help her in whatever matter she may need from you . For she herself has become a patroness of many , including me as well .
45016003	Greet Prisca and Aquila , my fellow workers in Messiah Yeshua ,
45016004	who risked their own necks for my life . Not only I give them thanks , but also all of Messiah’s communities among the Gentiles .
45016005	Greet also the community that meets in their house . Greet Epaenetus whom I dearly love , who is the first fruit in Asia for Messiah .
45016006	Greet Miriam , who has worked hard for you .
45016007	Greet Andronicus and Junia , my kin and fellow prisoners who are well known among the shlichim . They were in Messiah before me .
45016008	Greet Ampliatus , whom I dearly love in the Lord .
45016009	Greet Urbanus , our fellow worker in Messiah , and Stachys whom I dearly love .
45016010	Greet Apelles , who is approved in Messiah . Greet those from the household of Aristobulus .
45016011	Greet Herodion , my kinsman . Greet those from the household of Narcissus , who are in the Lord .
45016012	Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa , workers in the Lord . Greet Persis whom I dearly love , who has worked hard in the Lord .
45016013	Greet Rufus , chosen in the Lord , and his mother — who was also a mother to me .
45016014	Greet Asyncritus , Phlegon , Hermes , Patrobas , Hermas , and the brethren with them .
45016015	Greet Philologus and Julia , Nereus and his sister , also Olympas and all the kedoshim with them .
45016016	Greet one another with a holy kiss . All of Messiah’s communities greet you .
45016017	Now I urge you , brethren , to keep your eye on those who are causing divisions and stumbling blocks , contrary to the teaching that you learned . Turn away from them .
45016018	For such people do not serve our Lord the Messiah , but only their own belly . By their smooth talk and flattery they deceive the hearts of the unsuspecting .
45016019	Your obedience has become known to all , so I rejoice over you — but I want you to be wise about what is good and innocent about what is evil .
45016020	Now the God of shalom will soon crush satan under your feet . May the grace of our Lord Yeshua be with you .
45016021	Timothy , my fellow worker , greets you ; so do Lucius and Jason and Sosipater , my kin .
45016022	I , Tertius , who wrote this letter , greet you in the Lord .
45016023	Gaius , host to me and the whole community , greets you . Erastus , the city treasurer , greets you , and so does brother Quartus .
45016025	Now to the One who is able to strengthen you according to my Good News and the proclamation of Yeshua the Messiah , according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept secret for long ages
45016026	but now is revealed and through the Writings of the Prophets has been made known to all the nations , according to the commandment of the eternal God to bring about obedience of faith —
45016027	to the only wise God , through Yeshua the Messiah , to Him be the glory forever . Amen .
46001001	Paul , called as a shaliach of Messiah Yeshua by the will of God , and Sosthenes our brother ,
46001002	To God’s community in Corinth — having been made holy in Messiah Yeshua , called as kedoshim — with all who everywhere call on the name of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah , both theirs and ours :
46001003	Grace to you and shalom from God our Father , and the Lord Yeshua the Messiah ! Thanksgiving
46001004	I always thank my God for you because of God’s grace that was given to you in Messiah Yeshua .
46001005	For in Him you were made rich in every way — in all speaking and all knowledge —
46001006	just as the evidence of Messiah was confirmed among you .
46001007	So you are not lacking in any spiritual gift , as you eagerly wait for the revealing of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah .
46001008	He will also strengthen you until the end — blameless in the Day of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah .
46001009	God is faithful , through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son , Yeshua the Messiah our Lord .
46001010	Now I urge you , brethren , through the name of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah , that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you , but that you be united in the same mind and in the same purpose .
46001011	For it has been reported to me concerning you , my brethren , by those who are from Chloe’s household , that there are rivalries among you .
46001012	I say this because you are each saying , “ I follow Paul , ” or “ I follow Apollos , ” or “ I follow Kefa , ” or “ I follow Messiah . ”
46001013	Has Messiah been divided ? Paul wasn’t crucified for you , was he ? Or were you immersed into the name of Paul ?
46001014	I thank God that I immersed none of you , except Crispus and Gaius ,
46001015	so that no one should say that I had immersed you into my own name .
46001016	( I also immersed the household of Stephanas ; besides them , I don’t recall if I immersed anyone else . )
46001017	For Messiah sent me not to immerse , but to proclaim the Good News — not with cleverness of speech , so that the cross of Messiah would not be made of no effect .
46001018	For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing , but to us who are being saved it is the power of God .
46001019	For it is written , “ I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and bring to nothing the understanding of the intelligent . ”
46001020	Where is the wise one ? Where is the Torah scholar ? Where is the debater of this age ? Hasn’t God made foolish the wisdom of the world ?
46001021	For seeing that — in God’s wisdom — the world through its wisdom did not know God , God was pleased — through the foolishness of the message proclaimed — to save those who believe .
46001022	For Jewish people ask for signs and Greek people seek after wisdom ,
46001023	but we proclaim Messiah crucified — a stumbling block to Jewish people and foolishness to Gentile people ,
46001024	but to those who are called ( both Jewish and Greek people ) , Messiah , the power of God and the wisdom of God .
46001025	For the foolishness of God is wiser than men , and the weakness of God is stronger than men .
46001026	For you see your calling , brethren , that not many are wise according to human standards , not many are powerful , and not many are born well .
46001027	Yet God chose the foolish things of the world so He might put to shame the wise ; and God chose the weak things of the world so He might put to shame the strong ;
46001028	and God chose the lowly and despised things of the world , the things that are as nothing , so He might bring to nothing the things that are —
46001029	so that no human might boast before God .
46001030	But because of Him you are in Messiah Yeshua , who became to us wisdom from God and righteousness and holiness and redemption —
46001031	so that , just as it is written , “ Let him who boasts , boast in Adonai . ”
46002001	When I came to you , brethren , I did not come with excellence of speech or wisdom , proclaiming to you the mystery of God .
46002002	For I decided not to know about anything among you except Yeshua the Messiah — and Him crucified .
46002003	I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling .
46002004	My speech and my preaching were not with persuasive words of wisdom , but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power —
46002005	so that your faith would not be in the wisdom of men but in the power of God .
46002006	We do speak wisdom , however , among those who are mature — but not a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age , who are coming to nothing .
46002007	Rather , we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery — a wisdom that has been hidden , which God destined for our glory before the ages .
46002008	None of the rulers of this age understood it — for if they had , they would not have crucified the Lord of glory .
46002009	But as it is written , “ Things no eye has seen and no ear has heard , that have not entered the heart of mankind — these things God has prepared for those who love Him . ”
46002010	But God revealed these things to us through the Ruach . For the Ruach searches all things — even the depths of God .
46002011	For who among men knows the things of a man , except the man’s spirit within him ? In the same way , no one knows the things of God except the Ruach Elohim .
46002012	Now we have received not the spirit of the world , but the Spirit who is from God — so we might come to know the things freely given to us by God .
46002013	These things we also speak — not in words taught by human wisdom but in words taught by the Ruach , explaining the spiritual to the spiritual .
46002014	Now a natural man does not accept the things of the Ruach Elohim , for they are foolishness to him ; and he cannot understand them , because they are spiritually discerned .
46002015	But the one who is spiritual discerns all things , and he himself is discerned by no one . For
46002016	“ who has known the mind of Adonai , that he will instruct Him ? ” But we have the mind of Messiah .
46003001	And I , brethren , could not speak to you as Ruach — filled but as worldly — as infants in Messiah .
46003002	I gave you milk , not solid food , for you were not yet ready . Indeed , even now you are not yet ready ,
46003003	for you are still worldly . For since there is jealousy and strife among you , aren’t you worldly and walking in a human way ?
46003004	For when one says , “ I follow Paul , ” and another , “ I follow Apollos , ” are you not mere humans ?
46003005	What then is Apollos ? And what is Paul ? Servants through whom you came to trust — and to each as the Lord gave .
46003006	I planted , Apollos watered , but God gave the increase .
46003007	So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything , but only God who makes things grow .
46003008	Now he who plants and he who waters work as one , but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor .
46003009	For we are God’s co-workers ; you are God’s field , God’s building .
46003010	According to the grace of God which was given to me , like a skilled master builder I laid a foundation , and another builds on it . But let each consider carefully how he builds on it .
46003011	For no one can lay any other foundation than what is already laid — which is Yeshua the Messiah .
46003012	Now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold , silver , precious stones , wood , hay , straw ,
46003013	each one’s work will become clear . For the Day will show it , because it is to be revealed by fire ; and the fire itself will test each one’s work — what sort it is .
46003014	If anyone’s work built on the foundation survives , he will receive a reward .
46003015	If anyone’s work is burned up , he will suffer loss — he himself will be saved , but as through fire .
46003016	Don’t you know that you are God’s temple and that the Ruach Elohim dwells among you ?
46003017	If anyone destroys God’s temple , God will destroy him ; for God’s temple is holy , and you are that temple .
46003018	Let no one deceive himself . If anyone thinks he is wise in this age , let him become a fool so he may become wise .
46003019	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in the sight of God . For it is written , “ He catches the clever in their craftiness . ”
46003020	And again , “ The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise , that they are useless . ”
46003021	So let no one boast about men . For all things are yours —
46003022	whether Paul or Apollos or Kefa , or the world or life or death , or things present or things to come . All are yours ,
46003023	and you are Messiah’s , and Messiah is God’s .
46004001	So let each one think of us in this way — as Messiah’s helpers and stewards of the mysteries of God .
46004002	In this case , moreover , what is required of stewards is to be found trustworthy .
46004003	But to me it matters very little to be judged by you or by any human court . In fact , I do not even judge myself .
46004004	For I know of nothing against myself , yet I am not justified by this . It is the Lord who judges me .
46004005	Therefore do not judge anything before the time — wait until the Lord comes . He will bring to light the things hidden in darkness and also make clear the motives of the hearts . Then the praise for each one will come from God .
46004006	Now I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit , brethren , so you might learn from us not to go beyond what is written . Then none of you will be puffed up in favor of one against the other .
46004007	For who makes you different ? And what do you have that you did not receive ? But if you did receive it , why do you boast as if you had not received it ?
46004008	Already you are full ! Already you have become rich ! Without us you have become kings ! Indeed , I wish you were kings , so we also might be kings with you !
46004009	For it seems to me that God has put us , the shlichim , on display last of all — like men sentenced to death . For we have become a spectacle to the world , both to angels and to people .
46004010	We are fools for Messiah’s sake , but you are wise in Messiah ! We are weak , but you are strong ! You are honored , but we are dishonored !
46004011	To this very hour we are both hungry and thirsty , dressed in rags and mistreated and homeless .
46004012	We toil , working with our own hands . When we are cursed , we bless . When we are persecuted , we endure .
46004013	When we are slandered , we speak kindly . We have become the scum of the earth , the dregs of all things — even to this moment .
46004014	I do not write these things to make you ashamed , but to warn you as my dearly loved children .
46004015	For though you may have ten thousand guardians in Messiah , yet you do not have many fathers . For in Messiah Yeshua , I became your father through the Good News .
46004016	I urge you therefore — be imitators of me .
46004017	For this reason I have sent you Timothy , my dearly loved and faithful child in the Lord . He will remind you of my ways in Messiah , just as I teach everywhere in every community .
46004018	Now some are puffed up , as though I were not coming to you .
46004019	But I will come to you soon , if the Lord is willing ; and I will find out not the talk of those who are puffed up , but their power .
46004020	For the kingdom of God does not consist of talk but of power .
46004021	What do you want ? Shall I come to you with a rod , or in love and a spirit of gentleness ?
46005001	It is actually reported that among you there is sexual immorality , and such immorality as is not even among the pagans — that someone has his father’s wife .
46005002	And you are puffed up ! Shouldn’t you have mourned instead , so that the one who did this deed might be removed from among you ?
46005003	For even though I am absent in body , I am present in spirit — I have already passed judgment on the one who has done this thing , as though I were present .
46005004	When you are gathered together in the name of our Lord Yeshua , I am with you in spirit . With the power of our Lord Yeshua ,
46005005	you are to turn such a fellow over to satan for the destruction of his fleshly nature , so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Yeshua .
46005006	Your boasting is no good . Don’t you know that a little hametz leavens the whole batch of dough ?
46005007	Get rid of the old hametz , so you may be a new batch , just as you are unleavened — for Messiah , our Passover Lamb , has been sacrificed .
46005008	Therefore let us celebrate the feast not with old hametz , the hametz of malice and wickedness , but with unleavened bread — the matzah of sincerity and truth .
46005009	I wrote to you in my letter not to mix together with sexually immoral people —
46005010	not at all meaning the sexually immoral people of this world or the greedy or swindlers or idolaters , for then you would have to exit the world .
46005011	But now I am writing to you not to mix together with anyone who is being called a brother if he is sexually immoral or greedy or an idolater or a slanderer or a drunkard or a swindler — not even to eat with such a fellow .
46005012	For what business do I have judging outsiders ? Don’t you judge those who are inside ?
46005013	But those who are outside , God judges . Put away the wicked fellow from among yourselves .
46006001	Does any one of you , when he has a matter against his neighbor , dare to go to court before the unrighteous and not before the kedoshim ?
46006002	Don’t you know that the kedoshim will judge the world ? And if the world is to be judged by you , are you incompetent to judge trivial matters ?
46006003	Don’t you know that we will judge angels ? How much more the matters of this life !
46006004	So if you have courts for matters of this life , why do you appoint as judges those who have no standing in the community ?
46006005	I say this to put you to shame ! Isn’t there even one wise man among you who will be able to settle disputes between his brethren ?
46006006	Instead , a brother goes to court against a brother — and before unbelievers at that !
46006007	Therefore , it is already an utter failure for you that you have lawsuits among yourselves . Why not rather be wronged ? Why not rather be cheated ?
46006008	But you yourselves do wrong and cheat — and against your brethren at that !
46006009	Or don’t you know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God ? Don’t be deceived ! The sexually immoral , idolaters , adulterers , those who practice homosexuality ,
46006010	thieves , the greedy , drunkards , slanderers , swindlers — none of these will inherit the kingdom of God .
46006011	That is what some of you were — but you were washed , you were made holy , you were set right in the name of the Lord Yeshua the Messiah and by the Ruach of our God .
46006012	“ Everything is permitted for me ” — but not everything is helpful . “ Everything is permitted for me ” — but I will not be controlled by anything .
46006013	“ Food is for the stomach , and the stomach is for food ” — but God will do away with both of them . Yet the body is not for sexual immorality but for the Lord , and the Lord is for the body .
46006014	Now God raised up the Lord and will also raise us up by His power .
46006015	Don’t you know that your bodies are members of Messiah ? Shall I then take the members of Messiah and make them members of a prostitute ? May it never be !
46006016	Or don’t you know that the one who joins himself to a prostitute is one body with her ? For it is said , “ The two shall become one flesh . ”
46006017	But the one who joins himself to the Lord is one spirit with Him .
46006018	Flee from sexual immorality ! Every other sin that a man commits is outside the body — but the one committing sexual immorality sins against his own body .
46006019	Or don’t you know that your body is a temple of the Ruach ha-Kodesh who is in you , whom you have from God , and that you are not your own ?
46006020	For you were bought with a price . Therefore glorify God in your body .
46007001	Now concerning the things about which you wrote to me , it is good for a man not to touch a woman .
46007002	But because of much immorality , let each man have his own wife , and let each woman have her own husband .
46007003	Let the husband fulfill his obligation to his wife , and likewise also the wife to her husband .
46007004	The wife does not have the rights to her own body , but the husband . Likewise also the husband does not have the rights to his own body , but the wife .
46007005	Do not deprive one another — except by mutual consent for a time , so that you may devote yourselves to prayer . Then come together again , so that satan doesn’t tempt you because of your lack of self-control .
46007006	But this I say as a concession , not as a command .
46007007	Yet I wish that all men were like me . However , each man has his own gift from God , one in this way and another that .
46007008	But I say to the unmarried and to widows that it is good for them to remain as I am .
46007009	But if they do not have self-control , let them marry . For it is better to marry than to burn with desire .
46007010	But to the married I command — not I , but the Lord — a wife is not to be separated from her husband
46007011	( but if she gets separated , let her remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband ) , and the husband is not to divorce his wife .
46007012	But to the rest I say — I , not the Lord — if any brother has a wife who is not a believer , and she agrees to live with him , he must not divorce her .
46007013	And if any woman has a husband who is not a believer , and he agrees to live with her , she must not divorce him .
46007014	For the unbelieving husband is made holy through the wife , and the unbelieving wife is made holy through her husband . Otherwise your children would be unclean , but now they are holy .
46007015	But if the unbeliever separates , let him be separated . The brother or the sister is not bound in such cases , but God has called you to shalom .
46007016	For how do you know , wife , whether you will save your husband ? Or how do you know , husband , whether you will save your wife ? Remain As You Were Called
46007017	Only , as the Lord has assigned to each one , as God has called each , let him walk in this way . I give this rule in all of Messiah’s communities .
46007018	Was anyone called when he already had been circumcised ? Let him not make himself uncircumcised . Has anyone been called while uncircumcised ? Let him not allow himself to be circumcised .
46007019	Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing — but keeping God’s commandments matters .
46007020	Let each one remain in the calling in which he was called .
46007021	Were you called as a slave ? Don’t let that bother you — but if indeed you can become free , make the most of the opportunity .
46007022	For the one who was called in the Lord as a slave is the Lord’s freedman . Likewise the one who was called while free is Messiah’s slave .
46007023	You were bought with a price ; do not become slaves of men .
46007024	Brethren , let each one — in whatever way he was called — remain that way with God .
46007025	Now concerning virgins I have no command from the Lord , but I give an opinion as one who by the Lord’s mercy is trustworthy .
46007026	I think then , because of the present distress , that it is good for a man to remain as he is .
46007027	Are you bound to a wife ? Don’t seek a divorce . Are you free from a wife ? Don’t seek a wife .
46007028	But if you marry , you have not sinned ; and if a virgin marries , she has not sinned . Yet such people will have trouble in this fleshly life , and I am trying to spare you .
46007029	But this I say , brethren — the time is short . From now on those who have wives should be as though they had none ;
46007030	and those who weep , as though not weeping ; and those who rejoice , as though not rejoicing ; and those who buy , as though not possessing ;
46007031	and those who use the world , as though not using it to the fullest . For the present form of this world is passing away .
46007032	But I want you to be free from cares . An unmarried man cares about the things of the Lord — how he may please the Lord ;
46007033	but the married man cares about the things of the world — how he may please his wife —
46007034	and he is divided . The unmarried woman , as well as the virgin , cares about the things of the Lord , so that she may be holy both in body and in spirit . But the married woman cares about the things of the world — how she may please her husband .
46007035	Now I say this for your own benefit — not to put a restraint on you , but to promote proper and constant service to the Lord without distraction .
46007036	But if any man thinks that he is behaving inappropriately toward his virgin , if the time is ripe and it is meant to be , let him do what he decides . He does not sin . Let them marry .
46007037	But he who stands firm in his heart — who has no pressure , but has power over his own will and has so determined in his own heart to keep her a virgin — he will do well .
46007038	So then both he who marries the virgin does well , and he who doesn’t marry her does better .
46007039	A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives ; but if her husband dies , she is free to be married to anyone she wishes — only in the Lord .
46007040	But in my judgment she is happier if she stays as she is — and I also think that I have the Ruach Elohim .
46008001	Now concerning idol sacrifices , we know that we all have knowledge . Knowledge puffs up , but love builds up .
46008002	If anyone thinks he knows anything , he doesn’t yet know as he ought to know .
46008003	But if anyone loves God , he is known by Him .
46008004	Therefore concerning the eating of idol sacrifices , we know that an idol is nothing in the world , and that there is no God but one .
46008005	For even if there are so-called “ gods , ” whether in heaven or on earth ( as indeed there are many “ gods ” and many “ lords ” ) ,
46008006	yet for us there is one God , the Father , from whom are all things , and we exist for Him ; and one Lord , Yeshua the Messiah , through whom are all things , and we exist through Him .
46008007	But that knowledge is not in everyone — some , so accustomed to idols up until now , eat food as an idol sacrifice ; and their conscience , being weak , is defiled .
46008008	But food will not bring us before God . We are no worse off if we do not eat and no better off if we do eat .
46008009	But watch out that this freedom of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak .
46008010	For suppose someone sees you — who have this knowledge — dining in an idol’s temple . If his conscience is weak , won’t he be emboldened to eat idol sacrifices ?
46008011	For the one who is weak is destroyed by your knowledge — the brother for whom Messiah died .
46008012	In this way , when you sin against the brethren and wound their conscience when it is weak , you sin against Messiah .
46008013	For this reason , if food causes my brother to stumble , I will never eat meat again , so that I do not cause my brother to stumble .
46009001	Am I not free ? Am I not a shaliach ? Have I not seen Yeshua our Lord ? Are you not my work in the Lord ?
46009002	If to others I am not a shaliach , at least I am to you — for you are the seal of my office of shaliach in the Lord .
46009003	My defense to those who examine me is this .
46009004	Don’t we have the right to food and drink ?
46009005	Don’t we have the right to take along a believing wife , as do the other shlichim and the Lord’s brothers and Kefa ?
46009006	Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to not work ?
46009007	What soldier ever serves at his own expense ? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat its fruit ? Or who tends a flock and does not drink its milk ?
46009008	I don’t say these things merely as a man , do I ? Doesn’t Torah also say these things ?
46009009	For it is written in the Torah of Moses , “ You shall not muzzle an ox while it is threshing . ” Is it the oxen that concern God ,
46009010	or is He speaking entirely for our sake ? Yes , it was written for our sake , because the one plowing ought to plow in hope and the one threshing in hope of a share in the crop .
46009011	If we sowed spiritual things into you , is it too much if we reap material things from you ?
46009012	If others have a share in this claim over you , shouldn’t we even more ? Nevertheless we did not use this right , but we put up with all things so that we cause no hindrance to the Good News of Messiah .
46009013	Don’t you know that those who perform the holy services eat from the Temple , and those who wait on the altar receive a share at the altar ?
46009014	So also the Lord ordered those who proclaim the Good News to get their living from the Good News .
46009015	But I have used none of these things , and I am not writing these things so it will happen this way in my case — for I would rather die than let anyone deprive me of my reason to boast .
46009016	For if I proclaim the Good News , I have no reason to boast — for pressure is put on me and woe to me if I don’t proclaim the Good News !
46009017	For if I do this of my own will , I have a reward . But if not of my own will , I have been entrusted with a commission .
46009018	What then is my reward ? That when I preach , I may present the Good News free of charge , not making use of my right in the Good News .
46009019	For though I am free from all men , I have made myself a slave to all , so that I might win over more of them .
46009020	To the Jewish people I identified as a Jew , so that I might win over the Jewish people . To those under Torah I became like one under Torah ( though not myself being under Torah ) , so that I might win over those under Torah ;
46009021	to those outside Torah , like one outside Torah ( though not being outside God’s Torah but in Messiah’s Torah ) , so that I might win over those outside Torah .
46009022	To the weak I became weak , so that I might win over the weak . I have become all things to all men , so that by all means possible I might save some .
46009023	I do it all for the sake of the Good News , so that I might be a fellow partaker of it .
46009024	Don’t you know that in a stadium the runners all run , but one receives the prize ? Run in such a way that you may win !
46009025	Every competitor exercises self-control in all respects . They do it to receive a perishable crown , but we do it to receive an imperishable one .
46009026	So I run in this way — not aimlessly . So I box in this way — not beating the air .
46009027	Rather , I punish my body and bring it into submission , so that after I have preached to others , I myself will not be disqualified .
46010001	For I do not want you to be ignorant , brethren , that our fathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea .
46010002	They all were immersed into Moses in the cloud and in the sea .
46010003	And all ate the same spiritual food ,
46010004	and all drank the same spiritual drink — for they were drinking from a spiritual rock that followed them , and the Rock was Messiah .
46010005	Nevertheless , God was not pleased with most of them , for they were struck down in the desert .
46010006	Now these things happened as examples for us , so we wouldn’t crave evil things , just as they did .
46010007	Do not be idolaters , as some of them were . As it is written , “ The people sat down to eat and drink , and rose up to play . ”
46010008	And let’s not commit sexual immorality , as some of them did — and in one day 23,000 fell .
46010009	And let’s not test the Lord , as some of them did — and were destroyed by serpents .
46010010	And let’s not grumble , as some of them did — and were destroyed by the destroying angel .
46010011	Now these things happened to them as an example , and it was written down as a warning to us — on whom the ends of the ages have come .
46010012	Therefore let the one who thinks that he stands watch out that he doesn’t fall .
46010013	No temptation has taken hold of you except what is common to mankind . But God is faithful — He will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you can handle . But with the temptation He will also provide a way of escape , so you will be able to endure it .
46010014	Therefore , my dearly loved ones , flee from idolatry .
46010015	I speak as to sensible people — judge for yourselves what I say .
46010016	The cup of blessing that we bless — isn’t it a sharing of Messiah’s blood ? The bread which we break — isn’t it a sharing of Messiah’s body ?
46010017	Since there is one bread , we who are many are one body — for we all partake of the one bread .
46010018	Consider physical Israel . Those who eat the sacrifices — aren’t they partners in the altar ?
46010019	What am I saying then — that an idol sacrifice is anything , or that an idol is anything ?
46010020	No , I’m saying that what the pagans sacrifice is to demons and not to God , and I don’t want you to become partners with demons .
46010021	You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons . You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons .
46010022	Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy ? We are not stronger than He , are we ?
46010023	“ Everything is permitted ” — but not everything is helpful . “ Everything is permitted ” — but not everything builds up .
46010024	Let no one seek his own good , but the good of his neighbor .
46010025	Eat whatever is sold in the meat market , without raising questions of conscience .
46010026	For “ the earth is the Lord’s , and its fullness . ”
46010027	If an unbeliever invites you over and you want to go , eat whatever is set before you , without raising questions of conscience .
46010028	But if anyone says to you , “ This is from an idol sacrifice , ” do not eat it , for the sake of the one who informed you , and for the sake of conscience —
46010029	not your own conscience , I mean , but the other person’s . For why is my freedom judged by another’s conscience ?
46010030	If I partake with thankfulness , why am I denounced because of something I give thanks for ?
46010031	Therefore , whether you eat or drink or whatever you do , do all to the glory of God .
46010032	Give no offense either to Jewish or Greek people or to God’s community —
46010033	just as I also try to please everyone in everything , not seeking my own benefit but the benefit of many , so that they may be saved .
46011001	Be imitators of me , just as I also am of Messiah .
46011002	Now I praise you because you remember me in everything and hold firm the traditions just as I passed them on to you .
46011003	But I want you to know that the head of every man is Messiah , and the head of the woman is the man , and the head of Messiah is God .
46011004	Every man praying or prophesying with his head covered dishonors his head .
46011005	But every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered dishonors her head . For it is one and the same as having been shaved .
46011006	For if a woman does not cover her head , let her cut off her hair . But if it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut off or to be shaved , let her cover her head .
46011007	For surely a man ought not to cover his head , since he is the image and glory of God . But the woman is the glory of man .
46011008	For man is not from woman , but woman from man .
46011009	Neither was man created for the woman’s sake , but woman for the man’s sake .
46011010	For this reason the woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head , because of the angels .
46011011	In any case — in the Lord — woman is not independent of man and man is not independent of woman .
46011012	For just as the woman came from the man , so also the man comes through the woman — but all things are from God .
46011013	Judge for yourselves — is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered ?
46011014	Doesn’t the natural order of things teach you — if a man has long hair , it is a disgrace for him ;
46011015	but if a woman has long hair , it is her glory , for her hair was given to her as a covering .
46011016	But if anyone intends to be contentious , we have no such custom — nor do God’s communities . Unity at the Lord’s Table
46011017	But in giving you this instruction I do not praise you , for when you meet together it does more harm than good .
46011018	For first of all , when you come together as Messiah’s community , I hear that there are divisions among you ; and to some extent I believe it —
46011019	for there must be factions among you , so that those among you who are tried and true may be evident .
46011020	Therefore , when you meet together in the same place , it is not to eat the Lord’s Supper —
46011021	for each one takes his own supper beforehand , and one goes hungry while another gets drunk .
46011022	What ! It is certainly not that you do not have houses , is it ? Don’t you have houses to eat and drink in ? Or do you despise God’s community and try to humiliate those who have nothing ? What shall I say to you ? Shall I praise you ? I don’t praise you for this !
46011023	For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you — that the Lord Yeshua , on the night He was betrayed , took matzah ;
46011024	and when He had given thanks , He broke it and said , “ This is My body , which is for you . Do this in memory of Me . ”
46011025	In the same way , He also took the cup , after supper , saying , “ This cup is the new covenant in My blood . Do this , as often as you drink it , in memory of Me . ”
46011026	For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup , you proclaim the Lord’s death until He comes .
46011027	Therefore whoever eats the bread or drinks the Lord’s cup in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord .
46011028	But a man must examine himself , and then let him eat of the bread and drink from the cup .
46011029	For the one who eats and drinks without recognizing the body , eats and drinks judgment on himself .
46011030	For this reason many among you are weak and sick , and quite a few have died .
46011031	For if we were judging ourselves thoroughly , we wouldn’t be coming under judgment .
46011032	But when we are judged , we are being disciplined by the Lord so that we might not be condemned along with the world .
46011033	So then , my brethren , when you come together to eat , wait for one another .
46011034	If anyone is hungry let him eat at home , so that when you meet it doesn’t lead to judgment . And the rest I will put in order when I come .
46012001	Now concerning spiritual gifts , brethren , I do not want you to be ignorant .
46012002	You know that when you were pagans , you were enticed by idols that cannot speak , and you got led astray .
46012003	Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Ruach Elohim says , “ Yeshua be cursed , ” and no one can say , “ Yeshua is Lord , ” except by the Ruach ha-Kodesh .
46012004	Now there are various kinds of gifts , but the same Ruach .
46012005	There are various kinds of service , but the same Lord .
46012006	There are various kinds of working , but the same God who works all things in all people .
46012007	But to each person is given the manifestation of the Ruach for the benefit of all .
46012008	For to one is given through the Ruach a word of wisdom , to another a word of knowledge according to the same Ruach ,
46012009	to another faith by the same Ruach , to another gifts of healings by the one Ruach ,
46012010	to another workings of miracles , to another prophecy , to another discerning of spirits , to another different kinds of tongues , to another the interpretation of tongues .
46012011	But one and the same Ruach activates all these things , distributing to each person individually as He wills .
46012012	For just as the body is one and has many parts , and all the parts of the body — though many — are one body , so also is Messiah .
46012013	For in one Ruach we were all immersed into one body — whether Jewish or Greek , slave or free — and all were made to drink of one Ruach .
46012014	For the body is not one part , but many .
46012015	If the foot says , “ Since I’m not a hand , I’m not part of the body , ” is it therefore not part of the body ?
46012016	And if the ear says , “ Since I’m not an eye , I’m not part of the body , ” is it for this reason any less part of the body ?
46012017	If the whole body were an eye , where would the hearing be ? If the whole were hearing , where would the sense of smell be ?
46012018	But now God has placed the parts — each one of them — in the body just as He desired .
46012019	If they were all one part , where would the body be ?
46012020	But now there are many parts , yet one body .
46012021	The eye cannot tell the hand , “ I don’t need you ! ” or in turn the head to the feet , “ I don’t need you ! ”
46012022	On the contrary , those parts of the body that seem to be less important are indispensable .
46012023	Those parts of the body that we think to be less honorable , we clothe with greater honor ; and our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty ;
46012024	but our presentable parts have no such need . Rather God assembled the body , giving more honor to those who are lacking ,
46012025	so that there may be no division in the body , but so that the parts may have the same care for one another .
46012026	If one part suffers , all the parts suffer together . If one part is honored , all the parts rejoice together .
46012027	Now you are the body of Messiah , and members individually .
46012028	God has put into His community first shlichim , second prophets , third teachers , then miracles , then healings , helps , leadership , various kinds of tongues .
46012029	All are not shlichim , are they ? All are not prophets , are they ? All are not teachers , are they ? All do not work miracles , do they ?
46012030	All do not have gifts of healing , do they ? All do not speak in tongues , do they ? All do not interpret , do they ?
46012031	But earnestly desire the greater gifts . And still I show you a far better way :
46013001	If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels but have not love , I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal .
46013002	If I have the gift of prophecy and know all mysteries and all knowledge , and if I have all faith so as to remove mountains but have not love , I am nothing .
46013003	If I give away all that I own and if I hand over my body so I might boast but have not love , I gain nothing .
46013004	Love is patient , love is kind , it does not envy , it does not brag , it is not puffed up ,
46013005	it does not behave inappropriately , it does not seek its own way , it is not provoked , it keeps no account of wrong ,
46013006	it does not rejoice over injustice but rejoices in the truth ;
46013007	it bears all things , it believes all things , it hopes all things , it endures all things .
46013008	Love never fails — but where there are prophecies , they will pass away ; where there are tongues , they will cease ; where there is knowledge , it will pass away .
46013009	For we know in part and we prophesy in part ;
46013010	but when that which is perfect has come , then that which is partial will pass away .
46013011	When I was a child , I spoke like a child , I thought like a child , I reasoned like a child . When I became a man , I put away childish things .
46013012	For now we see in a mirror dimly , but then face to face . Now I know in part , but then I will know fully , even as I have been fully known .
46013013	But now these three remain — faith , hope , and love . And the greatest of these is love .
46014001	Pursue love and eagerly desire spiritual gifts , but especially that you may prophesy .
46014002	For one who speaks in a tongue speaks not to people but to God — for no one understands , but in the Ruach he speaks mysteries .
46014003	But one who prophesies speaks to people for building up , urging on , and uplifting .
46014004	One who speaks in a tongue builds up himself , but one who prophesies builds up the community .
46014005	Now I want you all to speak in tongues , but even more that you would prophesy . One who prophesies is greater than one who speaks in tongues — unless he interprets , so that the community may be built up .
46014006	But now , brethren , if I come to you speaking in tongues , how will I benefit you — unless I speak to you by way of revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching ?
46014007	It is the same for lifeless things that make a sound — like a flute or a harp . If they make no distinction in the tones , how will what is played be recognized ?
46014008	For if the trumpet makes an unclear sound , who will prepare himself for battle ?
46014009	So also with you with your tongue — unless you utter speech that is intelligible , how will what is spoken be understood ? For you will be talking to the wind !
46014010	It may be that there are many kinds of languages in the world — and none without meaning .
46014011	If then I do not understand the meaning of the language , I will be a foreigner to the speaker , and the speaker will be a foreigner to me .
46014012	Likewise with you — since you are zealous for spiritual gifts , keep trying to excel for the building up of the community .
46014013	Therefore let one who speaks in a tongue pray that he may interpret .
46014014	For if I pray in a tongue , my spirit prays , but my mind is unfruitful .
46014015	What is it then ? I will pray in my spirit , but I will also pray with my mind . I will sing praises with my spirit , and I will also sing praises with my mind .
46014016	Otherwise if you give thanks and praise in the spirit , how will one filling the place of the ungifted say the “ Amen ” to your thanksgiving , since he has no idea what you’re saying ?
46014017	For you certainly give thanks well , but the other person is not built up .
46014018	I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you .
46014019	However , in Messiah’s community I would rather speak five words with my mind , so I may also instruct others , than ten thousand words in a tongue .
46014020	Brethren , stop being children in your thinking — rather , be infants in evil , but in your thinking be mature .
46014021	In the Prophets it is written , “ By those with strange tongues and by the lips of strangers I will speak to this people . And not even then will they listen to me , ” says Adonai .
46014022	Therefore tongues are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers — but prophecy is a sign not for unbelievers but for believers .
46014023	So if Messiah’s whole community comes together and everyone speaks in tongues , and uninstructed or unbelieving people come in , won’t they say that you are crazy ?
46014024	But if all are prophesying and some unbelieving or ungifted person comes in , he is convicted by all , he is called to account by all .
46014025	The secrets of his heart become known , and so he will fall down on his face and worship God , declaring , “ God really is among you ! ”
46014026	What is it then , brethren ? Whenever you come together , each one has a psalm , a teaching , a revelation , a tongue , an interpretation . Let all things be done for edification .
46014027	If someone speaks in a tongue , let it be by two or at most three , and each in turn ; and let one interpret .
46014028	But if there is no interpreter , let him keep silent in the community but speak to himself and to God .
46014029	Let two or three prophets speak , and let the others evaluate .
46014030	But if something is revealed to another sitting nearby , let the first one become silent .
46014031	For you can all prophesy one by one , so all may learn and be encouraged .
46014032	The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets ,
46014033	for God is not a God of confusion , but shalom . As in all the communities of the kedoshim ,
46014034	let women keep silent in the communities , for it is not permitted for them to speak out . Rather let them be in order , as the Torah also says .
46014035	If they want to learn something , let them ask their own husbands at home — for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak out in the community .
46014036	Did the word of God originate with you ? Or did it reach you alone ?
46014037	If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual , let him recognize that what I write to you is the Lord’s command .
46014038	But if someone does not recognize it , he is not recognized .
46014039	Therefore , brethren , be eager to prophesy , and do not forbid speaking in tongues .
46014040	But let everything be done decently and in order .
46015001	Now I make known to you , brethren , the Good News which I proclaimed to you . You also received it , and you took your stand on it ,
46015002	and by it you are being saved if you hold firm to the word I proclaimed to you — unless you believed without proper consideration .
46015003	For I also passed on to you first of all what I also received — that Messiah died for our sins according to the Scriptures ,
46015004	that He was buried , that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures ,
46015005	and that He appeared to Kefa , then to the Twelve .
46015006	Then He appeared to over five hundred brethren at one time — most of them are still alive , though some have died .
46015007	Then He appeared to Jacob , then to all the shlichim ,
46015008	and last of all , as to one untimely born , He also appeared to me .
46015009	For I am the least of the shlichim , unworthy to be called a shaliach because I persecuted God’s community .
46015010	But by the grace of God I am what I am . His grace toward me was not in vain . No , I worked harder than them all — yet not I , but the grace of God that was with me .
46015011	Whether then it is I or they , so we proclaim , and so you believed .
46015012	Now if Messiah is proclaimed — that He has been raised from the dead — how can some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead ?
46015013	But if there is no resurrection of the dead , not even Messiah has been raised !
46015014	And if Messiah has not been raised , then our proclaiming is meaningless and your faith also is meaningless .
46015015	Moreover , we are found to be false witnesses of God , because we testified about God that He raised up Messiah — whom He did not raise up , if in fact the dead are not raised .
46015016	For if the dead are not raised , not even Messiah has been raised .
46015017	And if Messiah has not been raised , your faith is futile — you are still in your sins .
46015018	Then those also who have fallen asleep in Messiah have perished .
46015019	If we have hoped in Messiah in this life alone , we are to be pitied more than all people .
46015020	But now Messiah has been raised from the dead , the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep .
46015021	For since death came through a man , the resurrection of the dead also has come through a Man .
46015022	For as in Adam all die , so also in Messiah will all be made alive .
46015023	But each in its own order : Messiah the firstfruits ; then , at His coming , those who belong to Messiah ;
46015024	then the end , when He hands over the kingdom to God the Father after He has destroyed all rule and all authority and power .
46015025	For He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet .
46015026	The last enemy to be destroyed is death .
46015027	For God has “ put all things in subjection underneath His feet . ” But when the psalmist says that “ all ” has been put in subjection , it is clear that this does not include God Himself , who put all things under Messiah .
46015028	Now when all things become subject to Him , then the Son Himself will also become subject to the One who put all things under Him , so that God may be all in all .
46015029	Otherwise , what will they do who are immersed for the dead ? If the dead are not raised at all , then why are they immersed for them ?
46015030	And why are we in danger every hour ?
46015031	I die every day — yes , as surely as the boast in you , brethren , which I have in Messiah Yeshua our Lord .
46015032	If , for human reasons , I fought with “ wild animals ” at Ephesus , what good is that to me ? If the dead are not raised , “ let us eat and drink , for tomorrow we die ! ”
46015033	Do not be deceived ! “ Bad company corrupts good morals . ”
46015034	Come to your senses as you ought , and stop sinning ! For some have no knowledge of God — I say this to your shame .
46015035	But someone will say , “ How are the dead raised ? ” and , “ With what kind of body do they come ? ”
46015036	Fool ! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies .
46015037	As for what you sow — you are not sowing the body that will be , but a bare seed , maybe of wheat or something else .
46015038	But God gives it a body just as He planned , and to each of the seeds a body of its own .
46015039	All flesh is not the same flesh , but there is one flesh of humans , another flesh of animals , another of birds , and another of fish .
46015040	There are also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies , but the glory of the heavenly is one thing while the earthly is another .
46015041	There is one glory of the sun , another glory of the moon , and another glory of the stars ; for one star differs from another star in glory .
46015042	So also is the resurrection of the dead : Sown in corruption , raised in incorruption !
46015043	Sown in dishonor , raised in glory ! Sown in weakness , raised in power !
46015044	Sown a natural body , raised a spiritual body ! If there is a natural body , there is also a spiritual body .
46015045	So also it is written , “ The first man , Adam , became a living soul . ” The last Adam became a life-giving spirit .
46015046	However , the spiritual is not first , but the natural ; then the spiritual .
46015047	The first man is of the earth , made of dust ; the second man is from heaven .
46015048	Like the one made of dust , so also are those made of dust ; and like the heavenly , so also are those who are heavenly .
46015049	And just as we have borne the image of the one made from dust , so also shall we bear the image of the One from heaven .
46015050	Now I say this , brethren , that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God , and what decays cannot inherit what does not decay .
46015051	Behold , I tell you a mystery : We shall not all sleep , but we shall all be changed —
46015052	in a moment , in the twinkling of an eye , at the last shofar . For the shofar will sound , and the dead will be raised incorruptible , and we will be changed .
46015053	For this corruptible must put on incorruptibility , and this mortal must put on immortality .
46015054	But when this corruptible will have put on incorruptibility and this mortal will have put on immortality , then shall come to pass the saying that is written : “ Death is swallowed up in victory . ”
46015055	“ Where , O Death , is your victory ? Where , O Death , is your sting ? ”
46015056	Now the sting of death is sin , and the power of sin is the Torah .
46015057	But thanks be to God , who keeps giving us the victory through our Lord Yeshua the Messiah !
46015058	Therefore , my dearly loved brethren , be steadfast , immovable , always excelling in the work of the Lord — because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain .
46016001	Now concerning the collection for the kedoshim , as I directed Messiah’s communities in Galatia , you do likewise .
46016002	On the first day of the week , let each of you set something aside , saving up whatever is gained , so no collections take place when I come .
46016003	Then whenever I arrive , I will send whomever you approve with letters of introduction to carry your gift to Jerusalem .
46016004	If it is advisable for me to go also , they will go with me .
46016005	But I will come to you after I have passed through Macedonia — for I am passing through Macedonia .
46016006	Perhaps I will stay with you , or even spend the winter , so that you can help me on my journey — wherever I go .
46016007	For I do not wish to see you now just in passing — for I hope to stay on with you for a while , if the Lord permits .
46016008	But I will stay on at Ephesus until Shavuot ,
46016009	for a great door has opened wide for me , though many are in opposition .
46016010	Now if Timothy comes , see that he has nothing to fear among you — for he is doing the Lord’s work , just as I am .
46016011	No one , then , should treat him with disrespect . But set him on his way in shalom , so that he might come to me ; for I am expecting him , along with the brethren .
46016012	Now about our brother Apollos , I strongly urged him to come to you with the brethren , and he was quite unwilling to come now — but he will come when he has an opportunity .
46016013	Be on the alert ! Stand firm in the faith ! Be men of courage ! Be strong !
46016014	Let all that you do be done in love .
46016015	Now I urge you , brethren ( you know the household of Stephanas , that it is the firstfruits of Achaia , and that they have devoted themselves in service to the kedoshim ) ,
46016016	also to submit to people such as these , and to everyone working together and laboring .
46016017	I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus , for they made up for your absence .
46016018	For they refreshed my spirit and yours . Therefore acknowledge such men .
46016019	Messiah’s communities in Asia greet you . Aquila and Prisca greet you warmly in the Lord , with the community that meets in their house .
46016020	All the brethren greet you . Greet one another with a holy kiss .
46016021	This greeting is in my own hand — Paul’s .
46016022	If anyone does not love the Lord , let him be cursed . Marana , tha ! Our Lord , come !
46016023	The grace of the Lord Yeshua be with you .
46016024	My love be with you all in Messiah Yeshua .
47001001	Paul , a shaliach of Messiah Yeshua through the will of God , and Timothy our brother , To God’s community at Corinth , with all the kedoshim who are throughout Achaia :
47001002	Grace to you and shalom from God our Father and the Lord Yeshua the Messiah .
47001003	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah , the Father of compassion and God of all encouragement .
47001004	He encourages us in every trouble , so that we may be able to encourage those who are in any trouble , through the very encouragement with which we ourselves are encouraged by God .
47001005	For just as the sufferings of Messiah overflow into us , so also through Messiah our encouragement overflows .
47001006	If we are suffering hardship , it is for your encouragement and salvation . Or if we are encouraged , it is for your encouragement , which produces in you the patient endurance of the same sufferings that we also suffer .
47001007	Our hope for you is firm , since we know that as you are partners in our sufferings , so also in our encouragement .
47001008	For we do not want you to be unaware , brethren , of our trouble that happened in Asia . We were under great pressure — so far beyond our strength that we despaired even of living .
47001009	In fact , we had within ourselves the death sentence — so that we might not rely on ourselves , but on God who raises the dead .
47001010	He who rescued us from so great a danger of death will continue to rescue us — we have set our hope on Him that He will rescue us again .
47001011	You also are helping by your prayer for us , so that from many people thanks may be given on our behalf for the gracious gift given us through the help of many .
47001012	For our reason for boasting is this : the testimony of our conscience , that we behaved in the world , and most especially toward you , with simplicity and godly sincerity — not by human wisdom but by the grace of God .
47001013	For we write nothing to you other than what you can read and understand — and I hope you will understand in full
47001014	just as you understood us in part , so that we are your reason for boasting just as you also are ours in the Day of our Lord Yeshua .
47001015	Because of this confidence , I was planning to come to you first , so that you might have a second benefit —
47001016	to pass by you on my way to Macedonia and again from Macedonia to come back to you , and to be helped by you on my journey to Judea .
47001017	So when I was planning to do this , I didn’t do so lightly , did I ? Or the things I plan , do I plan according to the flesh — so it might be with me “ Yes , yes ” and “ No , no ” at the same time ?
47001018	But as God is faithful , our message to you is not both “ Yes ” and “ No . ”
47001019	For Ben-Elohim — Yeshua the Messiah , who was proclaimed among you by us , by myself and Silvanus and Timothy — was not “ Yes ” and “ No . ” Rather , in Him it has always been “ Yes . ”
47001020	For in Him all the promises of God are “ Yes . ” Therefore also through Him is the “ Amen ” by us , to the glory of God .
47001021	Now it is God who establishes us with you in Messiah . He anointed us ,
47001022	set His seal on us , and gave us the Ruach in our hearts as a pledge .
47001023	But I call God as my witness — to spare you , I didn’t come to Corinth again .
47001024	Not that we lord it over you in matters of faith , but we are fellow workers for your joy — for in the faith you are standing firm .
47002001	So I made up my mind that I would not come to you again causing sorrow .
47002002	For if I cause you sorrow , then who is there cheering me on but the one I have made sorrowful ?
47002003	And I wrote this very thing to you , so that when I came I wouldn’t have sorrow from those who ought to make me rejoice — having confidence in you all that my joy is yours .
47002004	For out of much distress and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears — not to make you sorrowful , but to let you know the love that I have especially for you .
47002005	But if anyone has caused sorrow , he has caused sorrow not to me , but to some extent — not to exaggerate — to all of you .
47002006	For such a person , this punishment by the majority is enough .
47002007	So instead you should forgive him and encourage him . Otherwise such a person might be swallowed up by excessive sorrow .
47002008	Therefore I urge you to reaffirm your love for him .
47002009	For to this end I also wrote , that I might know your character , whether you are obedient in all things .
47002010	Now anyone you forgive , I also forgive . For indeed , what I have forgiven ( if I have forgiven anything ) , I did it for you in the presence of Messiah ,
47002011	so that we might not be outwitted by satan — for we are not ignorant of his schemes .
47002012	Now when I arrived in Troas for the Good News of Messiah , and a door was opened to me by the Lord ,
47002013	I had no rest in my spirit , because I didn’t find Titus my brother . So I said farewell to them , and I set out for Macedonia .
47002014	But thanks be to God , who in Messiah always leads us in triumphal procession , and through us reveals everywhere the aroma of the knowledge of Himself .
47002015	For we are the aroma of Messiah to God , among those who are being saved and those who are perishing —
47002016	to the one an aroma from death to death , to the other an aroma from life to life . Who is competent for these things ?
47002017	For we are not like many , peddling the word of God . Rather , in Messiah we speak in the sight of God with sincerity , as persons sent from God .
47003001	Are we beginning to commend ourselves again ? Or do we need , as some do , letters of recommendation to you or from you ?
47003002	You are our letter , written on our hearts , known and read by everyone .
47003003	It is clear that you are a letter from Messiah delivered by us — written not with ink but with the Ruach of the living God , not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts .
47003004	Such is the confidence we have through Messiah toward God —
47003005	not that we are competent in ourselves to consider anything as coming from ourselves , but our competence is from God .
47003006	He also made us competent as servants of a new covenant — not of the letter , but of the Ruach . For the letter kills , but the Ruach gives life .
47003007	Now if the ministry of death , carved in letters on stone , came with such glory that B’nei-Israel could not look intently upon Moses’ face because of its glory — although it was passing away —
47003008	how will the ministry of the Ruach not be even more glorious ?
47003009	For if there is glory in the ministry of condemnation , the ministry of righteousness overflows even more in glory .
47003010	For even what was glorious is not glorious in comparison to the glory that surpasses it .
47003011	For if what is passing away is glorious , much more what remains is glorious .
47003012	Therefore , having such a hope , we act with great boldness .
47003013	We are not like Moses , who used to put a veil over his face in order for B’nei-Israel not to look intently upon the end of what was passing away .
47003014	But their minds were hardened . For up to this very day the same veil remains unlifted at the reading of the ancient covenant , since in Messiah it is passing away .
47003015	But to this day , whenever Moses is read , a veil lies over their heart .
47003016	But whenever someone turns to the Lord , the veil is taken away .
47003017	Now the Lord is the Ruach and where the Ruach Adonai is , there is freedom .
47003018	But we all , with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord , are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory — just as from the Lord , who is the Ruach .
47004001	For this reason , since we have this ministry , just as we received mercy , we do not lose heart .
47004002	Instead , we renounced the hidden shameful ways — not walking in deception or distorting the word of God , but commending ourselves before God to everyone’s conscience by the open proclamation of the truth .
47004003	And even if our Good News is veiled , it is veiled to those who are perishing .
47004004	In their case , the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving , so they might not see the light of the Good News of the glory of Messiah , who is the image of God .
47004005	For we do not proclaim ourselves , but Messiah Yeshua as Lord — and ourselves as your slaves for Yeshua’s sake .
47004006	For God , who said , “ Let light shine out of darkness , ” is the One who has shone in our hearts , to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Messiah .
47004007	But we have this treasure in jars of clay , so that the surpassing greatness of the power may be from God and not from ourselves .
47004008	We are hard pressed in every way , yet not crushed ; perplexed , yet not in despair ;
47004009	persecuted , yet not forsaken ; struck down , yet not destroyed ;
47004010	always carrying in the body the death of Yeshua , so that the life of Yeshua may also be revealed in our mortal body .
47004011	For we who live are always being handed over to death for Yeshua’s sake , so that the life of Yeshua may be revealed in our mortal body .
47004012	So death is at work in us , but life is at work in you .
47004013	But we have the same spirit of faith , according to what is written , “ I believed , and therefore I spoke . ” So we also believe , and therefore we also speak ,
47004014	knowing that the One who raised the Lord Yeshua will raise us also with Yeshua , and will bring us with you into His presence .
47004015	For all things are for your sakes , so that the grace that is spreading through more and more people may cause thanksgiving to overflow — to the glory of God .
47004016	Therefore we do not lose heart . Though our outward man is decaying , yet our inward man is renewed day by day .
47004017	For our trouble , light and momentary , is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison ,
47004018	as we look not at what can be seen but at what cannot be seen . For what can be seen is temporary , but what cannot be seen is eternal .
47005001	For we know that if the tent , our earthly home , is torn down , we have a building from God — a home not made with human hands , eternal in the heavens .
47005002	For in this we groan , longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling —
47005003	if indeed , after we have put it on , we will not be found naked .
47005004	For we groan while we are in this tent — burdened because we don’t want to be unclothed but to be clothed , so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life .
47005005	Now the One who prepared us for this very purpose is God , who gave us the Ruach as a pledge .
47005006	Therefore we are always confident and know that while we are at home in the body , we are absent from the Lord .
47005007	For we walk by faith , not by sight .
47005008	We are confident , I say , and prefer rather to be absent from the body and at home with the Lord .
47005009	So whether at home or absent , we make it our aim to be pleasing to Him .
47005010	For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Messiah , so that each one may receive what is due for the things he did while in the body — whether good or bad .
47005011	Therefore , knowing the fear of the Lord , we are trying to persuade people , but what we are is known to God — and I hope it is known to your consciences as well .
47005012	For we are not commending ourselves to you again , but giving you an opportunity for boasting about us , so that you may have something to answer those who boast in outward appearance and not in the heart .
47005013	For if we are out of our minds , it is for God ; if we are in our right mind , it is for you .
47005014	For the love of Messiah compels us , since we have concluded that One died for all ; as a result all died .
47005015	And He died for all so that those who live might no longer live for themselves , but for the One who died for them and was raised .
47005016	So from now on we recognize no one according to the flesh . Even though we have known Messiah according to the flesh , yet now we no longer know Him this way .
47005017	Therefore if anyone is in Messiah , he is a new creation . The old things have passed away ; behold , all things have become new .
47005018	Now all these things are from God , who reconciled us to Himself through Messiah and gave us the ministry of reconciliation .
47005019	That is , in Messiah God was reconciling the world to Himself , not counting their trespasses against them ; and He has entrusted the message of reconciliation to us .
47005020	We are therefore ambassadors for Messiah , as though God were making His appeal through us . We beg you on behalf of Messiah , be reconciled to God .
47005021	He made the One who knew no sin to become a sin offering on our behalf , so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God .
47006001	Since we are co-laboring , we also urge you not to receive God’s grace in vain .
47006002	For He says , “ At a favorable time I listened to you , in a day of salvation I helped you . ” Behold , now is the favorable time . Behold , now is the day of salvation .
47006003	We give no cause for offense in anything , so that our ministry may not be blamed .
47006004	But as God’s servants , we are commending ourselves in every way — in great endurance , in afflictions , in hardships , in distresses ,
47006005	in beatings , in imprisonments , in riots , in troubles , in sleeplessness , in hunger ;
47006006	in purity , in knowledge , in patience , in kindness , in the Ruach ha-Kodesh , in genuine love ,
47006007	in truthful speech , in the power of God ; with the weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left ;
47006008	through honor and dishonor , through evil report and good report . We are regarded as deceivers and yet true ;
47006009	as unknown and yet well-known ; as dying , yet behold , we live ; as disciplined yet not put to death ;
47006010	as grieving yet always rejoicing ; as poor yet enriching many ; as having nothing yet possessing everything .
47006011	We have spoken openly to you , O Corinthians ; our heart is open wide !
47006012	You are not restricted by us , yet you are restricted in your own feelings .
47006013	Now in return — I speak as to my children — open wide to us also .
47006014	Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers . For what partnership is there between righteousness and lawlessness ? Or what fellowship does light have with darkness ?
47006015	What harmony does Messiah have with Belial ? Or what part does a believer have in common with an unbeliever ?
47006016	What agreement does God’s Temple have with idols ? For we are the temple of the living God — just as God said , “ I will dwell in them and walk among them ; and I will be their God , and they shall be My people .
47006017	Therefore , come out from among them , and be separate , says Adonai . Touch no unclean thing . Then I will take you in .
47006018	I will be a father to you , and you shall be My sons and daughters , says Adonai — Tzva’ot . ”
47007001	Therefore , since we have these promises , loved ones , let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of body and spirit , perfecting holiness in the fear of God .
47007002	Make room for us in your hearts . We wronged no one , ruined no one , took advantage of no one .
47007003	I do not say this to condemn you , for I have said before that you are in our hearts — to die together and to live together with you .
47007004	Great is my boldness of speech toward you . Great is my boasting on your behalf . I have been filled with encouragement . I overflow with joy in all our troubles .
47007005	For even when we came into Macedonia , our body had no rest . But we were hard pressed on every side — conflicts outside , fears within .
47007006	But God , who encourages the downcast , encouraged us with the arrival of Titus ;
47007007	and not only by his coming , but also by the encouragement with which he was encouraged by you , as he told us of your longing , your mourning , and your deep concern for me — so that I rejoiced still more .
47007008	For even if I grieved you with my letter , I do not regret it — though I did regret it , for I see that my letter grieved you , but just for a while .
47007009	Now I rejoice , not that you were grieved , but that you were grieved to the point of repentance . For you were grieved according to God’s will , so that you might in no way suffer loss from us .
47007010	For the grief that God wills brings a repentance that leads to salvation , leaving no regret . But the world’s grief brings death .
47007011	For see what this very thing — this grieving that God wills — has brought you ! What diligence , what defense , what indignation , what fear , what longing , what zeal , what rendering of justice ! In everything you have proved yourselves to be innocent in this matter .
47007012	So although I wrote to you , I wrote not for the sake of the wrongdoer or for the sake of the one who was wronged , but to make known to you your diligence for us in the sight of God .
47007013	For this reason we have been encouraged . Besides our own encouragement , we rejoiced even more at the joy of Titus , because his spirit has been refreshed by all of you .
47007014	For if I have boasted some to him about you , I was not put to shame . But as we spoke all things truthfully to you , so also our boasting to Titus has proved to be the truth .
47007015	His feelings toward you overflow when he remembers everyone’s obedience — how you received him with fear and trembling .
47007016	I rejoice that in everything I have confidence in you .
47008001	Now we make known to you , brethren , the grace God has given to Messiah’s communities in Macedonia —
47008002	that in much testing by affliction , the abundance of their joy and their extreme poverty overflowed in a wealth of generosity on their part .
47008003	For I testify that according to their ability , and even beyond their ability , they gave of their own free will —
47008004	begging us with much urging for the favor of sharing in the relief of the kedoshim .
47008005	Moreover , it was not just as we had hoped , but they gave of themselves first to the Lord and then to us in keeping with God’s will .
47008006	So we urged Titus that , just as he had made a start before , so he should also complete this gracious service for you .
47008007	But as you excel in everything — in faith and speech and knowledge and all diligence , and in your love for us — also excel in this grace .
47008008	I am saying this not as a command , but I am trying to prove by the diligence of others the genuineness of your love as well .
47008009	For you know the grace of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah — that even though He was rich , yet for your sakes He became poor , so that through His poverty you might become rich .
47008010	Now I give my opinion in this matter , that it is a credit to you that a year ago you were the first to start — not only to do but even to be willing .
47008011	But now finish doing it , so that just as there was eagerness to be willing , so also to finish it , out of what you have .
47008012	For if the eagerness is present , the gift is acceptable according to what a person has , not according to what he doesn’t have .
47008013	For it is not relief for others and hardship for you , but as a matter of equality .
47008014	Your abundance at this present time meets their need , so that their abundance may also meet your need — so that there may be equality .
47008015	As it is written , “ He who gathered much did not have too much , and he who gathered little did not have too little . ”
47008016	But thanks be to God , who put into the heart of Titus the same devotion for you .
47008017	For indeed he not only accepted our appeal , but went to you with eagerness and on his own initiative .
47008018	We are sending along with him the brother whose fame in connection with the Good News has spread throughout all of Messiah’s communities .
47008019	Not only that , but he has also been appointed by the communities as our travel companion with this gracious gift , which is administered by us for the glory of the Lord Himself and to show our eagerness to help .
47008020	We are taking this precaution , so that no one will blame us in regard to the way we administer this generous gift .
47008021	We have regard for what is honorable — not only before the Lord , but also before people .
47008022	Also with them we are sending our brother whom we have tested many times and found to be diligent in many things , but now even more diligent because of his great confidence in you .
47008023	As for Titus , he is my partner and fellow worker among you ; as for our brethren , they are the shlichim of the communities , a glory to Messiah .
47008024	Therefore , before Messiah’s communities show them the proof of your love and of our boasting about you .
47009001	Now about this service to the kedoshim , it is indeed unnecessary for me to write to you —
47009002	for I know your eagerness . I boast about it to the Macedonians , that Achaia has been preparing for a year already ; and your zeal has stirred up most of them .
47009003	But I am sending the brethren in order that our boasting about you may not be in vain in this case , so that you may be prepared , just as I kept saying .
47009004	Otherwise , if any Macedonians were to come and find you unprepared , we — not to mention you — would be put to shame in this undertaking .
47009005	So I thought it necessary to urge the brethren to go on to you and arrange ahead of time your generous gift that had been promised beforehand , so that it would be ready as a gift and not as an extortion .
47009006	The point is this : whoever sows sparingly shall also reap sparingly , and whoever sows bountifully shall also reap bountifully .
47009007	Let each one give as he has decided in his heart , not grudgingly or under compulsion — for God loves a cheerful giver .
47009008	And God is able to make all grace overflow to you , so that by always having enough of everything , you may overflow in every good work .
47009009	As it is written , “ He scattered widely , He gave to the poor ; His righteousness endures forever . ”
47009010	Now the One who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed and increase the harvest of your righteousness .
47009011	You will be enriched in everything for all generosity , which through us brings about thanksgiving to God .
47009012	For this service of giving is not only supplying the needs of the kedoshim , but is also overflowing with many thanksgivings to God .
47009013	Because of the evidence of this service , they praise God for the obedience of your affirmation of the Good News of Messiah and for the generosity of your contribution to them and to everyone .
47009014	And in their prayer for you , they long for you because of the surpassing grace of God upon you .
47009015	Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift !
47010001	Now I , Paul , appeal myself to you by the meekness and gentleness of Messiah — I who am humble when face to face with you , but bold toward you when far away .
47010002	I beg of you that when I am present I won’t need to be bold with the courage I consider showing against some who judge us as walking in the flesh .
47010003	For though we walk in the flesh , we do not wage war according to the flesh .
47010004	For the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly but powerful through God for the tearing down of strongholds . We are tearing down false arguments
47010005	and every high-minded thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God . We are taking every thought captive to the obedience of Messiah —
47010006	ready to punish all disobedience , whenever your obedience is complete .
47010007	Look at what is before your eyes . If anyone is confident in himself that he belongs to Messiah , let him reconsider that just as he belongs to Messiah , so also do we .
47010008	For even if I boast a little more about our authority — which the Lord gave for building you up and not for tearing you down — I will not be put to shame .
47010009	Not that I would try to terrify you by my letters —
47010010	for they say , “ His letters are weighty and strong , but his presence in person is weak and his speech of no account . ”
47010011	Let such a person consider this , that what we are in word through letters when we are absent , we also are in action when we are present .
47010012	For we do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves . But when they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves , they have no understanding .
47010013	But we will not boast beyond limits , but within the limits of the area that God has assigned to us — to reach even as far as you .
47010014	We are not extending ourselves too far , as if we did not reach you — for we did come even as far as to you with the Good News of Messiah .
47010015	Neither are we boasting beyond limits based on the labors of others , but we have hope while your faith is growing for our area among you to be greatly enlarged —
47010016	so that we may proclaim the Good News even to regions beyond you , not boasting about what has been accomplished in another’s area .
47010017	But “ let him who boasts boast in the Lord . ”
47010018	For it Is not the one who commends himself who is approved , but the one whom the Lord commends .
47011001	I wish that you would put up with a little foolishness from me , but indeed you are putting up with me .
47011002	For I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy . For I betrothed you to one husband , to present you to Messiah as a pure virgin .
47011003	But I am afraid that somehow , as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning , your minds might be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion and purity to the Messiah .
47011004	For if someone comes and proclaims another Yeshua whom we did not proclaim , or if you receive a different spirit that you did not receive , or a different “ good news ” that you did not accept , you put up with that well enough !
47011005	For I consider myself in no way inferior to the “ super special ” shlichim .
47011006	Even if I am unskilled in speech , yet I am not so in knowledge . No , in every way we have made this clear to you in all things .
47011007	Or did I commit a sin in humbling myself so that you might be exalted , because I proclaimed to you God’s Good News free of charge ?
47011008	I robbed other communities by taking wages from them for service to you .
47011009	When I was present with you and I was in need , I did not burden anyone ; for the brethren who came from Macedonia supplied my need . In everything I kept myself from being a burden to you , and I will continue to do so .
47011010	As the truth of Messiah is in me , this boasting of mine will not be silenced in the regions of Achaia .
47011011	Why ? Because I do not love you ? God knows I do !
47011012	But what I am doing I will continue to do , so that I may cut off the opportunity from those who want an opportunity in what they boast about to also be regarded just as we are .
47011013	For such men are false shlichim , deceitful workers masquerading as Messiah’s shlichim .
47011014	And no wonder , for even satan masquerades as an angel of light .
47011015	It is no great thing therefore if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness , Their end will be according to their deeds .
47011016	I say again , let no one consider me to be a fool . But if you do , accept me as a fool , so that I also may boast a little .
47011017	What I am saying , I am saying not according to the Lord , but as in foolishness , in this self-confident boasting .
47011018	Since many boast according to the flesh , I too will boast .
47011019	For you , being so wise , put up with fools gladly .
47011020	For you put up with it if someone enslaves you , if someone devours you , if someone takes advantage of you , if someone puts on airs , if someone slaps you on the face .
47011021	To my shame I must say that we have been weak . Yet whatever anyone else dares to boast about — I speak in foolishness — I dare , too .
47011022	Are they Hebrews ? So am I . Are they Israelites ? So am I . Are they the descendants of Abraham ? So am I .
47011023	Are they servants of Messiah ? I am more so — I speak like I’m out of my mind — in labors much more , in prisons much more , in beatings more brutal , near death often .
47011024	Five times from the Jewish leaders I received forty lashes minus one .
47011025	Three times I was beaten with rods . Once I was stoned . Three times I suffered shipwreck . A night and a day I spent in the open sea .
47011026	In my many journeys I have been in dangers from rivers , dangers from robbers , dangers from my countrymen , dangers from the Gentiles , dangers in the city , dangers in the desert , dangers in the sea , dangers among false brethren ,
47011027	in labor and hardship , through many sleepless nights , in hunger and thirst , often without food , in cold and exposure .
47011028	Besides these other things , there is daily pressure on me of concern for all of Messiah’s communities .
47011029	Who is weak , and I am not weak ? Who is led into sin , and I do not burn with indignation ?
47011030	If I must boast , I will boast of my weakness .
47011031	The God and Father of the Lord Yeshua , who is blessed forever , knows that I am not lying .
47011032	In Damascus the governor under King Aretas was guarding the city of the Damascenes in order to seize me ,
47011033	and I was lowered in a basket through a window in the wall and escaped his hands .
47012001	I must go on boasting — though it does no good , I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord .
47012002	I know a man in Messiah ( whether in the body I don’t know , or whether out of the body I don’t know — God knows ) — fourteen years ago , he was caught up to the third heaven .
47012003	I know such a man ( whether in the body or outside of the body I don’t know — God knows ) —
47012004	he was caught up into Paradise and heard words too sacred to tell , which a human is not permitted to utter .
47012005	On behalf of such a man I will boast — but about myself I will not boast , except in regard to my weaknesses .
47012006	For if I should want to boast , I would not be foolish — for I will speak the truth . But I refrain , so that no one may think more of me than what he sees in me or hears from me —
47012007	even in the extraordinary quality of the revelations . So that I would not exalt myself , a thorn in the flesh was given to me — a a messenger of satan to torment me , so I would not exalt myself .
47012008	I pleaded with the Lord three times about this , that it might leave me .
47012009	But He said to me , “ My grace is sufficient for you , for power is made perfect in weakness . ” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly in my weaknesses , so that the power of Messiah may dwell in me .
47012010	For Messiah’s sake , then , I delight in weaknesses , in insults , in distresses , in persecutions , in calamities . For when I am weak , then I am strong .
47012011	I have become a fool — you drove me to it , for I ought to have been commended by you . For I am in no way inferior to the super-special shlichim — though I am nothing .
47012012	Truly the signs of a shaliach were worked out among you , with patient endurance , by signs and wonders and mighty miracles .
47012013	For in what respect were you treated worse than the rest of Messiah’s communities — except that I myself did not burden you ? Pardon me this injustice !
47012014	Look , I am ready to come to you this third time , and I will not burden you — for I seek not your possessions , but you ! For the children are not obliged to save up for the parents , but the parents for the children .
47012015	I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls . If I love you more , am I to be loved less ?
47012016	But be that as it may , I did not burden you myself . Nevertheless , crafty fellow that I am , I caught you with trickery !
47012017	I haven’t taken advantage of you through any of those I sent to you , have I ?
47012018	I did urge Titus to visit you , and I sent the brother with him . Titus didn’t take any advantage of you , did he ? Didn’t we walk in the same spirit , in the same footsteps ?
47012019	All along you’ve been thinking that we are defending ourselves to you . It is before God that we’ve been speaking in Messiah — and all for building you up , loved ones .
47012020	For I am afraid that perhaps when I come , I may find you not as I wish , or I may be found by you not as you wish — that there may be strife , envy , outbursts of anger , self-seeking disputes , lashon ha-ra , gossip , arrogance , unruly commotions .
47012021	I am afraid that when I come again my God may humiliate me before you , and I will mourn for many of those who have sinned before and not repented of the impurity and sexual immorality and indecency which they committed .
47013001	This is the third time I am coming to you . “ By the testimony of two or three witnesses shall every word be established . ”
47013002	I spoke a warning , when I was with you the second time . Though now I am away , I am again speaking a warning to those who have sinned before , as well as to all the rest , that if I come again , I will not spare anyone —
47013003	since you are demanding proof that Messiah is speaking through me . He is not weak toward you , but powerful among you .
47013004	For He was crucified in weakness , yet He lives through the power of God . For we also are weak in Him , yet we shall live with Him by God’s power toward you .
47013005	Test yourselves , to see whether you are in the faith . Examine yourselves ! Or don’t you know yourselves — that Messiah Yeshua is in you ? Unless of course you failed the test .
47013006	But I hope that you will realize that we haven’t failed the test .
47013007	Now we pray to God that you do no wrong — not so that we may appear to have passed the test , but in order that you may do what is right even if we may seem to have failed .
47013008	For we can do nothing against the truth , but only for the truth .
47013009	For we rejoice when we are weak and you are strong . We also pray for this — your perfecting .
47013010	For this reason I write these things while I am absent , so that when I am present I need not proceed harshly , according to the authority which the Lord gave me — for building up and not for tearing down .
47013011	Finally , brethren , rejoice ! Aim for restoration , encourage one another , be of the same mind , live in shalom — and the God of love and shalom will be with you .
47013012	Greet one another with a holy kiss . All the kedoshim greet you .
47013013	
47013014	The grace of the Lord Yeshua the Messiah and the love of God and the fellowship of the Ruach ha-Kodesh be with you all . Amen .
48001001	Paul , a shaliach ( sent not from men or by man , but by Yeshua the Messiah and God the Father , who raised Him from the dead ) ,
48001002	and all the brethren with me . To Messiah’s communities of Galatia :
48001003	Grace to you and shalom from God our Father and our Lord Yeshua the Messiah —
48001004	who gave Himself for our sins to rescue us from this present evil age , according to the will of our God and Father —
48001005	to Him be the glory forever and ever ! Amen .
48001006	I am amazed that you are so quickly turning away from the One who called you by the grace of Messiah , to a different “ good news ” —
48001007	not that there is another , but only some who are confusing you and want to distort the Good News of Messiah .
48001008	But even if we ( or an angel from heaven ) should announce any “ good news ” to you other than what we have proclaimed to you , let that person be cursed !
48001009	As we have said before , so I now repeat : if anyone proclaims to you “ good news ” other than what you received , let that person be under a curse !
48001010	Am I now trying to win people’s approval , or God’s ? Or am I trying to please people ? If I were still trying to please people , I would not be a servant of Messiah .
48001011	Now I want you to know , brethren , that the Good News proclaimed by me is not man-made .
48001012	I did not receive it from any human , nor was I taught it , but it came through a revelation of Yeshua the Messiah .
48001013	For you have heard of my earlier behavior in Judaism — how I persecuted God’s community beyond measure and tried to destroy it .
48001014	I was even advancing within Judaism beyond many my own age among my people , being a more extreme observer of my fathers’ traditions .
48001015	But when God — who set me apart from birth and called me through His grace — was pleased
48001016	to reveal His Son to me so I would proclaim Him among the Gentiles , I did not immediately consult with any human .
48001017	I did not go up to Jerusalem to those who were shlichim before me , either . Instead I went away to Arabia and returned again to Damascus .
48001018	Then three years later I went to Jerusalem to visit with Peter , and I stayed with him fifteen days .
48001019	But I saw no other shlichim except Jacob , the Lord’s brother .
48001020	( In what I’m writing you , before God , I do not lie . )
48001021	Then I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia .
48001022	But I was personally unknown to Messiah’s communities of Judea ;
48001023	they only kept hearing , “ The one who once persecuted us now proclaims the Good News he once tried to destroy ! ”
48001024	So they were praising God because of me .
48002001	Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas , taking Titus with me .
48002002	Because of a revelation , I went up and presented to them the Good News that I proclaim among the Gentiles . But I did so privately to those who seemed to be influential , to make sure I would not run — or had not run — in vain .
48002003	Yet not even Titus who was with me , a Greek , was forced to be circumcised .
48002004	Now this issue came up because of false brethren secretly brought in ( who slipped in to spy out our freedom in Messiah , in order to bring us into bondage ) .
48002005	But we did not give in to them even for a moment , so that the truth of the Good News might be preserved for you .
48002006	But from those who seemed to be influential ( whatever they were makes no difference to me ; God shows no partiality ) — well , those influential ones added nothing to my message .
48002007	On the contrary , they saw that I had been entrusted with the Good News for the uncircumcised just as Peter was for the circumcised .
48002008	( For the same God who was at work in Peter as a shaliach to the Jews , also was at work in me as a shaliach to the Gentiles . )
48002009	Realizing the favor that had been given to me , Jacob and Peter and John — who are the recognized pillars — shook hands in partnership with Barnabas and me , so that we would go to the Gentiles and they to the Jews .
48002010	They asked only that we remember the poor — something I also was eager to do .
48002011	But when Peter came to Antioch , I opposed him to his face , because he was clearly in the wrong —
48002012	for before certain people came from Jacob , he regularly ate with the Gentiles ; but when they came , he began to withdraw and separate himself , fearing those from the circumcision .
48002013	And the rest of the Jews joined him in hypocrisy , so that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy .
48002014	But when I saw that they were not walking in line with the truth of the Good News , I said to Peter in front of everyone , “ If you — being a Jew — live like the Gentiles and not like the Jews , how can you force the Gentiles to live like Jews ? ”
48002015	We are Jews by birth and not sinners from among the Gentiles .
48002016	Yet we know that a person is set right not by deeds based on Torah , but rather through putting trust in Messiah Yeshua . So even we have put our trust in Messiah Yeshua , in order that we might be set right based on trust in Messiah and not by deeds based on Torah — because no human will be justified by deeds based on Torah .
48002017	But if , while seeking to be justified in Messiah , we ourselves also were found to be sinners , is Messiah then an agent of sin ? May it never be !
48002018	For if I rebuild the very things I tore down , I prove myself to be a law-breaker .
48002019	For through law I died to law , so that I might live for God . I have been crucified with Messiah ;
48002020	and it is no longer I who live , but Messiah lives in me . And the life I now live in the body , I live by trusting in Ben-Elohim — who loved me and gave Himself up for me .
48002021	I do not nullify the grace of God — for if righteousness comes through Torah , then Messiah died for no reason !
48003001	O foolish Galatians , who cast a spell on you ? Before your eyes Yeshua the Messiah was clearly portrayed as crucified .
48003002	I want to find out just one thing from you : did you receive the Ruach by deeds based on Torah , or by hearing based on trust ?
48003003	Are you so foolish ? After beginning with the Ruach , will you now reach the goal in the flesh ?
48003004	Did you endure so much for nothing — if it really was for nothing ?
48003005	So then , the One who gives you the Ruach and works miracles among you — does He do it because of your deeds based on Torah or your hearing based on trust and faithfulness ?
48003006	Just as Abraham “ believed God , and it was credited to him as righteousness , ”
48003007	know then that those who have faith are children of Abraham .
48003008	The Scriptures , foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith , proclaimed the Good News to Abraham in advance , saying , “ All the nations shall be blessed through you . ”
48003009	So then , the faithful are blessed along with Abraham , the faithful one .
48003010	For all who rely on the deeds of Torah are under a curse — for the Scriptures say , “ Cursed is everyone who does not keep doing everything written in the scroll of the Torah . ”
48003011	It is clear that no one is set right before God by Torah , for “ the righteous shall live by emunah . ”
48003012	However , Torah is not based on trust and faithfulness ; on the contrary , “ the one who does these things shall live by them . ”
48003013	Messiah liberated us from Torah’s curse , having become a curse for us ( for it is written , “ Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree ” ) —
48003014	in order that through Messiah Yeshua the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles , so we might receive the promise of the Ruach through trusting faith .
48003015	Brethren , I speak in human terms : even with a man’s covenant , once it has been confirmed , no one cancels it or adds to it .
48003016	Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed . It doesn’t say , “ and to seeds , ” as of many , but as of one , “ and to your seed , ” who is the Messiah .
48003017	What I am saying is this : Torah , which came 430 years later , does not cancel the covenant previously confirmed by God , so as to make the promise ineffective .
48003018	For if the inheritance is based on law , it is no longer based on a promise . But God has graciously given it to Abraham by means of a promise .
48003019	Then why the Torah ? It was added because of wrongdoings until the Seed would come — to whom the promise had been made . It was arranged through angels by the hand of an intermediary .
48003020	Now an intermediary is not for one party alone — but God is one .
48003021	Then is the Torah against the promises of God ? May it never be ! For if a law had been given that could impart life , certainly righteousness would have been based on law .
48003022	But the Scripture has locked up the whole world under sin , so that the promise based on trust in Messiah Yeshua might be given to those who trust .
48003023	Now before faith came , we were being guarded under Torah — bound together until the coming faith would be revealed .
48003024	Therefore the Torah became our guardian to lead us to Messiah , so that we might be made right based on trusting .
48003025	But now that faith has come , we are no longer under a guardian .
48003026	For you are all sons of God through trusting in Messiah Yeshua .
48003027	For all of you who were immersed in Messiah have clothed yourselves with Messiah .
48003028	There is neither Jew nor Greek , there is neither slave nor free , there is neither male nor female — for you are all one in Messiah Yeshua .
48003029	And if you belong to Messiah , then you are Abraham’s seed — heirs according to the promise .
48004001	Now I am saying , so long as the heir is underage , he is no different from a slave , even though he is the owner of everything .
48004002	Instead , he is under guardians and managers until the date set by the father .
48004003	So also , when we were underage , we were subservient to the basic principles of the world .
48004004	But when the fullness of time came , God sent out His Son , born of a woman and born under law —
48004005	to free those under law , so we might receive adoption as sons .
48004006	Now because you are sons , God sent the Ruach of His Son into our hearts , who cries out , “ Abba ! Father ! ”
48004007	So you are no longer a slave but a son — and if a son , also an heir through God .
48004008	But at that time , when you did not know God , you served those who by nature are not gods at all .
48004009	But now you have come to know God — or rather you have come to be known by God . So how can you turn back again to those weak and worthless principles ? Do you want to be enslaved to them all over again ?
48004010	You observe days and months and seasons and years .
48004011	I fear for you , that perhaps I have labored over you in vain !
48004012	I plead with you , brethren , become like me , for I became like you . You have done me no wrong —
48004013	you know it was because of a physical ailment that I proclaimed the Good News to you the first time ;
48004014	and though my physical condition was a trial to you , you did not hate or reject me . No , you welcomed me as a messenger of God — or even as Messiah Yeshua .
48004015	So where is your sense of joy ? For I testify that you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me , if possible .
48004016	So have I become your enemy by telling you the truth ? !
48004017	Others zealously court you — not in a good way , but they wish to shut you out so that you will court them .
48004018	To be courted is good , but let it always be in a good way — and not just when I am there with you .
48004019	My dear children ! Again I suffer labor pains until Messiah is formed in you .
48004020	I wish I could be with you now and change my tone , for I don’t know what to make of you . Two Sons
48004021	Tell me , you who want to be under Torah , don’t you understand the Torah ?
48004022	For it is written that Abraham had two sons , one by the slave woman and one by the free woman .
48004023	But one — the son by the slave woman — was born naturally ; while the other — the son by the free woman — was through the promise .
48004024	Now these things are being treated allegorically , for these are two covenants . One is from Mount Sinai , giving birth to slavery — this is Hagar .
48004025	But this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present Jerusalem , for she is in slavery along with her children .
48004026	But the Jerusalem above is free — she is our mother .
48004027	For it is written : “ Rejoice , O barren woman who bears no children . Break forth and shout , you who suffer no labor pains . For more are the children of the desolate than of the one who has a husband . ”
48004028	Now you , brethren — like Isaac , you are children of promise .
48004029	But just as at that time the one born according to the flesh persecuted the one born according to the Ruach , so it is now .
48004030	But what does the Scripture say ? “ Drive out the slave woman and her son , for the son of the slave woman shall not inherit with the son ” of the free woman .
48004031	So then , brethren , we are not children of the slave woman but of the free woman .
48005001	For freedom , Messiah set us free — so stand firm , and do not be burdened by a yoke of slavery again .
48005002	Listen — I , Paul , tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised , Messiah will be of no benefit to you .
48005003	Again I testify to every man who lets himself be circumcised , that he is obligated to keep the whole Torah .
48005004	You who are trying to be justified by Torah have been cut off from Messiah ; you have fallen away from grace .
48005005	For through the Ruach , by faith , we eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness .
48005006	For in Messiah Yeshua , neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any meaning — but only trust and faithfulness expressing itself through love .
48005007	You were running a great race ! Who blocked you from following the truth ?
48005008	This detour doesn’t come from the One who calls you .
48005009	A little hametz works its way through the whole batch of dough !
48005010	I am confident in the Lord that you will not think otherwise . But the one who is confusing you will pay the penalty , whoever he is .
48005011	As for me , brethren , if I still proclaim circumcision , why am I still being persecuted ? In that case , the stumbling block of the cross has been eliminated .
48005012	I only wish those who are agitating you would castrate themselves !
48005013	Brethren , you were called to freedom — only do not let your freedom become an opportunity for the flesh , but through love serve one another .
48005014	For the whole Torah can be summed up in a single saying : “ Love your neighbor as yourself . ”
48005015	But if you bite and devour one another , watch out that you are not destroyed by one another .
48005016	But I say , walk by the Ruach , and you will not carry out the desires of the flesh .
48005017	For the flesh sets its desire against the Ruach , but the Ruach sets its desire against the flesh — for these are in opposition to one another , so that you cannot do what you want .
48005018	But if you are led by the Ruach , you are not under law .
48005019	Now the deeds of the flesh are clear : sexual immorality , impurity , indecency ,
48005020	idolatry , witchcraft , hostility , strife , jealousy , rage , selfish ambition , dissension , factions ,
48005021	envy , drunkenness , carousing , and things like these . I am warning you , just as I warned you before , that those who do such things will not inherit God’s kingdom .
48005022	But the fruit of the Ruach is love , joy , peace , patience , kindness , goodness , faithfulness ,
48005023	gentleness , and self-control — against such things there is no law .
48005024	Now those who belong to Messiah have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires .
48005025	If we live by the Ruach , let us also walk by the Ruach .
48005026	Let us not become conceited — provoking one another , envying one another .
48006001	Brethren , if someone is caught doing something wrong , you who are directed by the Ruach , restore such a person in a spirit of gentleness — looking closely at yourself so you are not tempted also .
48006002	Bear one another’s burdens , and in this way you fulfill the Torah of Messiah .
48006003	For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing , he is fooling himself .
48006004	Rather let each one examine his own work . Then he will have pride in himself alone and not in comparison to anyone else .
48006005	For each one will carry his own load .
48006006	Now let the one who is taught the word share all good things with his teacher .
48006007	Do not be deceived — God is not mocked . For whatever a man sows , that he also shall reap .
48006008	For the one who sows in the flesh will reap corruption from the flesh . But the one who sows in the Ruach will reap from the Ruach eternal life .
48006009	So let us not lose heart in doing good , for in due time we will reap if we don’t give up .
48006010	Therefore , whenever we have an opportunity , let us do good toward all — especially those who belong to the household of faith .
48006011	Notice the large letters — I am writing to you with my own hand .
48006012	Those wanting to look good outwardly are trying to force you to be circumcised — only so they will not be persecuted for the cross of Messiah .
48006013	For not even the circumcised keep Torah themselves . Yet they want to have you circumcised so that they may boast about your flesh .
48006014	But may I never boast — except in the cross of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah . Through Him the world has been crucified to me , and I to the world .
48006015	For neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything — but only a new creation .
48006016	Now as many as live by this rule — shalom and mercy on them and on the Israel of God .
48006017	From now on let no one make trouble for me , for I bear on my body the scars of Yeshua .
48006018	The grace of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah be with your spirit , brethren . Amen . Paul’s Letter to the Ephesians
49001001	Paul , a shaliach of Messiah Yeshua by God’s will , To the kedoshim in Ephesus — those trusting in Messiah Yeshua :
49001002	Grace and shalom to you , from God our Father and the Lord Yeshua the Messiah !
49001003	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah , who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Messiah .
49001004	He chose us in the Messiah before the foundation of the world , to be holy and blameless before Him in love .
49001005	He predestined us for adoption as sons through Messiah Yeshua , in keeping with the good pleasure of His will —
49001006	to the glorious praise of His grace , with which He favored us through the One He loves !
49001007	In Him we have redemption through His blood — the removal of trespasses — in keeping with the richness of His grace
49001008	that He lavished on us . In all wisdom and insight ,
49001009	He made known to us the mystery of His will , in keeping with His good pleasure that He planned in Messiah .
49001010	The plan of the fullness of times is to bring all things together in the Messiah — both things in heaven and things on earth , all in Him .
49001011	In Him we also were chosen , predestined according to His plan . He keeps working out all things according to the purpose of His will —
49001012	so that we , who were first to put our hope in Messiah , might be for His glorious praise .
49001013	After you heard the message of truth — the Good News of your salvation — and when you put your trust in Him , you were sealed with the promised Ruach ha-Kodesh .
49001014	He is the guarantee of our inheritance , until the redemption of His possession — to His glorious praise !
49001015	Therefore , ever since I heard of your trust in the Lord Yeshua and of your love for all the kedoshim ,
49001016	I never stop giving thanks for you as I mention you in my prayers —
49001017	that the God of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah , our glorious Father , may give you spiritual wisdom and revelation in knowing Him .
49001018	I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened , so that you may know what is the hope of His calling , what is the richness of His glorious inheritance in the kedoshim ,
49001019	and what is His exceedingly great power toward us who keep trusting Him — in keeping with the working of His mighty strength .
49001020	This power He exercised in Messiah when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in heaven .
49001021	He is far above any ruler , authority , power , leader , and every name that is named — not only in the olam ha-zeh but also in the olam ha-ba .
49001022	God placed all things under Messiah’s feet and appointed Him as head over all things for His community —
49001023	which is His body , the fullness of Him who fills all in all .
49002001	You were dead in your trespasses and sins .
49002002	At that time , you walked in the way of this world , in conformity to the ruler of the domain of the air — the ruler of the spirit who is now operating in the sons of disobedience .
49002003	We too all lived among them in the cravings of our flesh , indulging the desires of the flesh and the mind . By nature we were children of wrath , just like the others .
49002004	But God was rich in mercy , because of His great love with which He loved us .
49002005	Even when we were dead in our trespasses , He made us alive together with Messiah . ( By grace you have been saved ! )
49002006	And He raised us up with Him and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Messiah Yeshua —
49002007	to show in the olam ha-ba the measureless richness of His grace in kindness toward us in Messiah Yeshua .
49002008	For by grace you have been saved through faith . And this is not from yourselves — it is the gift of God .
49002009	It is not based on deeds , so that no one may boast .
49002010	For we are His workmanship — created in Messiah Yeshua for good deeds , which God prepared beforehand so we might walk in them . Jew and Gentile , One in Messiah
49002011	Therefore , keep in mind that once you — Gentiles in the flesh — were called “ uncircumcision ” by those called “ circumcision ” ( which is performed on flesh by hand ) .
49002012	At that time you were separate from Messiah , excluded from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise , having no hope and without God in the world .
49002013	But now in Messiah Yeshua , you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of the Messiah .
49002014	For He is our shalom , the One who made the two into one and broke down the middle wall of separation . In His body
49002015	He made the principle of mitzvot by decrees of no effect . He did this in order to create within Himself one new man from the two groups , making shalom ,
49002016	and to reconcile both to God in one body through the cross — by which He put the hostility to death .
49002017	And He came and proclaimed shalom to you who were far away and shalom to those who were near —
49002018	for through Him we both have access to the Father by the same Ruach .
49002019	So then you are no longer strangers and foreigners , but you are fellow citizens with God’s people and members of God’s household .
49002020	You have been built on the foundation made up of the shlichim and prophets , with Messiah Yeshua Himself being the cornerstone .
49002021	In Him the whole building , being fitted together , is growing into a holy temple for the Lord .
49002022	In Him , you also are being built together into God’s dwelling place in the Ruach .
49003001	For this reason I , Paul , am a prisoner of Messiah Yeshua for the sake of you Gentiles .
49003002	Surely you have heard about the plan of God’s grace given to me for you —
49003003	that the mystery was made known to me by revelation , as I wrote before briefly .
49003004	When you read this , you can understand my insight into the mystery of Messiah —
49003005	which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations , as it has now been revealed by the Ruach to His holy shlichim and prophets .
49003006	This mystery is that the Gentiles are joint heirs and fellow members of the same body and co-sharers of the promise in Messiah Yeshua through the Good News .
49003007	I became a servant of this Good News by the gift of God’s favor given to me through the exercise of His power .
49003008	This favor was given to me , the very least of His kedoshim , to proclaim to the Gentiles the endless riches of the Messiah
49003009	and to bring to light the plan of the mystery — which for ages was hidden in God , who created all things .
49003010	The purpose is that through Messiah’s community the multi-faceted wisdom of God might be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places ,
49003011	which is in keeping with the eternal purpose that He carried out in Messiah Yeshua our Lord .
49003012	In Him we have boldness and access with confidence through trusting in Him .
49003013	So I ask you not to be discouraged by my troubles on your behalf — they are your glory .
49003014	For this reason I bow my knees before the Father —
49003015	from Him every family in heaven and on earth receives its name .
49003016	I pray that from His glorious riches He would grant you to be strengthened in your inner being with power through His Ruach ,
49003017	so that Messiah may dwell in your hearts through faith . I pray that you , being rooted and grounded in love ,
49003018	may have strength to grasp with all the kedoshim what is the width and length and height and depth ,
49003019	and to know the love of Messiah which surpasses knowledge , so you may be filled up with all the fullness of God .
49003020	Now to Him who is able to do far beyond all that we ask or imagine , by means of His power that works in us ,
49003021	to Him be the glory in the community of believers and in Messiah Yeshua throughout all generations forever and ever ! Amen .
49004001	Therefore I , a prisoner for the Lord , urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling to which you were called —
49004002	with complete humility and gentleness , with patience , putting up with one another in love ,
49004003	making every effort to keep the unity of the Ruach in the bond of shalom .
49004004	There is one body and one Ruach , just as you also were called in one hope of your calling ;
49004005	one Lord , one faith , one immersion ;
49004006	one God and Father of all , who is over all and through all and in all .
49004007	But to each one of us grace was given in keeping with the measure of Messiah’s gift .
49004008	Therefore it says , “ When He went up on high , He led captive a troop of captives and gave gifts to his people . ”
49004009	Now what does “ He went up ” mean , except that He first went down to the lower regions of the earth ?
49004010	The One who came down is the same One who went up far above all the heavens , in order to fill all things .
49004011	He Himself gave some to be shlichim , some as prophets , some as proclaimers of the Good News , and some as shepherds and teachers —
49004012	to equip the kedoshim for the work of service , for building up the body of Messiah .
49004013	This will continue until we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of Ben-Elohim — to mature adulthood , to the measure of the stature of Messiah’s fullness .
49004014	As a result , we are no longer to be like children , tossed around by the waves and blown all over by every wind of teaching , by the trickery of men with cunning in deceitful scheming .
49004015	Instead , speaking the truth in love , we are to grow up in all ways into Messiah , who is the Head .
49004016	From Him the whole body is fitted and held together by every supporting ligament . The proper working of each individual part produces the body’s growth , for building itself up in love .
49004017	So I tell you this , indeed I insist on it in the Lord — walk no longer as the pagans do , stumbling around in the futility of their thinking .
49004018	They are darkened in their understanding , alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance in them due to the hardness of their heart .
49004019	Since they are past feeling , they have turned themselves over to indecency for the practice of every kind of immorality , with greed for more .
49004020	However , you did not learn Messiah in this way —
49004021	if indeed you have heard Him and were taught in Him , as the truth is in Yeshua .
49004022	With respect to your former lifestyle , you are to lay aside the old self corrupted by its deceitful desires ,
49004023	be renewed in the spirit of your mind ,
49004024	and put on the new self — created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness .
49004025	So lay aside lying and “ each one of you speak truth with his neighbor , ” for we are members of one another .
49004026	“ Be angry , yet do not sin . ” Do not let the sun go down on your anger ,
49004027	nor give the devil a foothold .
49004028	The one who steals must steal no longer — instead he must work , doing something useful with his own hands , so he may have something to share with the one who has need .
49004029	Let no harmful word come out of your mouth , but only what is beneficial for building others up according to the need , so that it gives grace to those who hear it .
49004030	Do not grieve the Ruach ha-Kodesh of God , by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption .
49004031	Get rid of all bitterness and rage and anger and quarreling and slander , along with all malice .
49004032	Instead , be kind to one another , compassionate , forgiving each other just as God in Messiah also forgave you .
49005001	Therefore be imitators of God , as dearly loved children ;
49005002	and walk in love , just as Messiah also loved us and gave Himself up for us as an offering and sacrifice to God for a fragrant aroma .
49005003	But sexual immorality and any impurity or greed — don’t even let these be mentioned among you , as is proper for kedoshim .
49005004	Obscene , coarse , and stupid talk are also out of place , but instead let there be thanksgiving .
49005005	Know for certain that no immoral , indecent , or greedy person — who is really an idol worshipper at heart — has any inheritance in the kingdom of Messiah and God .
49005006	Let no one deceive you with empty words , for because of such things God’s judgment comes on the children of disobedience .
49005007	Therefore do not be partners with them .
49005008	For once you were darkness , but now in union with the Lord you are light . Walk as children of light
49005009	( for the fruit of light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth ) ,
49005010	trying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord .
49005011	Take no part in the fruitless deeds of darkness , but rather expose them —
49005012	for it is disgraceful even to mention the things that are done by them in secret .
49005013	Yet everything exposed by the light is being made visible ,
49005014	for everything made visible is light . This is why it says , “ Wake up , O sleeper ! Rise from the dead , and Messiah will shine on you . ”
49005015	So pay close attention to how you walk — not as unwise people but as wise .
49005016	Make the most of your time because the days are evil .
49005017	For this reason do not be foolish , but understand what the Lord’s will is .
49005018	And do not get drunk on wine , for that is recklessness . Instead , be filled with the Ruach ,
49005019	speaking to one another in psalms , hymns , and spiritual songs , singing and making music in your heart to the Lord —
49005020	always giving thanks for everything to God the Father , in the name of the Lord Yeshua the Messiah .
49005021	Also submit yourselves to one another out of reverence for Messiah —
49005022	wives to your own husbands as to the Lord .
49005023	For the husband is head of the wife , as Messiah also is head of His community — Himself the Savior of the body .
49005024	But as Messiah’s community is submitted to Messiah , so also the wives to their husbands in everything .
49005025	Husbands , love your wives just as Messiah also loved His community and gave Himself up for her
49005026	to make her holy , having cleansed her by immersion in the word .
49005027	Messiah did this so that He might present to Himself His glorious community — not having stain or wrinkle or any such thing , but in order that she might be holy and blameless .
49005028	In the same way , husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies . He who loves his wife loves himself .
49005029	For no one ever hated his own flesh , but nourishes and cherishes it — just as Messiah also does His community ,
49005030	because we are members of His body .
49005031	“ For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife , and the two shall become one flesh . ”
49005032	This mystery is great — but I am talking about Messiah and His community .
49005033	In any case , let each of you love his own wife as himself , and let the wife respect her husband .
49006001	Children , obey your parents in the Lord , for this is right .
49006002	“ Honor your father and mother ” ( which is the first commandment with a promise ) ,
49006003	“ so that it may be well with you , and you may live long on the earth . ”
49006004	Fathers , do not provoke your children to anger , but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord . Orderly Relationships : Workplace
49006005	Slaves , obey your human masters , with respect and reverence , with sincerity of heart , as you would the Messiah —
49006006	not just under your master’s eye as people-pleasers , but as slaves of Messiah doing God’s will from the soul .
49006007	Serve with a positive attitude , as to the Lord and not to men —
49006008	knowing that whatever good each one does , this he will receive back from the Lord , whether slave or free .
49006009	And masters , treat your slaves in the same way . Stop using threats , knowing that the Master — of them and of you , too — is in heaven , and there is no favoritism with Him .
49006010	Finally , be strong in the Lord and in His mighty power .
49006011	Put on the full armor of God , so that you are able to stand against the schemes of the devil .
49006012	For our struggle is not against flesh and blood , but against the rulers , against the powers , against the worldly forces of this darkness , and against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places .
49006013	Therefore , take up the full armor of God , so that you may be able to resist when the times are evil , and after you have done everything , to stand firm .
49006014	Stand firm then ! Buckle the belt of truth around your waist , and put on the breastplate of righteousness .
49006015	Strap up your feet in readiness with the Good News of shalom .
49006016	Above all , take up the shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one .
49006017	And take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Ruach , which is the word of God .
49006018	Pray in the Ruach on every occasion , with all kinds of prayers and requests . With this in mind , keep alert with perseverance and supplication for all the kedoshim .
49006019	And pray for me when I open my mouth to make known with boldness the mystery of the Good News ,
49006020	for which I am an ambassador in chains . Pray that I may speak boldly , the way I should .
49006021	Now Tychicus , my dearly loved brother and faithful servant in the Lord , will give you all the news about me so you may know how I’m doing .
49006022	I have sent him to you for this very reason , so you may know how we are and he may encourage your hearts .
49006023	Shalom to the brethren , and trusting love from God the Father and the Lord Yeshua the Messiah .
49006024	Grace be with all those who love our Lord Yeshua the Messiah with undying love .
50001001	Paul and Timothy , slaves of Messiah Yeshua , To all the kedoshim in Messiah Yeshua who are in Philippi with the overseers and shammashim :
50001002	Grace to you and shalom from God our Father and the Lord Yeshua the Messiah .
50001003	I thank my God at every memory of you ,
50001004	always praying with joy in every prayer of mine for you all ,
50001005	because of your sharing in the Good News from the first day until now .
50001006	I am sure of this very thing — that He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the Day of Messiah Yeshua .
50001007	It is right for me to feel this way about you all , because I have you in my heart — for you all are partakers of grace with me , both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the Good News .
50001008	For God is my witness , how I long for all of you with the affection of Messiah Yeshua .
50001009	Now this I pray , that your love might overflow still more and more in knowledge and depth of discernment ,
50001010	in order to approve what is excellent — so that in the Day of Messiah you may be sincere and blameless ,
50001011	filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Yeshua the Messiah , to the glory and praise of God . Even in Chains , Proclaiming Messiah
50001012	Now I want you to know , brethren , that what has happened to me has actually resulted in the advancement of the Good News .
50001013	And so my imprisonment in the cause of Messiah has become well known throughout the whole Praetorian Guard and to everyone else .
50001014	Because of my imprisonment , most of the brethren have become confident in the Lord to dare more than ever to speak the message fearlessly .
50001015	Some are proclaiming the Messiah out of envy and strife , but others out of good will .
50001016	The latter do so out of love , knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the Good News .
50001017	The former proclaim Messiah not sincerely , but out of selfishness — expecting to stir up trouble for me in my imprisonment .
50001018	But what does it matter ? Only that in every way , whether in dishonesty or in truth , Messiah is being proclaimed — and in this I rejoice ! To Live Is Messiah Yes , and I will keep rejoicing ,
50001019	for I know that this will turn out for my deliverance , through your intercession and the help of the Ruach of Messiah Yeshua .
50001020	My eager expectation and hope is that in no way will I be put to shame , but that with complete boldness Messiah will even now , as always , be exalted in my body — whether through life or through death .
50001021	For to me , to live is Messiah and to die is gain .
50001022	But if to live on in the body means fruit from my work , what shall I choose ? I do not know .
50001023	I am torn between the two — having a desire to leave and be with Messiah , which is far better ;
50001024	yet for your sake , to remain in the body is more necessary .
50001025	Convinced of this , I know that I will remain and continue with you all , for the sake of your progress and joy in the faith —
50001026	so that your confidence in Messiah Yeshua might overflow because of me through my coming to you again .
50001027	Only live your lives in a manner worthy of the Good News of the Messiah . Then , whether I come and see you or I am absent , I may hear of you that you are standing firm in one spirit — striving side by side with one mind for the faith of the Good News
50001028	and not being frightened in any way by your opponents . For them this is a sign of destruction , but for you salvation — and that from God .
50001029	For to you was granted for Messiah’s sake not only to trust in Him , but also to suffer for His sake —
50001030	experiencing the same struggle you saw in me and now you are hearing in me .
50002001	Therefore if there is any encouragement in Messiah , if there is any comfort of love , if there is any fellowship of the Ruach , if there is any mercy and compassion ,
50002002	then make my joy complete by being of the same mind , having the same love , united in spirit , with one purpose .
50002003	Do nothing out of selfishness or conceit , but with humility consider others as more important than yourselves ,
50002004	looking out not only for your own interests but also for the interests of others .
50002005	Have this attitude in yourselves , which also was in Messiah Yeshua ,
50002006	Who , though existing in the form of God , did not consider being equal to God a thing to be grasped .
50002007	But He emptied Himself — taking on the form of a slave , becoming the likeness of men and being found in appearance as a man .
50002008	He humbled Himself — becoming obedient to the point of death , even death on a cross .
50002009	For this reason God highly exalted Him and gave Him the name that is above every name ,
50002010	that at the name of Yeshua every knee should bow , in heaven and on the earth and under the earth ,
50002011	and every tongue profess that Yeshua the Messiah is Lord — to the glory of God the Father .
50002012	Therefore , my loved ones , just as you have always obeyed — not only in my presence , but now even more in my absence — work out your salvation with fear and trembling .
50002013	For the One working in you is God — both to will and to work for His good pleasure .
50002014	Do everything without grumbling or arguing ,
50002015	so that you might be blameless and innocent , children of God in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation . Among them you shine as lights in the world ,
50002016	holding fast to the word of life , so that I may boast in the day of Messiah that I did not run or labor in vain .
50002017	But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and the service of your faith , I rejoice and share my joy with you all .
50002018	The same way , you also — rejoice and share your joy with me !
50002019	But I hope in the Lord Yeshua to send Timothy to you soon , so that I too might be encouraged when I know the news about you .
50002020	I have no one else like him who will genuinely care about you —
50002021	for all seek after their own interests , not those of Messiah Yeshua .
50002022	But you know Timothy’s proven character , that he served with me in spreading the Good News like a son with his father .
50002023	Therefore I hope to send him immediately , as soon as I see how things go with me .
50002024	And I trust in the Lord that soon I too will come myself .
50002025	But I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus — my brother and co-worker and fellow soldier , as well as your messenger and aide to my need .
50002026	For he was longing for you all and troubled because you heard that he was sick .
50002027	He certainly was sick , close to death . But God had mercy on him — and not only on him but also on me , so that I would not have sorrow upon sorrow .
50002028	Therefore I have sent him with special urgency , so that when you see him again you might rejoice and I might be less worried about you .
50002029	So welcome him in the Lord with all joy , and hold men like him in high regard ,
50002030	because he came close to death for the work of Messiah , risking his life to make up for what was lacking in your service to me .
50003001	Finally , my brethren , rejoice in the Lord ! To keep writing the same things to you is not troublesome for me — but for you it is a safeguard .
50003002	Beware of the dogs , beware of the evil workers , beware of the mutilation .
50003003	For it is we who are the circumcision , who worship by the Ruach Elohim and glory in Messiah Yeshua and have not depended on the flesh —
50003004	though I myself might have confidence in the flesh also . If anyone else thinks he might depend on the flesh , I far more —
50003005	circumcised the eighth day ; of the nation of Israel ; from the tribe of Benjamin ; a Hebrew of Hebrews ; in regard to the Torah , a Pharisee ;
50003006	as for zeal , persecuting Messiah’s community ; as for Torah righteousness , found blameless .
50003007	But whatever things were gain to me , these I have considered as loss for the sake of the Messiah .
50003008	More than that , I consider all things to be loss in comparison to the surpassing value of the knowledge of Messiah Yeshua my Lord . Because of Him I have suffered the loss of all things ; and I consider them garbage in order that I might gain Messiah
50003009	and be found in Him not having my righteousness derived from Torah , but one that is through trusting in Messiah — the righteousness from God based on trust .
50003010	My aim is to know Him and the power of His resurrection and the sharing of His sufferings , becoming like Him in His death —
50003011	if somehow I might arrive at the resurrection from among the dead . Pursuing the Goal
50003012	Not that I have already obtained this or been perfected , but I press on if only I might take hold of that for which Messiah Yeshua took hold of me .
50003013	Brethren , I do not consider myself as having taken hold of this . But this one thing I do : forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead ,
50003014	I press on toward the goal for the reward of the upward calling of God in Messiah Yeshua .
50003015	Therefore let all who are mature have this attitude ; and if you have a different attitude in anything , this also God will reveal to you .
50003016	Nevertheless , let us live up to the same standard we have attained .
50003017	Brethren , join in following my example and notice those who walk according to the pattern you have in us . (
50003018	For many walk who are enemies of the cross of Messiah — I have often told you about them , and now I am even weeping as I tell you .
50003019	Their end is destruction — their god is their belly and their glory is in their shame . They set their minds on earthly things . )
50003020	For our citizenship is in heaven , and from there we eagerly wait for the Savior , the Lord Yeshua the Messiah .
50003021	He will transform this humble body of ours into the likeness of His glorious body , through the power that enables Him even to put all things in subjection to Himself .
50004001	Therefore , my brethren whom I love and long for , my joy and crown — stand firm in the Lord in this way , my loved ones .
50004002	I urge Euodia and Syntyche to be in harmony in the Lord .
50004003	Yes , and I ask you , true companion , to help these women — they labored side by side with me in spreading the Good News , together with Clement also and the rest of my fellow workers , whose names are in the Book of Life .
50004004	Rejoice in the Lord always — again I will say , rejoice !
50004005	Let your gentleness be known to all people . The Lord is near .
50004006	Do not be anxious about anything — but in everything , by prayer and petition with thanksgiving , let your requests be made known to God .
50004007	And the shalom of God , which surpasses all understanding , will guard your hearts and your minds in Messiah Yeshua .
50004008	Finally , brethren , whatever is true , whatever is honorable , whatever is just , whatever is pure , whatever is lovely , whatever is commendable — if there is any virtue and if there is anything worthy of praise — dwell on these things .
50004009	What you have learned and received and heard and seen in me — put these things into practice , and the God of shalom will be with you .
50004010	I rejoiced in the Lord greatly , that now at last you have revived your concern for me ( though you were concerned before but lacked opportunity to show it ) .
50004011	I am not saying this because I am in need — for whatever circumstance I am in , I have learned to be content .
50004012	I know what it is to live with humble means , and I know what it is to live in prosperity . In any and every circumstance I have learned the secret of contentment — both to be filled and to go hungry , to have abundance and to suffer need .
50004013	I can do all things through Messiah who strengthens me .
50004014	Nevertheless , you have done well to share in my trouble .
50004015	Now you Philippians also know that in the beginning of the Good News , when I left Macedonia , not a single community partnered with me in giving and receiving — except you alone .
50004016	For even in Thessalonica you sent something for my need more than once .
50004017	Not that I am looking for a gift , but for fruit that overflows to your credit .
50004018	But I have received everything and have more than enough . I am amply supplied , having received from Epaphroditus what you sent — a fragrant aroma , an acceptable sacrifice , pleasing to God .
50004019	My God will fulfill every need of yours according to the riches of His glory in Messiah Yeshua .
50004020	To our God and Father be the glory forever and ever ! Amen .
50004021	Greet all the kedoshim in Messiah Yeshua . The brethren who are with me greet you .
50004022	All the kedoshim greet you , especially those of Caesar’s household .
50004023	The grace of the Lord Yeshua the Messiah be with your spirit .
51001001	Paul , a shaliach of Messiah Yeshua by God’s will , and Timothy our brother ,
51001002	To the kedoshim , the faithful brethren in Messiah , who are at Colossae : Grace and shalom to you from God our Father !
51001003	We always thank God , the Father of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah , whenever we pray for you .
51001004	For we heard of your trust in Messiah Yeshua and the love you have for all the kedoshim
51001005	because of the hope stored up for you in heaven . You heard before about this hope in the true message of the Good News
51001006	that has come to you . In all the world this Good News is bearing fruit and growing , just as it has in you since you first heard it and came to truly know God’s grace .
51001007	You learned it from Epaphras — our dearly loved fellow slave , who is a faithful servant of Messiah on our behalf .
51001008	He also made clear to us your love in the Ruach .
51001009	For this reason also , ever since we heard about you , we have not stopped praying for you . We keep asking God that you might be filled with the knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding —
51001010	to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord , to please Him in all respects , bearing fruit in every good work and growing in the knowledge of God .
51001011	We pray that you may be strengthened with all the power that comes from His glorious might , for you to have all kinds of patience and steadfastness . With joy
51001012	we give thanks to the Father , who qualified you to share in the inheritance of the kedoshim in the light .
51001013	He rescued us from the domain of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son whom He loves .
51001014	In Him we have redemption — the release of sins .
51001015	He is the image of the invisible God , the firstborn of all creation .
51001016	For by Him all things were created — in heaven and on earth , the seen and the unseen , whether thrones or angelic powers or rulers or authorities . All was created through Him and for Him .
51001017	He exists before everything , and in Him all holds together .
51001018	He is the head of the body , His community . He is the beginning , the firstborn from the dead — so that He might come to have first place in all things .
51001019	For God was pleased to have all His fullness dwell in Him
51001020	and through Him to reconcile all things to Himself , making peace through the blood of His cross — whether things on earth or things in heaven !
51001021	Once you were alienated from God and hostile in your attitude by wicked deeds .
51001022	But now He has reconciled you in Messiah’s physical body through death , in order to present you holy , spotless and blameless in His eyes —
51001023	if indeed you continue in the faith , established and firm , not budging from the hope of the Good News that you have heard . This Good News has been proclaimed throughout all creation under heaven , and I , Paul , have become its servant . The Mystery Revealed
51001024	Now I rejoice in my sufferings for you , and in my physical body — for the sake of His body , Messiah’s community — I fill up what is lacking in the afflictions of Messiah .
51001025	I became its servant according to God’s commission , given to me for you , in order to declare His message in full —
51001026	the mystery that was hidden for ages and generations , but now has been revealed to His kedoshim .
51001027	God chose to make known to them this glorious mystery regarding the Gentiles — which is Messiah in you , the hope of glory !
51001028	We proclaim Him , warning and teaching everyone in all wisdom , so that we may present every person complete in Messiah .
51001029	To this end I labor , striving with all His strength which is powerfully at work in me .
51002001	I want you to know how great a struggle I have for you and for those in Laodicea , as well as for those who have still not seen me face to face .
51002002	My purpose is that their hearts , joined together in love , may be encouraged . May they have all the riches of the full assurance of understanding , leading to a true knowledge of the mystery of God — that is , Messiah .
51002003	In Him all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden .
51002004	I am telling you this so that no one will deceive you with persuasive-sounding arguments .
51002005	For even though I am absent in body , yet I am with you in spirit — rejoicing to see your good order and the steadfastness of your trust in Messiah .
51002006	Therefore as you received Messiah Yeshua as Lord , so continue to walk in Him —
51002007	rooted and built up in Him and established in your faith just as you were taught , overflowing with thankfulness .
51002008	See that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception , according to the tradition of men and the basic principles of the world rather than Messiah .
51002009	For all the fullness of Deity lives bodily in Him ,
51002010	and in Him you have been filled to fullness . He is the head over every ruler and authority .
51002011	In Him you were also circumcised with a circumcision done not by hand , in the stripping away of the body of the flesh through the circumcision of Messiah .
51002012	You were buried along with Him in immersion , through which you also were raised with Him by trusting in the working of God , who raised Him from the dead .
51002013	When you were dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh , God made you alive together with Him when He pardoned us all our transgressions .
51002014	He wiped out the handwritten record of debts with the decrees against us , which was hostile to us . He took it away by nailing it to the cross .
51002015	After disarming the principalities and powers , He made a public spectacle of them , triumphing over them in the cross .
51002016	Therefore , do not let anyone pass judgment on you in matters of food or drink , or in respect to a festival or new moon or Shabbat .
51002017	These are a foreshadowing of things to come , but the reality is Messiah .
51002018	Let no one disqualify you by insisting on false humility and worship of angels — going into detail about what he has seen , puffed up without cause by his fleshly mind .
51002019	He is not holding fast to the Head . It is from Him that the whole body , nourished and held together by its joints and tendons , grows with a godly increase .
51002020	If you died with Messiah to the basic principles of the world , why — as though living in the world — do you subject yourselves to their rules ?
51002021	“ Don’t handle ! Don’t taste ! Don’t touch ! ”
51002022	These all lead to decay with use , based as they are on man-made commands and teachings .
51002023	Indeed , these are matters that have an appearance of wisdom in self-made religion and humility and self-denial of the body — yet none are of any value for stopping indulgence of the flesh .
51003001	Therefore , if you have been raised up with Messiah , keep seeking the things above — where Messiah is , sitting at the right hand of God .
51003002	Focus your mind on things above , not on things on the earth .
51003003	For you have died , and your life is hidden with Messiah in God .
51003004	When Messiah , who is your life , is revealed , then you also will be revealed with Him , in glory !
51003005	Therefore , put to death what is earthly in you — sexual immorality , impurity , lust , evil desire , and greed — for that is idolatry .
51003006	Because of such things God’s wrath is coming upon the sons of disobedience .
51003007	At one time you also walked in these ways , when you used to live in these ways .
51003008	But now , set them all aside — anger , rage , malice , slander , and foul language out of your mouth .
51003009	Do not lie to one another . After all , you have taken off the old self with its practices
51003010	and have put on the new self that is being renewed in knowledge , according to the image of the One who created him .
51003011	Here there is no longer Greek and Jew , circumcised and uncircumcised , barbarian , savage , slave and free ; but Messiah is all , and in all .
51003012	Therefore , as God’s chosen people , holy and dearly loved , clothe yourselves in tender compassion , kindness , humility , gentleness , and patience —
51003013	bearing with one another and forgiving each other , if anyone has a grievance against another . Just as the Lord pardoned you , so also you must pardon others .
51003014	But above all these things put on love , which is the bond of perfect harmony .
51003015	Let the shalom of Messiah rule in your hearts — to this shalom you were surely called in one body . Also be thankful .
51003016	Let the word of Messiah dwell in you richly , teaching and admonishing one another with all wisdom in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , singing with gratitude in your hearts to God .
51003017	And whatever you do in word or deed , do all in the name of the Lord Yeshua , giving thanks to God the Father through Him .
51003018	Wives , submit yourselves to your husbands , as is fitting in the Lord .
51003019	Husbands , love your wives and do not become harsh toward them .
51003020	Children , obey your parents in every respect , for this is pleasing to the Lord .
51003021	Fathers , do not provoke your children , so they will not become discouraged .
51003022	Slaves , obey your human masters in every respect — not just within your master’s sight as people-pleasers , but with sincerity of heart , fearing the Lord .
51003023	Whatever you do , work at it from the soul , as for the Lord and not for people .
51003024	For you know that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as a reward . It is to the Lord Messiah you are giving service .
51003025	For the one doing wrong will be paid back for what he did wrong , and there is no favoritism .
51004001	Masters , give your slaves what is just and fair , knowing that you also have a Master in heaven .
51004002	Devote yourselves to prayer , keeping alert in it with thanksgiving .
51004003	At the same time , keep praying for us as well , that God may open up to us a door for the message , to proclaim the mystery of Messiah — for which I am in prison .
51004004	Pray that I may make the mystery clear , as I ought to speak .
51004005	Conduct yourselves with wisdom toward outsiders , making the most of the opportunity .
51004006	Let your speech always be with grace , seasoned with salt , to know how you ought to answer everyone .
51004007	Tychicus — a dearly loved brother and trustworthy servant and fellow slave to the Lord — will tell you all the news about me .
51004008	I sent him to you for this very purpose , so you may know about us and he may encourage your hearts .
51004009	With him I sent Onesimus — a faithful and dear brother , who is one of your own . They will tell you about everything here .
51004010	My fellow prisoner Aristarchus sends you his greetings , as does Mark , the cousin of Barnabas . ( You received instructions about him — if he comes your way , welcome him . )
51004011	Yeshua who is called Justus also sends his greetings . These are the only fellow workers for the kingdom of God that are from among the circumcision — they have been a comfort to me .
51004012	Epaphras , who is one of your own , a slave of Messiah Yeshua , greets you . He is always laboring in prayer on your behalf , so you may stand complete and fully assured about everything that is God’s will .
51004013	For I testify that he has gone to much trouble for you and for those in Laodicea and Hierapolis .
51004014	Luke , the dearly loved physician , sends you greetings , and so does Demas .
51004015	Greet the brethren in Laodicea , as well as Nympha and the community that meets in her house .
51004016	When this letter has been read among you , make sure that it is also read in Messiah’s community of Laodicea . In turn , you should read my letter coming from Laodicea .
51004017	Tell Archippus , “ See to it that you complete the service you have received in the Lord , that you may fulfill it . ”
51004018	This greeting is in my own hand — Paul’s . Remember my chains ! Grace be with you .
52001001	Paul , Silvanus , and Timothy , To the community of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Yeshua the Messiah : Grace to you and shalom . Good News with Power
52001002	We always give thanks to God for all of you , mentioning you in our prayers — continually
52001003	remembering before our God and Father your work of faith and labor of love and steadiness of hope in our Lord Yeshua the Messiah .
52001004	We know , brethren loved by God , that you are chosen ,
52001005	because our Good News did not come to you in word only , but also in power and in the Ruach ha-Kodesh and with complete certainty — just as you know what kind of men we proved to be while among you for your sake .
52001006	You also became imitators of us and of the Lord , having accepted the message in much tribulation , with the joy of the Ruach ha-Kodesh .
52001007	So you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia .
52001008	For the word of the Lord rang out from you — not just in Macedonia and Achaia , but also in every place your faithfulness toward God has gone out , so that we have no need to say anything .
52001009	For they themselves bring news about what kind of welcome we had among you , and how you turned to God from idols , to serve the living and true God ,
52001010	and to wait for His Son from heaven , whom He raised from the dead — Yeshua , the One delivering us from the coming wrath .
52002001	For you yourselves know , brethren , that our visit to you was not in vain .
52002002	On the contrary , after we had first suffered and been mistreated in Philippi , as you know , we had boldness in our God to tell you the Good News of God — even in the midst of much opposition .
52002003	For our urging is not out of deceit or impure motives or trickery .
52002004	But just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the Good News , so we declare it — not pleasing men but rather God , who examines our hearts .
52002005	For as you know and God is witness , we never came with a word of flattery or a motive of greed —
52002006	or seeking glory from people , whether from you or from others ,
52002007	even though we could have thrown our weight around as shlichim of Messiah . Rather , we proved to be infants among you . Like a nursing mother cherishes her children ,
52002008	in this way we were yearning for you . We were delighted to share with you not only the Good News of God but also our very souls , because you had become dear to us .
52002009	For you recall , brethren , our labor and hardship — working night and day , so as not to burden any of you while we proclaimed to you the Good News of God .
52002010	You are witnesses , along with God , of how devoutly and righteously and blamelessly we behaved toward you who believe .
52002011	For you know how , as a father with his own children ,
52002012	we exhorted and encouraged and urged each one of you to walk in a manner worthy of God , who calls you into His own kingdom and glory .
52002013	For this reason , we also thank God constantly that when you received the word of God which you heard from us , you accepted it not as the word of men , but as it truly is — the word of God , which does its work in you who believe .
52002014	For you , brethren , became imitators of God’s communities in Messiah Yeshua that are in Judea — for you suffered the same things at the hands of your own countrymen as they did from the Judean leaders
52002015	who killed both the Lord Yeshua and the prophets and drove us out . They are not pleasing to God and hostile to all people ,
52002016	hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they might be saved . As a result , they constantly fill up the measure of their sins . But wrath has come upon them at last . Longing to Visit and Reassure
52002017	But brethren , after we were orphaned by separation from you for a short time ( in person , not in heart ) , we were all the more eager in our great longing to see you face to face .
52002018	For we wanted to come to you — I , Paul , more than once — but satan thwarted us .
52002019	For who is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our Lord Yeshua at His coming ? Is it not you ?
52002020	For you are our glory and joy !
52003001	So when we could stand it no longer , we thought it best to be left behind alone in Athens .
52003002	We sent Timothy , our brother and co-worker for God in proclaiming the Good News of Messiah , in order to strengthen and encourage you in your faith ,
52003003	so that no one would be shaken by these afflictions . For you yourselves know we are destined for this .
52003004	For even when we were with you , we kept telling you in advance that we were going to suffer persecution — just as has happened , as you know .
52003005	For this reason , when I could stand it no longer , I sent to find out about your faithfulness , for fear that the tempter had tempted you and that our labor might be in vain .
52003006	But now that Timothy has come to us from you and brought us the good news of your faithfulness and love , and that you always have good memories of us , longing to see us just as we long to see you —
52003007	because of this , brethren , in all our distress and trouble , we were comforted about you by your faithfulness .
52003008	For now we live , since you are standing firm in the Lord .
52003009	For what thanks would be enough to offer to God , in return for all the joy we feel before our God because of you ?
52003010	Night time and day time we keep praying more than ever to see you face to face , and mend any shortcomings in your faith . Thanks , Joy , and Love Before God
52003011	Now may our God and Father Himself and Yeshua our Lord direct our way to you .
52003012	May the Lord also cause you to increase and overflow in love for one another and for all people , just as we also do for you ,
52003013	in order to strengthen your hearts as blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Yeshua with all His kedoshim . Amen .
52004001	Finally then , brethren , we ask you and appeal in the Lord Yeshua — just as you received from us the way you ought to walk and please God ( as in fact you are walking ) — that you keep progressing more and more .
52004002	For you know what instructions we gave you through the Lord Yeshua .
52004003	For this is the will of God — your sanctification : to abstain from sexual immorality ;
52004004	to know , each of you , how to gain control over his own body in holiness and honor —
52004005	not in the passion of lust like the pagans who do not know God ;
52004006	and not to overstep his brother and take advantage of him in this matter — because the Lord is the avenger in all these things , as we told you before and solemnly warned you .
52004007	For God did not call us to impurity , but in holiness .
52004008	Consequently , the one who rejects this is not rejecting man , but God , who gives His Ruach ha-Kodesh to you .
52004009	Now concerning brotherly love , you have no need for anyone to write you — for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another .
52004010	In fact , you even practice it toward all your brethren throughout Macedonia . But we urge you , brethren , to keep progressing more and more
52004011	and aspire to lead a quiet life , to mind your own affairs , and to work with your hands , just as we directed you —
52004012	so you may behave properly toward outsiders and not have need of anything . The Shofar Call of Messiah’s Return
52004013	Now we do not want you to be uninformed , brethren , about those who are asleep , so that you may not grieve like the rest who have no hope .
52004014	For if we believe that Yeshua died and rose again , so with Him God will also bring those who have fallen asleep in Yeshua .
52004015	For this we tell you , by the word of the Lord , that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord shall in no way precede those who are asleep .
52004016	For the Lord Himself shall come down from heaven with a commanding shout , with the voice of the archangel and with the blast of God’s shofar , and the dead in Messiah shall rise first .
52004017	Then we who are alive , who are left behind , will be caught up together with them in the clouds , to meet the Lord in the air — and so we shall always be with the Lord .
52004018	Therefore encourage one another with these words .
52005001	Now concerning the times and seasons , brethren , you have no need for anything to be written to you .
52005002	For you yourselves know very well that the Day of the Lord comes like a thief in the night .
52005003	When they are saying , “ Shalom and safety , ” sudden destruction comes upon them like a woman having birth pains in the womb — there is no way they will escape .
52005004	But you , brethren , are not in the dark , so that the Day might overtake you like a thief .
52005005	For you all are sons of light and sons of day . We are not of night or of darkness —
52005006	so then , let us not sleep as the others do , but let us remain on the alert and sober-minded .
52005007	For those who sleep , sleep at night ; and those who get drunk , get drunk at night .
52005008	But since we are of the day , let us be sober-minded — putting on the breastplate of faithfulness and love , and the hope of salvation as a helmet .
52005009	For God did not destine us for wrath but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Yeshua the Messiah .
52005010	He died for us so that , whether we may be awake or asleep , we may live together with Him .
52005011	Therefore encourage one another and build each other up — just as you in fact are doing .
52005012	Now we ask you , brethren , to recognize those who work hard among you and are over you in the Lord and correct you ,
52005013	and to esteem them beyond all measure in love because of their work . Keep shalom among yourselves .
52005014	We urge you , brethren , correct the unruly , comfort the fainthearted , help the weak , be patient with everyone .
52005015	See that no one repays evil for evil to anyone , but always pursue what is good for one another and for all .
52005016	Rejoice always ,
52005017	pray constantly ,
52005018	in everything give thanks ; for this is God’s will for you in Messiah Yeshua .
52005019	Do not quench the Ruach ,
52005020	do not despise prophetic messages ,
52005021	but test all things , hold fast to what is good ,
52005022	keep away from every kind of evil .
52005023	Now may the God of shalom Himself make you completely holy ; and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept complete , blameless at the coming of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah .
52005024	Faithful is the One who calls you — and He will make it happen ! Closing Greetings
52005025	Brethren , pray for us .
52005026	Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss .
52005027	I charge you under oath , by the Lord , that this letter be read to all the brethren .
52005028	The grace of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah be with you .
53001001	Paul , Silvanus , and Timothy , To the community of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Yeshua the Messiah :
53001002	Grace to you and shalom from God our Father and the Lord Yeshua the Messiah ! Troubles From an Eternal Perspective
53001003	We ought to always thank God for you , brethren , as is appropriate , because your faithfulness grows wonderfully , and the love of each one of you for one another continually increases .
53001004	Therefore , we ourselves boast of you among the communities of God — about your perseverance and faithfulness through all the persecutions and troubles that you endure .
53001005	This is evidence of the righteous judgment of God , so that you may be considered worthy of the kingdom of God , for which indeed you are suffering . (
53001006	For after all , it is right in the sight of God to pay back trouble to those who trouble you ,
53001007	and relief to you who suffer trouble along with us . At the revelation of the Lord Yeshua from heaven with His mighty angels
53001008	in flaming fire , He will command judgment on those who do not know God and do not heed the Good News of our Lord Yeshua .
53001009	They will pay the price of eternal ruin , away from the presence of the Lord and the glory of His power —
53001010	on that Day when He comes to be glorified among His kedoshim and marveled at by all who have believed , because our testimony to you was believed . )
53001011	With this in mind , we pray for you constantly , that our God may consider you worthy of the calling and fulfill with power every good desire and work of faith ,
53001012	so the name of our Lord Yeshua may be glorified in you , and you in Him , in keeping with the grace of our God and the Lord Yeshua the Messiah .
53002001	Now we ask you , brethren , concerning the coming of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah and our gathering together to Him ,
53002002	not to get shaken out of your mind or disturbed — either by a spirit or a word or a letter as if through us — as though the Day of the Lord has come .
53002003	Let no one deceive you in any way , for the Day will not come unless the rebellion comes first and the man of lawlessness is revealed , the one destined to be destroyed .
53002004	He opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god or object of worship , so that he sits in the Temple of God , proclaiming himself that he is God .
53002005	Don’t you remember that when I was still with you I was telling you these things ?
53002006	And you know what now holds back , for him to be revealed in his own time .
53002007	For the mystery of lawlessness is already operating ; only there is one who holds back just now , until he is taken out of the way .
53002008	Then the lawless one will be revealed . The Lord Yeshua will slay him with the breath of His mouth and wipe him out with the appearance of His coming .
53002009	The coming of the lawless one is connected to the activity of satan , with all power and signs and false wonders ,
53002010	and with every kind of wicked deception toward those who are perishing . They perish because they did not accept the love of the truth so as to be saved .
53002011	For this reason God sends them a delusional force , to lead them to believe what is false ,
53002012	so that they may be judged — all those who did not believe the truth but delighted in wickedness . Firstfruits of Salvation
53002013	But we should always give thanks to God for you , brethren loved by the Lord , because God chose you as firstfruits for salvation through sanctification by the Ruach and belief in the truth .
53002014	He called you to this salvation through our proclaiming the Good News , for you to gain the glory of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah .
53002015	So then , brethren , stand firm and hold on to the traditions which you were taught , whether by word of mouth or by our letter .
53002016	Now may our Lord Yeshua the Messiah Himself and God our Father , who loved us and by grace gave us eternal comfort and good hope ,
53002017	comfort and strengthen your hearts in every good deed and word .
53003001	Finally , brethren , pray for us that the word of the Lord may spread quickly and be glorified — just as it is with you .
53003002	Also pray that we may be rescued from perverse and evil people , for not all are trustworthy .
53003003	But the Lord is trustworthy — and He will strengthen and protect you from the evil one .
53003004	We have confidence in the Lord concerning you , that you are doing and will keep doing what we command .
53003005	May the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patience of Messiah . No Time to Be Lazy
53003006	Now we command you , brethren , in the name of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah , to keep away from every brother who behaves irresponsibly and not according to the tradition they received from us .
53003007	For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us , for we did not behave inappropriately among you .
53003008	And we did not eat anyone’s bread without paying for it , but worked night and day with labor and hardship , so as not to burden any of you .
53003009	It wasn’t that we had no right , but rather to offer ourselves as an example for you to imitate .
53003010	For even when we were with you , we would give you this order : if anyone will not work , neither shall he eat .
53003011	For we hear that some among you are behaving irresponsibly — not busy , but busybodies .
53003012	Now such people we command and urge in the Lord Messiah Yeshua to work in a quiet demeanor , so they may eat their own bread .
53003013	But as for you , brethren , do not grow weary of doing good .
53003014	If anyone does not obey our message in this letter , take special note of him and do not associate with him , so that he may be put to shame .
53003015	Yet do not consider him as an enemy , but warn him as a brother .
53003016	Now may the Lord of shalom Himself give you shalom at all times and in every way . The Lord be with you all !
53003017	The greeting is in my own hand — Paul’s . It is a sign in every letter — in this way I write .
53003018	The grace of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah be with you all .
54001001	Paul , a shaliach of Messiah Yeshua by the command of God our Savior and Messiah Yeshua , our hope .
54001002	To Timothy , a true child in faith : Grace , mercy , shalom from God the Father and Messiah Yeshua , our Lord !
54001003	As I urged you , when I was leaving for Macedonia , stay in Ephesus to direct certain people not to pass on different instruction ,
54001004	or to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies . These give rise to useless speculations rather than God’s training which is in faithfulness .
54001005	Now the goal of this command is love from of a pure heart and a clear conscience and a genuine faith .
54001006	Some , having missed the mark , have turned away to fruitless discussion —
54001007	wanting to be teachers of Torah , even though they do not understand what they keep saying or what they so dogmatically assert .
54001008	But we know that the Torah is good if one uses it legitimately ,
54001009	knowing that the Torah is not given for a tzaddik but for the lawless and rebellious , for the ungodly and sinful , for the unholy and worldly , for those who kill their fathers or mothers , for murderers ,
54001010	the sexually immoral , homosexuals , slave-traders , liars , perjurers , and for anything else that opposes sound teaching —
54001011	in keeping with what was entrusted to me , the glorious Good News of the blessed God .
54001012	I thank Messiah Yeshua our Lord , who has strengthened me , because He considered me faithful , appointing me to service —
54001013	even though I was formerly a blasphemer , a persecutor , and a violent man . Yet I was shown mercy because I had acted ignorantly in unbelief ,
54001014	and the grace of our Lord overflowed with the faith and love that are in Messiah Yeshua .
54001015	Trustworthy is the saying and deserving of complete acceptance : “ Messiah Yeshua came into the world to save sinners ” — of whom I am foremost .
54001016	Yet for this reason I was shown mercy — so that in me as the foremost , Messiah Yeshua might demonstrate His complete patience , as an example for those about to put their trust in Him for eternal life .
54001017	Now to the King eternal , immortal , invisible , the only God , be honor and glory forever and ever . Amen .
54001018	This charge I entrust to you , Timothy my son , in keeping with the prophecies once spoken about you , so that by them you fight the good fight ,
54001019	holding onto faith and a good conscience . By rejecting these , some have suffered shipwreck regarding their faith .
54001020	Among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander — whom I have handed over to satan to be disciplined not to blaspheme .
54002001	Therefore , first of all I urge that requests , prayers , intercessions , and thanksgiving be made on behalf of all people —
54002002	for kings and all who are in authority — so we may live a peaceful and quiet life in all godliness and respectfulness .
54002003	This is good and pleasing in the sight of God our Savior .
54002004	He desires all men to be saved and come into the knowledge of the truth .
54002005	For there is one God and there is one Mediator between God and men — a human , Messiah Yeshua ,
54002006	who gave Himself as a ransom for all — the testimony at the proper time .
54002007	For this I was appointed a herald and a shaliach ( I am telling the truth ; I am not lying ) , a teacher of the Gentiles in faithfulness and truth .
54002008	So I desire all men to pray everywhere , lifting up holy hands , without anger and argument .
54002009	Likewise , women are to adorn themselves in appropriate clothing with modesty and sound judgment — not in seductive hairstyles and gold or pearls or costly clothing ,
54002010	but what is suitable for women claiming godliness , through good deeds .
54002011	Let a woman receive training in a quiet demeanor with complete respect for order .
54002012	But I do not allow a woman to train or dictate to a man , but to be in a quiet demeanor .
54002013	For Adam was formed first , then Eve .
54002014	Also Adam was not deceived but the woman — being deceived , she fell into transgression .
54002015	Nevertheless , she will be sustained through childbearing — if they continue in faithfulness and love and holiness , with sound judgment .
54003001	Trustworthy is the saying : “ If any man aspires to the office of overseer , he desires a good work . ”
54003002	An overseer , then , must be beyond criticism — the husband of one wife , clear-minded , self-controlled , respectable , hospitable , able to teach ,
54003003	not addicted to wine , not violent but gentle , peaceable , free from the love of money ,
54003004	managing his own household well , keeping his children under control with all respectfulness .
54003005	( But if someone does not know how to manage his own household , how will he care for God’s community ? )
54003006	He must not be a new believer , or he may become puffed up and fall into the same judgment as the devil .
54003007	Furthermore , he must have a good reputation with those outside , so that he will not fall into disgrace and the devil’s trap .
54003008	Shammashim likewise must be dignified , not double-speaking , not addicted to much wine , not greedy for dishonest gain .
54003009	They must keep hold of the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience .
54003010	Also let them first be tested — then let those who are blameless serve as shammashim .
54003011	Women likewise must be dignified , not backbiting ; clear-minded , trustworthy in every respect .
54003012	Let shammashim be husbands of one wife , managing their children and their own households well .
54003013	For those who have served well as shammashim gain for themselves a good standing and great confidence in the faith that is in Messiah Yeshua .
54003014	These things I write to you , hoping to come to you shortly .
54003015	But if I delay , I write so you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the household of God — which is the community of the living God , a pillar and foundation of truth .
54003016	Now beyond question , great is the mystery of godliness : He was revealed in the flesh , Vindicated in the Ruach , Seen by angels , Proclaimed among the nations , Trusted throughout the world , Taken up in glory .
54004001	Now the Ruach clearly says that in later times some will fall away from the faith , following deceitful spirits and teachings of demons
54004002	through the hypocrisy of false speakers — whose own conscience has been seared .
54004003	They forbid people to marry ; they command people to abstain from foods that God created for the faithful to share with thanksgiving , having come to know the truth .
54004004	For everything created by God is good , and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving ;
54004005	for it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer .
54004006	In pointing out these things to the brethren , you will be a good servant of Messiah Yeshua , nourished in the words of the faith and the sound teaching that you have been following .
54004007	But avoid godless myths and old wives’ tales ; instead , train yourself in godliness .
54004008	For physical exercise has some benefit ; but godliness is beneficial for all things , holding promise for both the present life and the one to come .
54004009	Trustworthy is the saying and deserving of complete acceptance
54004010	( for to this end we work hard and strive ) : “ We have set our hope on the living God , who is the Savior of all people , especially those who trust . ”
54004011	Insist on these things and teach them .
54004012	Let no one look down on your youthfulness , but become an example of the faithful — in speech , in conduct , in love , in faithfulness , and in purity .
54004013	Until I come , devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture , to encouragement , and to teaching .
54004014	Do not neglect the spiritual gift within you , which was given to you through prophecy with the laying on of hands of the elders .
54004015	Practice these things — be absorbed in them , so that your progress may be clear to all .
54004016	Give attention to yourself and your teaching . Persevere in these things , for in doing so you will save yourself and those who hear you .
54005001	Never speak harshly to an older man but appeal to him as a father ; to younger men as brethren ;
54005002	older women as mothers ; and younger women as sisters — with complete purity .
54005003	Honor widows who are really widows —
54005004	but if any widow has children or grandchildren , they must first learn to show devotion to their own home and give back to their parents , for this is pleasing before God .
54005005	Now she who is really a widow and has been left alone , has put her hope in God and continues in petitions and prayers night and day .
54005006	But she who is self-indulgent is dead even while she lives .
54005007	Insist on these things , so that they might be beyond criticism .
54005008	But if anyone does not provide for his own , especially those in his own house , he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever .
54005009	Let a widow be listed only if she is at least sixty , was the wife of one husband ,
54005010	well known for good deeds , if she raised children , if she showed hospitality , if she washed the feet of the kedoshim , if she helped those in trouble , and if she devoted herself to every good work .
54005011	But refuse younger widows ; for when their sensual desires draw them away from the Messiah , they want to get married —
54005012	facing judgment because they have set aside their previous pledge .
54005013	And at the same time , they also learn to be idle , going around from house to house — and not just idle , but also gossipers and busybodies , saying things they should not .
54005014	Therefore , I want the younger widows to get married , have children , manage a household , and give no opportunity to the enemy for slander .
54005015	For some have already gone astray after satan .
54005016	If any woman of faith has widows in need , let her help them and not let the community be burdened , so it may help the real widows .
54005017	The elders who lead well are worthy of honor and honorarium — especially those who work hard in the word and teaching .
54005018	For the Scripture says , “ You shall not muzzle the ox while he is threshing , ” and , “ The worker is worthy of his wage . ”
54005019	Do not accept an accusation against an elder except on the evidence of two or three witnesses .
54005020	Correct those who continue sinning in the presence of everyone , so that the rest also may fear .
54005021	I solemnly charge you — before God and Messiah Yeshua and the chosen angels — to observe these things without taking sides , doing nothing out of favoritism .
54005022	Do not lay hands on anyone hastily or take part in the sins of others — keep yourself pure .
54005023	( No longer drink only water , but use a little wine for your stomach and for your frequent ailments . )
54005024	The sins of some people are obvious , going before them into judgment ; but for others , their sins follow .
54005025	Likewise , good deeds are obvious , and the others cannot stay hidden .
54006001	Let all who are under the yoke as slaves consider their own masters worthy of full respect , so that God’s name and our teaching may not be slandered .
54006002	And let those who have believing masters not disrespect them because they are brethren , but serve them even more , since those who share in the benefit are believers and loved . Teach and encourage these things .
54006003	If anyone passes on a different teaching and does not agree with sound words , those of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah , and with the instruction in keeping with godliness ,
54006004	he is prideful , understanding nothing . Instead he is obsessed with arguments and disputes about words — out of which come envy , strife , slander , evil suspicions ,
54006005	and constant friction between people corrupted in mind and deprived of the truth , who suppose that godliness is a means of gain .
54006006	Now godliness with contentment is great gain .
54006007	For we brought nothing into this world , So we cannot take anything out of it .
54006008	But having food and clothing , with these things we shall be content .
54006009	But those who want to be rich fall into temptation and a trap and many foolish and harmful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction .
54006010	For the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil — some , longing for it , have gone astray from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows .
54006011	But you , O man of God , flee from these things and pursue righteousness , godliness , faithfulness , love , perseverance , and gentleness .
54006012	Fight the good fight of faith ! Take hold of the eternal life — you were called to it , and you made the good confession for it in the presence of many witnesses .
54006013	I charge you before God who gives life to all things and Messiah Yeshua who testified the good confession before Pontius Pilate ,
54006014	t0 keep this command without spot or blame until the appearing of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah .
54006015	This He will reveal in His own time — the blessed and only Ruler , the King of kings and the Lord of lords ,
54006016	who alone has immortality , dwelling in unapproachable light , whom no man has seen or is able to see . To Him be honor and eternal dominion ! Amen .
54006017	Direct those who are rich in this present age not to be proud or to fix their hope on the uncertainty of riches , but rather on God — who richly provides us with everything to enjoy .
54006018	Direct them to do good , to be rich in good deeds , to be generous , sharing ,
54006019	storing up for themselves a good foundation for the future , so they might take hold of the true life .
54006020	O Timothy , guard what has been entrusted to you , turning away from pointless chatter and the contradictions of so-called knowledge —
54006021	by professing it , some have missed the mark concerning the faith . Grace be with you .
55001001	Paul , a shaliach of Messiah Yeshua through the will of God , according to the promise of life in Messiah Yeshua .
55001002	To Timothy my beloved child : Grace , mercy , and shalom from God the Father and Messiah Yeshua our Lord !
55001003	I thank God , whom I serve with a clear conscience as my forefathers did , when I continually remember you in my prayers night and day .
55001004	I remember your tears , and I long to see you so that I may be filled with joy .
55001005	I recall the genuine faithfulness within you , which first lived in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice , and I am sure it is within you as well .
55001006	For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God , which is in you through the laying on of my hands .
55001007	For God has not given us a spirit of timidity but of power and love and self-discipline .
55001008	Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord or of me His prisoner , but share in suffering for the Good News according to the power of God .
55001009	He has saved us and called us with a holy calling — not because of our deeds but because of His own purpose and grace . This grace was given to us in Messiah Yeshua before time began ,
55001010	but now has been revealed through the appearing of our Savior Messiah Yeshua . Indeed , He nullified the power of death and brought life and immortality to light through the Good News .
55001011	For this Good News I was appointed a herald and a shaliach and a teacher .
55001012	For this reason I also am suffering these things — but I am not ashamed , for I know in whom I have trusted and I am convinced He is able to safeguard what I have entrusted to Him until that Day .
55001013	Keep the standard of sound words you have heard from me , in the faithfulness and love that are in Messiah Yeshua .
55001014	Guard the good that has been entrusted to you , through the Ruach ha-Kodesh who dwells in us .
55001015	You are aware that everyone in Asia has turned away from me — including Phygelus and Hermogenes .
55001016	May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus , because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my imprisonment .
55001017	On the contrary , when he was in Rome he zealously searched for me and found me .
55001018	May the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord in that day ! You know very well how much he served in Ephesus .
55002001	Therefore , my child , be strengthened in the grace that is in Messiah Yeshua .
55002002	And what you have heard from me among many witnesses , entrust to faithful people who will be capable to teach others also .
55002003	Suffer hardship with me , as a good soldier of Messiah Yeshua .
55002004	No one serving as a soldier entangles himself in the activities of everyday life , so that he might please the one who enlisted him .
55002005	Also , if anyone competes as an athlete , he is not crowned victorious unless he competes according to the rules .
55002006	The hard-working farmer ought to receive the first share of the crops .
55002007	Consider what I am saying , for the Lord will give you understanding in everything .
55002008	Remember Yeshua the Messiah , raised from the dead , from the seed of David — according to my Good News .
55002009	For this I suffer hardship as a criminal , even to the point of chains — though the word of God is not chained .
55002010	Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the chosen , so they might obtain the salvation that is in Messiah Yeshua with eternal glory .
55002011	Trustworthy is the saying : If we died with Him , we will also live with Him ;
55002012	if we endure , we will also reign with Him ; if we deny Him , He will also deny us ;
55002013	if we are faithless , He remains faithful , for He cannot deny Himself .
55002014	Remind them of these things and solemnly charge them before God not to quarrel about words , which is useless — to the ruin of those who are listening .
55002015	Make every effort to present yourself before God as tried and true , as an unashamed worker cutting a straight path with the word of truth .
55002016	But avoid godless chatter , for it will lead to further ungodliness
55002017	and their words will spread like cancer . Among them are Hymeneaus and Philetus —
55002018	men who have missed the mark concerning the truth , saying that the resurrection has already taken place . They are overturning the faith of some .
55002019	Nevertheless , the firm foundation of God stands , having this seal : “ The Lord knows those who are His , ” and , “ Let everyone who names the name of the Lord keep away from unrighteousness . ”
55002020	Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver , but also of wood and clay — some for honor and some for common use .
55002021	Therefore , if anyone cleanses himself from these , he will be a vessel for honor — sanctified , useful to the Master , prepared for every good work .
55002022	Now flee from youthful desires ; instead , pursue righteousness , faithfulness , love , and shalom , with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart .
55002023	But avoid foolish and ignorant disputes , knowing that they produce quarrels .
55002024	The Lord’s slave must not be quarrelsome , but be kind to all , able to teach , tolerant .
55002025	Let him give guidance with humility to those who are in opposition — perhaps God may grant them a change of mind , leading to the knowledge of truth .
55002026	Then they may regain their senses and escape the devil’s snare , in which they had been held captive by him to do his will .
55003001	But understand this , that in the last days hard times will come —
55003002	for people will be lovers of self , lovers of money , boastful , arrogant , blasphemers , disobedient to parents , ungrateful , unholy ,
55003003	hardhearted , unforgiving , backbiting , without self-control , brutal , hating what is good ,
55003004	treacherous , reckless , conceited , lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God ,
55003005	holding to an outward form of godliness but denying its power . Avoid these people !
55003006	For among these are those who slip into households and deceive weak women weighed down with sins , led away by various desires ,
55003007	always learning yet never able to come to the knowledge of truth .
55003008	Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses , so do these people oppose the truth , men corrupted in mind and worthless concerning the faith .
55003009	But these people will not make any more progress — for their folly , like that of Jannes and Jambres , will be obvious to everyone .
55003010	You , however , closely followed my teaching , manner of life , purpose , faithfulness , patience , love , perseverance —
55003011	as well as persecutions and sufferings that happened to me in Antioch , Iconium , and Lystra . What persecutions I endured ! And the Lord rescued me from them all !
55003012	Indeed , all who desire to live a godly life in Messiah Yeshua will be persecuted .
55003013	But evil men and imposters will go from bad to worse , deceiving and being deceived .
55003014	You , however , continue in what you have learned and what you have become convinced of . For you know from whom you have learned ,
55003015	and that from childhood you have known the sacred writings that are able to make you wise , leading to salvation through trusting in Messiah Yeshua .
55003016	All Scripture is inspired by God and useful for teaching , for reproof , for restoration , and for training in righteousness ,
55003017	so that the person belonging to God may be capable , fully equipped for every good deed .
55004001	I solemnly charge you — in the presence of God and Messiah Yeshua , who is about to judge the living and the dead at His appearing and His Kingdom —
55004002	proclaim the Word ! Be ready when it is convenient or inconvenient . Confront , rebuke , encourage — with complete patience and instruction .
55004003	For the time will come when they will not put up with sound instruction , but they will pile up for themselves teachers in keeping with their own desires , to have their ears tickled .
55004004	And they will turn away from hearing the truth and wander off to myths .
55004005	You , however , keep a clear mind in all things , withstand hardship , do the work of proclaiming the Good News , and fulfill your service .
55004006	For I am already being poured out like a drink offering , and the time of my departure has come .
55004007	I have fought the good fight , I have finished the course , I have kept the faith .
55004008	In the future there is reserved for me a crown of righteousness , which the Lord , the righteous Judge , will award to me on that day — and not to me only , but also to everyone who has longed for His appearing .
55004009	Do all you can to come to me quickly —
55004010	for Demas , having loved this world , has deserted me and gone to Thessolonica ; Crescens has gone to Galatia , and Titus to Dalmatia .
55004011	Luke is the only one with me . Get Mark and bring him with you , for he is useful to me for service .
55004012	I have sent Tychius to Ephesus .
55004013	When you come , bring the cloak which I left with Carpus in Troas , along with the scrolls , and especially the parchments .
55004014	Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm — the Lord will repay him according to his deeds .
55004015	Be on guard against him too , for he vehemently opposed our message .
55004016	At my first defense , no one stood by me ; instead , they all deserted me — may it not be counted against them !
55004017	But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me , so that through me the message might be proclaimed in full measure , and all the nations might hear — and I was rescued from the lion’s mouth !
55004018	The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed and will deliver me safely into His heavenly Kingdom . To Him be the glory forever and ever . Amen .
55004019	Greet Prisca and Aquila , and the household of Onesiphorus .
55004020	Erastus stayed in Corinth , and I left Trophimus sick in Miletus .
55004021	Do all you can to come before winter . Eubulus sends you greetings , as do Pudens , Linus , Claudia , and all the brethren .
55004022	The Lord be with your spirit . Grace be with you .
56001001	Paul , a slave of God and a shaliach of Messiah Yeshua , for the faith of God’s chosen and the knowledge of truth that is in keeping with godliness ,
56001002	based on the hope of eternal life . God — who cannot lie — promised this before the beginning of time .
56001003	But in His own time He made His message known , through a proclamation with which I was entrusted , by the command of God our Savior .
56001004	To Titus , a true child of our common faith : Grace and shalom from God the Father and Messiah Yeshua , our Savior !
56001005	The reason I left you in Crete was so that you would set in order the things that remain and appoint elders in every city as I directed you —
56001006	if anyone is blameless , the husband of one wife , having children of faith with no charge of wild living or rebellion .
56001007	For the overseer must be blameless as God’s administrator — not arrogant , not quick-tempered , not addicted to wine , not violent , not greedy for dishonest gain .
56001008	Rather he must be hospitable , loving what is good , self-controlled , upright , devout , disciplined .
56001009	He must hold firmly to the trustworthy message in keeping with the teaching , so he can both encourage by instruction that is sound and convict those who speak against it .
56001010	For there are many who are rebellious , vain talkers and deceivers , especially those from the circumcision .
56001011	They must be silenced — those who upset entire households by teaching what they should not , for the sake of dishonest gain .
56001012	One of them , one of their own prophets , said , “ Cretans are always liars , evil beasts , lazy gluttons . ”
56001013	This testimony is true . For this reason rebuke them sharply , so they might be sound in the faith ,
56001014	not paying attention to Judaic myths and commands of men who turn away from the truth .
56001015	To the pure all things are pure ; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving , nothing is pure . Both their mind and conscience are defiled .
56001016	They claim to know God but their deeds deny Him . They are despicable and disobedient and worthless for any good deed .
56002001	But as for you , speak things that are fitting for sound instruction .
56002002	Older men are to be clear-minded , dignified , self-controlled , sound in faith , in love , in patience .
56002003	Likewise , older women are to be sanctified in demeanor — not backbiting or enslaved to much wine . Let them be teachers of what is good ,
56002004	so that they may train the young women to love their husbands , to love their children ,
56002005	to be self-controlled , pure , managing their household , kind , submitted to their own husbands , so that God’s word may not be dishonored .
56002006	Likewise urge the younger men to be self-controlled ,
56002007	in all things showing yourself to be an example of good deeds — integrity in instruction , dignity ,
56002008	sound speech beyond criticism — so that an opponent may be put to shame , having nothing bad to say about us .
56002009	Urge slaves to submit themselves to their own masters in all things , well-pleasing and not back-talking ,
56002010	not stealing but showing all good faithfulness , so that they may do credit to the teaching about God our Savior in everything .
56002011	For the grace of God has appeared , bringing salvation to all men ,
56002012	training us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to live in a manner that is self-controlled and righteous and godly in the present age .
56002013	We wait for the blessed hope and appearance of the glory of our great God and Savior , Messiah Yeshua .
56002014	He gave Himself for us so that He might redeem us from every lawless deed and so that He might purify for Himself a chosen people , zealous for good deeds .
56002015	So communicate these things , and encourage and correct with complete authority . Let no one look down on you .
56003001	Remind the people to be submitted to rulers and authorities , to be obedient , to be ready for every good deed ,
56003002	to slander no one , without fighting , gentle , showing every courtesy to all people .
56003003	For we also once were foolish , disobedient , deluded , enslaved to various desires and pleasures , spending our lives in malice and envy , hateful and hating one another .
56003004	But when the kindness of God our Savior and His love for mankind appeared —
56003005	not by deeds of righteousness which we had done ourselves , but because of His mercy — He saved us through the mikveh of rebirth and renewing of the Ruach ha-Kodesh ,
56003006	whom He abundantly poured out on us through Messiah Yeshua our Savior ,
56003007	so that being set right by His grace , we might become heirs with the confident hope of eternal life !
56003008	Trustworthy is the saying , and I want you to insist on these things , so that those who have put their trust in God may be careful to devote themselves to good deeds . These things are good and beneficial for people .
56003009	But avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and strife and disputes about Torah , for they are unprofitable and useless .
56003010	Dismiss a quarrelsome person after a first and second warning ,
56003011	knowing that such a person is twisted and is sinning — he is self- condemned .
56003012	When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you , hurry to come to me in Nicopolis , for I have decided to winter there .
56003013	Send Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey with great care , so that nothing is lacking for them .
56003014	And let our people learn to devote themselves to doing mitzvot to meet urgent needs , so they will not be unfruitful .
56003015	All who are with me greet you . Greet those who love us in the faith . Grace be with you all .
57001001	Paul , a prisoner of Messiah Yeshua , and Timothy our brother , to Philemon our beloved and fellow worker .
57001002	To Apphia our sister , to Archippus our fellow soldier , and to the community that meets in your house :
57001003	Grace to you and shalom from God our Father and the Lord Messiah Yeshua !
57001004	I thank my God always when mentioning you in my prayers ,
57001005	hearing of your love and the trust you have toward the Lord Yeshua and all the kedoshim .
57001006	May the fellowship of your faith become effective , with the recognition of all the good that is ours in Messiah .
57001007	For I’ve received much joy and comfort in your love , brother , because the hearts of the kedoshim have been refreshed through you .
57001008	Therefore , though I have plenty of boldness in Messiah to order you to do what’s right ,
57001009	yet for love’s sake I appeal to you instead . I , Paul , am an old man and now also a prisoner belonging to Messiah Yeshua .
57001010	I beg you for my child Onesimus — for whom I became a spiritual father while in chains .
57001011	He once was useless to you , but now is useful both to you and me .
57001012	I sent him back to you — he is my very heart .
57001013	I really wanted to keep him with me , so that on your behalf he might serve me while I am in chains for the Good News .
57001014	But I didn’t want to do anything without your consent , so that your goodness wouldn’t be by force but by free will .
57001015	For perhaps he was separated from you for a while in order that you might have him back forever ,
57001016	no longer as a slave but more than a slave — as a beloved brother , especially to me but even more so to you , both in the flesh and in the Lord .
57001017	So if you consider me a partner , welcome him as you would welcome me .
57001018	But if he has done you any wrong or owes you anything , charge that to my account .
57001019	I , Paul , am writing this with my own hand : I will repay . ( Not to mention that you owe me your very self . )
57001020	Yes , brother , let me have some benefit from you in the Lord . Refresh my heart in Messiah .
57001021	Having confidence in your obedience , I write to you , knowing that you will do even more than what I say .
57001022	At the same time also , prepare a guest room for me — for I hope that through your prayers I will be given back to you .
57001023	Epaphras , my fellow prisoner in Messiah Yeshua , greets you .
57001024	So do Mark , Aristarchus , Demas , and Luke , my fellow workers .
57001025	May the grace of our Lord Messiah Yeshua be with your spirit . Amen .
58001001	At many times and in many ways , God spoke long ago to the fathers through the prophets .
58001002	In these last days He has spoken to us through a Son , whom He appointed heir of all things and through whom He created the universe .
58001003	This Son is the radiance of His glory and the imprint of His being , upholding all things by His powerful word . When He had made purification for our sins , He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high .
58001004	Thus He became as far above the angels as the name He has inherited is more excellent than theirs .
58001005	For to which of the angels did God ever say , “ You are My Son . Today I have become Your Father ” ? And again , “ I will be to Him a Father , and He will be to Me a Son ” ?
58001006	And again , when He brings the firstborn into the world , He says , “ Let all the angels of God worship Him . ”
58001007	And regarding the angels He says , “ He makes His angels winds , and His servants a flame of fire . ”
58001008	But regarding the Son He says , “ Your throne , O God , is forever and ever , and a scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Your Kingdom .
58001009	You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness ; therefore God , Your God , has anointed You with the oil of gladness above Your companions . ”
58001010	And , “ In the beginning , Adonai , You laid the foundation of the earth , and the heavens are the works of Your hands .
58001011	They shall pass away , but You remain . And they will all wear out like clothing .
58001012	And like a robe You will roll them up , and like clothing they will be changed ; but You are the same , and Your years shall never end . ”
58001013	But to which of the angels has He ever said , “ Sit at My right hand , until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet ” ?
58001014	Are they not all ministering spirits , sent out for service to those about to inherit salvation ?
58002001	For this reason it is necessary for us to pay especially close attention to what we have heard , so that we do not drift away .
58002002	For if the word spoken through angels proved to be firm , and every violation and disobedience received a just payback ,
58002003	how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation ? It was first spoken through the Lord and confirmed to us by those who heard .
58002004	At the same time , God was testifying by signs and wonders and various miracles and gifts of the Ruach ha-Kodesh , according to His will . Yeshua Greater than Angels
58002005	For it is not to angels that God has subjected the olam ha-ba — about which we speak .
58002006	But somewhere someone has testified , saying , “ What is man , that You are mindful of him , or the son of man , that You care for him ?
58002007	For a little while , You made him lower than the angels . You crowned him with glory and honor .
58002008	You put all things in subjection underneath his feet . ” For when He put all things in subjection to him , He left nothing outside his control . But for now we do not yet see all things subjected to him .
58002009	But we see One who was made for a little while lower than the angels — namely , Yeshua . He is now crowned with glory and honor , because of the death He suffered so that , by the grace of God , He might taste death for everyone .
58002010	For it was fitting for God — for whom and through whom all things exist — in leading many sons to glory , to perfect through sufferings the initiator of their salvation .
58002011	For both He who sanctifies and those being sanctified are all from one — so He is not ashamed to call them brethren ,
58002012	saying , “ I will proclaim Your name to My brethren . In the midst of the congregation I will sing praise to You . ”
58002013	And again , “ I will put My trust in Him . ” And again , “ Here am I and the children God has given Me . ”
58002014	Therefore , since the children share in flesh and blood , He Himself likewise shared the same humanity — so that through death He might break the power of the one who had the power of death ( that is , the devil )
58002015	and free those who by fear of death were in bondage all their lives .
58002016	For surely He is not concerned about angels , but about the seed of Abraham .
58002017	Therefore He had to be made like His brethren in all things , so He might become a merciful and faithful Kohen Gadol in matters relating to God , to make atonement for the sins of the people .
58002018	Because He Himself suffered when put to the test , He is able to help those being tested .
58003001	Therefore , holy brethren , partners in a heavenly calling , take notice of Yeshua — the Shaliach and Kohen Gadol we affirm .
58003002	He was faithful to the One who appointed Him in His house — as was Moses also .
58003003	For He has been considered worthy of more glory than Moses , even as the builder of the house has more honor than the house .
58003004	For every house is built by someone , but the builder of all things is God .
58003005	Now Moses surely was faithful in all God’s house as a servant , for a witness of things to be spoken later .
58003006	But Messiah , as Son , is over God’s house — and we are His house , if we hold firm to our boldness and what we are proud to hope . Listen and Obey , or Harden and Fall Away
58003007	Therefore , just as the Ruach ha-Kodesh says , “ Today if you hear His voice ,
58003008	do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion , on the day of testing in the wilderness .
58003009	There your fathers put Me to the test , though they saw My works for forty years .
58003010	Therefore I was provoked by this generation , and I said , ‘ They always go astray in their heart , and they have not known My ways . ’
58003011	As I swore in my wrath , ‘ They shall not enter My rest . ’ ”
58003012	Take care , brethren , that none of you has an evil heart of unbelief that falls away from the living God .
58003013	But encourage one another day by day — as long as it is called “ Today ” — so that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin .
58003014	For we have become partners of Messiah , if we hold our original conviction firm until the end .
58003015	As it is said , “ Today if you hear His voice , do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion . ”
58003016	Now which ones heard and rebelled ? Indeed , was it not all who came out of Egypt with Moses ?
58003017	And with whom was He provoked for forty years ? Was it not with those who sinned , whose bodies fell in the wilderness ?
58003018	And to whom did He swear that they would not enter His rest ? Was it not to those who were disobedient ?
58003019	So we see that they were not able to enter in because of lack of trust .
58004001	Let us fear then ! Though a promise of entering His rest is left open , some of you would seem to have fallen short .
58004002	For we also have had Good News proclaimed to us , just as they did . But the word they heard did not help them , because they were not unified with those who listened in faith .
58004003	For we who have trusted are entering into that rest . It is just as God has said , “ So in My wrath I swore , ‘ They shall never enter My rest , ’ ” even though His works were finished since the foundation of the world .
58004004	For somewhere He has spoken about the seventh day in this way : “ And God rested on the seventh day from all His works , ”
58004005	and again in this passage : “ They shall never enter My rest . ”
58004006	So then it remains for some to enter into it ; yet those who formerly had Good News proclaimed to them did not enter because of disobedience .
58004007	Again , God appoints a certain day — “ Today ” — saying through David after so long a time , just as it has been said before , “ Today , if you hear His voice , do not harden your hearts . ”
58004008	For if Joshua had given them rest , God would not have spoken of another day later on .
58004009	So there remains a Shabbat rest for the people of God .
58004010	For the one who has entered God’s rest has also ceased from his own work , just as God did from His .
58004011	Let us , therefore , make every effort to enter that rest , so that no one may fall through the same pattern of disobedience .
58004012	For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword — piercing right through to a separation of soul and spirit , joints and marrow , and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart .
58004013	No creature is hidden from Him , but all are naked and exposed to the eyes of Him to whom we must give account . Yeshua , Our Compassionate Kohen Gadol
58004014	Therefore , since we have a great Kohen Gadol who has passed through the heavens , Yeshua Ben-Elohim , let us hold firmly to our confessed allegiance .
58004015	For we do not have a kohen gadol who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses , but One who has been tempted in all the same ways — yet without sin .
58004016	Therefore let us draw near to the throne of grace with boldness , so that we may receive mercy and find grace for help in time of need .
58005001	For every kohen gadol taken from among men is appointed to act on behalf of people in matters relating to God , so that he may offer gifts and sacrifices for sins .
58005002	He is able to empathize with the ignorant and deluded , since he himself also is subject to weakness .
58005003	For this reason he has to make offerings for sins — just as for the people , so also for himself .
58005004	And no one takes this honor for himself , but only when he is called by God , as Aaron was .
58005005	So also Messiah did not glorify Himself to be made Kohen Gadol ; rather , it was God who said to Him , “ You are My Son ; today I have become Your Father . ”
58005006	And He says in a different passage , “ You are a kohen forever , according to the order of Melchizedek . ”
58005007	In the days of His life on earth , Yeshua offered up both prayers and pleas , with loud crying and tears , to the One able to save Him from death ; and He was heard because of His reverence .
58005008	Though He was a Son , He learned obedience from what He suffered .
58005009	And once made perfect , He became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey Him —
58005010	called by God Kohen Gadol “ according to the order of Melchizedek . ” Moving on to Maturity
58005011	About this subject there is much for us to say , and it is hard to explain since you have become sluggish in hearing .
58005012	For although you ought to be teachers by this time , again you need someone to teach you the basics of God’s sayings . You have come to need milk , not solid food .
58005013	For anyone living on milk is inexperienced with the teaching about righteousness — he is an infant .
58005014	But solid food is for the mature , who through practice have their senses trained to discern both good and evil .
58006001	Therefore leaving the basic teaching of the Messiah , let us move on toward maturity — not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of trust in God ,
58006002	of teaching about immersions , laying on of hands , resurrection of the dead , and eternal judgment .
58006003	Now this we will do , if God permits .
58006004	For it is impossible for those who once were enlightened — having tasted of the heavenly gift and become partakers of the Ruach ha-Kodesh ,
58006005	and having tasted the good word of God and the powers of the olam ha-ba ,
58006006	and then having fallen away — to renew again to repentance , since they are again crucifying Ben-Elohim for themselves and publicly disgracing Him .
58006007	For the earth — having soaked up the rain frequently falling on it — brings forth vegetation useful to those for whom it is farmed ; and it shares in God’s blessing .
58006008	But if it produces thorns and thistles , it is worthless and near to being cursed — its end is to be burned over .
58006009	But even though we speak like this , loved ones , concerning you we are convinced of better things — things coming with salvation .
58006010	For God is not unjust so as to forget your work and the love that you showed for His name , in having served and continuing to serve the kedoshim .
58006011	But we long for each of you to show the same eagerness for the certainty of hope to the very end —
58006012	so you will not be sluggish , but imitators of those inheriting the promises through trust and perseverance .
58006013	Now when God made His promise to Abraham — since He could swear by no one greater , He swore by Himself ,
58006014	saying , “ Surely I will bless you , and surely I will multiply you . ”
58006015	And so after waiting patiently , Abraham reached the promise .
58006016	For people swear by someone greater ; and the oath , as confirmation , is an end to all their disputing .
58006017	In the same way God , determining to point out more clearly to the heirs of the promise the unchanging nature of His purpose , guaranteed it with an oath .
58006018	So by two unchangeable things , in which it is impossible for God to lie , we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to take hold of the hope set before us .
58006019	We have this hope as an anchor of the soul , both firm and steady — a hope that enters the inner place behind the curtain .
58006020	Yeshua has entered there as a forerunner on our behalf , having become Kohen Gadol “ forever , according to the order of Melchizedek . ”
58007001	For this Melchizedek was king of Salem , kohen of God Most High . He met Abraham returning from the defeat of the kings and blessed him ,
58007002	and to him Abraham apportioned a tenth of everything . First , by the translation of his name , he is “ King of Righteousness ” ; and then also King of Salem , which is “ King of Shalom . ”
58007003	Without father , without mother , without genealogy , having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like Ben-Elohim , he remains a kohen for all time .
58007004	Now see how great this man is ! Even Abraham the patriarch gave him a tenth out of the plunder .
58007005	Indeed , those sons of Levi who receive the priesthood have , according to Torah , a command to collect a tithe from the people — that is , from their kin , although they have come out of the loins of Abraham .
58007006	But this one — who did not have their genealogy — has collected tithes from Abraham and has blessed him , the one holding the promises .
58007007	Now it is beyond dispute that the lesser is blessed by the greater .
58007008	In one case , dying men receive tithes ; but in the other , one about whom it is testified that he lives on .
58007009	Through Abraham even Levi , the one receiving tithes , has paid the tithe , so to speak —
58007010	for he was still in his father’s loins when Melchizedek met him . Yeshua , Our Kohen Gadol Forever
58007011	Now if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood ( for based on it the people had been given the Torah ) , what further need was there for a different kohen to arise — designated according to the order of Melchizedek , not according to the order of Aaron ?
58007012	For whenever the priesthood is altered , out of necessity an alteration of law also takes place .
58007013	For the one about whom these things are said belongs to another tribe , from which no one has officiated at the altar .
58007014	For it is clear that our Lord has sprung forth from Judah — concerning this tribe , Moses said nothing about kohanim .
58007015	And it is even more evident , if another kohen arises like Melchizedek —
58007016	one made not by virtue of a Torah requirement of physical descent , but by virtue of the power of an indestructible life .
58007017	For it is testified , “ You are a kohen forever , according to the order of Melchizedek . ”
58007018	For on the one hand , a former requirement is set aside because of its weakness and ineffectiveness —
58007019	for Torah made nothing perfect . But on the other hand , a better hope is introduced , through which we draw near to God .
58007020	Moreover , it was not without a sworn oath . ( Others indeed have become kohanim without a sworn oath ,
58007021	but He with a oath — sworn by the One who said to Him , “ Adonai has sworn and will not change His mind , ‘ You are a kohen forever . ’ ” )
58007022	How much more then has Yeshua become the guarantee of a better covenant .
58007023	Now on the one hand , many have become kohanim , who through death are prevented from continuing in office .
58007024	But on the other hand , the One who does remain forever has a permanent priesthood .
58007025	Therefore He is also able to save completely those who draw near to God through Him , always living to make intercession for them .
58007026	For such a Kohen Gadol was fitting for us : holy , guiltless , undefiled , separated from sinners , and exalted above the heavens .
58007027	He has no need to offer up sacrifices day by day like those other kohanim g’dolim — first for their own sins and then for the sins of the people . For when He offered up Himself , He did this once for all .
58007028	For the Torah appoints as kohanim g’dolim men who have weakness ; but the word of the oath , which came after the Torah , appoints a Son — made perfect forever .
58008001	Now here is the main point being said . We do have such a Kohen Gadol , who has taken His seat at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens .
58008002	He is a priestly attendant of the Holies and the true Tent — which Adonai set up , not man .
58008003	For every kohen gadol is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices , so it is necessary for this One also to have something to offer .
58008004	Now if He were on earth , He would not be a kohen at all , since there are those who offer the gifts according to the Torah .
58008005	They offer service in a replica and foreshadower of the heavenlies — one that is just as Moses was instructed by God when he was about to complete the tabernacle . For He says , “ See that you make everything according to the design that was shown to you on the mountain . ”
58008006	But now Yeshua has obtained a more excellent ministry , insofar as He is the mediator of a better covenant which has been enacted on better promises .
58008007	For if that first one had been flawless , there would not have been discourse seeking a second .
58008008	For finding fault with them , He says , “ Behold , days are coming , says Adonai , when I will inaugurate a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah .
58008009	It will not be like the covenant I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt . For they did not remain in My covenant , and I did not care for them , says Adonai .
58008010	For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days , says Adonai . I will put My Torah into their mind , and upon their hearts I will write it . And I will be their God , and they shall be My people .
58008011	And no more will they teach , each one his fellow citizen and each one his brother , saying , ‘ Know Adonai , ’ because all will know Me , from the least of them to the greatest .
58008012	For I will be merciful toward their iniquities , and their sins I will remember no more . ”
58008013	In saying “ new , ” He has treated the first as old ; but what is being made old and aging is close to vanishing .
58009001	Now even the first one had regulations for worship and the earthly sanctuary .
58009002	For a tent was prepared : in the outer part were the menorah , the table , and the presentation of the bread — this is called the Holy Place .
58009003	Beyond the second curtain was a dwelling called the Holy of Holies .
58009004	It held a golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant , completely covered with gold . In the ark was a golden jar holding the manna , Aaron’s rod that budded , and the tablets of the covenant —
58009005	and above it , cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat . But it is not now possible to speak in detail about these things .
58009006	Now with these things prepared this way , the kohanim do continually enter into the outer tent while completing the services ;
58009007	but into the inner , once a year , the kohen gadol alone — and not without blood which he offers for himself and for the unintentional sins of the people .
58009008	By this the Ruach ha-Kodesh makes clear that the way into the Holies has not yet been revealed while the first tent is still standing .
58009009	It is a symbol for the present time . Accordingly , gifts and sacrifices are being offered that cannot make the worshiper perfect with respect to conscience .
58009010	These relate only to food and drink and various washings — regulations for the body imposed until a time of setting things straight .
58009011	But when Messiah appeared as Kohen Gadol of the good things that have now come , passing through the greater and more perfect Tent not made with hands ( that is to say not of this creation ) ,
58009012	He entered into the Holies once for all — not by the blood of goats and calves but by His own blood , having obtained eternal redemption .
58009013	For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled sanctify for the cleansing of the flesh ,
58009014	how much more will the blood of Messiah — who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God — cleanse our conscience from dead works to serve the living God ?
58009015	For this reason He is the mediator of a new covenant , in order that those called may receive the promised eternal inheritance — since a death has taken place that redeems them from violations under the first covenant .
58009016	For where there is a covenant , the death of the one who made it must be established .
58009017	For a covenant is secured upon the basis of dead bodies , since it has no strength as long as the one who made it lives .
58009018	That is why not even the first covenant was inaugurated without blood .
58009019	For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the Torah , he took the blood of the calves and goats , with water and scarlet wool and hyssop , and he sprinkled both the book itself and all the people .
58009020	He said , “ This is the blood of the covenant which God commanded you . ”
58009021	And in the same way , he sprinkled the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry with the blood .
58009022	And nearly everything is purified in blood according to the Torah , and apart from the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness .
58009023	Therefore it was necessary for the replicas of these heavenly things to be purified with these sacrifices — but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these .
58009024	For Messiah did not enter into Holies made with hands — counterparts of the true things — but into heaven itself , now to appear in God’s presence on our behalf .
58009025	And He did not offer Himself again and again — as the kohen gadol enters into the Holy of Holies year after year with blood that is not his own .
58009026	For then He would have needed to suffer again and again from the foundation of the world . But as it is , He has been revealed once and for all at the close of the ages — to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself .
58009027	And just as it is appointed for men to die once , and after this judgment ,
58009028	so also Messiah , was offered once to bear the sins of many . He will appear a second time , apart from sin , to those eagerly awaiting Him for salvation .
58010001	The Torah has a shadow of the good things to come — not the form itself of the realities . For this reason it can never , by means of the same sacrifices they offer constantly year after year , make perfect those who draw near .
58010002	Otherwise , would they not have ceased to be offered , since the worshipers — cleansed once and for all — would no longer have consciousness of sins ?
58010003	But in these sacrifices is a reminder of sins year after year —
58010004	for it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins .
58010005	So when Messiah comes into the world , He says , “ Sacrifice and offering You did not desire , but a body You prepared for Me .
58010006	In whole burnt offerings and sin offerings You did not delight .
58010007	Then I said , ‘ Behold , I come to do Your will , O God ( in the scroll of the book it is written of Me ) . ’ ”
58010008	After saying above , “ Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sin offerings You did not desire , nor did You delight in them ” ( those which are offered according to Torah ) ,
58010009	then He said , “ Behold , I come to do Your will . ” He takes away the first to establish the second .
58010010	By His will we have been made holy through the offering of the body of Messiah Yeshua once for all .
58010011	Indeed , every kohen stands day by day serving and offering the same sacrifices again and again , which can never take away sins .
58010012	But on the other hand , when this One offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins , He sat down at the right hand of God —
58010013	waiting from then on , until His enemies are made a footstool for His feet .
58010014	For by one offering He has perfected forever those being made holy .
58010015	The Ruach ha-Kodesh also testifies to us — for after saying ,
58010016	“ This is the covenant that I will cut with them : ‘ After those days , ’ says Adonai , ‘ I will put My Torah upon their hearts , and upon their minds I will write it , ’ ” then He says ,
58010017	“ I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more . ”
58010018	Now where there is removal of these , there is no longer an offering for sin . Let Us Pray Boldly in God’s Presence
58010019	Therefore , brethren , we have boldness to enter into the Holies by the blood of Yeshua .
58010020	He inaugurated a new and living way for us through the curtain — that is , His flesh .
58010021	We also have a Kohen Gadol over God’s household .
58010022	So let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith , with hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and body washed with pure water .
58010023	Let us hold fast the unwavering confession of hope , for He who promised is faithful .
58010024	And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good deeds .
58010025	And do not neglect our own meetings , as is the habit of some , but encourage one another — and all the more so as you see the Day approaching .
58010026	For if we keep on sinning willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth , there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins ,
58010027	but only a terrifying expectation of judgment and a fury of fire about to devour the enemies of God .
58010028	Anyone who rejected the Torah of Moses dies without compassion on the word of two or three witnesses .
58010029	How much more severe do you think the punishment will be for the one who has trampled Ben-Elohim underfoot , and has regarded as unholy the blood of the covenant by which he was made holy , and has insulted the Ruach of grace ?
58010030	For we know the One who said , “ Vengeance is Mine ; I will repay , ” and again , “ Adonai will judge His people . ”
58010031	It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God . Suffering Perfects Yeshua’s Followers
58010032	But remember the former days when , after you were enlightened , you endured a great struggle with sufferings .
58010033	Sometimes you were publicly exposed to abuses and afflictions , and other times you became partners with those who were treated this way .
58010034	For you suffered along with the prisoners and joyfully accepted the plundering of your possessions , knowing that you have for yourselves a better and lasting possession .
58010035	Therefore , do not lose your boldness , which has great reward .
58010036	For you need perseverance so that , after you have done the will of God , you may receive the promise .
58010037	For yet “ in a very little while , the Coming One will come , and He will not delay .
58010038	But My righteous one shall live by emunah ; and if he shrinks back , My soul takes no pleasure in him . ”
58010039	But we are not among the timid ones on the path to destruction , but among the faithful ones on the path to the preservation of the soul .
58011001	Now faith is the substance of things hoped for , the evidence of realities not seen .
58011002	For by it the elders received commendation .
58011003	By faith we understand that the universe was created by the word of God , so that what is seen did not come from anything visible .
58011004	By faith Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain . Through faith he was commended as righteous when God approved of his gifts . And through faith he still speaks , although he is dead .
58011005	By faith Enoch was taken so as not to see death , and he was not found because God took him . For before he was taken , he was commended as pleasing to God .
58011006	Now without faith it is impossible to please God . For the one who comes to God must believe that He exists and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him .
58011007	By faith Noah , when warned about events not yet seen , in holy fear prepared an ark for the safety of his household . Through faith he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith .
58011008	By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place he was to receive as an inheritance . He went out , not knowing where he was going .
58011009	By faith he migrated to the land of promise as if it were foreign , dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob — fellow heirs of the same promise .
58011010	For he was waiting for the city that has foundations , whose architect and builder is God .
58011011	By faith even Sarah herself received ability to conceive when she was barren and past the age , since she considered the One who had made the promise to be faithful .
58011012	So from one — and him as good as dead — were fathered offspring as numerous as the stars of heaven , and as uncountable as the sand on the seashore .
58011013	These all died in faith without receiving the things promised — but they saw them and welcomed them from afar , and they confessed that they were strangers and sojourners on the earth .
58011014	For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a homeland .
58011015	If indeed they had been thinking about where they had come from , they would have had opportunity to return .
58011016	But as it is , they yearn for a better land — that is , a heavenly one . Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God , for He has prepared a city for them .
58011017	By faith Abraham , when he was tested , offered up Isaac . Yes , he who had received the promises was offering up his one and only son —
58011018	the one about whom it was said , “ Through Isaac offspring shall be named for you . ”
58011019	He reasoned that God was able to raise him up even from the dead — and in a sense , he did receive him back from there .
58011020	By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau , even concerning things to come .
58011021	By faith Jacob , as he was dying , blessed each of the sons of Joseph , and he bowed in worship while leaning on the top of his staff .
58011022	By faith Joseph , when his end was near , made mention of the exodus of B’nei-Israel and gave instructions about his bones .
58011023	By faith Moses , when he was born , was hidden for three months by his parents , because they saw he was an extraordinary child and they were not afraid of the king’s decree .
58011024	By faith Moses , when he had grown up , refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter .
58011025	Instead he chose to suffer mistreatment along with the people of God , rather than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin .
58011026	He considered the disgrace of Messiah as greater riches than the treasures of Egypt — because he was looking ahead to the reward .
58011027	By faith he left Egypt , not fearing the king’s anger — for he persevered as if seeing the One who is invisible .
58011028	By faith he kept the Passover and the smearing of the blood , so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch them .
58011029	By faith they passed through the Red Sea as if on dry ground . When the Egyptians tried it , they were swallowed up .
58011030	By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they were circled for seven days .
58011031	By faith Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient , because she welcomed the spies with shalom .
58011032	And what more shall I say ? For time would fail me if I tell of Gideon , Barak , Samson , Jephthah , also of David and Samuel and the prophets .
58011033	By faith they conquered kingdoms , administered justice , obtained promises , shut the mouths of lions ,
58011034	quenched the power of fire , escaped the edge of the sword , were made strong out of weakness , became mighty in war , and made foreign armies flee .
58011035	Women received their dead raised back to life ; and others were tortured , after not accepting release , so they might obtain a better resurrection .
58011036	Others experienced the trial of mocking and scourging — yes , and even chains and prison .
58011037	They were stoned , they were sawed in two , they were murdered with the sword . They went around in sheepskins and goatskins ; they were destitute , afflicted , mistreated .
58011038	The world was not worthy of them ! They wandered around in deserts and mountains , caves and holes in the ground .
58011039	And all these , though commended for their faith , did not receive what was promised —
58011040	because God had provided something better for us , so that only with us would they reach perfection .
58012001	Therefore , since we have such a great cloud of witnesses surrounding us , let us also get rid of every weight and entangling sin . Let us run with endurance the race set before us ,
58012002	focusing on Yeshua , the initiator and perfecter of faith . For the joy set before Him , He endured the cross , disregarding its shame ; and He has taken His seat at the right hand of the throne of God .
58012003	Consider Him who has endured such hostility by sinners against Himself , so that you may not grow weary in your souls and lose heart .
58012004	In struggling against sin , you have not yet resisted to the point of bloodshed .
58012005	Have you forgotten the warning addressed to you as sons ? “ My son , do not take lightly the discipline of Adonai or lose heart when you are corrected by Him ,
58012006	because Adonai disciplines the one He loves and punishes every son He accepts . ”
58012007	It is for discipline that you endure . God is treating you as sons — for what son does a father not discipline ?
58012008	But if you are without discipline — something all have come to share — then you are illegitimate and not sons .
58012009	Besides , we are used to having human fathers as instructors — and we respected them . Shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits and live ?
58012010	Indeed , for a short time they disciplined us as seemed best to them ; but He does so for our benefit , so that we may share in His holiness .
58012011	Now all discipline seems painful at the moment — not joyful . But later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it .
58012012	Therefore , strengthen the hands that are weak and the knees that are feeble !
58012013	And make straight paths for your feet , so that what is lame will not be pulled out of joint but rather be healed .
58012014	Pursue shalom with everyone , and the holiness without which no one will see the Lord .
58012015	See to it that no one falls short of the grace of God ; and see to it that no bitter root springs up and causes trouble , and by it many be defiled .
58012016	Also see to it that there is no immoral or godless person — like Esau , who sold his birthright for one meal .
58012017	For you know that later , when he wanted to inherit the blessing , he was rejected . He found no chance for repentance , though he begged for it with tears . Entering the Unshakeable Kingdom
58012018	For you have not come to a mountain that can be touched , and to a blazing fire , and to darkness and gloom and storm ,
58012019	and to the blast of a shofar and a voice whose words made those who heard it beg that not another word be spoken to them .
58012020	For they could not bear what was commanded : “ If even an animal touches the mountain , it shall be stoned . ”
58012021	So terrifying was the sight that Moses said , “ I am quaking with fear . ”
58012022	But you have come to Mount Zion — to the city of the living God , the heavenly Jerusalem , and to myriads of angels , a joyous gathering ,
58012023	and to the assembly of the firstborn who are written in a scroll in heaven , and to God the Judge of all , and to the spirits of the righteous ones made perfect ,
58012024	and to Yeshua , the Mediator of a new covenant , and to the sprinkled blood that speaks of something better than the blood of Abel .
58012025	See to it that you do not refuse the One who is speaking ! For if they did not escape when they refused the One who was warning them on earth , much less will we escape if we reject the One who warns us from heaven .
58012026	His voice shook the earth then , but now He has promised , saying , “ Yet once more I will shake not only the earth , but also the heavens . ”
58012027	Now this phrase , “ Yet once more , ” shows the removal of those things that are shaken — that is , created things — so that what cannot be shaken may remain .
58012028	Therefore , since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken , let us show gratitude — through this we may offer worship in a manner pleasing to God , with reverence and awe .
58012029	For our God is a consuming fire .
58013001	Let brotherly love continue .
58013002	Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers — for in doing so , some have entertained angels without knowing it .
58013003	Remember the prisoners as if you were fellow prisoners , and those who are mistreated as if you also were suffering bodily .
58013004	Let marriage be held in honor among all and the marriage bed kept undefiled , for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterers .
58013005	Keep your lifestyle free from the love of money , and be content with what you have . For God Himself has said , “ I will never leave you or forsake you , ”
58013006	so that with confidence we say , “ The Lord is my helper ; I will not fear . What will man do to me ? ”
58013007	Remember your leaders , who spoke the word of God to you . Consider the outcome of their way of life , and imitate their faith .
58013008	Yeshua the Messiah is the same yesterday , today , and forever .
58013009	Do not be carried away by all kinds of strange teachings , for it is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace — not by foods that have not benefited those occupied by them .
58013010	We have an altar from which those serving in the tabernacle have no right to eat .
58013011	For the bodies of those animals — whose blood is brought into the Holies by the kohen gadol as an offering for sin — are burned outside the camp .
58013012	Therefore , to make the people holy through His own blood , Yeshua also suffered outside the gate .
58013013	So let us go to Him outside the camp , bearing His disgrace .
58013014	For here we have no lasting city , but we seek the one that is to come .
58013015	Through Yeshua then , let us continually offer up to God a sacrifice of praise — the fruit of lips giving thanks to His name .
58013016	Do not neglect doing good and sharing , for with such sacrifices God is well pleased .
58013017	Obey your leaders and submit to them , for they keep watch over your souls as ones who must give an account . Let them do this with joy and not with groaning , for that would be of no benefit to you .
58013018	Pray for us , for we are convinced that we have a clear conscience , desiring to conduct ourselves honorably in all things .
58013019	I especially urge you to do this , so that I may be restored to you sooner . Closing Blessing
58013020	Now may the God of shalom , who brought up from the dead the great Shepherd of the sheep by the blood of an everlasting covenant , our Lord Yeshua ,
58013021	make you complete in every good thing to do His will , accomplishing in us what is pleasing in His sight , through Messiah Yeshua . To Him be the glory forever and ever . Amen . Final Greetings
58013022	But I urge you , brethren , listen patiently to this word of exhortation , for in fact I have written to you in few words .
58013023	Know that our brother Timothy has been released . If he comes soon , I will visit you with him .
58013024	Greet all your leaders and all the kedoshim — those from Italy greet you .
58013025	Grace be with you all .
59001001	Jacob , a slave of God and of the Lord Yeshua the Messiah , To the twelve tribes in the Diaspora : Shalom !
59001002	Consider it all joy , my brethren , when you encounter various trials ,
59001003	knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance .
59001004	And let endurance have its perfect work , so that you may be perfect and complete , lacking in nothing .
59001005	But if any of you lacks wisdom , let him ask of God , who gives to all without hesitation and without reproach ; and it will be given to him .
59001006	But let him ask in faith , without any doubting — for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea , blown and tossed by the wind .
59001007	For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord —
59001008	he is a double-minded man , unstable in all his ways .
59001009	But let the brother in humble circumstances boast in his high position —
59001010	and the rich person in his humble position , because like the flower of the grass he will pass away .
59001011	For the sun arises with a scorching heat and withers the grass , and its flower falls off and the beauty of its appearance is destroyed . So also the rich man in the midst of his pursuits will wither away .
59001012	Happy is the one who endures testing , because when he has stood the test , he will receive the crown of life , which the Lord promised to those who love Him .
59001013	Let no one say when he is tempted , “ I am being tempted by God ” — for God cannot be tempted by evil , and He himself tempts no one .
59001014	But each one is tempted when he is dragged away and enticed by his own desire .
59001015	Then when desire has conceived , it gives birth to sin ; and when sin is full grown , it brings forth death .
59001016	Do not be deceived , my dearly loved brethren .
59001017	Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above , coming down from the Father of lights , with whom there is no variation or shifting shadow .
59001018	By His will , He brought us forth by the word of truth , so that we might be a kind of firstfruits of all He created .
59001019	Know this , my dearly loved brethren : let every person be quick to listen , slow to speak , and slow to anger —
59001020	for human anger doesn’t produce the righteousness of God .
59001021	So put away all moral filth and excess of evil and receive with humility the implanted word , which is able to save your souls .
59001022	But be doers of the word , and not hearers only , deluding yourselves .
59001023	For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer , he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror —
59001024	for once he looks at himself and goes away , he immediately forgets what sort of person he was .
59001025	But the one who looks intently into the perfect Torah , the Torah that gives freedom , and continues in it , not becoming a hearer who forgets but a doer who acts — he shall be blessed in what he does .
59001026	If anyone thinks he is religious and yet does not bridle his tongue but deceives his heart , this person’s religion is futile .
59001027	Pure and undefiled religion before our God and Father is this : to care for orphans and widows in their distress , and to keep oneself unstained by the world .
59002001	My brethren , do not hold the faith of our glorious Lord Yeshua the Messiah while showing favoritism .
59002002	For if a man with a gold ring and fine clothes comes into your synagogue , and a poor person in filthy clothes also comes in ;
59002003	and you pay special attention to the one wearing the fine clothing and you say , “ Sit here in a good place ” ; and you say to the poor person , “ Stand there , ” or “ Sit by my footstool ” ;
59002004	haven’t you made distinctions between yourselves , and become judges with evil thoughts ?
59002005	Listen , my dearly loved brethren . Didn’t God choose the poor in this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the Kingdom that He promised to those who love Him ?
59002006	But you have dishonored the poor person . Isn’t it the rich who oppress you and drag you into court ?
59002007	Don’t they blaspheme the good name by which you were called ?
59002008	If , however , you fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture , “ You shall love your neighbor as yourself , ” you do well .
59002009	But if you show favoritism , you are committing sin and are convicted by the Torah as transgressors .
59002010	For whoever keeps the whole Torah but stumbles in one point , he has become guilty of all .
59002011	For the one who said , “ Do not commit adultery , ” also said , “ Do not commit murder . ” Now if you do not commit adultery but do commit murder , you have become a transgressor of the Torah .
59002012	So speak and act as those who will be judged according to a Torah that gives freedom .
59002013	For judgment is merciless to the one who does not show mercy . Mercy triumphs over judgment .
59002014	What good is it , my brethren , if someone says he has faith , but does not have works ? Can such faith save him ?
59002015	If a brother or sister is naked and lacks daily food ,
59002016	and one of you says to them , “ Go in shalom , keep warm and well fed , ” but you do not give them what the body needs , what good is that ?
59002017	So also faith , if it does not have works , is dead by itself .
59002018	But someone will say , “ You have faith and I have works . ” Show me your faith without works and I will show you faith by my works .
59002019	You believe that God is one . You do well . The demons also believe — and shudder !
59002020	But do you want to know , you empty person , that faith without works is dead ?
59002021	Wasn’t Abraham our father proved righteous by works when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar ?
59002022	You see that faith worked together with his works , and by the works his faith was made complete .
59002023	The Scripture was fulfilled that says , “ And Abraham believed God , and it was credited to him as righteousness ” — and he was called God’s friend .
59002024	You see that a man is proved righteous by works and not by faith alone .
59002025	And likewise , wasn’t Rahab the prostitute also proved righteous by works when she welcomed the messengers and sent them out another way ?
59002026	For just as the body without the spirit is dead , so also faith without works is dead .
59003001	Not many of you should become teachers , my brethren , since you know that we will receive a stricter judgment .
59003002	For we all stumble in many ways . If someone does not stumble in speech , he is a perfect man , able to bridle the whole body as well .
59003003	And if we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us , we guide their whole body as well .
59003004	See also the ships — though they are so large and are driven by strong winds , they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs .
59003005	So also the tongue is a small member — yet it boasts of great things . See how so small a fire sets a blaze so great a forest !
59003006	And the tongue is a fire . The tongue is a world of evil placed among our body parts . It pollutes the whole body and sets on fire the course of life — and is set on fire by Gehenna .
59003007	For every species of beasts and birds , reptiles and sea creatures , is tamed and has been tamed by mankind .
59003008	But no human being can tame the tongue . It is a restless evil , full of deadly poison .
59003009	With it we bless Adonai and Father , and with it we curse people , who are made in the image of God .
59003010	From the same mouth comes blessing and cursing . My brethren , these things should not be .
59003011	A spring doesn’t pour out fresh and bitter water from the same opening , does it ?
59003012	My brethren , can a fig tree produce olives , or a vine produce figs ? Neither can salt water produce fresh water .
59003013	Who among you is wise and understanding ? By his good conduct let him show his deeds in the gentleness of wisdom .
59003014	But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart , do not boast and lie against the truth .
59003015	This is not the wisdom that comes down from above , but is earthly , unspiritual , demonic .
59003016	For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist , there is disorder and every evil practice .
59003017	But the wisdom that is from above is first pure , then peaceable , gentle , open to reason , full of mercy and good fruits , impartial , not hypocritical .
59003018	And the fruit of righteousness is sown in shalom by those who make shalom .
59004001	Where do quarrels and conflicts among you come from ? Don’t they come from this , namely your passions that battle within your body parts ?
59004002	You crave and have not . You murder and you envy , yet you cannot get it . You fight and you wage war . You do not have because you do not ask .
59004003	You ask and do not receive , because you ask with wrong motives so you may spend it on your passions .
59004004	You adulteresses ! Don’t you know that friendship with the world is enmity with God ? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God .
59004005	Or do you think that in vain the Scripture says , “ He yearns jealously over the spirit which He made to dwell in us ” ?
59004006	But He gives greater grace . Therefore it says , “ God opposes the proud , but gives grace to the humble . ”
59004007	Therefore submit to God . But resist the devil and he will flee from you .
59004008	Draw near to God , and He will draw near to you . Cleanse your hands , you sinners , and purify your hearts , you double-minded !
59004009	Lament and mourn and weep ! Let your laughter be turned into mourning , and your joy into gloom .
59004010	Humble yourselves in the sight of Adonai , and He shall lift you up .
59004011	Do not speak evil against one another , brethren . The one who speaks against a brother or judges his brother , speaks evil against the Torah and judges the Torah . But if you judge the Torah , you are not a doer of the Torah , but a judge .
59004012	There is only one lawgiver and judge — the One who is able to save and to destroy . But who are you who judges your neighbor ?
59004013	Come now , you who say , “ Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a town and spend a year there and engage in business and make a profit . ”
59004014	Yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow . What is your life ? For you are a vapor that appears for a little while and then vanishes .
59004015	Instead you ought to say , “ If the Lord wills , we will live and also do this or that . ”
59004016	But now you boast in your arrogance . All such boasting is evil .
59004017	Therefore whoever knows the right thing to do and does not do it — for him it is sin .
59005001	Come now , you rich , weep and wail over the miseries that are coming upon you .
59005002	Your riches have rotted and your clothes have become moth-eaten .
59005003	Your gold and your silver have rusted and their rust will be evidence against you and will eat your flesh like fire . You have stored up treasure in the last days .
59005004	Behold , the wages of the workers who mowed your fields — which you kept back by fraud — are crying out against you . And the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of Hosts .
59005005	You have lived on earth in luxury and self-indulgence . You have fattened your hearts for a day of slaughter .
59005006	You have condemned , you have murdered the righteous person — he does not resist you .
59005007	So be patient , brethren , until the coming of the Lord . See how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth , being patient for it until it receives the early and late rain .
59005008	You also be patient . Strengthen your hearts because the coming of the Lord is near .
59005009	Do not grumble against one another , brethren , so that you may not be judged . Behold , the judge is standing at the doors .
59005010	As an example of suffering and patience , brethren , take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord .
59005011	Behold , we consider blessed those who showed endurance . You have heard of the endurance of Job , and you have seen the outcome of Adonai — that Adonai is full of compassion and mercy .
59005012	But above all , my brethren , do not swear — either by heaven , or by the earth , or by any other oath . But let your “ yes ” be “ yes , ” and your “ no , ” be “ no ” — so that you may not fall under judgment .
59005013	Is anyone among you suffering ? Let him pray . Is anyone cheerful ? Let him sing praises .
59005014	Is anyone among you sick ? Let him call for the elders of Messiah’s community , and let them pray over him , anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord .
59005015	The prayer of faith will save the one who is sick , and the Lord will raise him up . If he has committed sins , he will be forgiven .
59005016	So confess your offenses to one another and pray for one another so that you may be healed . The effective prayer of a righteous person is very powerful .
59005017	Elijah was a man with a nature like ours , and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain . And it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months .
59005018	He prayed again , and the sky gave rain , and the earth produced its fruit .
59005019	My brethren , if any among you strays from the truth and someone turns him back ,
59005020	let him know that the one who turns a sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death and cover a multitude of sins .
60001001	Peter , a shaliach of Messiah Yeshua , To the sojourners of the Diaspora in Pontus , Galatia , Cappadocia , Asia , and Bithynia — chosen
60001002	according to the foreknowledge of God the Father , set apart by the Ruach for obedience and for sprinkling with the blood of Yeshua the Messiah : May grace and shalom be multiplied to you . A Message of Living Hope
60001003	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah ! In His great mercy He caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Messiah Yeshua from the dead .
60001004	An incorruptible , undefiled , and unfading inheritance has been reserved in heaven for you .
60001005	By trusting , you are being protected by God’s power for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time .
60001006	You rejoice in this greatly , even though now for a little while , if necessary , you have been distressed by various trials .
60001007	These trials are so that the true metal of your faith ( far more valuable than gold , which perishes though refined by fire ) may come to light in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Messiah Yeshua .
60001008	Though you have not seen Him , you love Him . And even though you don’t see Him now , you trust Him and are filled with a joy that is glorious beyond words ,
60001009	receiving the outcome of your faith — the salvation of your souls .
60001010	The prophets , who spoke about the grace that was to be yours , searched for this salvation and investigated carefully .
60001011	They were trying to find out the time and circumstances the Ruach of Messiah within them was indicating , when predicting the sufferings in store for Messiah and the glories to follow .
60001012	It was revealed to them that they were providing these messages not to themselves but to you . These messages have now been announced to you through those who proclaimed the Good News to you by the Ruach ha-Kodesh , sent from heaven . Even angels long to catch a glimpse of these things . A Call to Be Holy
60001013	So brace your minds for action . Keep your balance . And set your hope completely on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Yeshua the Messiah .
60001014	Like obedient children , do not be shaped by the cravings you had formerly in your ignorance .
60001015	Instead , just like the Holy One who called you , be holy yourselves also in everything you do .
60001016	For it is written , “ Kedoshim you shall be , for I am kadosh . ”
60001017	If you call on Him as Father — the One who judges impartially according to each one’s deeds — then live out the time of sojourning in reverent fear .
60001018	You know that you were redeemed from the futile way of life handed down from your ancestors — not with perishable things such as silver or gold ,
60001019	but with precious blood like that of a lamb without defect or spot , the blood of Messiah .
60001020	He was chosen before the foundation of the world , but was revealed in these last times for your sake .
60001021	Through Him you are believers in God , who raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory , so that your trust and hope are in God .
60001022	Now that you have purified your souls in obedience to the truth , leading to sincere brotherly love , love one another fervently from a pure heart .
60001023	You have been born again — not from perishable seed but imperishable — through the living and enduring word of God .
60001024	For , “ All humanity is like grass , And all its glory like a wildflower . The grass withers , and the flower falls off ,
60001025	But the word of the Lord endures forever . ” And this is the word that was proclaimed as Good News to you .
60002001	So get rid of all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all lashon ha-ra .
60002002	As newborn babes , long for pure spiritual milk , so that by it you may grow toward salvation —
60002003	now that you have tasted that the Lord is good .
60002004	As you come to Him , a living stone rejected by men but chosen by God and precious ,
60002005	you also , as living stones , are being built up as a spiritual house — a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Messiah Yeshua .
60002006	For it says in Scripture , “ Behold , I lay in Zion a stone , a chosen , precious cornerstone . Whoever trusts in Him will never be put to shame . ”
60002007	Now the value is for you who keep trusting ; but for those who do not trust , “ The stone which the builders rejected — this One has become the chief cornerstone , ”
60002008	and “ a stone of stumbling , and a rock of offense . ” They stumble because they are disobeying the word — to this they were also appointed .
60002009	But you are a chosen people , a royal priesthood , a holy nation , a people for God's own possession , so that you may proclaim the praises of the One who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light .
60002010	Once you were “ not a people , ” but now you are “ God’s people . ” You were shown “ no mercy , ” but now you have been shown “ mercy . ”
60002011	Loved ones , I urge you as strangers and sojourners to keep away from the fleshly cravings that war against the soul .
60002012	Keep your conduct honorable among the Gentiles . Then while they speak against you as evildoers , they may — from noticing your good deeds — glorify God in the day of visitation . Respect and Order
60002013	For the Lord's sake , submit yourselves to every human authority — whether to a king as supreme ,
60002014	or to governors sent by him for the punishment of those who do evil and the praise of those who do good .
60002015	For this is God’s will , that you silence the ignorance of foolish men by doing good .
60002016	Live as free people , but not using your freedom as a cover-up for evil . Rather , live as God’s slaves .
60002017	Honor all people . Love the brotherhood . Fear God . Honor the king .
60002018	Slaves , with all respect submit yourselves to your masters — not only to those who are good and gentle , but also to those who are harsh .
60002019	For this finds favor if , for the sake of conscience toward God , someone endures grief from suffering undeservedly .
60002020	For what credit is there if , when you sin and get a beating , you endure ? But if you endure when you do good and suffer for it , this finds favor with God .
60002021	For you were called to this , because Messiah also suffered for you , leaving you an example so that you might follow in His footsteps :
60002022	“ He committed no sin , nor was any deceit found in His mouth . ” 23 When He was abused , He did not return the abuse . While suffering , He made no threats . Instead , He kept entrusting Himself to the One who judges righteously . 24 He Himself bore our sins in His body on the tree , so that we , removed from sins , might live for righteousness . “ By His wounds you were healed . ” 25 For you like sheep were going astray , but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls .
60003001	Likewise , wives , be submitted to your own husbands so that — even if some do not obey the message — by the wives’ conduct , without a word they may be won over
60003002	as they observe your pure , reverent conduct .
60003003	Don’t let your beauty be external — braiding the hair and wearing gold jewelry or fine clothes .
60003004	Instead let it be in the hidden person of the heart , with the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit , which in God’s sight is very precious .
60003005	For this is the way the holy women , who put their hope in God , used to beautify themselves long ago — being submitted to their own husbands
60003006	just as Sarah obeyed Abraham , calling him lord . You have become her daughters by doing what is good and not fearing intimidation .
60003007	In the same way , husbands , live with your wives in an understanding way . Though they are weaker partners , honor them as equal heirs of the grace of life . In this way , your prayers will not be hindered . Suffering for Doing Good
60003008	Finally , all of you be harmonious , sympathetic , brotherly , tenderhearted , humble-minded .
60003009	Do not repay evil for evil or insult for insult , but give a blessing instead — it is for this reason you were called , so that you might inherit a blessing .
60003010	For , “ The one who loves life , wanting to see good days , must keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit .
60003011	He must turn away from evil and do good . He must seek shalom and pursue it .
60003012	For the eyes of Adonai are on the righteous and His ears open to their prayer , but the face of Adonai is against those who do evil . ”
60003013	Who is going to harm you if you are eager to do good ?
60003014	But even if you should suffer for what is right , you are blessed . Do not be afraid or worry about their threats .
60003015	Instead sanctify Messiah as Lord in your hearts . Always be ready to give an answer to anyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you ,
60003016	yet with humility and reverence — keeping a clear conscience so that , whatever you are accused of , those who abuse you for your good conduct in Messiah may be put to shame .
60003017	For it is better to suffer for doing good ( if it is God’s will ) than for doing evil .
60003018	For Messiah once suffered for sins also — the righteous for the unrighteous — in order to bring you to God . He was put to death in the flesh , but made alive by the Ruach .
60003019	Through the Ruach He also went and preached to the spirits in prison .
60003020	Long ago they disobeyed while God kept waiting patiently , in the days of Noah as the ark was being built . In that ark a few ( that is , eight souls ) were brought safely through water .
60003021	Corresponding to that , immersion now brings you to safety — not the removal of dirt from the flesh , but a pledge to God of a good conscience — through the resurrection of Messiah Yeshua .
60003022	He has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God , with angels and authorities and powers subjected to Him .
60004001	Therefore , since Messiah suffered in the flesh , arm yourselves also with the same attitude . For the one who has suffered in the flesh is finished with sin .
60004002	As a result , he lives the rest of his time in the flesh no longer for human desires , but for God’s will .
60004003	For the time that has passed was sufficient for you to carry out the desire of the pagans — living in indecency , lusts , drunken binges , orgies , wild parties , and lawless idolatries .
60004004	They are surprised that you do not run with them into the same riot of recklessness , and they vilify you .
60004005	But they will have to give an account to the One who stands ready to judge the living and the dead .
60004006	For this was the reason the Good News was proclaimed even to those now dead , so that though they are judged in the flesh before humans , they might live in the Ruach before God .
60004007	Now the end of all things is near . So be self-controlled and sober-minded for prayer .
60004008	Above all , keep your love for one another constant , for “ love covers a multitude of sins . ”
60004009	Be hospitable one to another without grumbling .
60004010	As each one has received a gift , use it to serve one another , as good stewards of the many-sided grace of God .
60004011	Whoever speaks , let it be as one speaking the utterances of God . Whoever serves , let it be with the strength that God supplies . So in all things may God be glorified through Messiah Yeshua — all glory and power to Him forever and ever ! Amen .
60004012	Loved ones , do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal taking place among you to test you — as though something strange were happening to you .
60004013	Instead , rejoice insofar as you share in the sufferings of Messiah , so that at the revelation of His glory you may also rejoice and be glad .
60004014	If you are insulted for the name of Messiah , you are fortunate , for the Ruach of glory and of God rests on you .
60004015	For let none of you suffer as a murderer or thief or evildoer or as a troublemaker .
60004016	But if anyone suffers for following Messiah , let him not be ashamed , but let him glorify God in this name .
60004017	For the time has come for judgment to begin with the house of God . If judgment begins with us first , what will be the end for those who disobey the Good News of God ?
60004018	Now , “ if it is hard for the righteous to be saved , what shall become of the ungodly and the sinner ? ”
60004019	So then , those who suffer according to God’s will — let them trust their souls to a faithful Creator while continuing to do good .
60005001	Therefore I appeal to the elders among you — as a fellow elder and witness of Messiah’s sufferings , and a partaker also of the glory about to be revealed —
60005002	shepherd God’s flock among you . Watch over it not under compulsion but willingly before God , not for dishonest gain but eagerly .
60005003	Don’t lord it over those apportioned to you , but become examples to the flock .
60005004	When the Chief Shepherd appears , you will receive the unfading crown of glory .
60005005	Likewise , you younger ones , submit yourselves to the elders . And all of you , clothe yourselves with humility toward one another , for “ God opposes the proud , but gives grace to the humble . ”
60005006	Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God , so that He may lift you up at the appropriate time .
60005007	Cast all your worries on Him , for He cares for you .
60005008	Stay alert ! Watch out ! Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion , searching for someone to devour .
60005009	Stand up against him , firm in your faith , knowing that the same kinds of suffering are being laid upon your brethren throughout the world .
60005010	After you have suffered a little while , the God of all grace — who has called you into His eternal glory in Messiah — will Himself restore , support , strengthen , and establish you .
60005011	All power to Him forever ! Amen . Final Greetings
60005012	Through Silvanus , whom I consider our faithful brother , I have written to you briefly , encouraging and testifying that this is the true grace of God . Stand firm in it !
60005013	Messiah’s community in Babylon , chosen together with you , sends you greetings . So does my son Mark .
60005014	Greet one another with a kiss of love . Shalom to you all who are in Messiah . Amen .
61001001	Simon Peter , a slave and shaliach of Messiah Yeshua , To those who have received a faith equal to ours through the righteousness of our God and Savior , Messiah Yeshua :
61001002	May grace and shalom be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Yeshua our Lord . Qualities for Living Forever
61001003	His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness , through the knowledge of Him who called us by His own glory and virtue .
61001004	Through these things He has given us His precious and magnificent promises , so that through them you may become partakers of the divine nature , since you have escaped the corruption that evil desires have brought into the world .
61001005	Now for this very reason , making every effort , add to your faith virtue ; and to virtue , knowledge ;
61001006	and to knowledge , self-control ; and to self-control , patience ; and to patience , godliness ;
61001007	and to godliness , brotherly love ; and to brotherly love , love .
61001008	For if these qualities are in you and increasing , they keep you from becoming idle and unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah .
61001009	But anyone who lacks these qualities is blind — nearsighted because he has forgotten his cleansing from past sins .
61001010	Therefore , brethren , make all the more effort to make your calling and election certain — for if you keep doing these things , you will never stumble .
61001011	For in this way entry into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior , Messiah Yeshua , will be richly provided for you .
61001012	Therefore I intend to keep reminding you of these things , even though you know them and are well-grounded in the truth that you have .
61001013	I think it right to stir you up with a reminder , as long as I remain alive in this “ tent ” of a body —
61001014	knowing that my death is soon , as our Lord Yeshua the Messiah has made clear to me .
61001015	And I will make every effort for you to always remember these things even after my departure . Distinguishing True Testimony from Tales
61001016	For we did not follow cleverly concocted tales when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah , but we were eyewitnesses of His majesty .
61001017	For when He received honor and glory from God the Father , a voice came to Him from the Majestic Glory : “ This is My Son , whom I love ; with Him I am well pleased ! ”
61001018	And we ourselves heard this voice come out of heaven , when we were with Him on the holy mountain .
61001019	Furthermore , we have the reliable prophetic word . You do well by paying attention to it , as to a lamp shining in a dark place , until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts .
61001020	Above all understand this : no prophecy of Scripture comes about from a person’s own interpretation .
61001021	For no prophecy was ever brought forth by human will ; rather , people spoke from God as they were moved by the Ruach ha-Kodesh .
61002001	But false prophets also arose among the people , just as there will also be false teachers among you . They will secretly bring in destructive heresies . They will even deny the Master who bought them — bringing swift destruction upon themselves .
61002002	Many will follow their immoral ways , and as a result the way of the truth will be maligned .
61002003	In their greed they will exploit you with false words . Their judgment from long ago is not idle , and their destruction does not slumber .
61002004	For God did not spare angels when they sinned , but threw them into Sheol . He put them in chains of gloomy darkness , to be held until the judgment .
61002005	He did not spare the ancient world . He preserved only Noah , a proclaimer of righteousness , along with seven others , when He brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly .
61002006	He devastated the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah , reducing them to ashes — making them an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly .
61002007	He rescued Lot , a righteous man deeply troubled by the shameless immorality of the wicked .
61002008	( For that righteous man , while living among them , was tormented in his righteous soul day after day by lawless deeds he saw and heard . )
61002009	Therefore the Lord certainly knows how to rescue the godly from trials , and how to keep the unrighteous being punished until the Day of Judgment —
61002010	especially those who follow after the flesh in its unclean desires and who despise the Lord’s authority . Brazen and arrogant , these people do not tremble while slandering glorious beings ;
61002011	yet even angels , though stronger and more powerful , do not bring a slanderous charge against them before the Lord .
61002012	But these people are like irrational animals — creatures of instinct born to be captured and killed . They malign what they don’t understand , and in their destruction they will be utterly destroyed .
61002013	They will be paid back for what they have done — evil for evil . They consider carousing in broad daylight a pleasure . They are blots and blemishes , reveling in their deceitful pleasures while feasting together with you .
61002014	They have eyes full of adultery that never stop sinning , enticing unstable souls . They have hearts trained in greed — a cursed brood !
61002015	They have abandoned the straight way . They have gone astray . They have followed the way of Balaam the son of Beor , who loved the wages of wickedness .
61002016	But he received a rebuke for his own wrongdoing . A dumb donkey spoke with a man's voice and put a stop to the prophet’s madness .
61002017	These people are springs without water and mists driven by a storm . The gloom of utter darkness has been reserved for them .
61002018	For by mouthing grandiosities that amount to nothing , they entice in sensual fleshly passions those who are barely escaping from those who live in error .
61002019	They promise them freedom while they themselves are slaves of corruption — for a person is a slave to whatever has overcome him .
61002020	For if — after escaping the world’s pollutions through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior , Yeshua the Messiah — they again become entangled in these things and are overcome , the end for them has become worse than the beginning .
61002021	For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness , than after learning about it , to turn back from the holy commandment passed on to them .
61002022	What has happened to them confirms the truth of the proverb , “ A dog returns to its vomit , ” and “ A scrubbed pig heads right back into the mud . ”
61003001	Loved ones , this is now the second letter that I am writing to you . In both I am trying to stir you up by way of a reminder to wholesome thinking —
61003002	to remember the words previously proclaimed by the holy prophets and the commandment of our Lord and Savior through your shlichim .
61003003	First of all , understand that in the last days , scoffers will come scoffing , following after their own desires
61003004	and saying , “ Where is this promise of His coming ? Ever since the fathers died , everything goes on just as it has from the beginning of creation . ”
61003005	For in holding to this idea , it escapes their notice that the heavens existed long ago and the earth was formed out of water and through water by the word of God .
61003006	Through these , the world of that time was destroyed by being flooded with water .
61003007	But by the same word the present heavens and earth are being reserved for fire — kept until the Day of Judgment and the destruction of ungodly people .
61003008	But don’t forget this one thing , loved ones , that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years , and a thousand years are like one day .
61003009	The Lord is not slow in keeping His promise , as some consider slowness . Rather , He is being patient toward you — not wanting anyone to perish , but for all to come to repentance .
61003010	But the day of the Lord will come like a thief . On that day the heavens will pass away with a roar , and the elements will melt and disintegrate , and the earth and everything done on it shall be exposed .
61003011	Since all these things are to be destroyed in this way , what kind of people should you be ? Live your lives in holiness and godliness ,
61003012	looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God . In that day the heavens will be dissolved by fire , and the elements will melt in the intense heat .
61003013	But in keeping with His promise , we look for new heavens and a new earth , where righteousness dwells . Final Advice
61003014	Therefore , loved ones , while you are looking for these things , make every effort to be found in shalom , spotless and blameless before Him .
61003015	Bear in mind that the patience of our Lord means salvation — just as our dearly loved brother Paul also wrote to you with the wisdom given to him .
61003016	He speaks about these matters in all of his letters . Some things in them are hard to understand , which the ignorant and unstable twist ( as they also do with the rest of the Scriptures ) — to their own destruction .
61003017	Since you already know all this , loved ones , be on your guard so that you are not led astray by the error of the lawless and lose your sure footing .
61003018	Instead , keep growing in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Yeshua the Messiah . To Him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity ! Amen .
62001001	What was from the beginning , what we have heard , what we have seen with our eyes , what we have looked at and touched with our hands , concerning the Word of life —
62001002	the life was revealed , and we have seen and testify and declare to you the eternal life that was with the Father and was revealed to us .
62001003	What we have seen and heard we proclaim also to you , so you may have fellowship with us . Indeed , our fellowship is with the Father and His Son , Yeshua the Messiah .
62001004	These things we write so our joy may be full .
62001005	Now this is the message we have heard from Him and announce to you — that God is light and in Him there is no darkness at all .
62001006	If we say we have fellowship with Him and keep walking in the darkness , we are lying and do not practice the truth .
62001007	But if we walk in the light as He Himself is in the light , we have fellowship with one another and the blood of His Son Yeshua purifies us from all sin .
62001008	If we say we have no sin , we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us .
62001009	If we confess our sins , He is faithful and righteous to forgive our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness .
62001010	If we say we have not sinned , we make Him a liar and His word is not in us .
62002001	My children , I am writing these things to you so that you will not sin . But if anyone does sin , we have an Intercessor with the Father — the righteous Messiah Yeshua .
62002002	He is the atonement for our sins , and not only for our sins but also for the whole world .
62002003	Now we know that we have come to know Him by this — if we keep His commandments .
62002004	The one who says , “ I have come to know Him , ” and does not keep His commandments is a liar , and the truth is not in him .
62002005	But whoever keeps His word , in him the love of God is truly made perfect . We know that we are in Him by this —
62002006	whoever claims to abide in Him must walk just as He walked .
62002007	Loved ones , I am not writing a new commandment for you , but an old commandment — one you had from the beginning . This old commandment is the word you have heard .
62002008	Yet I am writing a new commandment for you , which is true in Him and in you , because the darkness is fading and the true light is already shining .
62002009	The one who says he is in the light and hates his brother is still in the darkness .
62002010	The one who loves his brother abides in the light , and in him there is no cause for stumbling .
62002011	But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness . He doesn’t know where he is going , because the darkness has made his eyes blind .
62002012	I am writing to you , children , because your sins have been forgiven on account of His name .
62002013	I am writing to you , fathers , because you have known the One who is from the beginning . I am writing to you , young men , because you have overcome the evil one .
62002014	I have written to you , children , because you have known the Father . I have written to you , fathers , because you have known the One who is from the beginning . I have written to you , young men , because you are strong , the word of God abides in you , and you have overcome the evil one .
62002015	Do not love the world or the things in the world . If anyone loves the world , the love of the Father is not in Him .
62002016	For everything in the world — the desire of the flesh , the desire of the eyes , and the boasting of life — is not from the Father but from the world .
62002017	The world is passing away along with its desire , but the one who does the will of God abides forever .
62002018	Children , it is the last hour . Just as you heard that the anti-messiah is coming , even now many anti-messiahs have come — by this we know that it is the last hour .
62002019	They left us , but they didn’t really belong to us . If they had belonged to us , they would have remained with us . But they left us so it became clear that none of them belongs to us .
62002020	But you have an anointing from the Holy One , and you all know .
62002021	I have not written you because you do not know the truth , but because you do know it , and because no lie is of the truth .
62002022	Who is the liar , if not the one who denies that Yeshua is the Messiah ? This one is the anti-messiah — the one who denies the Father and the Son .
62002023	No one who denies the Son has the Father ; the one who acknowledges the Son also has the Father .
62002024	As for you , let what you heard from the beginning remain in you . If what you heard from the beginning remains in you , you also will continue to live in the Son and in the Father .
62002025	Now this is the promise that He Himself has promised us — eternal life .
62002026	I have written you these things about those who are trying to mislead you .
62002027	As for you , the anointing you received from Him remains in you , and you have no need for anyone to teach you . But as His anointing teaches you about all things — and it is true and not a lie — and just as it has taught you , abide in Him .
62002028	And now , children , abide in Him , so that when He appears we will have confidence and not be ashamed in His presence at His coming .
62002029	If you know that He is righteous , you also know that everyone who does what is right is born of Him .
62003001	See how glorious a love the Father has given us , that we should be called God’s children — and so we are ! The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know Him .
62003002	Loved ones , now we are God’s children ; and it has not yet been revealed what we will be . But we do know that when it’s revealed , we shall be like Him , because we will see Him just as He is .
62003003	Everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself , just as He is pure .
62003004	Everyone practicing sin also practices lawlessness — indeed , sin is lawlessness .
62003005	You know that Yeshua appeared in order to take away sins , and in Him there is no sin .
62003006	No one who abides in Him sins ; no one who sins has seen Him or known Him .
62003007	Children , let no one mislead you ! The one who practices righteousness is righteous , just as Yeshua is righteous .
62003008	The one who practices sin is of the devil , for the devil has been sinning from the beginning . Ben-Elohim appeared for this purpose — to destroy the works of the devil .
62003009	No one born of God practices sin , because God’s seed remains in him . He cannot sin , because he is born of God .
62003010	It is clear who are the children of God and who are the children of the devil by this — anyone who does not act righteously or love his brother is not of God .
62003011	For this is the message you have heard from the beginning — we should love one another .
62003012	Do not be like Cain , who was from the evil one and murdered his brother . And why did he murder him ? Because his deeds were evil , while his brother’s were righteous .
62003013	Do not be surprised , brethren , if the world hates you .
62003014	We know that we have passed from death to life , because we love our brethren . The one who does not love remains in death .
62003015	Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer — and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him .
62003016	We have come to know love by this — Yeshua laid down His life for us , and we also ought to lay down our lives for our brethren .
62003017	But if someone has material possessions and sees his brother in need and closes his heart against him , how does the love of God abide in him ?
62003018	Children , let us not love with word or talk , but in deed and truth !
62003019	By this we shall know that we are of the truth , and set our heart at rest before Him
62003020	whenever our heart condemns us . For God is greater than our heart , and knows all things .
62003021	Loved ones , if our heart does not condemn us , we have confidence before God ;
62003022	and whatever we ask , we receive from Him , because we keep His commandments and do what is pleasing in His sight .
62003023	Now this is His commandment — that we should believe in the name of His Son , Yeshua the Messiah , and love one another , just as He commanded us .
62003024	The one who keeps His commandments abides in God , and God in him . We know that He abides in us by this — by the Ruach He has given us .
62004001	Loved ones , do not believe every spirit , but test the spirits to see if they are from God . For many false prophets have gone out into the world .
62004002	You know the Ruach Elohim by this — every spirit that acknowledges that Messiah Yeshua has come in human flesh is from God ,
62004003	but every spirit that does not acknowledge Yeshua is not from God . This is the spirit of the anti-messiah , which you have heard is coming and now is already in the world .
62004004	You are from God , children , and you have overcome them , because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world .
62004005	They are from the world , so they speak from the world and the world listens to them .
62004006	We are from God ; whoever knows God listens to us , but whoever is not from God does not listen to us . By this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error .
62004007	Loved ones , let us love one another , for love is from God . Everyone who loves is born of God and knows God .
62004008	The one who does not love does not know God , for God is love .
62004009	The love of God was revealed among us by this — that God sent His one and only Son into the world so that we might live through Him .
62004010	This is love — not that we have loved God , but that He loved us and sent His Son as an atonement for our sins .
62004011	Loved ones , if God so loved us , we also ought to love one another .
62004012	No one has ever seen God . If we love one another , God abides in us and His love is made perfect in us .
62004013	We know that we abide in Him and He in us by this — because He has given us of His Ruach .
62004014	We have seen and testify that the Father has sent His Son as Savior of the world .
62004015	If anyone acknowledges that Yeshua is Ben-Elohim , God abides in him and he abides in God .
62004016	So we have come to know and trust in the love that God has for us . God is love . Now whoever abides in love abides in God , and God abides in him .
62004017	In this way , love is made perfect among us , so that we should have boldness on the Day of Judgment . For just as He is , so also are we in this world .
62004018	There is no fear in love , but perfect love drives out fear . For fear has to do with punishment , and the one who fears has not been made perfect in love .
62004019	We love , because He first loved us .
62004020	If anyone says , “ I love God , ” and hates his brother , he is a liar . For the one who does not love his brother , whom he has seen , cannot love God , whom he has not seen .
62004021	And this commandment we have from Him : that the one who loves God should also love his brother .
62005001	Everyone who believes that Yeshua is the Messiah is born of God , and everyone who loves the Father loves the one born of Him .
62005002	We know that we love God’s children by this — when we love God and obey His commandments .
62005003	For this is the love of God — that we keep His commandments . And His commandments are not burdensome .
62005004	For everyone born of God overcomes the world . And the victory that has overcome the world is this — our faith .
62005005	Who is it that overcomes the world , if not the one who believes that Yeshua is Ben-Elohim ?
62005006	Messiah Yeshua is the One who came by water and blood — not by water only , but by water and blood . The Ruach is the One who testifies , because the Ruach is the truth .
62005007	For there are three that testify —
62005008	the Ruach , the water , and the blood — and these three are one .
62005009	If we accept men’s testimony , God’s testimony is greater — for this it is the testimony that God has given about His Son .
62005010	The one who trusts in Ben-Elohim has the testimony in himself ; the one who does not trust in God has made Him a liar , because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given about His Son .
62005011	And the testimony is this — that God gave us eternal life , and this life is in His Son .
62005012	The one who has the Son has life ; the one who does not have Ben-Elohim does not have life .
62005013	I wrote these things to you who believe in the name of Ben-Elohim , so you may know that you have eternal life .
62005014	Now this is the confidence we have before Him — that if we ask anything according to His will , He hears us .
62005015	And if we know that He hears us — whatever we ask — we know that we have the requests we have asked from Him .
62005016	If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not leading to death , he should ask , and God will give life to those who commit sin not leading to death . There is a sin leading to death — I am not saying you should ask about that .
62005017	All unrighteousness is sin , but there is sin not leading to death .
62005018	We know that anyone born of God does not keep on sinning ; rather , the One born of God keeps him safe , and the evil one cannot touch him .
62005019	We know that we are of God , and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one .
62005020	And we know that Ben-Elohim has come and given us insight , so that we may know Him who is true — and we are in Him who is true , in His Son Yeshua the Messiah . This One is the true God and eternal life .
62005021	Children , guard yourselves from idols .
63001001	The elder . To the chosen lady and her children , whom I love in truth — and not I alone , but also all who have come to know the truth —
63001002	because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever :
63001003	Grace , mercy , and shalom be with us , from God the Father and from Messiah Yeshua , the Father’s Son , in truth and love !
63001004	I was overjoyed to find some of your children walking in truth , just as we received as a commandment from the Father .
63001005	Now I ask you , dear lady , that we love one another . It is not as though I am writing you a new command , but the one we have had from the beginning .
63001006	Now this is love : that we walk according to His commands . This is the commandment — just as you heard from the beginning — that you walk in love .
63001007	For many deceivers have gone out into the world — those who do not acknowledge Yeshua as Messiah coming in human flesh . This one is a deceiver and the anti-messiah .
63001008	Watch yourselves , so you do not lose what we have worked for but receive a full reward .
63001009	Anyone who goes too far and does not remain in Messiah’s teaching does not have God . Anyone who remains in this teaching has both the Father and the Son .
63001010	If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching , do not welcome him into your home or even give him a greeting .
63001011	For the one greeting him shares in his evil deeds .
63001012	Although I have much to write to you , I don’t want to do it with paper and ink . But I hope to come to you and speak face to face , so that our joy may be full .
63001013	The children of your chosen sister send you greetings .
64001001	The elder . To Gaius the loved one , whom I love in truth :
64001002	Loved ones , I pray that all may go well with you and that you may be in good health , just as it is well with your soul .
64001003	For I was overjoyed when some brethren came and testified of the truth in you — how you are walking in truth .
64001004	I have no greater joy than this — to hear that my children are walking in the truth .
64001005	Loved ones , you are acting faithfully in whatever you do for the brethren and especially for strangers .
64001006	They have testified to your love before Messiah’s community . You will do well to send them on their way in a manner worthy of God .
64001007	For on behalf of the Name they went out , accepting nothing from the pagans .
64001008	Therefore we ought to support such people , so we might become co-workers in the truth .
64001009	I wrote something to Messiah’s community , but Diotrephes , who loves to be first among them , doesn’t welcome us .
64001010	So if I do come , I will call attention to what he is doing — slandering us with wicked words . Not even content with that , he refuses to welcome the brethren , and even forbids those who want to do so — throwing them out of the community !
64001011	Loved ones , do not imitate what is evil but what is good . The one who does good is of God ; the one who does evil has not seen God .
64001012	Demetrius has a good testimony from everyone , even from the truth itself . We also vouch for him — and you know that our testimony is true .
64001013	I have much to write you , but I don’t want to write to you with ink and pen .
64001014	But I hope to see you soon , and we will speak face to face .
64001015	Shalom aleichem . The friends here send their greetings . Greet the friends there by name .
65001001	Judah , a slave of Yeshua the Messiah and brother of Jacob , To those who are called , who are loved in God the Father , and kept safe for Yeshua the Messiah :
65001002	May mercy and shalom and love be multiplied to you !
65001003	Loved ones , though very eager to write to you about our common salvation , I felt it necessary to write to you urging you to continue to contend for the faith that was once for all handed down to the kedoshim .
65001004	For certain people have secretly slipped in — those who from long ago have been marked out for this judgment . They are ungodly people , who pervert the grace of our God into indecency and deny our only Master and Lord , Yeshua the Messiah .
65001005	Now I wish to remind you — though you have come to know all things — that the Lord , once having saved a people out of the land of Egypt , afterward destroyed those who did not believe .
65001006	And the angels — who did not keep their own position of authority but deserted their proper place — He has kept in everlasting shackles under gloomy darkness until the judgment of the great Day .
65001007	In the same way as these angels , Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them — having given themselves over to sexual immorality and gone after a different sort of flesh — are displayed as an example , suffering the punishment of eternal fire .
65001008	Yet in the same way these people also , by their visionary dreaming , defile the flesh , reject the Lord’s authority , and defame glorious beings .
65001009	But when Michael the archangel , disputing with the devil , was arguing about the body of Moses , he did not dare to render a judgment against him for slander , but said , “ May the Lord rebuke you ! ”
65001010	But these people slander whatever they do not understand . And whatever they do understand instinctively — like animals without reason — by these things they are destroyed .
65001011	Woe to them ! For they went the way of Cain ; they were consumed for pay in Balaam’s error ; and in Korah’s rebellion they have been destroyed .
65001012	These people are hidden rocky reefs at your love feasts — shamelessly feasting with you , tending only to themselves . They are waterless clouds , carried along by winds ; fruitless trees in late autumn , doubly dead , uprooted ;
65001013	wild waves of the sea , foaming up their own shame ; wandering stars , for whom the gloom of utter darkness has been reserved forever .
65001014	It was also about these people that Enoch , the seventh generation from Adam , prophesied , saying , “ Behold , the Lord came with myriads of His kedoshim ,
65001015	to execute judgment against all . He will convict all the ungodly for all their ungodly deeds that they have done in an ungodly way , and for all of the harsh things ungodly sinners have spoken against Him . ”
65001016	These are bellyaching grumblers , following after their own desires . Their mouth speaks grandiose things , showing favoritism for the sake of gain .
65001017	But you , loved ones , ought to remember the words previously proclaimed by the shlichim of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah —
65001018	how they kept telling you , “ In the last time there will be scoffers , following after their own ungodly desires . ”
65001019	These are the ones who cause divisions — worldly-minded , not having the Ruach
65001020	But you , loved ones , continue building yourselves up on your most holy faith , praying in the Ruach ha-Kodesh .
65001021	Keep yourselves in the love of God , eagerly waiting for the mercy of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah that leads to eternal life .
65001022	And have mercy on those who are wavering —
65001023	save them by snatching them out of the fire ; but on others have mercy with fear — hating even the garment defiled by the flesh .
65001024	Now to the One who is able to keep you from stumbling , and to present you blameless before the presence of His glory with great joy ,
65001025	to the only God our Savior , through Yeshua the Messiah our Lord , be glory , majesty , power , and authority , before all time , both now and forever . Amen .
66001001	The revelation of Yeshua the Messiah , which God gave Him to show to His servants the things that must soon take place . He made it known by sending His angel to His servant John ,
66001002	who testified to the word of God and to the testimony of Yeshua the Messiah — to everything he saw .
66001003	How fortunate is the one who reads the words of this prophecy , and those who hear and keep what has been written in it — for the time is near .
66001004	John , To Messiah’s seven communities in Asia : Grace to you and shalom from Him who is and who was and who is to come , as well as from the seven spirits who are before His throne ,
66001005	and from Messiah Yeshua , the faithful witness , the firstborn of the dead , and the ruler of the kings of the earth . To Him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by His blood
66001006	and made us a kingdom , kohanim to His God and Father — to Him be glory and power forever ! Amen !
66001007	“ Look , He is coming with the clouds , and every eye shall see Him , even those who pierced Him . And all the tribes of the earth shall mourn because of Him . Yes , amen ! ”
66001008	“ I am the Alpha and the Omega , ” says Adonai Elohim , “ Who is and who was and who is to come , the Almighty ! ”
66001009	I , John , your brother and fellow partaker with you in the tribulation and kingdom and patient endurance that are in Yeshua , was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Yeshua .
66001010	I was in the Ruach on the Day of the Lord , and I heard behind me a loud voice like that of a trumpet ,
66001011	saying , “ Write what you see in a scroll , and send it to Messiah’s seven communities — to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea . ”
66001012	Then I turned to see the voice that was speaking to me . And when I turned , I saw seven golden menorahs .
66001013	In the midst of the menorahs , I saw One like a Son of Man , clothed in a robe down to His feet , with a golden belt wrapped around His chest .
66001014	His head and His hair were white like wool , white like snow , and His eyes like a flame of fire .
66001015	His feet were like polished bronze refined in a furnace , and His voice was like the roar of rushing waters .
66001016	In His right hand He held seven stars , and out of His mouth came forth a sharp , two-edged sword . His face was like the sun shining at full strength .
66001017	When I saw Him , I fell at His feet like a dead man . But He placed His right hand on me , saying , “ Do not be afraid ! I am the First and the Last ,
66001018	and the One who lives . I was dead , but look — I am alive forever and ever ! Moreover , I hold the keys of death and Sheol .
66001019	Therefore write down what you have seen , what is , and what will happen after these things .
66001020	As for the mystery of the seven stars that you saw in My right hand , and the seven golden menorahs — the seven stars are the angels of Messiah’s seven communities , and the seven menorahs are the seven communities . ”
66002001	To the angel of Messiah’s community in Ephesus write : “ Thus says the One who holds the seven stars in His right hand , the One who walks in the midst of the seven golden menorahs :
66002002	I know all about your deeds and your toil and your patient endurance , and that you cannot bear those who are evil . You have tested those who call themselves shlichim and are not , and have found them to be liars .
66002003	You have perseverance and have endured for My name's sake , and you have not grown weary .
66002004	“ But this I have against you , that you have forsaken your first love .
66002005	Remember then from where you have fallen . Repent and do the deeds you did at first . If not , I will come to you and remove your menorah from its place — unless you repent .
66002006	“ Yet you have this going for you , that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans , which I also hate .
66002007	He who has an ear , let him hear what the Ruach is saying to Messiah’s communities . To the one who overcomes , I will grant the right to eat from the Tree of Life , which is in the Paradise of God . ”
66002008	To the angel of Messiah’s community in Smyrna write : “ Thus says the First and Last , who was dead and came to life .
66002009	I know your tribulation and your poverty ( yet you are rich ) , as well as the slander of those who say they are Jewish and are not , but are a synagogue of satan .
66002010	Do not fear what you are about to suffer . Behold , the devil is about to throw some of you into prison , so that you may be tested , and you will have tribulation for ten days . Be faithful until death , and I will give you the crown of life .
66002011	He who has an ear , let him hear what the Ruach is saying to Messiah’s communities . The one who overcomes shall never be harmed by the second death . ”
66002012	To the angel of Messiah’s community in Pergamum write : “ Thus says the One who has the sharp two-edged sword :
66002013	I know where you live — where satan's throne is . Yet you continue to hold firm to My name , and you did not deny your faith in Me even in the days of Antipas , My faithful witness , who was killed among you , where satan resides .
66002014	“ But I have a few things against you . You have some there who hold to the teaching of Balaam , who was teaching Balak to put a stumbling block before B’nei-Israel , to eat food sacrificed to idols and to commit sexual immorality .
66002015	Likewise you also have those who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans .
66002016	Repent then ! If not , I will come to you soon and make war against them with the sword of My mouth .
66002017	He who has an ear , let him hear what the Ruach is saying to Messiah’s communities . To the one who overcomes I will give some of the hidden manna , and I will give him a white stone — and written on the stone a new name that no one knows except the one who receives it . ”
66002018	To the angel of Messiah’s community in Thyatira write : “ Thus says the Son of God , who has eyes like a flame of fire and feet like polished bronze :
66002019	I know your deeds and your love and faith and service and patient endurance , and that your last deeds are greater than the first .
66002020	“ But this I have against you , that you tolerate that woman Jezebel , who calls herself a prophetess — yet she is teaching and deceiving My servants to commit sexual immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols .
66002021	I gave her time to repent , but she refuses to repent of her immorality .
66002022	Behold , I will throw her into a sickbed , and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation — unless they repent of her doings .
66002023	I will also strike her children with a deadly disease . Then all of Messiah’s communities will know that I am the One who searches minds and hearts , and I will give to each of you according to your deeds .
66002024	“ But to the rest of you in Thyatira , who do not hold to this teaching and have not learned the so-called ‘ deep things’ of satan — I place on you no other burden .
66002025	Only hold firm to what you have until I come .
66002026	To the one who overcomes and guards My deeds until the end , ‘ I will give him authority over the nations
66002027	and he shall rule them with an iron rod , as when clay pots are broken into pieces . ’
66002028	Even as I have received from My Father , so I will give him the morning star .
66002029	He who has an ear , let him hear what the Ruach is saying to Messiah’s communities . ”
66003001	To the angel of Messiah’s community in Sardis write : “ Thus says the One having the seven spirits of God and the seven stars : I know your deeds — you have a reputation for being alive , but you are dead .
66003002	Wake up , and strengthen what remains that was about to die . For I have not found your deeds complete in the sight of My God .
66003003	So remember what you have received and heard — keep it , and repent . If you will not wake up , I will come like a thief , and you will not know at what hour I will come upon you .
66003004	“ But still , you have a few people in Sardis who have not stained their clothes . They will walk with Me in white , because they are worthy .
66003005	The one who overcomes thus will be dressed in white clothes ; I will never blot his name out of the Book of Life , and will confess his name before My Father and His angels .
66003006	He who has an ear , let him hear what the Ruach is saying to Messiah’s communities .
66003007	To the angel of Messiah’s community in Philadelphia write : “ Thus says the Holy One , the True One , who has the key of David , who opens and no one will shut , and who shuts and no one opens :
66003008	I know your deeds . Behold , I have set before you an open door that no one is able to shut — because you have little power , but you have kept My word and have not denied My name .
66003009	Behold , I will cause those of the synagogue of satan — who say they are Jewish and are not , but lie — behold , I will cause them to come and bow down before your feet , so that they acknowledge that I have loved you !
66003010	“ Because you have kept My word about patient endurance , I will also keep you from the hour of trial that is coming upon the whole world to test those who dwell on the earth .
66003011	I am coming soon — hold on to what you have , so that no one will take away your crown .
66003012	The one who overcomes , I will make him a pillar in the Temple of My God , and he will never leave it . And on him I will write the name of My God and the name of the city of My God — the New Jerusalem , which comes down out of heaven from My God — and My own new Name .
66003013	He who has an ear , let him hear what the Ruach is saying to Messiah’s communities . ”
66003014	To the angel of Messiah’s community in Laodicea write : “ Thus says the Amen , the Faithful and True Witness , the Originator of God's creation :
66003015	I know your deeds , that you are neither cold nor hot . Oh , that you were either cold or hot !
66003016	So because you are lukewarm , and neither cold nor hot , I am about to spew you out of My mouth .
66003017	For you say , ‘ I am rich , I have made myself wealthy , and I need nothing . ’ But you do not know that you are miserable and pitiable and poor and blind and naked .
66003018	I advise you to buy from Me gold refined by fire so that you may be rich , and white clothes so that you may dress yourself and so the shame of your nakedness will not be revealed , and eye salve to anoint your eyes so that you may see .
66003019	Those whom I love , I rebuke and discipline . Therefore , be zealous and repent .
66003020	Behold , I stand at the door and knock . If anyone hears My voice and opens the door , I will come in to him and will dine with him , and he with Me .
66003021	To the one who overcomes I will grant the right to sit with Me on My throne , just as I myself overcame and sat down with My Father on His throne .
66003022	He who has an ear , let him hear what the Ruach is saying to Messiah’s communities . ”
66004001	After these things I looked , and behold , there was a door was standing open in heaven . And the first voice , which I had heard speaking with me like a trumpet , said , “ Come up here , and I will show you what must take place after these things . ”
66004002	Immediately I was in the Ruach ; and behold , a throne was standing in heaven , and One seated on the throne .
66004003	And the One who was seated was like jasper and carnelian in appearance , and a rainbow around the throne , like an emerald in appearance .
66004004	Around the throne were twenty-four thrones , and seated on the thrones were twenty-four elders dressed in white clothes with golden crowns on their heads .
66004005	And out from the throne come flashes of lightning and rumblings and clashes of thunder — and seven torches of fire burning before the throne , which are the seven spirits of God .
66004006	And before the throne was something like a sea of glass , like crystal . In the middle of the throne and around it were four living creatures , full of eyes in front and behind .
66004007	The first living creature was like a lion , the second living creature was like an ox , the third living creature had a face like a man , and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle .
66004008	The four living creatures , each having six wings , were full of eyes all around and within . They do not rest day or night , chanting , “ Kadosh , kadosh , kadosh Adonai Elohei-Tzva’ot , asher haya v’hoveh v’yavo ! Holy , holy , holy is the Lord God of Hosts , who was and who is and who is to come ! ”
66004009	And whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to the One seated on the throne , who lives forever and ever ,
66004010	the twenty-four elders fall down before the One seated on the throne and worship Him who lives forever and ever . And they throw their crowns down before the throne , chanting ,
66004011	“ Worthy are You , our Lord and God , to receive glory and honor and power , For You created all things , and because of Your will they existed and were created ! ”
66005001	And I saw in the right hand of the One seated upon the throne a scroll , written on both the front and the back , sealed with seven seals .
66005002	I also saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice , “ Who is worthy to open the scroll and to break its seals ? ”
66005003	No one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it .
66005004	I began to weep loudly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it .
66005005	Then one of the elders tells me , “ Stop weeping ! Behold , the Lion of the tribe of Judah , the Root of David , has triumphed — He is worthy to open the scroll and its seven seals . ”
66005006	And in the midst of the throne and the four living creatures , and in the midst of the elders , I saw a Lamb standing , as having been slain — having seven horns and seven eyes , which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth .
66005007	He came and took the scroll from the right hand of the One seated on the throne .
66005008	When He had taken the scroll , the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb , each holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense — which are the prayers of the kedoshim .
66005009	And they are singing a new song , saying , “ You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals . For You were slain , and by Your blood You redeemed for God those from every tribe and tongue and people and nation .
66005010	You have made them for our God a kingdom and kohanim , and they shall reign upon the earth . ”
66005011	Then I looked , and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders — their number was myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands .
66005012	They were chanting with a loud voice , “ Worthy is the Lamb who was slain , to receive power and riches and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing ! ” And I heard every creature in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea and everything in them , responding , “ To the One seated on the throne and to the Lamb be blessing and honor and glory and power forever and ever ! ”
66005014	And the four living creatures kept saying , “ Amen ! ” And the elders fell down and worshiped .
66006001	Then I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals , and I heard one of the four living creatures say with a voice like thunder , “ Come ! ”
66006002	I looked , and behold , there was a white horse . The one riding on it had a bow , and a crown was given to him . He went out as a conqueror so he might conquer .
66006003	When the Lamb opened the second seal , I heard the second living creature saying , “ Come ! ”
66006004	Then another horse came out , fiery red . The one riding on it was permitted to take peace from the earth , so that people would slaughter one another . He was given a great sword .
66006005	When the Lamb opened the third seal , I heard the third living creature saying , “ Come ! ” And behold , I saw a black horse . The one riding on it held a balance scale in his hand .
66006006	Then I heard something like a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying , “ A quart of wheat for a denarius , and three quarts of barley for a denarius — but do no harm to the oil and wine ! ”
66006007	When the Lamb opened the fourth seal , I heard the fourth living creature saying , “ Come ! ”
66006008	Behold , I saw a horse , pale greenish gray . The name of the one riding on it was Death , and Sheol was following with him . Authority was given to them over a fourth of the earth , to kill by sword and by famine and by plague and by the wild beasts of the earth .
66006009	When the Lamb opened the fifth seal , I saw under the altar the souls of those slaughtered for the sake of the word of God and for the witness they had .
66006010	And they cried out with a loud voice , saying , “ O Sovereign Master , holy and true , how long before You judge those who dwell on the earth and avenge our blood ? ”
66006011	Then a white robe was given to each of them , and they were told to rest a little while longer , until the number of their fellow servants was complete — their brethren who were to be killed as they had been .
66006012	I saw when the Lamb opened the sixth seal , and there was a great earthquake . The sun became as black as sackcloth made of goat’s hair , and the full moon became like blood .
66006013	The stars of heaven fell to the earth like a fig tree drops unripe figs when shaken by a great wind .
66006014	The heaven ripped apart like a scroll being rolled up , and every mountain and island was moved from their places .
66006015	Then the kings of the earth and the great men and the military commanders and the rich and the mighty and everyone — slave and free — hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains .
66006016	And they tell the mountains and the rocks , “ Fall on us , and hide us from the face of the One seated on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb .
66006017	For the great day of their wrath has come , and who is able to stand ? ”
66007001	After this , I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth , holding back the four winds of the earth so that no wind would blow on the earth or on the sea or against any tree .
66007002	Then I saw another angel coming up from the east , having the seal of the living God . He cried out with a loud voice to the four angels who were permitted to harm the earth and the sea ,
66007003	saying , “ Do no harm to the earth or the sea or the trees , until we have put a seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God . ”
66007004	Now I heard the number of those marked with the seal : 144,000 from every tribe of B’nei-Israel —
66007005	12,000 from the tribe of Judah ; 12,000 from the tribe of Reuben ; 12,000 from the tribe of Gad ;
66007006	12,000 from the tribe of Asher ; 12,000 from the tribe of Naphtali ; 12,000 from the tribe of Manasseh ;
66007007	12,000 from the tribe of Simeon ; 12,000 from the tribe of Levi ; 12,000 from the tribe of Issachar ;
66007008	12,000 from the tribe of Zebulun ; 12,000 from the tribe of Joseph ; 12,000 from the tribe of Benjamin .
66007009	After these things I looked , and behold , a vast multitude that no one could count — from every nation and all tribes and peoples and tongues — was standing before the throne and before the Lamb . They were clothed in white robes , with palm branches in their hands
66007010	and crying out with a loud voice , saying , “ Salvation belongs to our God , who sits on the throne , and to the Lamb ! ”
66007011	And all the angels were standing around the throne , along with the elders and the four living creatures ; and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God ,
66007012	saying , “ Amen , blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might belong to our God forever and ever . Amen ! ”
66007013	Then one of the elders answered , saying to me , “ Who are these dressed in white robes , and where have they come from ? ”
66007014	I said to him , “ Sir , you know . ” Then he said to me , “ These are the ones coming out of the great tribulation . They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb .
66007015	For this reason , they are before the throne of God , and they serve Him day and night in His Temple . The One seated on the throne will shelter them .
66007016	They shall never again go hungry , nor thirst anymore ; the sun shall not beat down on them , nor any scorching heat .
66007017	For the Lamb in the midst of the throne shall shepherd them and guide them to springs of living water , and God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes . ”
66008001	Now when the Lamb opened the seventh seal , there was silence in heaven for about half an hour .
66008002	Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God , and seven trumpets were given to them .
66008003	Another angel came and stood at the altar , holding a golden incense burner . He was given much incense to offer up along with the prayers of all the kedoshim upon the golden altar before the throne .
66008004	And the smoke of the incense , with the prayers of the kedoshim , rose before God from the angel’s hand .
66008005	Then the angel took the incense burner and filled it with fire from the altar , and threw it to the earth ; and there were clashes of thunder and rumblings and flashes of lightning and earthquakes .
66008006	Then the seven angels holding the seven trumpets prepared to sound them .
66008007	The first trumpeted , and there was hail and fire mixed with blood , and they were thrown upon the earth . A third of the earth burned up , a third of the trees burned up , and all the green grass burned up .
66008008	The second angel trumpeted , and something like a huge mountain ablaze with fire was thrown into the sea . A third of the sea turned into blood ,
66008009	a third of the creatures living in the sea died , and a third of the ships were destroyed .
66008010	The third angel trumpeted , and a great star fell from the heavens , burning like a torch . It fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water .
66008011	Now the name of the star is Wormwood ; and a third of the waters became wormwood , and many people died from the waters that were made bitter .
66008012	The fourth angel trumpeted , and a third of the sun and a third of the moon and a third of the stars were struck , so that a third of them were darkened . A third of the day would not shine , as well as a third of the night .
66008013	Then I looked , and I heard an eagle crying out with a loud voice as it flew high in the sky , saying , “ Woe , woe , woe to those who dwell on the earth , because of the remaining blasts of the trumpets the three angels are about to sound ! ”
66009001	Then the fifth angel trumpeted , and I saw a star that had fallen from heaven to earth . The key to the bottomless pit was given to him .
66009002	He opened the pit , and smoke rose from the pit like the smoke of a gigantic furnace . The sun and the air were darkened by the smoke from the pit .
66009003	Then from the smoke came locusts upon the earth , and power was given to them like the scorpions have power over the earth .
66009004	They were told to do no harm to the grass of the earth or any green plant or any tree , but only the people who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads .
66009005	And they were permitted not to kill them , but to torment them for five months — and their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it stings a person .
66009006	In those days , people will seek death but will not find it ; they will long to die , but death will flee from them .
66009007	Now the appearance of the locusts was like horses prepared for battle . On their heads were something like crowns of gold , and their faces were like human faces .
66009008	They had hair was like women's hair , and their teeth were like those of lions .
66009009	They had chests like iron breastplates ; and the noise of their wings was like the noise of many horse-drawn chariots rushing into battle .
66009010	They have tails like scorpions with stingers ; and in their tails is their power to harm people for five months .
66009011	They have as king over them the angel of the abyss . His name in Hebrew is Abaddon , and in Greek he has the name Apollyon .
66009012	The first woe is past . Behold , two woes are still coming after these things .
66009013	The sixth angel trumpeted , and I heard a single voice from the four horns of the golden altar before God .
66009014	It said to the sixth angel , the one holding the trumpet , “ Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates . ”
66009015	So the four angels — who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year — were released to kill a third of mankind .
66009016	The number of mounted troops was two hundred million — I heard their number .
66009017	Now here is how I saw the horses and those riding on them : they had breastplates that were fiery red , hyacinth blue , and sulfur yellow . The heads of the horses were as heads of lions , and out of their mouths came fire and smoke and brimstone .
66009018	By these three plagues a third of mankind was killed — by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone that came out of their mouths .
66009019	For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails ; for their tails are like serpents , having heads by which they inflict injuries .
66009020	But the rest of mankind , those not killed by these plagues , did not repent and turn away from the works of their hands — they would not stop worshiping demons and the idols of gold and silver and stone and wood , which cannot see or hear or walk .
66009021	And they did not repent and turn away from their murders or their sorceries or their sexual immorality or their stealing .
66010001	Then I saw another powerful angel coming down from heaven , wrapped in a cloud with a rainbow over his head . His face was like the sun and his feet like pillars of fire .
66010002	He had in his hand a little scroll that was open . He set his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land ,
66010003	and he cried out with a loud voice , just as a lion roars . When he cried out , the seven thunders spoke .
66010004	And when the seven thunders had spoken , I was about to write ; but I heard a voice from heaven saying , “ Seal up what the seven thunders have said . Do not write it down ! ”
66010005	Then the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand toward heaven
66010006	and swore by the One who lives forever and ever , who created heaven and what is in it , the earth and what is in it , the sea and what is in it , that there would be no more delay .
66010007	But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel — when he is about to trumpet — the mystery of God is completed , just as He declared to His servants the prophets .
66010008	Then the voice that I heard from heaven spoke to me again , saying , “ Go , take the scroll that is open in the hand of the angel standing on the sea and on the land . ”
66010009	So I went to the angel , telling him to give me the little scroll . And he tells me , “ Take and eat it . It will be bitter to your stomach , but sweet as honey in your mouth . ”
66010010	So I took the little scroll from the angel’s hand and ate it . It was sweet as honey in my mouth ; but when I had swallowed it , my stomach was made bitter .
66010011	And they tell me , “ You must prophesy again about many peoples and nations and tongues and kings . ”
66011001	Then a measuring rod like a staff was given to me , saying , “ Get up and measure the Temple of God and the altar , and count those worshiping in it .
66011002	But do not measure the court outside the Temple — leave it out , because it has been given to the nations , and they shall trample the holy city for forty-two months .
66011003	And I will grant authority to My two witnesses and they will prophesy for 1260 days , dressed in sackcloth . ”
66011004	These are the two olive trees and the two menorahs that are standing before the Lord of the earth .
66011005	If anyone wishes to harm them , fire comes out of their mouths and consumes their enemies . If anyone wants to harm them , he must be killed in this way .
66011006	These two have the power to shut the heavens , so that no rain may fall during the days of their prophesying . And they have power over the waters to turn them into blood , and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they wish .
66011007	When they have finished their testimony , the beast that rises from the abyss will make war on them , and overcome them and kill them .
66011008	And their corpses will lie in the open street of the great city that figuratively is called Sodom and Egypt — where also their Lord was crucified .
66011009	Some from the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations will look at their corpses for three and a half days , not allowing them to be placed into a grave .
66011010	Those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them . They will celebrate and send gifts to one another , because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth .
66011011	But after the three and a half days , the breath of life from God entered them , and they stood up on their feet ; and great fear fell on those who were watching them .
66011012	Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them , “ Come up here ! ” And they went up to heaven in a cloud , while their enemies watched them .
66011013	At that hour there was a great earthquake , and a tenth of the city collapsed . Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake , and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven .
66011014	The second woe is past . The third woe is coming soon .
66011015	Then the seventh angel trumpeted , and there were loud voices in heaven saying , “ The kingdom of this world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Anointed One . And He shall reign forever and ever ! ”
66011016	And the twenty-four elders seated on their thrones before God fell on their faces and worshiped God ,
66011017	saying , “ We thank you , Adonai Elohei-Tzva’ot , who is and who was , because You have taken Your great power and begun to reign .
66011018	The nations were enraged , but Your wrath has come and the time for the dead to be judged — to reward Your servants , the prophets and kedoshim , and those who fear Your name , the small and the great , and to destroy the destroyers of the earth . ”
66011019	Then the Temple of God in heaven was opened , and the Ark of His Covenant appeared in His Temple . And there were flashes of lightning and rumblings and clashes of thunder and an earthquake and heavy hail .
66012001	A great sign appeared in heaven : a woman clothed with the sun , with the moon under her feet , and on her head a crown of twelve stars .
66012002	She is pregnant — crying out in birth pains , in agony to give birth .
66012003	Then another sign appeared in heaven : a great fiery red dragon that had seven heads and ten horns , and seven royal crowns on his heads .
66012004	His tail sweeps away a third of the stars of heaven — it hurled them to the earth . Now the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth , so that whenever she gave birth he might devour her child .
66012005	And she gave birth to a son , a male child , who is to rule all the nations with an iron rod . And her child was snatched away to God and to His throne .
66012006	Then the woman fled into the wilderness , where she has a place prepared by God so they might take care of her for 1260 days .
66012007	And war broke out in heaven , Michael and his angels making war against the dragon . The dragon and his angels fought ,
66012008	but they were not strong enough , and there was no longer any place for them in heaven .
66012009	And the great dragon was thrown down — the ancient serpent , called the devil and satan , who deceives the whole world . He was thrown down to the earth , and his angels were thrown down with him .
66012010	Then I heard a loud voice in heaven saying , “ Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Anointed One , for the accuser of our brethren — the one who accuses them before our God day and night — has been thrown out .
66012011	They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony , and they did not love their lives even in the face of death .
66012012	Therefore rejoice , O heavens , and you who dwell in them ! Woe to the earth and the sea , for the devil has come down to you with great rage , knowing that his time is short .
66012013	Now when the dragon saw that he had been thrown to the earth , he stalked the woman who had given birth to the male child .
66012014	But the woman was given two wings of the great eagle , so that she might fly away from the presence of the serpent into the wilderness , to the place where she is taken care of — for a time , times , and half a time .
66012015	And from out of his mouth , the serpent spewed water like a river after the woman , in order to sweep her away with a flood .
66012016	But the earth came to the aid of the woman . The earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river that the dragon had spewed from his mouth .
66012017	So the dragon became enraged at the woman and went off to make war with the rest of her offspring — those who keep the commandments of God and hold to the testimony of Yeshua .
66013001	And he stood on the shore of the sea . Then I saw a beast rising out of the sea , that had ten horns and seven heads . On his horns were ten royal crowns , and upon his heads were slanderous names .
66013002	Now the beast that I saw was like a leopard , his feet like a lion’s , and his mouth like a bear’s . And the dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority .
66013003	One of his heads seemed to have been slain , but the fatal wound was healed . The whole earth was amazed and followed the beast .
66013004	And they worshiped the dragon , because he had given authority to the beast . They also worshiped the beast , chanting , “ Who is like the beast , and who can make war against him ? ”
66013005	The beast was given a mouth uttering great boasts and blasphemies . It was given authority to act for forty-two months .
66013006	Then he opened his mouth with blasphemies against God , to slander His name and His tabernacle — that is , those dwelling in heaven .
66013007	He was also permitted to make war against the kedoshim and overcome them , and he was given authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation .
66013008	All who dwell on the earth shall worship him — everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the Book of Life of the Lamb who was slain .
66013009	If anyone has an ear , let him hear .
66013010	If anyone is meant for captivity , to captivity he goes . If anyone is to be killed by the sword , by the sword he must be killed . Here is the perseverance and faith of the kedoshim .
66013011	Then I saw another beast rising out of the earth . He had two horns like a lamb and spoke like a dragon .
66013012	He exercises all the authority of the first beast before him , and he makes the earth and all those who dwell in it worship the first beast , whose fatal wound was healed .
66013013	He performs great signs , even making fire come down from heaven in the sight of men .
66013014	And he deceives those who dwell on the earth through the signs he is permitted to perform , telling those who dwell on the earth to make an image in honor of the beast who has the sword wound yet lived .
66013015	The second beast was permitted to give life to the image of the first beast , so that the image of the beast could even speak and cause all who would not worship the image of the beast to be killed .
66013016	He also causes all — the small and the great , the rich and the poor , the free and the slave — to receive a mark on their right hand or upon their forehead .
66013017	And so no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark — either the name of the beast or the number of his name .
66013018	Here is wisdom : let the one who has understanding calculate the number of the beast , for it is a number of a man , and his number is 666 .
66014001	Then I looked , and behold , the Lamb was standing on Mount Zion , and with Him were 144,000 who had His name and His Father’s name written on their foreheads .
66014002	And I heard a voice from heaven like the roar of rushing waters and the booming of loud thunder . The voice I heard was like harpists playing on their harps .
66014003	And they are singing a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders ; and no one is able to learn the song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth .
66014004	These are the ones who have not defiled themselves with women , for they are virgins . These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever He goes . These have been redeemed from among mankind as firstfruits for God and the Lamb .
66014005	And in their mouth was found no lie — they are blameless .
66014006	And then I saw another angel flying high in the sky , having a timeless message of good news to proclaim to those who dwell on the earth — to every nation and tribe and tongue and people .
66014007	He said in a loud voice , “ Fear God and give Him glory , because the hour of His judgment has come . Worship the One who made heaven and earth and sea and springs of water . ”
66014008	Another angel , a second one , followed , saying , “ Fallen , fallen , is Babylon the great — she who made all nations drink of the wine of the fury of her immorality . ”
66014009	And another angel , a third one , followed them , saying in a loud voice , “ If anyone worships the beast and his image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand ,
66014010	he shall also drink the wine of God’s fury , poured full strength into the cup of His wrath . And he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone before the holy angels and before the Lamb .
66014011	The smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever . Those who worship the beast and its image and those who receive the mark of his name have no rest day or night . ”
66014012	Here is the perseverance of the kedoshim — those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Yeshua .
66014013	Then I heard a voice from heaven saying , “ Write : How fortunate are the dead — those who die in the Lord from now on ! ” “ Yes , ” says the Ruach , “ that they may rest from their labors , for their deeds follow them . ”
66014014	Then I looked , and behold , there was a white cloud — and seated on the cloud was one like a son of man . He had a golden crown on His head and a sharp sickle in His hand .
66014015	Then another angel came out of the Temple , crying out with a loud voice to the One seated on the cloud , “ Put in your sickle and reap , for the hour to reap has come , because the harvest of the earth is fully ripe . ”
66014016	So the One seated on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth , and the earth was harvested .
66014017	Then another angel came out of the Temple in heaven , and he also had a sharp sickle .
66014018	Then another angel — the one who has authority over fire — came out from the altar ; and he called out with a loud voice to the one holding the sharp sickle , saying , “ Put in your sickle and gather the grape clusters from the vineyard of the earth , because her grapes are ripe . ”
66014019	So the angel swung his sickle over the earth and gathered the clusters from the vineyard of the earth and threw them into the great winepress of the wrath of God .
66014020	And the winepress was stomped on outside the city , and blood flowed from the winepress as high as a horse’s bridle for 1600 stadia .
66015001	Then I saw another great and wonderful sign in heaven : seven angels who have seven plagues — the last ones , for with them God’s wrath is finished .
66015002	And I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire , and those who had overcome the beast and his image and the number of his name standing by the sea of glass , holding the harps of God .
66015003	And they are singing the song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the Lamb , saying , “ Great and wonderful are Your deeds , Adonai Elohei-Tzva’ot ! Just and true are Your ways , O King of the nations !
66015004	Who shall not fear and glorify Your name , O Lord ? For You alone are Holy . All the nations shall come and worship before You , for Your righteous acts have been revealed ! ”
66015005	After these things I looked , and the Temple of the Tent of Witness in heaven was opened .
66015006	Out of the Temple came the seven angels having the seven plagues , dressed in pure bright linen and wearing wide gold sashes around their chests .
66015007	Then one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God , who lives forever and ever .
66015008	And the Temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from His power . No one was able to enter the Temple until the seven angels’ seven plagues were finished .
66016001	Then I heard a loud voice from the Temple saying to the seven angels , “ Go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of God’s wrath . ”
66016002	So the first angel went and poured out his bowl on the earth , and foul and painful boils came upon the people having the mark of the beast and worshiping his image .
66016003	Next the second angel poured out his bowl into the sea , and it became blood like that of a corpse ; and every living thing in the sea died .
66016004	Then the third angel poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of water , and they became blood .
66016005	Then I heard the angel of the waters saying , “ Righteous are You — the Holy One , who is and who was — because You have passed these judgments .
66016006	For they have poured out the blood of kedoshim and prophets , and You have given them blood to drink — they are deserving ! ”
66016007	Then I heard the altar saying , “ Yes , Adonai Elohei-Tzva’ot , true and righteous are Your judgments ! ”
66016008	The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun , and it was permitted to scorch people with fire .
66016009	People were scorched with fierce heat , and they cursed the name of God — the One who has power over these plagues . But they did not repent , to give Him glory .
66016010	Then the fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast , and his kingdom was plunged into darkness . People gnawed their tongues in pain
66016011	and cursed the God of heaven because of their pains and their boils . But they did not repent of their deeds .
66016012	The sixth angel poured out his bowl over the great river Euphrates ; and its water was dried up , to prepare the way for the kings from the east .
66016013	Then I saw — coming from the dragon’s mouth and from the beast’s mouth and from the false prophet’s mouth — three unclean spirits like frogs .
66016014	For they are demonic spirits performing miraculous signs , who go out to the kings of the whole world — to gather them for battle on the great Day of Elohei Tzva’ot .
66016015	“ Behold , I am coming like a thief ! How fortunate is the one who stays alert and keeps his clothes on , lest he walk around naked and they see his shamefulness . ”
66016016	Then the spirits gathered the kings to the place called in Hebrew Har-Megiddo .
66016017	The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air . A loud voice came out of the Temple from the throne , saying , “ It is done ! ”
66016018	And there were flashes of lightning and rumblings and clashes of thunder and a great earthquake — such as never happened since mankind has been on the earth , so mighty was the quake .
66016019	Then the great city was split into three parts , and the cities of the nations collapsed . Babylon the great was remembered before God , to force her to drink the cup of the wine of His furious wrath .
66016020	Every island fled away , and no mountains were to be found .
66016021	Enormous hail — about a hundred pounds each — falls from heaven on the people . And the people cursed God because of the plague of hail — so extreme was that plague .
66017001	Then one of the seven angels holding the seven bowls came and spoke with me , saying , “ Come , I will show you the sentencing of the great prostitute , who sits on many waters .
66017002	The earth’s kings committed sexual immorality with her , and those who dwell on the earth got drunk with the wine of her immorality . ”
66017003	So he carried me away in the Ruach into a wilderness , and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was full of blasphemous names and had seven heads and ten horns .
66017004	The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet , and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls . She was holding a golden cup in her hand full of detestable things and the filth of her immorality ,
66017005	and on her forehead was written a name , a mystery : “ Babylon the Great , the mother of prostitutes and the detestable things of the earth . ”
66017006	And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the kedoshim and with the blood of the witnesses of Yeshua . When I saw her , I was totally astounded .
66017007	But the angel said to me , “ Why are you astonished ? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her , which has the seven heads and ten horns .
66017008	The beast that you saw was , and is not , and yet is about to rise up from the abyss and head for destruction . Those who dwell on the earth — whose names have not been written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world — will be astonished when they see the beast , because he was and is not and is to come .
66017009	“ This calls for a mind having wisdom . The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated . They are also seven kings —
66017010	five have fallen , one is , the other has not yet come ; and when he comes , he must remain a little while .
66017011	The beast that was and is not — he himself is the eighth , and is one of the seven , and is heading for destruction .
66017012	The ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received royal power , but receive authority as kings with the beast for one hour .
66017013	These kings are of one mind , and they give their power and authority to the beast .
66017014	They will make war against the Lamb , and the Lamb will overcome them — because He is Lord of lords and King of kings , and those with Him are called and chosen and faithful . ”
66017015	Then he tells me , “ The waters that you saw , where the prostitute is seated , are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues .
66017016	The ten horns that you saw , and the beast — these will hate the prostitute . They will make her desolate and naked , and devour her flesh and burn her up with fire .
66017017	For God has put it into their hearts to do His will , and to be of one mind , and to give their royal power to the beast until the words of God are fulfilled .
66017018	And the woman that you saw is the great city exercising kingship over the kings of the earth . ”
66018001	After these things , I saw another angel coming down from heaven , having great authority , and the earth was illuminated by his glory .
66018002	He cried out with a mighty voice , saying : “ Fallen , fallen is Babylon the great ! She has become a den for demons , a haunt for every unclean spirit and for every unclean bird and for every unclean and detestable beast .
66018003	For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the fury of her immorality . The kings of the earth have committed sexual immorality with her , and the merchants of the earth grew rich off the power of her self-indulgence . ”
66018004	Then I heard another voice from heaven saying , “ Come out of her , my people , lest you participate in her sins and receive her plagues !
66018005	For her sins have piled up to heaven , and God has remembered her crimes .
66018006	Pay her back just as she has paid out , and give her back double for her deeds ! In the cup she has mixed — mix a double dose for her !
66018007	As she has exalted herself and indulged herself in luxury , so give her the same measure of torment and grief ! For in her heart she says , ‘ I sit as a queen — I am no widow ; I shall never see grief . ’
66018008	For this reason her plagues will arrive in a single day — death and grief and famine — and she shall be burned down with fire . For mighty is Adonai Elohim who judges her ! ”
66018009	Then the kings of the earth , who committed sexual immorality and indulged in luxury with her shall weep and wail over her when they see the smoke of her burning —
66018010	standing far off because of the terror of her torment , saying : “ Alas , alas , O great city — O Babylon , the mighty city ! For in a single hour your judgment has come ! ”
66018011	And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn for her , because no one buys their merchandise anymore —
66018012	shipments of gold , silver , precious stones , and pearls ; fine linen , purple , silk , and scarlet ; all kinds of citron wood ; all kinds of ivory products ; all kinds of products made of costly wood , bronze , iron , and marble ;
66018013	cinnamon , spice , incense , myrrh , and frankincense ; wine , oil , fine flour , and wheat ; cattle , sheep , horses , and chariots ; and slaves — that is , human souls .
66018014	The fruit of your soul’s desire has gone from you , and all the expensive and beautiful things are lost to you — never again will people find them .
66018015	The merchants of these things , who became rich from her , shall stand far off for fear of her torment , weeping and mourning ,
66018016	saying , “ Alas , alas , O great city — clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet , adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls !
66018017	For in a single hour so much wealth has been ruined ! ” And every ship captain and passenger , sailors and all who make their living at sea , stood at a distance
66018018	and were crying out , seeing the smoke of her burning , saying , ‘ What city is like the great city ? ’
66018019	And they threw dust on their heads and were crying out , weeping and mourning , “ Alas , alas , O great city — in her all who had ships at sea grew rich from her wealth ! For in a single hour has she been ruined !
66018020	Rejoice over her , O heaven , and you kedoshim , shlichim and prophets ! For God has judged her condemnation of you ! ”
66018021	Then a mighty angel picked up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea , saying : “ So shall Babylon , the great city , be thrown down with violence , never to be found again !
66018022	And the sound of harpists and musicians , flautists and trumpeters , shall never be heard in you again ! And the craftsman of any craft shall never be found in you again ! And the sound of a mill shall never be heard in you again !
66018023	And the light of a lamp shall never shine in you again ! And the voice of the bridegroom and bride shall never be heard in you again ! For your businessmen were the tycoons of the world , for all the nations were deceived by your sorcery !
66018024	And in her was found the blood of the prophets and kedoshim and all those slaughtered on the earth . ”
66019001	After these things , I heard something like the loud voice of a great multitude in heaven , shouting : “ Hallelujah ! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God .
66019002	For His judgments are true and just . For He has judged the great prostitute who corrupted the earth with her whoring , and has avenged the blood of His servants caused by her hand . ”
66019003	And a second time they shouted , “ Hallelujah ! The smoke from her goes up forever and ever ! ” Then the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who is seated on the throne , saying , “ Amen ! Hallelujah ! ”
66019005	Then a voice came from the throne , saying : “ Praise our God , all you His servants and all who fear Him , both the small and the great ! ”
66019006	Then I heard something like the voice of a great multitude — like the roar of rushing waters or like the rumbling of powerful thunder — saying , “ Hallelujah ! For Adonai Elohei-Tzva’ot reigns !
66019007	Let us rejoice and be glad and give the glory to Him ! For the wedding of the Lamb has come , and His bride has made herself ready ,
66019008	She was given fine linen to wear , bright and clean ! For the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the kedoshim . ”
66019009	Then the angel tells me , “ Write : How fortunate are those who have been invited to the wedding banquet of the Lamb ! ” He also tells me , “ These are the true words of God . ”
66019010	Then I fell down at his feet and worshiped him . But he said to me , “ See that you do not do that — for I am only a fellow servant with you and your brethren who hold to the testimony of Yeshua . Worship God ! For the testimony of Yeshua is the Ruach Nevuah . ”
66019011	Then I saw heaven opened , and behold , a white horse ! The One riding on it is called Faithful and True , and He judges and makes war in righteousness .
66019012	His eyes are like a flame of fire , and many royal crowns are on His head . He has a name written that no one knows except Himself .
66019013	He is clothed in a robe dipped in blood , and the name by which He is called is “ the Word of God . ”
66019014	And the armies of heaven , clothed in fine linen , white and clean , were following Him on white horses .
66019015	From His mouth comes a sharp sword — so that with it He may strike down the nations — and He shall rule them with an iron rod , and He treads the winepress of the furious wrath of Elohei-Tzva’ot .
66019016	On His robe and on His thigh He has a name written , “ King of kings , and Lord of lords . ”
66019017	Then I saw a single angel standing in the sun , and with a loud voice he cried out to all the birds flying high in the sky , “ Come , gather for the great banquet of God —
66019018	to eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of generals and the flesh of mighty men , the flesh of horses and those riding on them , the flesh of all men , both free and slave , both small and great ! ”
66019019	Also I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war against the One who sat on the horse and against His army .
66019020	Then the beast was captured , and along with him the false prophet who had performed the signs before him by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast , as well as those who had worshiped his image . These two were thrown alive into the lake of fire burning with brimstone .
66019021	The rest were killed with the sword coming out of the mouth of the One riding on the horse . And all the birds gorged themselves with their flesh .
66020001	Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven , holding in his hand the key to the abyss and a great chain .
66020002	He seized the dragon — the ancient serpent , who is the devil and satan — and bound him for a thousand years .
66020003	He also threw him into the abyss and locked and sealed it over him , so that he would not deceive the nations any longer , until the thousand years were completed . After these things , he must be released for a short while .
66020004	Then I saw thrones , and people sat upon them — those to whom authority to judge was given . And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony for Yeshua and because of the word of God . They had not worshiped the beast or his image , nor had they received his mark on their forehead or on their hand . And they came to life and reigned with the Messiah for a thousand years .
66020005	The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were completed . This is the first resurrection .
66020006	How fortunate and holy is the one who has a share in the first resurrection ! Over such the second death has no authority , but they shall be kohanim of God and the Messiah , and they shall reign with Him for a thousand years .
66020007	When the thousand years has ended , satan shall be released from his prison ,
66020008	and he shall come out to deceive the nations at the four corners of the earth , Gog and Magog , to gather them for the battle . Their number is like the sand of the sea .
66020009	And they came up on the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the kedoshim and the beloved city — but fire fell from heaven and consumed them .
66020010	And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone , where the beast and the false prophet are too , and they shall be tortured day and night forever and ever .
66020011	Then I saw a great white throne , and the One seated on it . The earth and heaven fled from His presence , but no place was found for them .
66020012	And I saw the dead — the great and the small — standing before the throne . The books were opened , and another book was opened — the Book of Life . And the dead were judged according to what was written in the books , according to their deeds .
66020013	The sea gave up the dead that were in it , and death and Sheol gave up the dead in them . Then they were each judged , each one of them , according to their deeds .
66020014	Then death and Sheol were thrown into the lake of fire . This is the second death — the lake of fire .
66020015	And if anyone was not found written in the Book of Life , he was thrown into the lake of fire .
66021001	Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth ; for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away , and the sea was no more .
66021002	I also saw the holy city — the New Jerusalem — coming down out of heaven from God , prepared as a bride adorned for her husband .
66021003	I also heard a loud voice from the throne , saying , “ Behold , the dwelling of God is among men , and He shall tabernacle among them . They shall be His people , and God Himself shall be among them and be their God .
66021004	He shall wipe away every tear from their eyes , and death shall be no more . Nor shall there be mourning or crying or pain any longer , for the former things have passed away . ”
66021005	And the One seated upon the throne said , “ Behold , I am making all things new ! ” Then He said , “ Write , for these words are trustworthy and true . ”
66021006	Then He said to me , “ It is done ! I am the Alpha and the Omega , the Beginning and the End . To the thirsty I will freely give from the spring of the water of life .
66021007	The one who overcomes shall inherit these things , and I will be his God and he shall be My son .
66021008	But for the cowardly and faithless and detestable and murderers and sexually immoral and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars — their lot is in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone , which is the second death . ”
66021009	Then came one of the seven angels holding the seven bowls full of the seven final plagues , and he spoke with me , saying , “ Come , I will show you the bride , the wife of the Lamb . ”
66021010	Then he carried me away in the Ruach to a great and high mountain , and he showed me the holy city , Jerusalem , coming down out of heaven from God ,
66021011	having the glory of God — her radiance like a most precious stone , like a jasper , sparkling like crystal .
66021012	She had a great , high wall , with twelve gates , and above the gates twelve angels . On the gates were inscribed the names of the twelve tribes of B’nei-Israel —
66021013	three gates on the east , three gates on the north , three gates on the south , and three gates on the west .
66021014	And the wall of the city had twelve foundations , and on them the twelve names of the twelve shlichim of the Lamb .
66021015	The angel speaking with me had a gold measuring rod to measure the city and its gates and walls .
66021016	The city is laid out as a square — its length the same as its width . He measured the city with the rod — 12,000 stadia . Its length and width and height are equal .
66021017	He also measured its wall — 144 cubits by human measurement , which is also an angel’s measurement .
66021018	The material of the city’s wall was jasper , while the city was pure gold , clear as glass .
66021019	The foundations of the city wall were decorated with every kind of precious stone — the first foundation was jasper ; the second , sapphire ; the third , chalcedony ; the fourth , emerald ;
66021020	the fifth , sardonyx ; the sixth , carnelian ; the seventh , yellow topaz ; the eighth ; beryl ; the ninth , topaz ; the tenth , chrysoprase ; the eleventh , jacinth ; the twelfth , amethyst .
66021021	And the twelve gates were twelve pearls — each of the gates was from a single pearl . And the street of the city was pure gold , transparent as glass .
66021022	I saw no temple in her , for its Temple is Adonai Elohei-Tzva’ot and the Lamb .
66021023	And the city has no need for the sun or the moon to shine on it , for the glory of God lights it up , and its lamp is the Lamb .
66021024	The nations shall walk by its light , and the kings of the earth bring their glory into it .
66021025	Its gates shall never be shut by day , for there shall be no night there !
66021026	And they shall bring into it the glory and honor of the nations .
66021027	And nothing unholy shall ever enter it , nor anyone doing what is detestable or false , but only those written in the Book of Life .
66022001	Then the angel showed me a river of the water of life — bright as crystal , flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb
66022002	down the middle of the city’s street . On either side of the river was a tree of life , bearing twelve kinds of fruit , yielding its fruit each month ; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations .
66022003	No longer will there be any curse . The throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in the city , and His servants shall serve Him .
66022004	They shall see His face , and His name shall be on their foreheads .
66022005	Night shall be no more , and people will have no need for lamplight or sunlight — for Adonai Elohim will shine on them . And they shall reign forever and ever !
66022006	He said to me , “ These words are trustworthy and true ! Adonai , the God of the spirits of the prophets , has sent His angel to show His servants what must happen soon .
66022007	Behold , I am coming soon ! How fortunate is the one who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book . ”
66022008	I , John , am the one hearing and seeing these things . And when I heard and saw them , I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel showing me these things .
66022009	But he tells me , “ See that you do not do that ! I am a fellow servant with you and your brethren the prophets and those keeping the words of this book . Worship God ! ”
66022010	Then he tells me , “ Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book , for the time is near .
66022011	Let the evildoer still do evil , and the filthy still be filthy , and the righteous still do righteousness , and the holy still be holy .
66022012	Behold , I am coming soon , and My reward is with Me , to pay back each one according to his deeds .
66022013	“ I am the Alpha and the Omega , the First and the Last , the Beginning and the End .
66022014	How fortunate are those who wash their robes , so that they may have the right to the Tree of Life and may enter through the gates into the city .
66022015	Outside are the dogs and the sorcerers and the sexually immoral and the murderers and the idolaters , and everyone who loves and practices falsehood .
66022016	I , Yeshua , have sent My angel to testify these things to you for My communities . I am the Root and the Offspring of David , the Bright and Morning Star . ”
66022017	The Ruach and the bride say , “ Come ! ” And let the one who hears say , “ Come ! ” Let the one who is thirsty come — let the one who wishes freely take the water of life !
66022018	I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book . If anyone adds to them , God shall add to him the plagues that are written in this book ;
66022019	and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy , God shall take away his share in the Tree of Life and the Holy City , which are written in this book .
66022020	The One giving testimony to these things says , “ Yes ! I am coming soon ! ” Amen ! Come , Lord Yeshua !
66022021	May the grace of the Lord Yeshua be with all !
