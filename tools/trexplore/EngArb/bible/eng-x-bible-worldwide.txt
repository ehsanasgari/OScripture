40001001	Here are the names of the people in the family line from which Jesus Christ came . He came from Davids family . He came from Abrahams family .
40001002	Jesus family line : Abraham , Isaac , Jacob , Judah , Perez ( his mother was Tamar ) , Zezron , Ram , Amminadab , Nahshon , Salmon , Boaz ( his mother was Rahab ) , Obed ( his mother was Ruth ) , Jesse , David the king , Solomon ( whose mother was Uriahs wife ) , Rehoboam , Abijah , Asa , Jehoshaphat , Joram , Uzziah , Jotham , Ahaz , Hezekiah , Manasseh , Amon , Josiah , Jeconiah and his brothers ( at the time the people of Israel were carried away to Babylon ) , Shealtiel , Zerubbabel , Abiud , Eliakim , Azor , Zadok , Achim , Eliud , Eleazor , Matthan , Jacob and Joseph who was the husband of Mary . Mary was the mother of Jesus , who is called the Christ .
40001017	There were fourteen families from Abraham to David . There were fourteen families from David to the time the people were taken to Babylon . And there were fourteen families after that until Christ was born .
40001018	This is the way Jesus Christ was born . Mary , his mother , was promised to Joseph to be his wife . But before they were married , she found out that she was going to have a baby . It was by the Holy Spirit .
40001019	Joseph , the man she was to marry , was a good man . He did not want her to be made ashamed . So he planned to leave her without telling people about it .
40001020	While he was thinking about this , he had a dream . An angel of the Lord came to him . He said , Joseph , Davids son , do not fear to take Mary to be your wife . Her baby is by the Holy Spirit .
40001021	She will have a baby son . Name him Jesus , because he will save his people from the wrong things they have done .
40001022	All of this had been told long before by the Lord through his prophet . It came true .
40001023	The prophet said , A young woman who has not slept with a man is going to have a baby son . His name will be Emmanuel . That means " God is with us . "
40001024	Joseph woke up and did what the angel of the Lord told him to do . He took Mary to be his wife .
40001025	But he did not make love with her until her first son had been born . He named him Jesus .
40002001	Jesus was born in the town of Bethlehem , in the country of Judea . Herod was the king . After Jesus was born , wise men came from the east to Jerusalem .
40002002	They asked , Where is the child who has been born to be King of the Jews ? We saw his star rising and we have come to worship him .
40002003	When King Herod heard this , he was very troubled . All the people in Jerusalem were troubled also .
40002004	He called all the chief priests and the scribes of the Jews for a meeting . He asked them , Where is the Christ to be born ?
40002005	They told him , In Bethlehem in Judea . That is what the prophet , the man of God long ago , wrote :
40002006	" Bethlehem in the country of Judah , you are not the least among the leaders in Judah . A leader will come from you who will rule over my people Israel . "
40002007	Then Herod called the wise men to talk with them secretly . He found out from them what time they saw the star .
40002008	He sent them to Bethlehem . He said , Go and ask everywhere until you find the child . When you have found him , come and tell me , so that I myself may go and worship him .
40002009	After they heard what the king said , they went away . And the star , which they had seen rising , went in front of them . It stopped above the place where the child was .
40002010	When they saw the star , they were very glad .
40002011	They went into the house , and there they saw the child and Mary his mother . They kneeled down and worshipped him . Then they opened their bags and gave him gifts . These gifts were gold , and frankincense and myrrh .
40002012	In a dream they were told not to go back to Herod . So they went home by a different road .
40002013	After the wise men had gone , Joseph had a dream . An angel of the Lord came to him and said , Get up . Take the child and his mother , and go quickly to the country of Egypt . Stay there till I tell you , because Herod will try to find the child and kill him .
40002014	Joseph woke up . He took the child and his mother in the night and went to Egypt .
40002015	He stayed there until Herod died . What the Lord told through his prophet long ago , came true . He said I called my son out of Egypt .
40002016	Herod saw that the wise men had fooled him . He was very angry . He sent men to kill all the baby boys in the town of Bethlehem and around it . They killed all the boys who were two years old or less . Herod remembered what the wise men had told him about the time they first saw the star .
40002017	So what the prophet Jeremiah said , came true .
40002018	He said , A voice could be heard in the town of Ramah . Rachel was crying for her children . She would not let anyone comfort her because her children were dead .
40002019	Herod died . Then Joseph had a dream . An angel of the Lord came to him in Egypt .
40002020	The angel said , Get up . Take the child and his mother and go to the country of Israel . The men who wanted to kill the child are dead .
40002021	Joseph woke up . He took the child and his mother and went to the country of Israel .
40002022	But he heard that Archelaus was king of Judea in his father Herods place . So he was afraid to go there . In a dream he was told what to do . He went to the country of Galilee .
40002023	He went and made his home in the town of Nazareth . The prophets of God long ago had said , He shall be called a man from Nazareth . What they said came true .
40003001	After some years had passed , John the Baptizer came and told Gods word in the desert of Judea .
40003002	He said , Stop doing wrong things and turn back to God ! The kingdom of heaven is almost here .
40003003	This is the man that Isaiah the prophet of God spoke about long ago . He said , A man is calling in the wilderness , " Make the way ready for the Lord . Make the road straight for him . "
40003004	John wore clothes made of camels hair and a leather belt . He ate locusts and wild honey .
40003005	People went to him from Jerusalem , from all of Judea , and from all the country near the Jordan River .
40003006	He baptised them in the Jordan River when they said how sorry they were for the wrong things they had done .
40003007	Many of the Pharisee group and the Sadducee group came to him to be baptised . But when he saw them , he said to them , You family of snakes ! Who told you to run away from Gods anger that is coming ?
40003008	Stop your wrong ways to show that you have turned back to God .
40003009	Do not think you can say to your-selves , " Abraham is our father . " I tell you , God can make children for Abraham from these stones .
40003010	The axe is ready to cut down the trees . Every tree that does not have good fruit is cut down and thrown into a fire .
40003011	I baptise you with water when you stop your wrong ways . But another person is coming after me . He is greater than I am . I am not good enough to take off his shoes . He will baptise you with the Holy Spirit and with fire .
40003012	He has a cleaning fan in his hand and will fan his grain very clean . He will put the grain into his storehouse . But he will burn the chaff in the fire that never dies .
40003013	Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River . He came to John to be baptised by him .
40003014	John tried to stop him . He said , I need to be baptised by you . Why do you come to me to be baptised ?
40003015	But Jesus answered , Please do it now . In this way we shall do all that is right . Then John let him be baptised .
40003016	After Jesus was baptised , he came up out of the water right away . The sky opened . He saw the Spirit of God coming down on him like a dove .
40003017	A voice from the sky said , This is my dear Son . I am very pleased with him .
40004001	Then the Spirit led Jesus into the desert . The devil tried to make Jesus do wrong .
40004002	Jesus did not eat anything for forty days and forty nights . Then he was very hungry .
40004003	The one who tries to make people do wrong came and said to him , If you are Gods Son , tell these stones to be changed into bread .
40004004	But Jesus answered him , The holy writings say , " Man cannot live on bread only . He needs to live by every word that God says . "
40004005	Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city . He put him on a high part of the temple .
40004006	The devil said to him , If you are Gods Son , jump down . The holy writings say , " God will tell his angels to take care of you . They will hold you up in their hands so that you will not knock your foot on a stone . "
40004007	Jesus answered him , The holy writings say , " You must not test the Lord your God . "
40004008	The devil took Jesus to a very high hill . He showed him all the countries of the world and how great they were .
40004009	He said to Jesus , I will give you all these if you kneel down and worship me .
40004010	But Jesus answered him , Get away , Satan . The holy writings say , " You must worship the Lord your God . and he is the only one you are to worship . "
40004011	Then the devil left Jesus . Angels came and took care of him .
40004012	Jesus heard that John was put in prison , so he went to Galilee .
40004013	He left the town of Nazareth and went to live in the town of Capernaum . It is by the sea ( of Galilee ) in the district of Zebulun and Naphtali .
40004014	So what the prophet Isaiah said came true .
40004015	He talked about , The country of Zebulun and the country of Naphtali , the road by the sea , the land on the other side of the Jordan River , Galilee where the people are not Jews .
40004016	And he said , The people who lived in darkness have seen a great Light . Light has come to those who lived in a land covered by the dark shadow of death .
40004017	From then on , Jesus began to tell Gods word to the people . He said , Stop your wrong ways and turn back to God ! The kingdom of heaven is here !
40004018	Jesus was walking by the sea of Galilee . There he saw two brothers , Simon who later was named Peter , and his brother Andrew . They were throwing a fishing net into the water . Their work was to catch fish .
40004019	Jesus said to them , Come with me . The work I will give you will be to catch people .
40004020	Right away they left their nets and went with him .
40004021	Jesus went on from there and saw two other brothers , James and John . Their fathers name was Zebedee . They were in the boat with their father mending their nets .
40004022	Jesus called them . Right away they left the boat and their father and went with him .
40004023	Jesus went all around through Galilee . He taught people in their meeting houses and told them the good news about the kingdom of heaven . He healed all the sick and weak people .
40004024	The people in all the country of Syria heard about him . They brought all who were sick in any way , or had bad spirits in them , and those who could not walk or use their hands . Jesus healed them .
40004025	Many people went with him . They came from Galilee , the Ten Towns , Jerusalem , Judea , and from the other side of the Jordan river .
40005001	When Jesus saw the many people , he went up on a hill . He sat down and his disciples came to him .
40005002	He began to teach the people .
40005003	He said , God makes happy those who know that they need him . The kingdom of heaven is for them .
40005004	God makes happy those who are sad . They will have comfort .
40005005	God makes happy those who quietly trust him and do not try to get their own way . The world will belong to them .
40005006	God makes happy those who are hungry and thirsty for what is right and good . They will be filled .
40005007	God makes happy those who are kind . He will be kind to them .
40005008	God makes happy those who have clean hearts . They will see God .
40005009	God makes happy those who make peace between people . They will be called Gods sons .
40005010	God makes happy those who have trouble for doing what is right . The kingdom of heaven is for them .
40005011	God makes you happy when people say wrong things about you , when they trouble you , and when they say all kinds of lies about you . God makes you happy when it is for my sake .
40005012	Be happy and glad because God will be good to you in heaven . In the same way people troubled the prophets before your time .
40005013	You are like salt in the world . If salt has lost its taste , how can it be made salty again ? Salt that has no taste is good for nothing . The only thing to do is to throw it out on the road .
40005014	You are like light in the world . A city built on a hill cannot be hidden .
40005015	So also with a lamp . People do not light a lamp and put it under a basket . But they put it on the place for a lamp . Then all the people in the house can see its light .
40005016	So , let your light shine to all people . Then they will see the good things you do . And they will praise your Father in heaven .
40005017	Do not think that I have come to take away the law and the writings of the prophets . No , I have not come to take them away . But I have come to do what they say must be done .
40005018	I tell you the truth . Until the sky and the earth are taken away , not one small part of the law will be taken away , until everything has been done .
40005019	So anyone who does not obey one of the smallest laws , and teaches other people not to obey it , will have the smallest part in the kingdom of heaven . But any one who obeys and teaches the law , will have a big part in the kingdom of heaven .
40005020	I tell you , you must do much better than the scribes and Pharisees . If you do not , then you will never go into the kingdom of heaven .
40005021	You have heard this said to men long ago , " Do not kill . Anyone who kills will be judged in court . "
40005022	But I tell you this . Anyone who is angry with his brother without having a good reason , will be judged in court . Anyone who says wrong things to his brother will be judged for it in the big court . Anyone who says " You fool ! " will be judged to go into hell fire .
40005023	Perhaps you are bringing your gift to God at his altar . There you remember that your brother has something against you .
40005024	If so , leave your gift there in front of the altar . First , go to your brother and make things right with him . Then come and give your gift to God .
40005025	If someone wants to take you to court , make an agreement with him quickly on the way . If you do not , he will take you to the judge . The judge will give you to the guard , and the guard will put you in prison .
40005026	I tell you the truth , you will not get out of prison until you have paid every piece of money .
40005027	You have heard that the law says , " Do not commit adultery [ have another man or woman who is not your husband or wife ] . "
40005028	But I tell you that if a man looks at a woman and he wants her , then he has already committed adultery with her in his heart .
40005029	If your right eye makes you do wrong , take it out and throw it away . It is better to lose a part of your body , than for your whole body to be thrown into hell .
40005030	If your right hand makes you do wrong , cut it off and throw it away . It is better to lose a part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell fire .
40005031	The law said , " Any man who does not want to keep his wife must give her a paper to tell others she is no longer his wife . "
40005032	But I tell you , no man may send away his wife unless she has committed adultery . If he does send her away , he is making her commit adultery . And if a man marries a woman who has been sent away from her husband , he commits adultery .
40005033	Also you have heard this said to men long ago , " You must not make a promise in Gods name and break it . " And , " You must do for the Lord what you said you would do . "
40005034	But I tell you , do not make a promise in Gods name . Do not use the name of heaven , because that is where God rules .
40005035	Do not use the name of earth , because that is where God rests his feet . Do not use the name of Jerusalem , because it is the city of the great King .
40005036	Do not make a promise by your head , because you cannot make one hair of your head white or black .
40005037	You must mean " Yes " when you say " Yes " . You must mean " No " when you say " No " . To say anything more than that is wrong .
40005038	You have heard that the law says , " Take an eye for an eye , and a tooth for a tooth . "
40005039	But I tell you , do not fight with anyone who does wrong to you . But if someone hits you on one side of your face , turn the other side to him also .
40005040	If anyone takes you to court to get your shirt , let him have your coat also .
40005041	If anyone wants you to help carry a load , go with him twice as far .
40005042	When someone asks you for something , give it to him . When someone wants to borrow something from you , let him have it .
40005043	You have heard that the law says , " Love your neighbour and hate your enemy . "
40005044	But I tell you , love your enemies . Ask God to do good to those who trouble you .
40005045	In that way you will be sons of your Father in heaven . He makes his sun shine on both wrong and good people . He lets the rain fall on people who do right and on people who do wrong .
40005046	If you love only those who love you , what reward will you get ? Even the tax collectors do that .
40005047	Do you speak to your brothers only ? If so , you are not doing any better than other people . Even people who do not believe in God do that .
40005048	You must be good in every way , as your Father in heaven is good in every way .
40006001	Do not do good things so that people will see you do them . If you do , you will get no reward from your Father in heaven .
40006002	So when you give money to poor people , do not send men in front of you to blow trumpets or horns . Some people do this in the meeting houses and on the streets so that people will praise them . They are not true to themselves . I tell you the truth . They have their pay already .
40006003	But when you give money to poor people , do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing .
40006004	In this way , what you give to the poor will be secret . Your Father sees secret things and he will reward you .
40006005	When you talk to God , do not be like people who are not true to themselves . They like to stand and talk to God in the meeting houses and at the street corners , so that people will see them . I tell you the truth . They have their reward already .
40006006	But when you talk to God , go into your room and shut the door . Then talk to your Father in secret . Your Father sees secret things and he will reward you .
40006007	And when you talk to God , do not say words that mean nothing , over and over again . People who do not believe in God do that . They think their god will hear them because they say many words .
40006008	Do not be like them . Your Father knows what you need before you ask him .
40006009	So talk to your God like this : " Our Father in heaven , may your name be kept holy .
40006010	" May your kingdom come . May your will be done on earth as it is in heaven .
40006011	" Give us our food for today .
40006012	" Forgive us for the wrong things we have done , the way we forgive those who have done wrong things to us .
40006013	" Do not test us but help us , so that no one will make us do wrong . Deliver us from the evil one . The kingdom and power and praise belong to you for ever . Amen ! "
40006014	If you forgive others for the wrong things they have done , then your Father in heaven will forgive you .
40006015	But if you do not forgive others , your Father will not forgive you for the wrong things you have done .
40006016	When you are fasting [ not eating food for a time ] , do not look sad . That is what people do who are not true to themselves . They look sad to show people they are fasting . I tell you the truth . They have their reward already .
40006017	But when you fast , put oil on your head and wash your face as you do at other times .
40006018	Then people will not see that you are fasting . But your Father sees secret things , and he will reward you .
40006019	Do not keep many things for yourself on earth . Insects and rust will spoil them . People will get in and steal them .
40006020	But keep things for yourself in heaven . Insects and rust will not spoil them there . People will not get in and steal them .
40006021	The place where you keep things is where your heart will be also .
40006022	The body gets its light through the eyes . If you have good eyes , all your body will have light .
40006023	But if your eyes are bad , all your body will be in darkness . If the light in you is dark , it will be very dark for you .
40006024	No man can work for two masters . He will hate one and love the other . Or he will obey one and despise the other . You cannot work for both God and money .
40006025	So , I tell you this . Do not be troubled about what you will eat or drink to keep alive . Do not be troubled about what you will wear on your body . Life itself is worth more than food , and the body is worth more than clothes .
40006026	Look at the birds that fly in the air . They do not plant or cut or keep any food . Yet your Father in heaven feeds them . Are you not worth more than birds ?
40006027	Can any one of you live any longer by troubling yourself about these things ?
40006028	And why are you troubled about clothes ? See how the flowers grow in the fields . They do not work or make cloth .
40006029	I tell you , King Solomon was a great man . But he was not dressed as fine as one of these flowers .
40006030	God dresses the grass in the fields so it looks nice . It is in the field one day and the next day it is put on the fire . If God dresses the grass like that , he cares much more that you have clothes to wear . You do not believe in God very much !
40006031	So then , do not keep asking , " What shall we eat ? " " What shall we drink ? " and " What shall we wear ? "
40006032	It is the people who do not believe in God who work for all these things . Your Father in heaven knows that you need them all .
40006033	Work first for Gods kingdom and what he calls good . Then you will have all these things also .
40006034	So do not be troubling yourself about tomorrow . Tomorrow will have its own trouble . Todays trouble is enough for today .
40007001	Do not judge others , then you will not be judged .
40007002	The way you judge others , that is the way you will be judged . How much you give to others is how much will be given to you .
40007003	Why do you look at the spot of dust in your brothers eye ? But you do not see a big stick in your own eye !
40007004	Why do you say to your brother , " Let me take the dust out of your eye " ? And all the time you have that stick in your own eye !
40007005	You are not true to yourselves ! First take the stick out of your own eye . Then you will be able to see to take the dust out of your brothers eye .
40007006	Do not give what is holy to dogs . Do not throw your fine stones to pigs . They will walk all over them , and then turn and hurt you .
40007007	Ask , and you will get what you ask for . Look , and you will find what you look for . Knock , and the door will be opened for you .
40007008	Everyone who asks will get . The one who looks will find . And the one who knocks will have the door opened for him .
40007009	If your son asks for bread , will any of you give him a stone ?
40007010	Or if he asks for a fish , will you give him a snake ?
40007011	You are wrong , and yet you know how to give good things to your children . Much more , your Father in heaven will give good things to those who ask him .
40007012	Do to other people what you want them to do to you . That is what the law and the writings of the prophets say .
40007013	Go in by the small gate . The gate is big and the road is wide that goes to death . Many people go that way .
40007014	The gate is small and the road is not wide that goes to life . Not many people find it .
40007015	Take care . There are prophets who are not true . They come to you dressed like sheep , but inside they are like wolves , bad animals that kill sheep .
40007016	You will know them by the things they do . People do not pick fruit like grapes from thistles . They do not pick fruit like figs from thorn trees .
40007017	In the same way , every good tree has good fruit . But a bad tree has bad fruit .
40007018	A good tree cannot have bad fruit , and a bad tree cannot have good fruit .
40007019	Every tree that does not have good fruit is cut down and thrown into a fire .
40007020	So you will know them by the things they do , good or bad fruit .
40007021	Some people say to me , " Lord , Lord " . But not all who say that will go into the kingdom of heaven . Only those who do what my Father in heaven wants , will go in .
40007022	Many people will say to me on that day , " Lord , Lord , did we not speak in your name ? Did we not drive bad spirits out of people in your name ? Did we not do big works in your name ? "
40007023	Then I will say to them , " I never knew you . Go away from me ! What you do is very wrong ! "
40007024	Everyone who hears what I say and obeys me will be like a man who has good sense . He built his house on a rock .
40007025	It rained hard . The water in the rivers came up high . The winds were strong and beat on the house . But it did not fall down . It was built on a rock .
40007026	But everyone who hears what I say and does not obey me , will be like a man who has no sense . He built his house on the sand .
40007027	It rained hard . The water in the rivers came up high . The winds were strong and beat on the house . It fell down with a loud noise !
40007028	Jesus finished saying all these things . The people were surprised at his teaching .
40007029	He taught them as if he had the right to teach them . He did not teach like their scribes .
40008001	When Jesus came down from the hill , many people followed him .
40008002	A man who had leprosy [ a bad skin disease ] came and kneeled in front of Jesus and worshipped him . He said to Jesus , Sir , I know you can heal me if you want to .
40008003	Jesus put out his hand and touched him . He said , I want to . Be healed . Right away his leprosy was healed .
40008004	Jesus said to him , Do not tell anyone about this . But go and let the priest look at you . Moses gave a law about the sacrifice you must give when you are healed . Give it , to prove to people you are healed .
40008005	When Jesus came to the town of Capernaum , a Roman army officer came to ask him for help .
40008006	He said , Sir , one of my servants is in bed at my house . He cannot move and has much pain .
40008007	Jesus said , I will come and heal him .
40008008	The officer said , Sir , I am not good enough to have you come into my house . Just say the word and my servant will be healed .
40008009	I myself am a man who takes orders , and I have soldiers who take orders from me . I say to one , " Go , " and he goes . I say to another one , " Come , " and he comes . I say to my servant , " Do this , " and he does it .
40008010	Jesus was surprised when he heard this . He said to the people who followed him , I tell you the truth . I have not found any Jew who believes as this man does .
40008011	I tell you , many people will come from the east and from the west . They will sit down with Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven .
40008012	But those who were born in the kingdom will be put into the darkness outside . There they will cry and make noises with their teeth .
40008013	Jesus said to the officer , Go home . What you have believed , will be done . At that very same time the officers servant was healed .
40008014	Jesus went into Peters house . There he saw the mother of Peters wife in bed , sick with fever .
40008015	Jesus took hold of her hand and the fever left her . She got up and began to do things for Jesus .
40008016	That evening , many people who had bad spirits were brought to Jesus . He spoke to the bad spirits and drove them out . And he healed all the people who were sick .
40008017	What the prophet Isaiah said came true . He said , He took away the things that made us weak . He took away the things that made us sick .
40008018	Jesus saw many people around him . So he said , Let us cross over to the other side of the sea .
40008019	A scribe came and said to him , Teacher , I will go anywhere you go .
40008020	Jesus said , Foxes have holes to live in . Birds have nests . But the Son of Man has no place to lie down to rest .
40008021	Another man who was a follower of Jesus , said to Jesus , Lord , let me go first and bury my father .
40008022	But Jesus said to him , Come with me . Let those who are dead bury their own dead people .
40008023	Jesus got in the boat and his disciples got in with him .
40008024	A bad storm came on the sea . The waves were high . Water came into the boat . But Jesus was sleeping .
40008025	The disciples came to Jesus and woke him . Lord , save us ! they shouted . We will die !
40008026	Jesus said to them , Why do you fear ? You do not believe in God very much ! Then Jesus got up . He said to the winds and the sea , Stop ! Then all was quiet .
40008027	The disciples were surprised . They said What kind of man is this ? Even the winds and the sea obey him .
40008028	Jesus came to the other side of the sea , to the country of the Gadarene people . There were graves in that place . Two men came from among the graves to meet him . They had bad spirits in them . They were so bad and strong that people feared to pass that way .
40008029	They shouted , Jesus , Son of God , what do you want to do to us ? Have you come here to punish us before it is our time ?
40008030	Many pigs were eating in a place far from them .
40008031	The bad spirits begged Jesus , If you drive us out of these men , let us go into the pigs .
40008032	Jesus said , Go ! The spirits came out of the men and went into the pigs . All the pigs ran fast down the steep hill into the sea . They died in the water .
40008033	The men who cared for the pigs ran to the town . They told everything and what had happened to the men who had the bad spirits .
40008034	All the people in the town came out to meet Jesus . When they saw him , they begged him to go away out of their country
40009001	Jesus got in the boat and crossed the sea . He came to his own town .
40009002	Some men brought a sick man to him . The man could not move his arms or legs . He was lying on a bed . Jesus saw that they believed he would be healed . So he said to the sick man , My son , be glad ! The wrong things you have done are forgiven .
40009003	Some of the scribes were thinking , This man is not giving respect to God .
40009004	Jesus knew what they were thinking . He said , Why do you think these wrong things in your heart ?
40009005	Which is easier , to say , " The wrong things you have done are forgiven , " or to say , " Get up and walk " ?
40009006	I want you to know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive wrong things people have done . So he said to the sick man , Get up . Make up your bed and go home .
40009007	The man got up and went home .
40009008	Many people saw this and were much surprised . They praised God who had given such power to men .
40009009	Jesus went on from there . He saw a man named Matthew . He was sitting at the place where people came to pay taxes . Jesus said to him , Come with me . Matthew stood up and went with him .
40009010	Jesus was eating in a house . Many tax collectors and bad people came in . They sat down to eat with Jesus and his disciples .
40009011	The Pharisees saw this . They said to his disciples , Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and bad people ?
40009012	Jesus heard it . He said to them , People who are well do not need a doctor . But sick people need him .
40009013	Go and learn what this means : " I want you to be kind . I do not want a sacrifice . " I did not come to call good people . I came to call bad people to stop doing wrong things .
40009014	Then Johns disciples came to Jesus . They said , We and the Pharisees fast . Why do your disciples not do the same ?
40009015	Jesus answered , The people at a wedding cannot be sad while the man who is married is with them . But the time will come when he will be taken away from them . Then they will not eat .
40009016	No one sews a piece of new cloth on an old coat . If he does , the new cloth will tear the old coat . Then the hole is bigger than it was before .
40009017	People do not put new wine into old wine skins . If they do , the old skins break . The wine is lost and the skins are spoiled . New wine is put into new skins . And so they are both saved .
40009018	While Jesus was telling them these things , a ruler came to him . He bowed down in front of Jesus to worship him and said , My daughter has just died . But if you will come and put your hand on her , she will live .
40009019	Jesus got up and went with the ruler . His disciples went too .
40009020	A woman had a sickness for twelve years . She was bleeding all the time . She came behind Jesus and touched his clothes .
40009021	She said to herself , If only I touch his clothes , I will be well .
40009022	Jesus turned around . He saw her and said , Daughter , be glad . You were healed because you believed . And right away the woman was healed .
40009023	When Jesus came to the rulers house , he saw the music players and people making a noise .
40009024	He said to them , Go away . The girl is not dead , but sleeping . They laughed at him .
40009025	The people were told to go outside . When they were out , he went in and took the girls hand . The girl got up .
40009026	People in all that part of the country heard about it .
40009027	When Jesus went on from there , two blind men followed him . They called out , Son of David , help us !
40009028	When Jesus came into the house , the blind men came to him . Jesus asked them , Do you believe that I can do this ? They said , Yes , sir .
40009029	Then Jesus touched their eyes . He said , As you believed , so will it happen to you .
40009030	Then they were able to see . Jesus said to them , Take care , do not tell anyone about this .
40009031	But they went away and told everybody in that part of the country about him .
40009032	As they were leaving , people brought a man to Jesus . This man could not talk He had a bad spirit in him .
40009033	Jesus drove the bad spirit out of the man . Then he could talk . The people were very much surprised . They said , Nothing like this has ever been seen in the country of Israel .
40009034	But the Pharisees said , He drives bad spirits out of people by the power of the chief of bad spirits .
40009035	Jesus went around to all the cities and towns . He taught people in their meeting houses and told them the good news of the kingdom of heaven . He healed all the sick and weak people .
40009036	He saw the many people and was sorry for them . They were troubled and they could not help themselves . They were like sheep with no one to care for them .
40009037	Then Jesus said to his disciples , The harvest is much . But there are not many people to gather it .
40009038	Talk to the Lord of this harvest , and ask him to send out people to his harvest .
40010001	Jesus called his twelve disciples to him . He gave them power over bad spirits so they could drive them out of people . He gave them power to heal people who were sick or weak in any way .
40010002	The names of the twelve apostles are : Simon , whose other name was Peter , and his brother Andrew , James and his brother John , the sons of Zebedee , Philip and Bartholomew , Thomas and Matthew the tax collector , James , the son of Alphaeus , and Lebbaeus , whose other name was Thaddaeus , Simon , the freedom fighter , and Judas Iscariot , the one who gave Jesus over to people who hated him .
40010004	missing fehlt/missing
40010005	Jesus sent out these twelve . He said to them , Do not go to the people who are not Jews . Do not go to any town of the Samaritan people .
40010006	But go to the people of Israel . They are like lost sheep .
40010007	As you go , tell people that the kingdom of heaven is here .
40010008	Heal sick people . Bring dead people to life . Heal people who have leprosy . Drive bad spirits out of people You got it free , so give it free to others
40010009	Do not take gold , silver , or brass money with you .
40010010	Do not take a bag with you , and do not take two shirts , shoes , or a walking stick . The one who does the work should be given his food .
40010011	When you come to any city or town , ask who there is able to have you . Then live there until you leave the town .
40010012	When you go into the house , greet the family with a blessing .
40010013	If the family is all right , let your blessing stay on it . If it is not all right , take your blessing away .
40010014	In some places people will not take you in , or listen to what you say . So when you leave that house or town , shake the dust off your feet .
40010015	I tell you the truth . On the day when people are judged , the people from that city will be punished harder than the people from the country of Sodom and Gomorrah .
40010016	I am sending you out amongst people . You will be like sheep amongst bad animals like wolves . So be wise like snakes , and harmless like doves .
40010017	But take care . Men will take you to their courts . They will beat you in their meeting houses .
40010018	They will bring you to rulers and kings for my sake . Then you will talk about me to them and to those who are not Jews .
40010019	When men take you to court , do not be troubled about what you will say . What you are to say will come to your mind at the right time .
40010020	It is not you who speak . But it is the Spirit of your Father who is speaking through you .
40010021	A brother will take his brother to be killed . A father will take his child . The children will talk against their father and mother , and have them killed .
40010022	Everyone will hate you because you are true to me . But the person who keeps on being true to me until the end , will be saved .
40010023	When they trouble you in one town , go to another . I tell you the truth . You will not go to all the towns in Israel before the Son of Man comes .
40010024	The one who learns is not better than his teacher . And the servant is not better than his master .
40010025	The one who learns should want to be like his teacher . And the servant should want to be like his master . If they say the master belongs to the devil , they will say it all the more about those who work for him .
40010026	So do not be afraid of people . Everything that is hidden will be seen . Everything that is hidden will be known .
40010027	What I say to you in the dark , tell it in the light . What you hear in secret , shout to others from the tops of the houses .
40010028	Do not fear people who can kill the body . They cannot kill the spirit . But fear the one who can destroy both spirit and body in hell .
40010029	Are not two sparrows worth only a small amount of money ? Yet not one of them falls to the ground without your Father knowing about it .
40010030	Even the number of hairs on your head is known .
40010031	So do not fear . You are worth more than many sparrows .
40010032	If anyone tells people that he knows me , I will also tell the Father in heaven that I know him .
40010033	But anyone who tells people he does not know me , I will also tell my Father in heaven that I do not know him .
40010034	Do not think that I came to bring peace on the earth . I did not come to bring peace , but war .
40010035	I came to take away peace between a man and his father . I came to take away peace between a daughter and her mother . I came to take away peace between a mans wife and his mother .
40010036	A man will have people in his own family who make trouble for him .
40010037	Anyone who loves his father or his mother more than he loves me , is not good enough for me . Anyone who loves his son or his daughter more than he loves me , is not good enough for me .
40010038	Anyone who is not willing to carry his cross and suffer with me , is not good enough for me .
40010039	Anyone who tries to keep his life , will lose it . Anyone who gives up his life for my sake , will find it .
40010040	Anyone who takes you in , takes me in . And anyone who takes me in , takes in the one who sent me .
40010041	Anyone who takes in a prophet because he is a prophet of God will get a prophets reward .
40010042	And if any one as a disciple gives a drink of cold water to one of my children , he will not lose his reward . I tell you the truth .
40011001	When Jesus finished telling his twelve disciples what to do , he left that place . He went to teach and tell Gods word to people in the towns around there .
40011002	John was in prison . He heard what Christ was doing . So he sent two of his disciples to him .
40011003	He asked , Are you the one who will come ? Or shall we wait for another person ?
40011004	Jesus answered them , Go and tell John what you hear and see .
40011005	Blind people see . Lame people walk . People with leprosy are healed . People who could not hear , can hear . Dead people are made alive . Poor people hear the good news .
40011006	Anyone who is not troubled in his heart about me , will be happy .
40011007	When Johns disciples went away , Jesus began to talk to people about John . He said , What did you go out into the wilderness to see ? Did you go out to see a tall grass moved by the wind ?
40011008	What did you go out to see ? A man wearing fine clothes ? People who wear fine clothes live in kings houses .
40011009	Why did you go out ? To see a prophet of God ? Yes , I tell you , and he is much more than a prophet .
40011010	He is the man the holy writings tell about . " See , I send my messenger ahead of you . He will make the way ready for you . "
40011011	I tell you the truth . No one has ever been born who is greater than John the Baptizer . And yet the smallest one in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he .
40011012	From the time of John until now , people try hard to break into the kingdom of heaven . And strong people take hold of it .
40011013	All the prophets and the books of the law gave Gods word until John came .
40011014	If you will believe it , this man is the Elijah who would come .
40011015	Everyone who has ears , listen .
40011016	What shall I say that the people of today are like ? They are like children who sit in the market . They call to the other children .
40011017	They say , " We played music for you , but you did not dance . We cried , but you did not cry . "
40011018	John came . He does not eat or drink much . People say , " He has a bad spirit in him ! "
40011019	The Son of Man came . He eats and drinks . People say , " This man eats and drinks too much ! He is a friend with tax collectors and bad people ! " But a man is proved to be wise by what he has done .
40011020	Then Jesus began to talk about the towns where he had done most of his big works . He said hard things about the people , because they did not stop their wrong ways and turn back to God .
40011021	He said , Chorazin ! You will have trouble ! Bethsaida ! You will have trouble ! If the big works I did in you had been done in the cities of Tyre and Sidon , the people there would have stopped their wrong ways long ago . They would wear the clothes people wear to show they are sad . They would sit in ashes .
40011022	But I tell you , on the day when people are judged , you will be punished harder than the people from the cities of Tyre and Sidon .
40011023	Capernaum , will you be lifted up to the sky ? No , you will go down to death . If the big things I did in you had been done in the city of Sodom , it would be standing now .
40011024	But I tell you , on the day when people are judged you will be punished harder than the people from Sodom .
40011025	Then Jesus said , Father , you are Lord of heaven and earth . I thank you because you have hidden these things from people who are wise and know many things . But you have shown them to people who are like children .
40011026	Yes , Father , that was the way you wanted it .
40011027	He said , My Father has given everything to me . No one knows who the Son is but the Father . No one knows who the Father is but the Son and those to whom the Son wants to show him .
40011028	All you who work hard ! All you who carry heavy loads ! Come to me ! I will give you rest .
40011029	Do what I tell you . Learn what I teach you . I am gentle . I am not proud . Then your hearts will rest .
40011030	What I tell you to do is easy . What I give you to carry is not heavy .
40012001	About that time , Jesus was walking through the grain fields on a Sabbath day . His disciples were hungry . They began to pick some of the grain and to eat it .
40012002	The Pharisees saw them . They said to Jesus , Look ! Your disciples are doing what is not right on the Sabbath day .
40012003	But Jesus said to them , Have you not read what David did ? He and his men who were with him were hungry .
40012004	He went into Gods house . Some bread was there for God . Davids men ate it . David did not have the right to eat it , nor the men who were with him . Only the priests have the right to eat it . But David took the bread and ate it . He also gave some of it to the men who were with him .
40012005	Have you never read in the books of the law that the priests in the temple break the Sabbath law on the Sabbath day ? They are not punished for it .
40012006	I tell you , there is someone here who is greater than the temple .
40012007	You do not know what this means , " I want you to be kind; I do not want a sacrifice . " If you knew , then you would not have said what they did was wrong . What they did was not wrong .
40012008	The Son of Man rules over the Sabbath day .
40012009	Jesus left that place and went into the meeting house .
40012010	There was a man whose hand was thin and weak . The people asked Jesus , Is it right to heal a man on the Sabbath day ? They wanted to find something wrong about Jesus .
40012011	Jesus said to them , If one of you had a sheep and it fell into a hole on the Sabbath day , would you not take hold of it and pull it out ?
40012012	A man is worth much more than a sheep . So it is right to do good things on the Sabbath day .
40012013	Then he said to the man , Hold out your hand . The man held out his hand and it was made well like the other hand .
40012014	Then the Pharisees went out and planned together how to kill Jesus .
40012015	Jesus knew about their plan , so he went away from there . Many people followed him and he healed them all .
40012016	He told them not to tell where he was .
40012017	So what Isaiah the prophet of God said , came true .
40012018	He said , This is my servant . I have chosen him . I love him . I am very pleased with him . I will put my Spirit on him . He will judge the people who are not Jews .
40012019	He will not fight or shout . No one will hear his voice in the streets .
40012020	He will not break a stick that is already bent . He will not put out a light that burns only a little . What is right will win , because he will make it win .
40012021	Those who are not Jews will believe in him .
40012022	Then the people brought a man to Jesus . The man had a bad spirit in him . He was blind and could not talk . Jesus healed him . Then the man could talk and see .
40012023	All the people were surprised . They said , Is he Davids son ?
40012024	The Pharisees heard about it . They said , This man drives out bad spirits by the help of Beelzebub , the chief of bad spirits .
40012025	Jesus knew what they were thinking . He said to them , If one part of any country fights against the other part of the country , that country is broken down . If one part of any city or family fights against the other part of it , it cannot stand .
40012026	If Satan drives out Satan , he fights against himself . How then will his kingdom stand ?
40012027	If I drive out bad spirits by Beelzebub , how do your own people drive them out ? Let them judge you .
40012028	But if I drive out bad spirits by Gods Spirit , then Gods kingdom is here with you now .
40012029	If anyone wants to go into a strong mans house and steal his things , he must first tie the strong man . Then he can steal his things .
40012030	Anyone who is not with me , is against me . Anyone who does not work with me is working against me .
40012031	That is why I tell you this . All wrong things that people do or say , will be forgiven . But people who say wrong things against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven .
40012032	Anyone who says anything against the Son of Man will be forgiven . But anyone who says anything against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven . He will not be forgiven in this world or in the next world .
40012033	Either make a tree good and its fruit good , or make a tree bad and its fruit bad . People know what kind of tree it is by the fruit on it .
40012034	You family of snakes ! How can you say good things ? You are wrong ! The mouth will say what is in the heart .
40012035	A good man has stored up good things in his heart , so he will say good things . A bad man has stored up wrong things in his heart , so he will say wrong things .
40012036	I tell you this . On the day when people are judged , they will pay for every empty word they have said .
40012037	Because of your words , you will be called good . Or because of your words , you will be punished .
40012038	Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to him , Teacher , we want you to show us a sign .
40012039	But Jesus answered them , The people today are bad . They have gone away from God . They want a sign . No sign will be given them but the sign of the prophet Jonah .
40012040	Jonah was inside the big sea animal for three days and three nights . So the Son of Man will be in the ground for three days and three nights .
40012041	When people are judged , the men of the city of Nineveh will stand up and speak against the people of today . The people of Nineveh stopped their wrong ways when Jonah told them Gods word . And the one who is here is greater than Jonah .
40012042	When people are judged , the Queen of the South will stand up and speak against the people of today . She came a long way to hear the wise talk of Solomon . And the one who is here is greater than Solomon .
40012043	When a bad spirit has gone out of a man , he goes through dry places . He looks for a place to rest , but he does not find any .
40012044	Then he says , " I will go back to my house from where I came . " When he comes back , he finds it is empty , clean , and all fixed up .
40012045	Then he goes and brings seven other spirits with him . They are worse than he is . They go in and live there . Now the man is worse than he was at first . That is how it will be for the wrong people of today .
40012046	While Jesus was still talking to the people , his mother and brothers stood outside . They wanted to talk to him .
40012047	Someone told him , Your mother and your brothers are standing outside . They want to talk to you .
40012048	But to the man who told him , he said , Who is my mother ? Who are my brothers ?
40012049	He pointed to his disciples and said , These people are my mother and my brothers !
40012050	Anyone who obeys my Father in heaven is my brother , my sister , and my mother .
40013001	That day Jesus left the house and sat down by the sea side .
40013002	Many people came to where he was . So he got into a boat and sat down . All the people stood on the land by the water .
40013003	He taught the people many things by telling them stories . He said , Listen , a man went out to sow some seed .
40013004	As he sowed it , some of the seed fell on the road . Birds came and ate the seed .
40013005	Some seed fell on the stony ground . Not much earth covered the stones . The seed started to grow right away because it was not deep in the ground .
40013006	When the sun began to shine , it was too hot for the new plants . They died because they had no roots .
40013007	Some seed fell among the weeds . The weeds grew up and made the new plants die .
40013008	But some seed fell on good ground . The seed grew and the plants gave more seed . Some plants gave thirty seeds . Some gave sixty . And some gave a hundred .
40013009	Everyone who has ears , listen !
40013010	The disciples came to Jesus and asked him , Why do you tell the people these stories ?
40013011	Jesus answered them , You can learn the secret things about the kingdom of heaven . But they cannot learn them .
40013012	Anyone who already has something will get more , and he will have plenty . But he who does not have anything , even the little that he has will be taken away from him .
40013013	That is why I tell them stories . They look , but they do not see . They listen , but they do not hear or understand .
40013014	They make what Isaiah the prophet said long ago , come true . Isaiah said : " You will listen and listen , but you will not understand . You will look and look , but you will not see .
40013015	The hearts of these people have no feeling . They do not hear well with their ears . And they have shut their eyes . They do not want to see with their eyes . They do not want to hear with their ears . They do not want to understand in their hearts . They do not want to turn to me . If they did turn , I would heal them . "
40013016	God is blessing your eyes because they see . God is blessing your ears because they hear .
40013017	I tell you the truth . Many prophets and good men wanted to see what you see , but they did not see them . They wanted to hear what you hear , but they did not hear them .
40013018	So listen to hear what the story means , about the man who sowed the seed .
40013019	People listen to the message about the kingdom of heaven . If anyone does not understand it , the devil comes along and takes the message out of his heart . That person is like the seed which fell on the road .
40013020	Some seed fell on the stony ground . That is like a person who hears the message and right away he is glad to hear it .
40013021	But it does not go down deep in his heart . He believes it for a short time . When trouble or a hard time comes because of the message , he stops believing .
40013022	Some seed fell among the weeds . That is like the person who hears the message . But he thinks about the things of this world . He wants to get money to be happy . These things push the message out of his heart . No good comes from it .
40013023	Some seed fell on good ground . That is like a person who hears the message and understands it . Much good comes from it . Some people are like the seed that gave a hundred more seeds . Some people are like the seed that gave sixty . Some people are like the seed that gave thirty .
40013024	Jesus told the people another story . He said , The kingdom of heaven is like this . A man sowed good seed in his field .
40013025	While people were sleeping , a bad man came and sowed weeds among the good seed . Then he went away .
40013026	The good seed grew and the plants gave more seeds . Then the weeds grew too .
40013027	The servants came and said to the man who owned the field , " Sir , did you not sow good seed in your field ? How did the weeds get here ? "
40013028	He answered them , " A bad man has done this . " They asked him , " Do you want us to go and pull up the weeds ? "
40013029	" No , " said the man . " If you pull up the weeds , then the good plants will come up with them .
40013030	Let them both grow together until the harvest time . When it is time to cut it , I will say to the men who cut it , Cut the weeds first . Tie them in bundles to be burned . Then put the grain into my storehouse . "
40013031	Jesus told the people another story . He said , The kingdom of heaven is like this . A man took a mustard seed and planted it in his field .
40013032	A mustard seed is the smallest of all seeds . But the plant that grows from it is bigger than other plants . It is like a tree . It is so big that birds come and live in the branches .
40013033	Jesus told them another story . He said , The kingdom of heaven is like this . A woman took yeast and mixed it with many cups of flour . The yeast went all through the flour .
40013034	Jesus told the people all these things in stories . He did not tell them anything without a story .
40013035	What the prophet of God said long ago , came true . He said , I will use stories . I will tell things that have been secret since the world was made .
40013036	Then Jesus left the people and went into the house . His disciples came to him . They said , Tell us the meaning of the story about the weeds in the field .
40013037	Jesus answered , The person who sows the good seed is the Son of Man .
40013038	The field is the world . The good seed means the people who belong to the kingdom . The weeds mean those who belong to the bad one .
40013039	The bad man who planted the weeds is the devil . The harvest time is the end of this world . The men who cut the harvest are angels .
40013040	The weeds are gathered and burned in a fire . That is the way it will be at the end of the world .
40013041	The Son of Man will send his angels . They will gather everything that is bad and the people who do bad things . They will take them out of his kingdom .
40013042	They will put them into the big fire . There they will cry and make a noise with their teeth .
40013043	Then the people who are right with God will shine like the sun in their Fathers kingdom . Everyone who has ears , listen .
40013044	The kingdom of heaven is like this . Something worth a lot of money is buried in a field . A man found it and covered it again . He was so glad that he went and sold everything he had . Then he bought that field .
40013045	The kingdom of heaven is like this . A trader was looking for fine stones called pearls .
40013046	He found a pearl that was worth a lot of money . Then he went and sold everything he had and bought it .
40013047	The kingdom of heaven is like this . A fish net was thrown into the sea . It caught all kinds of fish .
40013048	When it was full , the men pulled it to the land . They sat down and picked out the good fish into baskets . But they threw the bad fish away .
40013049	That is the way it will be at the end of the world . The angels will come and take the bad people away from the good people .
40013050	They will put the bad people into the never-ending hell fire . There they will cry and make a noise with their teeth .
40013051	Jesus asked , Have you understood all these stories ? The disciples said , Yes .
40013052	Then Jesus said to them , So anyone who knows the law and has learned about the kingdom of heaven , is like the headman of a house . He can bring both new things and old things out of what he has stored up .
40013053	When Jesus had finished telling these stories , he went away from there .
40013054	He went back to his home town and he taught people in their meeting house . They were very much surprised and said , Where did he learn all this ? Where did he get the power to do these big works ?
40013055	Is he not the carpenters son ? Is not Mary his mother ? Are not James , Joseph , Simon , and Judas his brothers ?
40013056	Are not his sisters all here with us ? Where did he get all this ?
40013057	They did not understand Jesus . Jesus said to them , Other people honour a man who is a prophet . But the people in his own country and home do not honour him .
40013058	Jesus could not do many big works in that place because the people did not believe in him .
40014001	At this time Herod the ruler heard of Jesus .
40014002	He said to his servants , This is John the Baptizer . He is risen from death . That is why he is able to do such great work .
40014003	Herod had taken John and tied him up . He put him in prison . He did this because of Herodias . She was the wife of his brother Philip .
40014004	John had said to Herod , It is not right for you to have her for your wife .
40014005	Herod wanted to kill John , but he was afraid of the people . They thought John was a prophet , a man of God .
40014006	On Herods birthday , the daughter of Herodias danced for the people who were there . She pleased Herod .
40014007	He was so pleased that he promised to give her anything she asked for .
40014008	The girls mother told her what to ask for . So she said , Give me here , on a plate , the head of John the Baptizer .
40014009	The king was very sorry to do this . But he had made a promise . And all the people who were there had heard him promise . So he gave orders to do it .
40014010	He sent someone to the prison to cut off Johns head .
40014011	Johns head was brought on a plate . It was given to the girl . And she took it to her mother .
40014012	Then Johns disciples came and took his body and buried it . They went and told Jesus .
40014013	When Jesus heard this , he went away from there in a boat . He went to a lonely place by himself . The people heard that he went away and they followed him . They walked from the towns around there .
40014014	When Jesus got out of the boat , he saw many people . He was sorry for them and he healed those who were sick .
40014015	In the evening the disciples came to him . They said , This is a lonely place . And the time is late . Send these people away so they can go to the farms and villages to buy food for themselves .
40014016	Jesus said to them , They need not go away . You give them food to eat .
40014017	They said , We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish .
40014018	Jesus said , Bring them here to me .
40014019	Then Jesus told the people to sit down on the grass . He took the five loaves of bread and the two fish . He looked up to heaven and thanked God for them . Then he broke the bread and gave it to the disciples . The disciples gave it to the people .
40014020	They all ate and had enough . They gathered twelve baskets full of pieces that were left .
40014021	The number of men who ate was about five thousand , besides some women and children .
40014022	Then Jesus told the disciples , You get into the boat right away and go ahead of me to the other side of the sea . And I will send these people away .
40014023	After he had sent them away , he went up on the hill by himself to talk with God . Evening came and he was there alone .
40014024	The boat was far out on the water by this time . The water was beating against the boat and the wind was blowing the wrong way .
40014025	When it was almost morning , Jesus came to them . He was walking on the water .
40014026	His disciples saw him walking on the water . They were afraid , and said , It is a spirit ! Then they shouted loudly because they were afraid .
40014027	Then Jesus spoke to them right away . He said , Be glad ! It is I . Do not fear .
40014028	Peter said , Lord , if it is you , tell me to come to you on the water .
40014029	Jesus said , Come . So Peter got out of the boat . He walked on the water and went toward Jesus .
40014030	He saw what the wind did . Then he was afraid and began to go down in the water . He called out , Lord , save me !
40014031	Right away Jesus put out his hand and took hold of him . He said , You do not believe very much in me ! Why did you not believe ?
40014032	When they got into the boat , the wind stopped blowing .
40014033	Then the men in the boat bowed down in front of Jesus . They said , You really are the Son of God .
40014034	They crossed over the sea and came to the land at Gennesaret .
40014035	The men there knew him and sent word to the people in all the country around . They brought all the sick people to him .
40014036	They begged Jesus to let them touch his clothes . And all the people who touched him were healed .
40015001	Then some Pharisees and scribes from Jerusalem came to Jesus .
40015002	They asked him , Why do your disciples break the law our fathers made ? They do not wash their hands before they eat .
40015003	Jesus asked them , Why do you break Gods law so that you can keep your own law ?
40015004	God said , " Respect your father and your mother . " And God said , " Anyone who says wrong things to his father or his mother will surely die . "
40015005	But you say , " Tell your father or your mother that you have given to God what you were going to give to them . " You say , " If anyone says that , then he does not need to help his father or mother . "
40015006	You make Gods law to mean nothing so you can keep your own laws !
40015007	You are not true to yourselves ! What Isaiah said about you was true . He said ,
40015008	" These people respect me with their mouth but their heart is far from me .
40015009	They do not mean it in their hearts when they worship me . Their teachings are only the words of men . "
40015010	Jesus called the people to him . He said to them , Listen to me and understand what I say .
40015011	What goes into a persons mouth does not make him dirty . But what comes out of a persons mouth makes him dirty .
40015012	Then the disciples came to Jesus . They said , The Pharisees were angry when they heard what you said . Did you know that ?
40015013	Jesus answered , Every plant that my Father in heaven did not plant will be pulled out by the roots .
40015014	Leave them alone . They are blind men who are trying to lead blind men . If a blind man leads a blind man , they will both fall into a hole .
40015015	Peter said to Jesus , Tell us the meaning of that story .
40015016	Jesus said , Do you still not understand ?
40015017	Do you not know this ? What goes into the mouth goes into the stomach , and then it goes out of the body .
40015018	But what comes out of the mouth , comes from the heart . This is what makes a person dirty .
40015019	Here is what comes from the heart : wrong thoughts , killing people , all kinds of adultery , stealing , lying , and saying wrong things about people .
40015020	These things make a person dirty . To eat with hands that are not washed does not make him dirty .
40015021	Jesus left that place and went to the country of Tyre and Sidon . woman of the people of Canaan was in that country . She called out , Sir , you are the Son of David . Help me ! My daughter is being troubled very much by a bad spirit .
40015022	Jesus did not answer her . His disciples came to him and said , Send her away . She keeps calling after us .
40015023	He said , I was sent only to the people of Israel . They are like lost sheep .
40015024	But the woman came and bowed down in front of Jesus and worshipped him . She said , Sir , help me .
40015025	He said , It is not right to take the childrens food and give it to the little dogs .
40015026	She answered , Yes , sir . But even the little dogs eat the food that falls from the tables of their masters .
40015027	Then Jesus answered , Woman , you believe very much . The thing you want me to do will be done . And her daughter was healed at that very time .
40015028	Jesus went on from there along the Sea of Galilee . He went up on a hill and sat down there .
40015029	Many people came to him . They brought sick people with them . Some were lame . Some were hurt . Some were blind . Some could not talk . And there were many others . They laid them down in front of Jesus . And he healed them .
40015030	The people were surprised . They saw that people who had not been able to talk were talking . They saw that people who were hurt were made well . They saw that lame people were walking . They saw that blind people could see . And they praised the God of Israel .
40015031	Jesus called his disciples to him . He said , I share the suffering of the people . They have been with me for three days and they have nothing to eat . I do not want to send them away hungry . If they go away hungry , they will get weak and fall on the way .
40015032	The disciples said to him , Where can we get enough food in this lonely place to feed so many people ?
40015033	Jesus said to them , How many loaves of bread have you ? They said , We have seven , and a few small fish .
40015034	He told the people to sit down on the ground .
40015035	Then he took the seven loaves of bread and the fish . He thanked God for them . Then he broke the bread and gave it to the disciples . The disciples gave it to the people .
40015036	They all ate and had enough . They gathered seven baskets full of pieces that were left .
40015037	The number of people who ate was about four thousand men , besides some women and children .
40015038	Jesus sent the people away . Then he got in the boat and went to the country around Magadan .
40015039	missing fehlt/missing
40016001	The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus . They wanted to test him , so they asked him to show them a sign from the sky .
40016002	He answered them , In the evening you say , " It will be a nice day tomorrow because the sky is red . "
40016003	In the morning you say , " It will be a stormy day , because the sky is red and there are clouds . " You know the meaning of these signs in the sky . But you do not know the meaning of the signs about the time in which we are living .
40016004	People today are wrong . They have gone away from God . They want a sign . No sign will be given them but the sign of Jonah . Then Jesus went away and left them .
40016005	When the disciples reached the other side of the sea , they found they had forgotten to bring any bread with them .
40016006	Jesus said , Watch ! Do not let the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees spoil you .
40016007	The disciples said to each other , He said that because we did not bring any bread .
40016008	Jesus knew what they were saying . He said to them , You dont believe very much in me . Why are you saying to each other , " We have no bread " .
40016009	Do you not yet understand ? When there were five thousand people , there were only five loaves of bread . Do you not remember how many baskets full of pieces you gathered up ?
40016010	When there were four thousand people , there were only seven loaves . Do you not remember how many baskets full of pieces you gathered up ?
40016011	Why do you not understand that I was not talking about bread ? Take care . Do not let the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees spoil you .
40016012	Then they understood that he was not talking about bread . He did not mean that the yeast of bread would spoil them . They understood that he was talking about the things the Pharisees and Sadducees taught .
40016013	Jesus went to the country of Caesarea Philippi . He asked his disciples , I am the Son of Man . Whom do people say I am ?
40016014	They answered , Some people say you are John the Baptizer . Others say you are Elijah . And others say you are Jeremiah or one of the prophets .
40016015	Jesus said to them , Whom do you say I am ?
40016016	Simon Peter answered , You are the Christ , the Son of the living God .
40016017	Jesus answered , Simon , Jonahs son , God has blessed you . No person on earth has showed you this . But my Father in heaven has showed you .
40016018	I tell you this . You are Peter . On this rock I will build my church . The power of death will not destroy it .
40016019	I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven . What you tie on earth will be tied in heaven . What you set free on earth will be set free in heaven .
40016020	Then Jesus said to the disciples , Do not tell anyone that I am the Christ .
40016021	From that time on , Jesus began to teach his disciples . He said , I must go to Jerusalem . I will have much trouble from the leaders , the chief priests , and the scribes . I will be killed . On the third day , I will be raised from death .
40016022	Peter took him to one side and began to talk to him . He said , Lord ! May God stop it ! This must never happen to you .
40016023	But Jesus turned to Peter and said , Get away from me Satan ! You are trying to make me do wrong . You are not thinking the way God thinks , but the way people think .
40016024	Then Jesus told his disciples , If anyone wants to come with me , he must leave what he himself wants to do . He must be willing to carry his cross and come with me .
40016025	Anyone who wants to keep his life will lose it . And anyone who gives up his life for my sake will find it .
40016026	What good will it do a man if he gets the whole world for himself , but loses his life ? What can a person give to get back his life ?
40016027	The Son of Man will come with his angels and will be great like his Father . Then he will pay every man for what he has done .
40016028	I tell you the truth . Some people are standing here who will not die before they see the Son of Man come in his kingdom .
40017001	Six days after this , Jesus took Peter , James , and his brother John with him . He led them up a hill by themselves .
40017002	Jesus was changed in front of them . His face was bright like the sun . His clothes were white , like light .
40017003	Then they saw Moses and Elijah talking with Jesus .
40017004	Peter said to Jesus , Lord , this is a good place for us . If you want , we will make three places here , one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah .
40017005	While he was saying this , a bright cloud came over them . A voice in the cloud said , This is my dear Son . I am very pleased with him . Listen to him .
40017006	When the disciples heard it , they bowed their faces to the ground . They were very much afraid .
40017007	But Jesus came and touched them . He said , Get up . Do not fear .
40017008	When they looked up , they saw no one but Jesus .
40017009	When they came down the hill , Jesus said to them , Do not tell anyone what you saw . Do not tell it until after the Son of Man has been raised from death .
40017010	The disciples asked him , Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first ?
40017011	Jesus answered , Elijah does come . He will get everything ready .
40017012	I tell you that Elijah has come already . The people did not know him . And they did to him just what they wanted to do . So also the Son of Man will be troubled by them .
40017013	Then the disciples knew that he was talking about John the Baptizer .
40017014	They came to the people . A man came and kneeled in front of Jesus .
40017015	He said , Sir , help my son . A bad spirit is in him and he has much trouble . Often he falls into the fire , and often he falls into the water .
40017016	I brought him to your disciples , but they could not heal him .
40017017	Jesus said , You people today do not believe . You have turned away from God . How long must I be with you ? How long must I put up with you ? Bring the boy here to me .
40017018	Jesus talked to the bad spirit and he came out of the boy . The boy was healed .
40017019	Then the disciples came to Jesus alone . They asked him , Why could we not drive the bad spirit out ?
40017020	Jesus said to them , Because you do not believe enough . I tell you the truth . If your strength to believe were as much as a little mustard seed , you could say to this hill , " Go , move over to that place ! " And it would move . Nothing is too hard for you to do .
40017021	But this kind of bad spirit does not come out of a person unless people ask God and fast [ do not eat food for a time ] .
40017022	They were travelling in Galilee . Jesus said to his disciples , The Son of Man will be given over to men .
40017023	They will kill him . But he will be raised on the third day . This troubled the disciples very much .
40017024	They came to Capernaum . There the men who were collecting the tax for the temple came to Peter . They asked him , Does not your teacher pay the tax for the temple ?
40017025	Peter said , Yes , he does . When he came into the house , Jesus spoke to him about it first . He said , Simon , what do you think ? From whom do kings on earth take taxes ? Do they take them from their own people or from other people ?
40017026	Peter said , From other people . Jesus said , Then the sons do not pay a tax .
40017027	But we must not make them think something wrong about us . So go to the sea . Throw a fish-hook into the water . Take the first fish you catch . Open its mouth and you will see a piece of money . Take it and pay them the tax for you and me .
40018001	The disciples came to Jesus at that time . They said , Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven ?
40018002	Jesus called a child to him . He had the child stand in front of them .
40018003	He said , I tell you the truth . If your hearts do not change and become like hearts of children , you will never go into the kingdom of heaven .
40018004	So anyone who feels himself small like this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven .
40018005	If anyone takes in a child like this for my sake , he takes in me .
40018006	These little children believe in me . If anyone makes one of them do wrong , he will be punished . He will have worse trouble than if a big stone were tied to his neck and he were thrown into the deep sea .
40018007	There will be trouble in the world because people make other people do wrong ! People will do wrong . But the person who makes another person do wrong will have trouble .
40018008	If your hand or your foot makes you do wrong , cut it off and throw it away ! It is better for you to enter into life without hands or feet than to have two hands and two feet and be thrown into the fire that burns for ever .
40018009	If your eye makes you do wrong , pull it out and throw it away ! It is better for you to enter into life with one eye , than to have two eyes and be thrown into the hell fire .
40018010	Do not think badly of these little children . I tell you this . They have angels in heaven . And all the time their angels can see the face of my father who is in heaven .
40018011	The Son of Man came to save anyone who is lost .
40018012	What do you think about this ? A man has a hundred sheep . One of them is lost . Will he not leave the ninety-nine sheep on the hills and go to look for the one that is lost ? Yes , he will .
40018013	I tell you the truth . When he finds it , he is more happy to see that one than the ninety-nine that were not lost .
40018014	In the same way , my Father in heaven does not want one of these little children to be lost .
40018015	If your brother does something wrong to you , go to him . Talk alone to him and tell him what he has done . If he listens to you , you have kept your brother as a friend .
40018016	But if he does not listen to you , take one or two others with you to talk to him . Then two or three people will hear every word and can prove what was said .
40018017	If he does not listen to them , tell the church . If he does not listen to the church , treat him as one who does not believe in God and as bad as a tax collector .
40018018	I tell you the truth . What you tie on earth will be tied in heaven . What you set free on earth will be set free in heaven .
40018019	I tell you another thing . If two of you on earth agree together to ask for something , my Father in heaven will do it for them .
40018020	Where two or three people meet together in my name , I am there with them .
40018021	Then Peter came to Jesus and asked him , Lord , how many times should I forgive my brother when he does wrong things to me ? Should I forgive him seven times ?
40018022	Jesus answered him , I say not seven times only , but seventy times seven .
40018023	In that way the kingdom of heaven is like this . A king was ready to finish his business with his servants .
40018024	The first servant was brought in . He owed the king a very large sum of money .
40018025	He could not pay it . So his master said , " Go sell him , his wife , his children , and everything he has , and pay me ! "
40018026	So the servant bowed down in front of him . He begged , " Sir , give me time . I will pay everything . "
40018027	His master was sorry for him and let him go . He did not make him pay the money .
40018028	That same servant went out and met another servant . This man owed him a much smaller sum of money . He caught him by the throat and said , Pay me what you owe me ! "
40018029	Then this servant bowed down in front of him . He begged , " Give me time . I will pay you . "
40018030	But he said , " No . " He went and put the man in prison until he could pay what he owed him .
40018031	The other servants saw what he did . They were very sad . They went and told their master everything that had been done .
40018032	Then his master called the first servant to him . He said , " You bad man ! I let you go . I did not make you pay all you owed me , because you begged me to be kind to you .
40018033	You should have been kind to the other servant , as I was kind to you . "
40018034	His master was very angry . He turned the servant over to the prison guards until he could pay all he owed him .
40018035	That is like what my Father in heaven will do to every one of you , if you do not forgive your brother from your heart .
40019001	When Jesus had finished this talk , he left Galilee . He went away to the part of Judea that is on the other side of the Jordan River .
40019002	Many people followed him . He healed them there .
40019003	The Pharisees came to Jesus to test him . They asked , Is it right for a man to send his wife away from him for any reason ?
40019004	Jesus answered , Have you not read this ? From the time God first made people , he made them a man and a woman .
40019005	God said , " A man must leave his father and mother and must stay with his wife . The two of them will be like one person . "
40019006	So they are not two people any more , but they are one person . Man must not separate what God has joined together .
40019007	They said to Jesus , Then why did Moses make this law ? He said that a man may give his wife a paper to show that he does not want her any more . Then he may send her away .
40019008	Jesus said to them , Moses wrote that law because your hearts are so hard . That is why he let you send your wives away . But in the beginning it was not that way .
40019009	But I tell you this . No man may send his wife away unless she has committed adultery . If he does , and if he marries another woman , he commits adultery . And if a man marries a woman who has been sent away by her husband , he commits adultery .
40019010	The disciples said to him , If a man and woman are like that , then it is better not to marry .
40019011	Jesus said , Not everyone can agree to that . But God has chosen some not to be married .
40019012	Some men cannot marry because they were born that way . Some were made that way by men . Others said , " I will not marry , for the sake of the kingdom of heaven . " Anyone who can do this , should do it .
40019013	Then people brought children to Jesus . They wanted him to put his hands on them and ask God to bless them . The disciples tried to stop the people .
40019014	But Jesus said , Let the children come to me . Do not try to stop them . The kingdom of heaven belongs to people like them .
40019015	So he put his hands on the children . Then he went away .
40019016	A man came to Jesus and said , Teacher , what good thing must I do so that I will live for ever ?
40019017	Jesus said , Why do you ask me about what is good ? Only God is good . If you want to live for ever , you must keep Gods laws .
40019018	The man said , Which laws ? Jesus said , Do not kill . Do not commit adultery . Do not steal . Do not tell lies .
40019019	Respect your father and your mother . Love your neighbour as you love yourself .
40019020	The young man said , I have kept all those laws . What more must I do ?
40019021	Jesus said , If you want to be all right , go and sell everything you have . Give the money to poor people . For this you will be rich in heaven . Then come and go with me .
40019022	When the young man heard that , he was sad , because he was very rich . So he went away .
40019023	Then Jesus said to his disciples , I tell you the truth . It is very hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven .
40019024	And I tell you this also . It is easier for a big animal like a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God .
40019025	When the disciples heard this , they were very much surprised . They said , Then who can be saved ?
40019026	Jesus looked at them and said , Men cannot do it , but God can do anything .
40019027	Then Peter said , See , we have left all things and have come with you . So what will we have ?
40019028	Jesus said to them , I tell you the truth . In the new world , the Son of Man will be great . He will sit on his throne of glory [ big chair of a king ] to rule . Then you who have come with me will also sit on twelve thrones . You will judge the twelve tribes of Israel .
40019029	If anyone has left his house , his brothers , his sisters , his father , his mother , his children , or his farms for my sake , he will receive a hundred times as much as he has left . And he will live for ever .
40019030	But many people who are first will be last , and those who are last will be first .
40020001	The kingdom of heaven is like this . A man owned a farm . Early in the morning he went out to look for men to work on his farm .
40020002	He agreed to pay them a days wages and sent them out to his farm .
40020003	About nine oclock he went out again . He saw some men standing around at the market . They were not working .
40020004	He said to them , " You go out to work on the farm too . I will pay you what is right . " And they went to work .
40020005	The man went out again at twelve oclock and at three oclock . He did the same as he had done before .
40020006	About five oclock he went out again and found other men standing around . He said to them , " Why have you been standing here all day ? Why are you not working ? "
40020007	They said , " No man has asked us to work . " So he said to them , " You go out to work on the farm too . "
40020008	When evening came , the man who owned the farm said to his manager , " Call the workmen and pay them . Begin with those who came last and end with those who came first . "
40020009	Each of the men who started work at five oclock was paid a days wages .
40020010	Those who started work first thought they would get more than that . But they also were paid a days wages .
40020011	They took it , but they were angry and talked against the man who owned the farm .
40020012	They said , " These men came last , and worked only one hour . Yet you paid them the same as you paid us . We worked all day , when the sun was hot . "
40020013	But he said to one of them , " My friend , I am not doing any wrong to you . You agreed that I should pay you a days wages . Did you not ?
40020014	Take your money and go . I want to give the last man the same pay as I gave you .
40020015	It is my own money . Can I not do with it as I like ? Do you think it is a wrong thing for me to be kind ? "
40020016	In the same way , people who are last will be first , and those who are first will be last .
40020017	On the way to Jerusalem , Jesus took the twelve disciples with him , away from the people .
40020018	He said to them , We are going to Jerusalem . The Son of Man will be given over to the chief priests and scribes . They will judge him and say he must die .
40020019	They will give him over to rulers who are not Jews . They will make fun of him . They will beat him and nail him to a cross . On the third day , he will be raised .
40020020	Then Zebedees wife came with her sons to Jesus . She bowed down in front of him and asked him to do something for her .
40020021	Jesus asked , What do you want me to do for you ? The woman said , These are my two sons . Promise that in your kingdom one may sit at your right and the other at your left .
40020022	But Jesus said , You do not know what you are asking for . Can you drink from the cup that I will drink ? Yes , they said . We can .
40020023	Then Jesus said to them , You will drink what I drink . But I cannot choose who will sit at my right or at my left . My Father has planned who will sit there .
40020024	When the other ten disciples heard about it , they were angry with the two brothers .
40020025	But Jesus called them to him and said , You know that those who rule over countries make their people obey them . The great men will tell the others what to do .
40020026	But that is not the way it is among you . Anyone among you who wants to be great will help the others .
40020027	Anyone among you who wants to be first will be a servant to the others .
40020028	The Son of Man did not come to have others help him . But he came to help others . He came to give his life to make many people free .
40020029	As Jesus and the disciples left the city of Jericho , many people followed him .
40020030	Two blind men were sitting by the road . They heard that Jesus was passing that way . So they shouted , Sir , you are the Son of David . Help us !
40020031	The people said to them , Be quiet ! But they shouted louder , Sir , Son of David ! Help us !
40020032	Jesus stopped and called the men to him . He asked , What do you want me to do for you ?
40020033	They said , Sir , we want to see .
40020034	Jesus was very sorry for them as he shared in their suffering . He touched their eyes , and right then they were able to see . They went with him .
40021001	Jesus and his disciples came near to Jerusalem . They came to the village of Bethphage by the hill called the Mount of Olives . Then Jesus sent two of his disciples ahead .
40021002	He said to them , Go into the village in front of you . As soon as you go in , you will find a donkey for riding , and her young one . They are tied there . Untie them and bring them to me .
40021003	If anyone says anything to you , tell him , " The Lord needs them . He will send them back soon . "
40021004	This happened , and what the prophet of God said long ago , came true .
40021005	He said , Tell the people of Zion : See , your king is coming to you . He is not proud . He rides a donkey . It is a young animal .
40021006	The disciples went and did what Jesus told them to do .
40021007	They brought the donkey and her young one . They put their coats on them . Then Jesus got on to ride .
40021008	Many people spread their coats on the road . Others cut leaves from the palm trees and put them on the road .
40021009	People in front of him and people behind him shouted , Praise the Son of David ! God bless him who comes in the name of the Lord ! Praise him in heaven !
40021010	When Jesus came into Jerusalem , all the people there were very excited . They said , Who is this ?
40021011	The people who were with Jesus said , This is Jesus from the town of Nazareth in Galilee . He is a prophet .
40021012	Jesus went into the temple of God . He drove out all the people who were buying and selling in the temple . He threw down the tables of the money changers . He pushed down the seats of those who sold doves .
40021013	He said to them , The holy writings say , " My house shall be called a house where people talk with God . " But you have made it a place for people who steal !
40021014	Blind people came to Jesus in the temple . People who could not walk came to him . And he healed them .
40021015	The chief priests and the scribes saw the big works that Jesus did . They saw the children calling out in the temple , God save the Son of David ! They were angry .
40021016	They asked Jesus , Do you hear what they are saying ? Jesus answered , Yes . Have you never read this ? " You like the praise of children and babies . "
40021017	Then he left them and went out of the city to Bethany . He stayed there for the night .
40021018	In the morning he went back to the city . On the way he was hungry .
40021019	Along the road he saw a fig tree . He went to the tree . There was no fruit on it , only leaves . He said to the tree , No fruit will ever grow on you again ! Right away the tree died .
40021020	The disciples saw it and were surprised . They said , So soon the fig tree has died !
40021021	Jesus said to them , I tell you the truth . Believe God . Do not doubt him . Then you can do what I did to this fig tree . But that is not all . You can even say to this hill , " Go and jump into the sea " and it will be done .
40021022	When you ask God for anything , believe that you will have it . Then you will have it .
40021023	He came to the temple and went in and taught the people . The chief priests and the leaders of the people came to him . They asked , What right have you to do these things ? Who gave you the right to do them ?
40021024	Jesus answered them , I will ask you a question also . If you answer me , I will answer you . I will tell you what right I have to do these things .
40021025	Who gave John the right to baptise people ? Did God or did men ? So they talked it over together . They said , If we say , " God gave John the right to do it , " he will say to us , " Then why did you not believe him ? "
40021026	But if we say , " Men gave him the right to do it , " we have the people to fear , because all the people say that John was a prophet .
40021027	So they answered Jesus , We do not know . Then Jesus said , Neither will I tell you what right I have to do these things .
40021028	What do you think about this ? A man had two sons . He went to the first one and said , " Son , go and work today on my farm . "
40021029	The son said , " No , I will not go . " But he changed his mind and went .
40021030	The man went to the second son and said the same thing . The son answered , " Yes , sir , I will go . " But he did not go .
40021031	Which of the two sons did what his father wanted him to do ? They said , The first one . Then Jesus said , I tell you the truth . The tax collectors and women who commit adultery by selling their bodies , are going into the kingdom of God ahead of you .
40021032	John came to you to tell you the right way . But you did not believe him . The tax collectors and women who commit adultery believed him . And even when you saw that , you did not change your minds and believe him .
40021033	Listen to another story . A man planted a farm of vines for growing fruit called grapes . He put a fence of small trees around it . He dug a place to press the juice from the fruit . He built a high house from which men could watch over the farm . He let some men pay to use it . Then he went to a country far away .
40021034	When it was near the time to cut the fruit , he sent his servants to those men . He wanted to have some of the fruit .
40021035	The men caught the servants . They beat one of them and killed another one of them . They threw stones at another one .
40021036	Then the man sent other servants . There were more than the first time . The men did the same to them .
40021037	Last of all he sent his son to them . He said , " They will respect my son . "
40021038	When the men saw the son , they said to each other , " This is the one who will have everything when his father dies . Let us kill him and we will have it all . "
40021039	They caught him , dragged him off the farm , and killed him .
40021040	When the owner of the farm comes , what will he do to those men ?
40021041	They answered , He will kill those bad men , and will give the farm to other men who will give him the fruit when it is time .
40021042	Jesus said , Have you never read in the holy writings " The stone which the builders would not use is now the chief corner stone . The Lord did this . It looks wonderful to us " ?
40021043	So I tell you , the kingdom of God will be taken from you . It will be given to the people who do what they should do in it .
40021044	If anyone falls on this stone , he will be broken to pieces . But if this stone falls on anyone , it will crush him .
40021045	The chief priests and the Pharisees heard the stories Jesus told , and they knew he was talking about them .
40021046	They wanted to catch him , but they feared the people . The people thought Jesus was a prophet .
40022001	Jesus told them other stories .
40022002	He said , The kingdom of heaven is like this . A king made a wedding for his son .
40022003	The king sent his servants to call the people who had been asked to the wedding . But they would not come .
40022004	He sent other servants to call them . He said , " Tell those who were asked to the wedding that my dinner is cooked . The cows and bullocks have been killed . Everything is ready . Come now to the wedding . "
40022005	The people did not listen , but went away . One went to his farm . One went to his business .
40022006	The others caught his servants , treated them very badly , and killed them .
40022007	The king was very angry . He sent his soldiers to kill the men who had killed his servants . And he burned their city .
40022008	Then he said to his servants , " The wedding is ready . But those who were asked to come were not good enough .
40022009	Go out on the roads . Call all the people you find to come to the wedding . "
40022010	So those servants went out on the roads . They brought all the people they could find , both bad and good people . Then the room was full of people for the wedding .
40022011	The king came in to look at the people . He saw one man there who was not wearing the right clothes for a wedding .
40022012	The king said to him , " My friend , why did you come here without putting on the right clothes for a wedding ? " The man did not answer .
40022013	Then the king said to his servants , " Tie his hands and his feet . Put him in a dark place outside . People there will cry and grind [ make a noise with ] their teeth . "
40022014	Many people are asked to come , but only a few are chosen .
40022015	Then the Pharisees went away . They planned how to make Jesus say something wrong .
40022016	They sent their disciples to him with some of Herods people . They said , Teacher , we know that you are true . We know that you teach the true way of God . You do not fear any person , or care how great he is .
40022017	So tell us . What do you think ? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or is it not ?
40022018	Jesus knew they were trying to get him into trouble . So he said to them , Why are you trying to get me to do wrong ? You are not true to yourselves !
40022019	Show me a piece of money used for tax . They brought him a piece of money .
40022020	Whose picture and name is this ? he asked .
40022021	They said , Caesars . Then he said to them , Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar . And give to God what belongs to God .
40022022	When they heard that , they were surprised . They left him and went away .
40022023	The same day some of the Sadducees came to Jesus . They say that people do not rise from death .
40022024	They came to ask him a question . They said , Teacher , Moses gave us this law : " If a man dies and has no children , then his brother must marry the wife and raise a family for his brother . "
40022025	There were seven brothers among us . The first one married . He died and left no children . So his brother married the wife .
40022026	The same thing happened to the second brother , and the third one , and all seven of them .
40022027	Last of all , the woman died .
40022028	Now then , when people rise from death , which of the seven brothers will have her for his wife ? They all married her .
40022029	Jesus answered , You are wrong ! You do not know what the holy writings say . And you do not know what power God has .
40022030	When people rise from death , men and women do not marry . But they are like angels in heaven .
40022031	People do rise from death ! Have you never read what God said to you ?
40022032	He said , " I am the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . " He is not the God of dead people , but of living people .
40022033	When the people heard this , they were surprised at his teaching .
40022034	The Pharisees heard that the Sadducees could not answer Jesus . So they got together .
40022035	One of them was a man who taught Gods law . He asked Jesus a question to try him out .
40022036	Teacher , he said , which law is the greatest law of all ?
40022037	Jesus said , " Love the Lord your God with all your heart . Love him with all your soul , and love him with all your mind . "
40022038	This is the first and greatest law .
40022039	The second law of God is like it . " Love your neighbour as you love yourself . "
40022040	All that is written in the books of the law and the books of the prophets is about these two laws .
40022041	While the Pharisees were still there , Jesus asked them a question .
40022042	He said , What do you think about Christ ? Whose son is he ? They said , He is Davids son .
40022043	Jesus asked , Then how can David call him " Lord " ? He said , by the Spirit ,
40022044	" The Lord said to my Lord , Sit beside me until I make you master over your enemies . "
40022045	David calls Christ his Lord . How can Christ be Davids son ?
40022046	No one could answer him a word . And after that day , everyone feared to ask him any more questions .
40023001	Then Jesus talked to the people and to his disciples .
40023002	He said , The scribes and Pharisees have taken Moses place .
40023003	So obey and do everything they tell you to do . But do not do what they do . They say what should be done , but they do it not .
40023004	They make heavy loads and put them on peoples backs . But they themselves will not put up even one finger to help carry the loads .
40023005	They do all their work to be seen by people . They wear bigger and bigger boxes with Gods word in . And they make wider and wider borders on their gowns .
40023006	They want to sit in the best places at the feasts . They want to have the front seats in the meeting houses .
40023007	They want people to greet them in the market , and to call them " Teacher " .
40023008	But people should not call you " Teacher " . You have one Teacher . And you are all brothers .
40023009	Do not call anyone on earth your " Father " . You have one Father . He is in heaven .
40023010	People should not call you " Master " . You have one Master . He is the Christ .
40023011	The person who is greatest among you will help the others .
40023012	Anyone who puts himself up will be brought down . And anyone who puts himself down will be brought up .
40023013	You scribes and Pharisees will have trouble . You are not true to yourselves ! You shut the door of the kingdom of heaven so people cannot go in . You yourselves do not go in , and you stop those who were going in .
40023014	You scribes and Pharisees will have trouble . You who are not true to yourselves ! You take away the homes of women whose husbands are dead . You cover up your wrong ways by talking big to God for a long time . Because of that , you will be punished harder .
40023015	You scribes and Pharisees will have trouble . You who are not true to yourselves ! You travel over sea and land to win one person to believe what you believe . And when he believes , you make him twice as fit for hell as you are .
40023016	You blind leaders will have trouble . You say that if anyone makes a promise in the name of the temple , he does not have to keep that promise . But if anyone makes a promise in the name of the gold on the temple , he must keep that promise .
40023017	You fools and blind men ! Which is greater , the gold or the temple that makes the gold holy ?
40023018	And you say that if anyone makes a promise in the name of Gods altar , he does not have to keep that promise . But if anyone makes a promise in the name of the sacrifice , he must keep that promise .
40023019	You fools and blind people ! Which is greater , the sacrifice or the place that makes the sacrifice holy ?
40023020	So if anyone makes a promise by Gods altar , he makes his promise by it and by all that is on it .
40023021	If anyone makes a promise by the temple , he makes his promise by the temple and by God who lives in the temple .
40023022	If anyone makes a promise by heaven , he makes his promise by Gods big chair called a throne and by God who sits on the throne .
40023023	You scribes and Pharisees will have trouble . You who are not true to yourselves ! You give God a tenth part of small garden plants . But you have not done those bigger matters of the law . You have not judged in the right way . You have not been kind . You have not believed God . You should be doing these things and the other things too .
40023024	You blind leaders ! You take a fly out of your cup , but you drink down a big animal like a camel !
40023025	You scribes and Pharisees will have trouble . You who are not true to yourselves ! You wash the outside of a cup and a dish clean . But inside they are full of greed and wrong ways !
40023026	You blind Pharisees ! First clean the inside of the cup and the dish so that the outside will be clean too .
40023027	You scribes and Pharisees will have trouble . You who are not true to yourselves ! You are like graves that have been painted white . Outside they look very nice . But inside they are full of dead mens bones and all kinds of dirt .
40023028	So it is with you . You look right on the outside . But inside you are full of lies and wrong ways .
40023029	You scribes and Pharisees will have trouble . You who are not true to yourselves ! You build places to bury the prophets and fix up graves of good men .
40023030	You say , " If we had lived in the days of our fathers , we would not have helped to kill the prophets of God . "
40023031	So you prove that you are the sons of the men who killed the prophets .
40023032	Finish doing what your fathers started to do .
40023033	You snakes-a whole family of snakes ! You cannot get away ! You will be judged and sent to hell .
40023034	That is why I send you prophets , wise men , and teachers . You will kill some of them and nail them to a cross . And you will beat some of them in your meeting houses and trouble them from one town to another .
40023035	So you will be punished for all the blood of every good man that is on the ground . I mean all the blood from the time of Abel , who was a good man , to Zechariah , the son of Barachiah . You killed him between the temple and Gods altar .
40023036	I tell you the truth . The people who are still living now will be punished for all these things .
40023037	Jerusalem ! Jerusalem ! You kill the prophets . You throw stones to kill the men who are sent to you ! How often I have wanted to gather your people together , as a mother hen gathers her little ones under her wings . But you would not come !
40023038	Now you are left alone in your house .
40023039	I tell you this . You will not see me again until the time when you say , " God bless him who comes in the name of the Lord . "
40024001	Jesus left the temple and was going away . His disciples came to him . They wanted to show him the different buildings that were a part of the temple .
40024002	But Jesus answered them , Do you see these buildings ? I tell you the truth . Not one stone here will be left on top of another stone . They will all be thrown down !
40024003	Jesus was sitting on the hill called the Mount of Olives . The disciples came to him alone . They said , Tell us , when will this happen ? What will be the sign to show you are coming and that it is the end of this world ?
40024004	Jesus answered them , Take care . Do not let anyone fool you .
40024005	Many men will come in my name . They will say , " I am the Christ " . They will fool many people .
40024006	You will hear about wars . You will hear that war is coming . But do not fear . These things must happen , but that is not yet the end .
40024007	One tribe will fight against another tribe . And one country will fight against another country . The people will have no food to eat . Many people will be sick . The earth will shake in many different places .
40024008	All these troubles are only the beginning of troubles that will come .
40024009	Then people will trouble you and kill you . All nations will hate you because you are true to me .
40024010	Then many people will stop believing . They will give one another over to trouble . They will hate one another .
40024011	Many people will come and say they are prophets of God . But they will not be true . They will fool many people .
40024012	People will do more and more wrong things and many people will stop loving me .
40024013	But the person who keeps on being true to me until the end , that one will be saved .
40024014	This good news about the kingdom will be told in all the world . The people in all countries must know about it . And then the end will come .
40024015	Daniel the prophet said that people would put something very bad in the temple . ( Let the one who reads this understand it . )
40024016	When that happens , the people in Judea must go quickly to the hills .
40024017	A person who is on the top of a house must not go down into the house to get things from the house .
40024018	A person who is working in the fields must not go back home to get his coat .
40024019	In those days it will be very hard for women who are to have a child . It will be very hard for mothers who have a baby .
40024020	Ask God that you may not have to go in the cold time of the year or on the Sabbath day .
40024021	The trouble then will be bigger than any other trouble since God made the world . And there never will be any trouble as big as that .
40024022	No person would be saved if the Lord did not cut the time of trouble shorter . He will cut it shorter for the sake of his chosen people .
40024023	If anyone says to you then , " Look , here is the Christ ! " or " There he is ! " do not believe it .
40024024	People will come and say they are the Christ . People will come and say they are prophets . But they are not true . They will show big signs and do wonderful things to fool people . They will fool Gods chosen people if they can .
40024025	Watch ! I have told you these things before they happen .
40024026	So if people say to you , " He is in the wilderness , " do not go there . If they say , " He is hiding somewhere , " do not believe it .
40024027	When lightning shines in the east , it can be seen in the west . It will be like that when the Son of Man comes .
40024028	The big birds that eat meat will all go to the place where the dead body is .
40024029	Right after that time of trouble , the sun will be dark . The moon will not shine . The stars will fall from the sky . And the powers in the sky will be shaken .
40024030	Then people will see the sign of the Son of Man in the sky . Then all the people of the earth will cry . They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds in the sky . He will have much power and will be very great .
40024031	He will send his angels to call with a loud trumpet or horn . They will gather his chosen people from everywhere all over the earth .
40024032	Learn a lesson from the fig tree . As soon as its branches begin to grow and the leaves come , then you know it will soon be the warm time of the year .
40024033	It is the same when you see all these things . You will know that the time is very near , right at the door .
40024034	I tell you the truth . The people who are living then , will not die before all these things happen .
40024035	The sky and the earth will pass away , but my words will not pass away .
40024036	But no one knows the day and the hour when the Son of Man will come . Even the angels in heaven and the Son do not know . Only the Father knows .
40024037	When the Son of Man comes , it will be as it was in the time of Noah .
40024038	In the days before the water covered the earth , people ate and drank . They married and gave their daughters to be married . Then one day Noah went into his house built on a boat .
40024039	The people did not know until much water came and killed them all . When the Son of Man comes , it will be like that .
40024040	Two men will be working together in the field . One will be taken and the other will be left .
40024041	Two women will be making flour together . One woman will be taken away and one woman will be left .
40024042	So watch ! You do not know what day your Lord will come .
40024043	And remember this . The owner of the house does not know at what time of the night a man will come to steal something . If he knew , he would watch and not let the man break into his house .
40024044	So , be ready ! The Son of Man will come at a time when you are not looking for him .
40024045	Who is like a wise servant who can be trusted ? His master will put him in charge of his other servants . He gives them their food at the right time .
40024046	The servant who is doing this when his master comes , will be blessed .
40024047	I tell you the truth . His master will put him in charge of all that he has .
40024048	But if the servant is bad , he will say to himself , " My master will not come just now . "
40024049	Then he will begin to beat the other servants . He will eat and drink with men who are drunk .
40024050	The master of that servant will come on a day the servant is not looking for him . He will not know the time he is coming home .
40024051	The master will punish him and lock him in with people who are not true . People there will cry and grind [ make a noise with ] their teeth .
40025001	Then the kingdom of heaven will be like this . Ten young women took their lamps and went to meet a man who was being married .
40025002	Five of them were foolish and five of them were wise .
40025003	The five foolish women took their lamps but took no oil with them .
40025004	The wise ones took bottles of oil with their lamps .
40025005	It was a long time before the man came , so they all went to sleep .
40025006	At midnight there was a call , " Here comes the man who is to be married ! Come out to meet him . "
40025007	Then all the young women woke up . They cleaned their lamps .
40025008	The foolish ones said to the wise ones , " Give us some of your oil . The light in our lamps is dying . "
40025009	But the wise ones answered , " There may not be enough oil for us all . Go to the market and buy some for yourselves . "
40025010	While they went away to buy oil , the man came . Those who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast . Then the door was shut .
40025011	After that , the other women also came . They called , " Sir , sir , open the door for us . "
40025012	But he said , " I tell you the truth . I do not know you . "
40025013	So watch ! You do not know the day or the hour .
40025014	The kingdom of heaven will be like the time a man went to a country far away . He called his servants and put them in charge of his money .
40025015	He gave five bags of money to one servant . He gave two bags of money to another servant . He gave one bag of money to another servant . He gave to each one what he was able to be in charge of . Then he went away .
40025016	Right away the servant who had five bags of money began to buy and sell things with it . He made five bags of money more than he had at first .
40025017	The servant who had two bags of money did the same thing as the one who had five bags . He also made two bags of money more than he had at first .
40025018	But the man who had only one bag of money dug a hole in the ground . And he hid his masters money in the ground .
40025019	After a long time , the master of those servants came home . He asked what they had done with his money .
40025020	The servant who had been given five bags of money brought five bags more to his master . He said , " Sir , you gave me five bags of money . See , I have made five bags more money . "
40025021	His master said , " You have done well . You are a good servant . I can trust you . You have taken good care of a few things . I will put you in charge of many things . Come , have a good time with your master . "
40025022	The servant who had been given two bags of money came and said to his master , " Sir , you gave me two bags of money . I have made two bags more money . "
40025023	His master said , " You have done well . You are a good servant . I can trust you . You have taken good care of a few things . I will put you in charge of many things . Come , have a good time with your master . "
40025024	The servant who had been given one bag of money came and said , " Sir , I knew that you were a hard man . You cut grain where you did not plant . You pick fruit where you put nothing in .
40025025	I was afraid . So I went and hid your money in the ground . Here is your money . "
40025026	His master answered him , " You are a bad and lazy servant . You knew that I cut grain where I did not plant . You knew that I pick fruit where I put nothing in .
40025027	You should have put my money in the bank . Then when I came home , I would have had my money with interest on it .
40025028	So take the money away from him . Give it to the one who has ten bags .
40025029	Anyone who has some will get more , and he will have plenty . But he who does not get anything , even the little that he has will be taken away from him .
40025030	Take this good-for-nothing servant ! Put him out in the dark place outside . People there will cry and make a noise with their teeth . "
40025031	The Son of Man will be great and will come with all his holy angels . Then he will sit on his throne like a king .
40025032	All the nations will be gathered in front of him . He will put them in two groups like a man who takes care of sheep . He puts the sheep on one side of him and he puts the goats on the other side of him .
40025033	The Son of Man will put people who are like the sheep at his right side . He will put people who are like the goats at his left side .
40025034	Then the King will say to those who are at his right side , " Come ! My Father has blessed you . The kingdom was made ready for you when the world was first made . Come into it now .
40025035	I was hungry . You gave me food . I was thirsty . You gave me a drink . I was a stranger . You took me in .
40025036	I needed clothes . You gave me clothes . I was sick . You came to visit me . I was in prison . You came to see me . "
40025037	Then the good people will ask him , " Lord when did we see you hungry and give you food ? When did we see you thirsty and give you a drink ?
40025038	When did we see you a stranger and take you in ? When did we see you needing clothes and give you clothes ?
40025039	When did we see you sick or in prison and come to see you ? "
40025040	The King will answer them , " I tell you the truth . What you did for even the smallest of these people you did for me . They are my brothers . "
40025041	Then he will say to those at the left side " Go away from me . You are cursed . Go into the fire that burns for ever . That fire has been made ready for the devil and his angels .
40025042	I was hungry . You did not give me food . I was thirsty . You did not give me a drink .
40025043	I was a stranger . You did not take me in . I needed clothes . You did not give me any clothes . I was sick and in prison . You did not come to see me . "
40025044	Then they will also ask , " Lord , when did we see you hungry , or thirsty , or a stranger , or needing clothes , or sick , or in prison , and did not help you ? "
40025045	Then the King will answer them , " I tell you the truth . What you did not do for even the smallest of these , you did not do for me . "
40025046	And they will go away to be punished for ever . But the good people will go away to live for ever .
40026001	When Jesus had finished telling all these things , he talked to his disciples .
40026002	He said , You know that after two days it will be time for the Passover Feast . The Son of Man will be given over to his enemies to be nailed to a cross .
40026003	Then at that time the chief priests and the leaders of the people met together in the house of the high priest . His name was Caiaphas .
40026004	They planned how to catch Jesus by some trick and have him killed .
40026005	But they said , Let us not do it on the day of the feast . We do not want the people to start fighting about it .
40026006	When Jesus was in the town of Bethany , he was in the house of Simon , a man who had leprosy , a bad skin disease .
40026007	While Jesus sat at the table , a woman came to him . She had a bottle of oil . It smelled very nice and cost much money . She put the oil on Jesus head .
40026008	When the disciples saw this , they were angry . They said , Why was the oil wasted like that ?
40026009	The oil might have been sold for much money . Then the money could have been given to poor people .
40026010	When Jesus heard it , he said to them , Why do you trouble the woman ? She has done a good thing to me .
40026011	You will always have poor people with you . But I will not always be with you .
40026012	She has put oil on my body to make me ready to be buried .
40026013	I tell you the truth . Any place in the whole world where people tell the good news , people will also tell what she has done . People will remember her because of it .
40026014	Then Judas Iscariot , one of the twelve disciples , went to the chief priests .
40026015	He said , What will you give me if I help you catch Jesus ? They gave him thirty pieces of silver money .
40026016	And from then on , Judas watched for a good way to help them catch Jesus . Supper
40026017	It was the first day of the feast with bread that has no yeast in it . The disciples came to Jesus and asked , Where do you want us to make ready for you to eat the Passover Feast ?
40026018	He said , Go into the city to a certain man . Say to him , " The Teacher says , My time is near . I will come to your house with my disciples to eat the Passover Feast . "
40026019	The disciples did what Jesus told them . They made the Passover food ready .
40026020	When evening came , Jesus sat down to eat with the twelve disciples .
40026021	As they were eating , Jesus said , I tell you the truth . One of you will give me over to people who hate me .
40026022	They were very sad and troubled . One after the other they began to say to him , Lord , is it I ?
40026023	Jesus answered them , The man who is putting his hand in the dish with me is the one who will give me over .
40026024	The Son of Man will go away just as the holy writings tell about him . But the man who gives him over will have trouble . It would have been better for that man if he had not been born !
40026025	Judas was the one who would give Jesus over to the people who hated him . He said , Master , is it I ? Jesus said , Yes , it is .
40026026	As they were eating , Jesus took some bread . He thanked God for it and broke it . He gave it to the disciples and said , Take this bread and eat it . It is my body .
40026027	He also took a cup . He thanked God for it . Then he gave it to the disciples and said , All of you drink from this .
40026028	This is my blood . My blood is the blood of the new agreement . It is given so that many people will be forgiven for the wrong things they did .
40026029	I tell you this . I will not drink any of the juice of the fruit of the vine again , until I drink some of it new with you in my Fathers kingdom .
40026030	They sang a song and then went out to the hill called the Mount of Olives .
40026031	Then Jesus said to them , All of you will leave me this night . The holy writings say , " I will kill the one who takes care of the sheep . And the sheep will run away . "
40026032	But after I am raised from death , I will go to Galilee to meet you .
40026033	Peter said , Even if all the others leave you , I will never leave you .
40026034	Jesus said , I tell you the truth . This night , before the cock calls , you will say three times that you do not know me .
40026035	Peter said , Even if I must die with you , I will never say I do not know you ! All the disciples said the same thing .
40026036	Then Jesus came to a place called Gethsemane . He said to his disciples , Sit down here . I will go over there and talk with God .
40026037	He took Peter and Zebedees two sons with him . Jesus began to be sad and troubled .
40026038	He said to them , My heart is very sad . I am almost dying ! Stay here and watch with me .
40026039	Jesus went on a little further . He bowed down with his face to the ground . He talked to God and said , My Father , if it can be , let this cup of trouble pass by me . But do not do what I want . May what you want be done .
40026040	Jesus went back to the disciples and found them sleeping . He said to Peter , What ? Could you not watch with me for one hour ?
40026041	Watch and talk with God , so that you will not do wrong . A persons heart can want to do it , but his body is weak .
40026042	Jesus went away again . He talked to God and said , My Father , if you do not want this cup to pass by me , but you want me to drink it , I will do what you want .
40026043	Jesus went back again and found the disciples sleeping . They could not keep their eyes open .
40026044	He left them and went away again . He talked with God the third time and said the same words .
40026045	Then he went back to his disciples and said to them , Are you still sleeping and resting ? The time has come now . The Son of Man is given over to bad people .
40026046	Get up . Let us go . Look , here comes the one who will give me over to people who hate me !
40026047	As Jesus was saying this , Judas came . He was one of the twelve disciples . Many people came with him . They had long knives or swords and big sticks . The chief priests and the leaders of the people had sent them .
40026048	The man who was going to help them catch Jesus had told them that he would give them a sign . He said , The man that I kiss is the one . Catch him and hold him .
40026049	Right then he went to Jesus and said , Greetings , Master ! And he kissed him .
40026050	Jesus said to him , Friend , why have you come ? Then the men came and caught Jesus and held him .
40026051	One of the men who was with Jesus took his sword in his hand . He hit the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear .
40026052	Then Jesus said to him , Put your sword back in its place . All people who fight with a sword will be killed by a sword .
40026053	Do you think that I cannot talk to my Father , and he would send me right now more than twelve armies of angels ?
40026054	But then , how would Gods word come true ? The holy writings say that this is the way it must be .
40026055	At that same time Jesus said to the people , Have you come to take me with swords and sticks as you would a man who steals ? Every day I sat with you in the temple and taught . But you did not try to catch me then .
40026056	All this happened so that what the prophets said in the holy writings would come true . Then all the disciples left Jesus and ran away .
40026057	The men who caught Jesus took him to Caiaphas , the high priest . The scribes and the leaders had met at his house .
40026058	Peter followed Jesus a long way behind . He went as far as the yard of the high priests house . He sat down with the people who worked for the high priest . He wanted to see how this would end .
40026059	The chief priests and all the judges of the court tried to find men to say Jesus had done something wrong so they could kill him .
40026060	But they found nothing . Many people came and said things that were not true . At last two men came .
40026061	They said , This man said , " I can break down Gods temple and build it again in three days . "
40026062	The high priest stood up . He said to Jesus , Have you no answer ? What do you have to say about this ? They have said something against you .
40026063	But Jesus said nothing at all . Then the high priest said to him , I ask you in the name of the living God . Tell us . Are you the Christ , the Son of God ?
40026064	Jesus answered him , Yes , I am . Also I tell you that after this you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the One who has all power . You will see him coming on the clouds in the sky !
40026065	Then the high priest tore his clothes and said , What he has said is wrong ! We do not need any more proof against him . You have heard the wrong thing he said .
40026066	What do you think ? They said , He should be killed .
40026067	Then they spat on Jesus face and hit him . Others slapped him with their hands .
40026068	They said , Christ , tell us , if you know who hit you !
40026069	Peter sat out in the yard . A servant girl came to him and said , You were also with Jesus of Galilee .
40026070	But Peter said in front of them all , I do not know what you are talking about .
40026071	Peter went out to the gate . There , another servant-girl saw him . She said to the others around there , This man was also with Jesus of Nazareth .
40026072	Peter said some bad words and then said , I do not know the man .
40026073	A little later , those standing around came to Peter and said , Surely you are one of them also . We know it by the way you talk .
40026074	Then Peter began to say even more bad words . He said , I do not know the man ! Right then , a cock called .
40026075	Then Peter remembered that Jesus had said , Before the cock calls , you will say three times that you do not know me . Then Peter went out and cried very much .
40027001	When it was morning , all the chief priests and the leaders of the people made a plan against Jesus . They wanted to kill him .
40027002	They tied him and took him away . They took him to Pilate , the ruler .
40027003	Judas was the man who helped them take Jesus . He saw that they had judged Jesus and were going to kill him . He was sorry for what he had done , so he brought the thirty pieces of silver money back to the chief priests and leaders .
40027004	He said , I have done wrong . I have helped you take a good man who should not be killed . They said , What do we care ? You look after that !
40027005	Judas threw the silver money into the temple . He went away and hanged himself .
40027006	The chief priests took the money . They said , It is not right to put this money in the money box of the temple . It has been used to buy a mans death .
40027007	They talked the matter over and bought a field that belonged to a man who made pots . They bought it for a place in which to bury strangers .
40027008	That is why that field has been called The field of blood until now .
40027009	What Jeremiah the prophet said long ago , then came true at that time . He said , They took thirty pieces of silver money . That is what the people of Israel said he was worth .
40027010	They paid for the potters field . That is what the Lord told me to do .
40027011	Jesus stood before the ruler . The ruler asked him , Are you the King of the Jews ? Jesus said , Yes , I am .
40027012	When the chief priests and leaders brought their complaints , Jesus said nothing .
40027013	Then Pilate said to him , Do you not hear what these people say against you ?
40027014	But Jesus did not answer him , not even one word . Pilate was very much surprised about this .
40027015	At the feast Pilate used to let one prisoner free . He let the people choose the man they wanted to go free .
40027016	In the prison at that time was a very bad man named Barabbas .
40027017	So while the people were there Pilate asked them , Which one do you want me to let free for you , Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ ?
40027018	Pilate knew that the chief priests did not like Jesus . He knew that was why they had brought Jesus to him .
40027019	While Pilate was sitting in the court to judge the case , his wife sent a message to him . She said , Do nothing to that good man . I have been troubled very much in a dream about him today .
40027020	The chief priests and leaders talked to the people . They told them to ask Pilate to let Barabbas go free , but to kill Jesus .
40027021	The ruler said to the people , Which of these two do you want me to let go free for you ? They said , Barabbas .
40027022	Pilate said to them , Then what shall I do with Jesus , who is called Christ ? They all said , Nail him to a cross !
40027023	The ruler said , What wrong thing has he done ? But they shouted even more , Nail him to a cross !
40027024	Pilate saw that he was not doing any good . And the people were making a lot of loud noise . So he washed his hands in water in front of the people . Then he said , I will not say this man must be killed . You must do that .
40027025	Then all the people answered , We and our children will do that .
40027026	Then Pilate let Barabbas go free . He told the soldiers to beat Jesus and nail him to a cross .
40027027	Then Pilates soldiers took Jesus to a room . They called all the soldiers together .
40027028	They took off his clothes , and they put a red gown on him .
40027029	They made a big ring of thorns like a crown and put it on his head . They put a stick in his right hand . Then they kneeled down in front of him and made fun of him . They shouted , Greetings , King of the Jews !
40027030	They spat on him . And they took the stick and hit him on the head with it .
40027031	After they had made fun of him , they took off the red gown . They put his own clothes on him . Then they took him away to nail him to a cross .
40027032	As they were going , they met a man named Simon . He was born in the country of Cyrene . They made him carry Jesus cross .
40027033	They came to a place called Golgotha . That means , The place of a head bone .
40027034	They wanted Jesus to drink wine mixed with something bitter . Jesus tasted it but he would not drink it .
40027035	Then they nailed him to a cross . They gambled to see how they should divide Jesus clothes .
40027036	Then the soldiers sat down on the ground and watched him there .
40027037	They put the complaint against Jesus above his head . These words were written there : This is Jesus the King of the Jews .
40027038	Two bad men were also nailed to crosses . They had stolen money . One man was put on the right side of Jesus and one was put on the left side of him .
40027039	The people who passed by said bad things about him . They shook their heads .
40027040	They said , You are the man who said you could break down the temple and build it again in three days . Save yourself ! If you are really Gods Son , come down from the cross .
40027041	The chief priests , the scribes , and the leaders also made fun of him .
40027042	They said , He saved other people but he cannot save himself ! If he is the King of the people of Israel , he should come down from the cross now . Then we will believe in him .
40027043	He trusted in God . If God wants him , he can save him now . He said , " I am Gods Son . "
40027044	The bad men who were also nailed to crosses with him said the same things to him .
40027045	About midday , the whole land became dark and stayed dark for three hours .
40027046	About three oclock , Jesus called out loud , Eli , Eli , lama sabachthani ? That means , My God , my God , why have you left me alone ?
40027047	Some of the people standing there heard what Jesus said . They said This man is calling for Elijah .
40027048	Right away , one of them ran to get something called a sponge . He made it wet with sour wine and put it on the end of a stick . With it he gave Jesus a drink .
40027049	The other people said , Wait . We will see if Elijah will come and save him .
40027050	Jesus called out loud again . Then he died .
40027051	At that time the thick cloth that hung in the temple was torn into two pieces . It was torn from the top down to the bottom . The earth shook and big rocks broke .
40027052	The graves opened . Many of Gods people who had died rose from death .
40027053	They came out of their graves after Jesus rose from death . They went into Jerusalem . Many people saw them there .
40027054	The Roman captain and some of his soldiers were guarding Jesus on the cross . When they saw the earth shake and the other things happen , they were very much afraid . They said , Surely this man was Gods Son .
40027055	Many women were there watching from far away . They had come with Jesus from Galilee and had helped him .
40027056	Among these women were Mary Magdalene , Mary the mother of James and Joseph , and the mother of Zebedees sons .
40027057	In the evening , a rich man came . He was Joseph from the town of Arimathea . He also believed in Jesus .
40027058	He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus . Pilate said that it should be given to him .
40027059	Joseph took the body and wrapped a clean linen cloth around it .
40027060	He put the body in his own new grave which had been cut in a rock . He rolled a very big stone to close the grave . Then he went away .
40027061	Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there . They sat where they could see the grave .
40027062	The next day was the Sabbath day . The chief priests and Pharisees went to Pilate together .
40027063	They said , Sir , that man fooled people . We remember what he said when he was still living . He said that he would rise after three days .
40027064	So give orders that the grave must be guarded for three days . Then his disciples cannot come in the night to carry away his body , and tell people he rose from death . This last trick would be worse than the first .
40027065	Pilate said to them , Take soldiers . Go and guard the grave as well as you can .
40027066	So they went and shut the grave tight . They put a government mark on the big stone . And the soldiers stayed to guard it . This was to make sure the grave would stay shut .
40028001	The Sabbath day was past . Morning light was beginning to shine on the first day of the week . Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the grave .
40028002	The earth shook very much because an angel of the Lord came down from heaven . He came and rolled the big stone away from the grave and sat on it .
40028003	His face shone like lightning . His clothes were as white as snow .
40028004	The soldiers who were guarding the grave saw him and shook with fear . They fell down like dead men .
40028005	The angel talked to the women . He said , Do not fear . I know you are looking for Jesus , who was nailed to a cross .
40028006	He is not here . He has risen , as he said . Come and see the place where he lay .
40028007	Go quickly and tell his disciples , " He has risen from death . He is going to Galilee before you . You will see him there . " Now , I have told you .
40028008	The women went quickly away . They left the grave with fear and they were very happy . They ran to tell his disciples .
40028009	As they were going , Jesus met them . He said Greetings ! The women bowed down in front of him and put their hands on his feet .
40028010	Then Jesus said to them , Do not fear . Go tell my brothers to go to Galilee . They will see me there .
40028011	While the women were going , some of the soldiers who had guarded the grave came into the city . They told the chief priests all that had happened .
40028012	The chief priests had a meeting with the leaders of the people and talked the matter over . They gave much money to the soldiers .
40028013	They said , Tell the people , " His disciples came by night and took away the body while we were sleeping . "
40028014	If the ruler hears about this , then we will talk to him so that he will not punish you .
40028015	The soldiers took the money . They did as they were told to do . And even to this day , many of the Jewish leaders say this is what happened to Jesus .
40028016	The eleven disciples went to Galilee . They went to the hill where Jesus had told them to meet him .
40028017	When they saw him , they bowed down in front of him . But some people were not sure .
40028018	Jesus came and talked to them . He said , All power in heaven and on earth has been given to me .
40028019	So go and make disciples in all countries . Baptise them in the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Spirit .
40028020	Teach them to do all the things I have told you to do . I am with you always , even to the end of time .
41001001	This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ , Gods Son .
41001002	The men of God , called prophets , long ago wrote about it this way : God said , See , I send my man ahead of you to tell about you . He will make the way ready for you .
41001003	A man is calling out in the desert , " Make the way ready for the Lord . Make the road straight for him . "
41001004	John baptised people in the desert . He told them to stop doing wrong things and be baptised , and God would forgive them for the wrong things they did .
41001005	People from all the land of Judea and all the city of Jerusalem went out to John . He baptised them in the Jordan River when they told about the wrong things they did .
41001006	John wore clothes made of camels hair and a leather belt . He ate locusts and wild honey .
41001007	He told the people , Another person is coming . He is greater than I am . I am not good enough to bend down and untie his shoe strings .
41001008	I have baptised you with water , but he will baptise you with the Holy Spirit .
41001009	At that time Jesus came from the town of Nazareth in the country of Galilee . John baptised him in the Jordan River .
41001010	As soon as he came up out of the water , Jesus saw the sky open . He saw Gods Holy Spirit come down on him like a bird called a dove .
41001011	A voice from the sky said , You are my dear Son . I am very pleased with you .
41001012	Right away , the Spirit made Jesus go into the desert .
41001013	Jesus was in the desert for forty days . All that time Satan tried to make Jesus do wrong . Jesus was with wild animals . Angels came and took care of him .
41001014	John was put in prison . Then Jesus went to Galilee . He told people the good news of Gods kingdom .
41001015	The time has come , he said . The kingdom of God is here . Stop your wrong ways , turn back to God and believe the good news .
41001016	Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee . There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew . They were throwing a fishing net into the water . Their work was to catch fish .
41001017	Jesus said to them , Come with me . The work I give you will be to catch people .
41001018	Right away they left their nets and went with him .
41001019	Jesus went on from there and saw James and his brother John . Their fathers name was Zebedee . They were in a boat mending their nets .
41001020	Jesus called them . Right away they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the workmen and went with Jesus .
41001021	They went to the town of Capernaum . As soon as it was the Sabbath day , Jesus went into their meeting house and taught the people .
41001022	They were very much surprised at his teaching because he taught them as if he had the right to teach them . He did not teach them like their teachers called scribes .
41001023	A man who had a bad spirit in him was in the meeting house at that time .
41001024	He called out , Jesus of Nazareth , what do you want to do to us ? Have you come to kill us ? I know who you are . You are the Holy One of God .
41001025	Jesus said to the spirit , Be quiet ! Come out of him !
41001026	The bad spirit threw the man around . It called out loud and then it came out of the man .
41001027	The people were all surprised . They said one to another , What is this ? Is not this a new teaching ? He tells the bad spirits what to do and even they obey him
41001028	The people all around Galilee heard right away about Jesus .
41001029	As soon as they came out of the meeting house , they went to the home of Simon and Andrew . James and John went also .
41001030	Simons wifes mother was sick and was lying down . She had a fever . Right away they told Jesus about her .
41001031	Jesus went to her . He took her hand and helped her up . The fever left her right away , and she began to do things to help them .
41001032	That evening when the sun went down , people brought to Jesus all the sick people and those who had bad spirits .
41001033	All the people in the city crowded around the door .
41001034	He healed many sick people . He drove the bad spirits out of people . And he did not let them speak because they knew who he was .
41001035	The next morning Jesus got up long before daylight . He went out to a place by himself . There he talked with God .
41001036	Simon and his friends went out after Jesus .
41001037	When they found him they said , Everyone is looking for you .
41001038	Jesus said , We must go to the next towns . I must tell the good news to the people there too . That is why I came here .
41001039	Then Jesus talked to the people in all the meeting houses in all the country of Galilee . He also made the bad spirits come out of people .
41001040	A man who was sick with leprosy [ a bad skin disease ] came to him . He kneeled down and begged Jesus saying , I know you can heal me if you want to .
41001041	Jesus was very sorry for him . He put out his hand and touched him . He said , I want to . Be healed .
41001042	As soon as he said this , the disease left the man and he was healed .
41001043	Jesus talked strongly to him and sent him away .
41001044	He said , Do not tell anyone about this . But go and let the priest look at you . Moses gave a law about the gift you must give to God when you are healed . Give it to prove to people that you are healed .
41001045	But the man went out and told everyone everywhere what had happened to him . Because he did this , Jesus could not go into any large town freely . He stayed in places where only a few people were . There people came to him from everywhere .
41002001	After a few days he came back to Capernaum . People soon heard that he was at home .
41002002	Many came together right away . The house was full . There was no more room , not even outside near the door . Jesus was telling them Gods message .
41002003	Four men brought a sick man to Jesus . The man could not move his arms or legs .
41002004	But they could not get in the house where Jesus was , because there were so many people . So they went up on the roof . They made a hole in the roof . Then they let down the mat with the sick man on it .
41002005	Jesus saw that they believed he would be healed . So he said to the sick man , Son , the wrong things you have done are forgiven .
41002006	Some of the scribes were sitting there .
41002007	They were thinking , Why does this man say such wrong things against God ? He is not giving God respect ! Who can forgive the wrong things people do ? No one but God can do that .
41002008	Jesus understood in his spirit what the scribes were thinking . He said right away , Why do you think these wrong things in your hearts ?
41002009	Which is easier , to say to the sick man , " The wrong things you have done are forgiven , " or to say , " Get up . Take up your mat and walk " ?
41002010	I want you to know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive the wrong things people do . So he said to the sick man ,
41002011	I tell you , get up ! Take up your mat and go home .
41002012	Right away the man stood up in front of them . He took up his mat and went home . They were all very much surprised , and they praised God . They said , We have never seen anything like this before .
41002013	Jesus went out again by the seaside . Many people came to him . So he taught them .
41002014	As he went along , he saw Levi , the son of Alphaeus . He was sitting at the place where people come to pay taxes . Jesus said to him , Come with me . Levi stood up and went with him .
41002015	Jesus was eating in Levis house . Many tax collectors and bad people also came . They sat down to eat with Jesus and his disciples . There were many who went with him .
41002016	The scribes and Pharisees saw that Jesus ate with these people . They said to the disciples , Why does he eat and drink with bad people ?
41002017	Jesus heard it . He said to them , People who are well do not need a doctor . But sick people need him . I did not come to call good people . I came to call bad people to stop doing wrong things .
41002018	Johns disciples and the Pharisees disciples were fasting [ not eating food for a time ] . Some people came to Jesus and said , The disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast . Why do your disciples not do the same ?
41002019	Jesus answered them , The people at a wedding cannot be sad while the man who is married is with them .
41002020	But the time will come when he will be taken away from them . Then they will fast .
41002021	No person sews a piece of new cloth on an old coat . If he does , the new cloth will tear the old coat . Then the hole is bigger than it was before .
41002022	No person puts new wine into old wine skins . If he does , the new wine will break the skins . Then the wine will be lost and the skins will be spoiled . New wine is put into new skins .
41002023	Jesus was walking through the grainfields on the Sabbath day . His disciples began to pick some of the seed ( to eat ) as they went along .
41002024	The Pharisees said to Jesus , Why do your disciples do what is not right on the Sabbath day ?
41002025	Jesus answered them , Have you not read what David did ? He and his men who were with him were hungry .
41002026	He went into Gods house when Abiathar was the high priest . Some bread was there for God . It was not right for them to eat it . Only the priests have the right to eat it . But David took the bread and ate it . He also gave some of it to the people who were with him .
41002027	Jesus went on to say , The Sabbath was made for the good of man . Man was not made for the Sabbath .
41002028	So the Son of Man rules over the Sabbath day .
41003001	Jesus went into the meeting house again . A man was there whose right hand was thin and weak .
41003002	The Pharisees watched Jesus to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath day . They wanted to find something wrong about Jesus .
41003003	He spoke to the man whose hand was thin and weak . He said , Stand here .
41003004	Then he spoke to the Pharisees . He said , Is it right to do good things on the Sabbath day or to do wrong things ? Is it right to heal people so they will live , or to let them die ? But the Pharisees said nothing .
41003005	Jesus was angry as he looked at them . And he was sad that their hearts were so hard . Then he said to the man , Hold out your hand . The man did so , and it was made well like the other hand .
41003006	The Pharisees went out . Right away they and the servants of King Herod planned together how to kill Jesus .

41003008	Jesus and his disciples went away to the sea of Galilee . Many people went with Jesus . They came from Galilee , Judea , Jerusalem , Idumea , and from the other side of the Jordan River . And many more people came also , a great many from around the cities of Tyre and Sidon . They also had heard about the great works that Jesus had done .
41003009	Jesus saw that the crowd was very big . He told the disciples to have a small boat ready for him so that he would have more room .
41003010	He did this because he healed many people . All who were sick tried to touch him .
41003011	When the bad spirits saw Jesus , they bowed down before him . They shouted , You are Gods Son !
41003012	He told them they must not tell anyone who he was .
41003013	Then Jesus went up on the hill . He wanted some of the people to come with him . So he called them and they came .
41003014	He chose twelve disciples to stay with him . He wanted to send them out to other places to tell people Gods word .
41003015	He gave them power to heal people and to drive bad spirits out of people .
41003016	One of the twelve was Simon , whom Jesus called Peter .
41003017	He also chose James and his brother John , the sons of Zebedee , whom he named Boanerges , which means " Men of Thunder . "
41003018	, fehlt/missing
41003019	He also chose Andrew , Philip , Bartholomew , Matthew , Thomas , James the son of Alphaeus , Thaddaeus , Simon of Canan , and Judas Iscariot , the one who gave Jesus over to people who hated him . Then Jesus and his disciples went home .
41003020	So many people came again that they could not even eat .
41003021	When Jesus family heard about this , they came to take him away . They said , He is crazy .
41003022	The scribes who came from Jerusalem also talked about Jesus . They said , Beelzebub , the chief of bad spirits , is in this man . He drives out bad spirits by the help of Beelzebub .
41003023	Jesus called the people and talked to them in stories . He asked , How can Satan drive out Satan ?
41003024	If one part of a country fights against another part of the country , that country cannot be strong .
41003025	If one part of a family fights against the other part of the family , it cannot stand .
41003026	If Satan fights against himself and the bad spirits fight against each other , he cannot stand . It will be the end of him .
41003027	If anyone wants to go into a strong mans house and steal his things , he must first tie the strong man . Then he can steal his things .
41003028	I tell you the truth . All wrong things that people do and say about anyone will be forgiven .
41003029	But people who say wrong things against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven . A person who does that will be punished for ever .
41003030	Jesus said all this because the scribes said , A bad spirit is in him .
41003031	Jesus mother and brothers came to him . They stood outside . They sent someone to him .
41003032	Many people were sitting around him . They said , See , your mother and your brothers are outside . They want you .
41003033	Jesus asked them , Who are my mother and my brothers ?
41003034	Then he looked at the people who sat around him . He said , These people are my mother and my brothers !
41003035	Anyone who obeys God is my brother , my sister , and my mother .
41004001	Jesus began to teach people by the sea again . Many people came to him . So he got in a boat on the sea and sat down . The people were by the sea on the land .
41004002	He told the people stories and taught them many things .
41004003	He said , Listen . A man went out to sow some seed .
41004004	As he sowed it , some of the seed fell on the road . Birds came and ate the seed .
41004005	Some seed fell on the stony ground . Not much ground covered the stones . The seed started to grow right away because it was not deep in the ground .
41004006	When the sun began to shine , it was too hot for the new plants . They died because they had no roots .
41004007	Some seed fell among the weeds . The weeds grew up and made the new plants die . So no seeds grew on them .
41004008	But some seed fell on good ground . That seed grew and the plants gave more seed . Some plants gave thirty seeds . Some gave sixty . And some gave a hundred .
41004009	Jesus said to them , Everyone who has ears to hear , listen !
41004010	Later , Jesus was alone . Then the twelve disciples and the other people who were there asked him about the stories .
41004011	He said to them , You can learn the secret things about the kingdom of God . But we must use stories to tell the other people .
41004012	They may look and look , but they will not see . They may listen and listen , but they will not understand . If they did understand , they would turn back to God and he would forgive them for the wrong things they have done .
41004013	Jesus said also , Do you not understand this story ? How then are you going to understand all the stories ?
41004014	The man who sows the seed tells Gods message .
41004015	Those beside the road are like people who hear the message . But as soon as they hear it , Satan comes and takes it out of their hearts
41004016	The seed that fell on the stony ground is the same . It is like people who hear the message and as soon as they hear it they are very glad .
41004017	They believe it for a short time . When trouble or a hard time comes because of the message , they stop believing .
41004018	The seed that fell among the weeds is like people who hear the message .
41004019	But they think about the things of this world . They want to get money and other things to be happy . These things push the message out of their hearts . No good comes from it .
41004020	But some seed fell on good ground . That is like people who hear the message and understand it . Much good comes from it . Some people are like the seed that made thirty seeds . Some people are like the seed that gave sixty . Some people are like the seed that gave a hundred .
41004021	Then Jesus said to them , People do not bring a light and put it under a basket or under a bed . But they put it on the place for a lamp .
41004022	Everything that is hidden will be seen . Everything that is secret will be known and come out to be seen .
41004023	Everyone who has ears to hear , listen !
41004024	And Jesus said , Take care how you listen . How much you give to others is how much will be given to you . You who obey God will get more than you give .
41004025	Anyone who has some will get more . But he who does not have anything , even the little that he has will be taken away from him .
41004026	And Jesus said , The kingdom of God is like this . A man sows some seed in the ground .
41004027	Then he goes on just as he did before . He sleeps at night and wakes up in the morning . The seed begins to grow but he doesnt know what makes it grow .
41004028	The ground itself makes the seed grow . First the plant comes up . Then it begins to have seed of its own . After a while the harvest is ready .
41004029	When the harvest is really ready , he cuts it right away because the harvest time has come .
41004030	And Jesus said , What is the kingdom of God like ? What shall I say it is like ?
41004031	It is like this . A mustard seed is the smallest seed that is ever planted in the earth .
41004032	But the plant that grows from that seed is bigger than any other plant . It puts out very big branches . The birds come and live in its branches .
41004033	Jesus told the people many stories like this . He told them as much of Gods words as they were able to understand .
41004034	He did not tell them anything without a story . When he was alone with his disciples , he told them the meaning of the stories .
41004035	In the evening of that day , Jesus said to his disciples , Let us cross over to the other side of the sea .
41004036	The disciples left the people and took Jesus away in the boat he was in . Other little boats were with him .
41004037	A very strong wind began to blow . Water came in the boat . It began to fill up with water .
41004038	Jesus was in the back end of the boat , sleeping with his head on a pillow . The disciples woke him up . Master , they shouted . We will die ! Do you not care ?
41004039	Then Jesus got up . He said to the wind and the sea , Stop ! The wind stopped . Then all was quiet .
41004040	Then he said to the disciples , Why do you fear ? Do you not believe in God ?
41004041	The disciples were surprised . They said to each other , What kind of man is this ? Even the wind and the sea obey him .
41005001	They came to the other side of the sea , to the country of the Gadarene people .
41005002	There were graves in that place . As soon as Jesus came out of the boat , a man came from among the graves to meet him . The man had a bad spirit in him .
41005003	The man lived among the graves . No person could tie him , not even with chains .
41005004	Many times people had tied him with strong ropes and chains . But he broke the chains and tore the ropes into many pieces . No person was strong enough to hold the man .
41005005	All the time he stayed in the hills where the graves were . He screamed day and night and cut himself with sharp stones .
41005006	Jesus was still far from him , but when he saw Jesus he ran to him . He kneeled down in front of Jesus and worshipped him .
41005007	He called out loud , Jesus , Son of the High God , what are you going to do to me ? I beg you not to hurt me .
41005008	He said this because Jesus had said to him , You bad spirit , come out of the man .
41005009	Jesus asked , What is your name ? He answered , My name is An Army , for we are many .
41005010	He begged Jesus saying , Do not send us out of the country .
41005011	Many pigs were feeding on the hill there .
41005012	The bad spirits begged Jesus saying , Send us to the pigs so that we can go into them .
41005013	Jesus let them go right away . The bad spirits came out of the man and went into the pigs . The pigs ran fast down the steep hill into the sea . They died in the water . The number of pigs was about two thousand .
41005014	Then the men who cared for the pigs ran away . They told the people in the city and all around the country about it . The people went out to see what had happened .
41005015	They came to Jesus . They saw the man who had the many bad spirits in him . He was sitting with clothes on and was not crazy any more . The people were afraid .
41005016	Those who had seen it told them what had happened to the man who used to have many bad spirits . And they told about the pigs .
41005017	Then the people began to beg Jesus to go away out of their country .
41005018	So Jesus got into the boat again . The man who used to have the bad spirits in him begged to go with him .
41005019	But Jesus did not let him . He said , Go home . Tell your friends what the Lord has done for you . Tell them that he has helped you .
41005020	So the man went away and told people in the Ten Towns what Jesus had done for him . All the people were surprised .
41005021	Jesus crossed over the sea again to the other side . Many people came to him while he was near the water .
41005022	One of the rulers of the meeting house came to him . His name was Jairus . When he saw Jesus , he kneeled down before him .
41005023	He said , My little daughter is dying . I beg you , come and put your hands on her so that she will be healed and live .
41005024	So Jesus went with Jairus . Many people went with Jesus and pushed against him .
41005025	A woman among them had a sickness for twelve years . She was bleeding all the time .
41005026	Many doctors tried to heal her . She spent all the money she had to pay them . She was not better , but was getting worse .
41005027	When she heard of Jesus , she came among the people behind him . Then she reached out and touched his clothes .
41005028	She said to herself , If only I touch his clothes , I will be well .
41005029	The bleeding stopped right away . She could feel that she was healed of her trouble .
41005030	Jesus knew right away that power to heal went out from him . He turned around among the people and said , Who touched my clothes ?
41005031	But his disciples said to him , You see all these people pushing around you . Why do you ask , " Who touched me ? "
41005032	He looked around to see who had done it .
41005033	The woman was afraid and trembled . She knew what had happened to her . She kneeled down in front of Jesus and told him the truth about herself .
41005034	He said to her , Daughter , you were healed because you believed . Go and do not be troubled . You are healed .
41005035	While Jesus was still talking , some people came from the rulers house . They said , Your daughter has died . Why trouble the Teacher any more ?
41005036	Jesus heard it . He said to the ruler , Do not fear . Only believe .
41005037	Jesus did not let anyone go with him only Peter , James , and his brother John .
41005038	They came to the rulers house . Jesus saw that there was trouble . People were crying and making much noise because the rulers daughter had died .
41005039	When he came into the house , he said to them , Why do you make so much noise and cry ? The girl is not dead , but is sleeping .
41005040	They laughed at him . So he sent them all outside . Then he took the girls father and mother and the three disciples into the room where the girl was lying .
41005041	He took her hand and said , Talitha cumi ! That means , Little girl , I tell you , get up !
41005042	The girl got up right away and walked around . She was twelve years old . The people were very much surprised .
41005043	Jesus said , Do not tell anyone about this . Give the girl something to eat .
41006001	Jesus left that place and went back to his home town . His disciples went with him .
41006002	On the Sabbath day he began to teach in the meeting house again . Many people who heard him were very much surprised and said , Where did he learn all this ? Where did he get the power to do these big works ?
41006003	Is he not the carpenter ? Is not Mary his mother ? Are not James , Joseph , Judas , and Simon his brothers ? Are not his sisters here with us ? The people did not understand Jesus .
41006004	Jesus said to them , Other people honour a man who is a prophet of God . But the people in his own country , his own home , and his family , do not honour him .
41006005	Jesus could not do any big works in that place . But he put his hands on a few sick people and healed them .
41006006	He was surprised that the people did not believe him . He went out to the villages , teaching the people .
41006007	He called the twelve disciples to him and sent them out two by two . He gave them power to drive bad spirits out of people .
41006008	He said , Take only a walking stick with you when you go . Do not take anything else . Do not take any food , or a bag , or money .
41006009	Wear shoes , but do not take extra clothing with you .
41006010	When you go into a certain house , live there until you leave the town .
41006011	In some places the people will not take you in . They will not listen to what you say . When you leave such a town , shake the dust off your feet . That will be a warning to them . I tell you the truth . On the day when people are judged , the people in that town will be punished harder than the people in the country of Sodom and Gomorrah .
41006012	The disciples went out and told the people that they should stop doing wrong things .
41006013	They drove bad spirits out of many people . They also put oil on many sick people and healed them .
41006014	King Herod heard about these things . People were talking about Jesus everywhere . Herod said , John the Baptizer is risen from death . That is why he is able to do such great works .
41006015	Other people said , It is Elijah . Others said , He is a prophet like the prophets of God who lived long ago .
41006016	Herod heard what other people said , so he said , I cut off Johns head . He is alive again .
41006017	Herod had sent his people to catch John . They tied him and put him in prison to please Herodias . Herod had married her , but she was his brother Philips wife .
41006018	John had told Herod , It is wrong for you to have your brothers wife .
41006019	, fehlt/missing
41006020	So Herodias hated John . She wanted to kill him . But she could not because Herod liked John . He knew that John did what was right and was a good man . So he kept John safe . When he heard John speak he was troubled in his heart , and yet he was glad to hear him .
41006021	rod made a feast on his birthday . He called all his rulers and the captains and the leaders of Galilee to come to the feast .
41006022	The daughter of Herodias came in and danced for them . This pleased Herod and the people at the feast . Then the king said to the girl , Ask me for anything you want and I will give it to you .
41006023	He made a promise which he would not break . He said , Anything that you ask me for I will give you , even if you ask me for half of my kingdom .
41006024	The girl went to her mother and said , What shall I ask for ? Her mother said , Ask for the head of John the Baptizer .
41006025	The girl came quickly to the king and said , I want you to give me the head of John the Baptizer on a plate . Give it to me right away .
41006026	The king was very sorry . But he had made a promise and all the people at the feast had heard him promise . He wanted to do what he promised her .
41006027	Right away he sent one of the soldiers who was standing on guard . He told him to bring Johns head . The soldier went to the prison and cut off Johns head .
41006028	He brought the head on a plate and gave it to the girl . She gave it to her mother .
41006029	When Johns disciples heard of it , they came and took his body and buried it .
41006030	The apostles came back to Jesus . They told him all they had done and taught .
41006031	Jesus said to them , Come away with me . Let us go alone to a quiet place and rest for a while . Many people were coming and going . They could not even eat .
41006032	So they went away in a boat to a lonely place by themselves .
41006033	The people saw them going . Many people knew them . The people ran from all the towns and got there ahead of them .
41006034	When the boat got there , Jesus saw the many people . He was very sorry for them because they were like sheep with no one to care for them . He began to teach them many things .
41006035	When it was late in the day , his disciples came to him . They said , This is a lonely place and the time is late .
41006036	Send these people away to farms and villages to buy food for themselves . They have nothing to eat .
41006037	Jesus said , You give them food to eat . They said , Shall we go and buy a lot of bread and give them to eat ?
41006038	He said , Go and see how much bread you have . When they knew , they told him , We have five loaves of bread and two fish .
41006039	Jesus told the disciples to make all the people sit on the green grass in groups .
41006040	The people sat down in groups . Some groups were a hundred people and some were fifty people .
41006041	Jesus took the five loaves of bread and the two fish . He looked up to heaven and thanked God for them . Then he broke them in pieces . He gave them to the disciples to give to the people . Then he divided the two fish among them all .
41006042	They all ate and had enough .
41006043	Then they gathered twelve baskets full of pieces that were left .
41006044	The number of men who ate was about five thousand .
41006045	Then Jesus said to the disciples , You get into the boat right away and go over to Bethsaida . I will send the people away .
41006046	When he had sent the people away , he went up on the hill to talk with God .
41006047	In the evening the boat was far out on the water . Jesus was alone on the land .
41006048	He saw the disciples working hard rowing the boat . The wind was blowing the wrong way . When it was almost morning , Jesus came to the disciples . He was walking on the water . He was going to pass by them .
41006049	But when they saw him walking on the water , they thought it was a spirit . They shouted loudly .
41006050	They all saw him and were very much afraid . He spoke to them right away . He said , Be glad ! It is I . Do not fear .
41006051	Then he got in the boat with them . The wind stopped . They were very much surprised and did not know what to say .
41006052	They did not understand the lesson about the bread because their minds were too slow .
41006053	They crossed over the sea and came to the land at Gennesaret . They came to shore .
41006054	As soon as he got out of the boat , the people knew him .
41006055	They went quickly to all the country around . They brought sick people in their beds to the place where they heard Jesus was .
41006056	They laid sick people by the road in villages , towns , and farms and every place he went . They begged him to let them touch his clothes . And all the people who touched him were healed .
41007001	Then some Pharisees and scribes from Jerusalem came to Jesus .
41007002	They saw some of the disciples eating food . They had not washed their hands before they ate . The Pharisees said that was wrong .
41007003	They and all the Jews keep the laws made by men . God did not give them those laws . They do not eat until they wash their hands very well .
41007004	When they come from the market , they do not eat until they have washed themselves . They also keep many other laws such as washing cups , pots , brass pans , and beds .
41007005	The Pharisees and the scribes asked Jesus , Why do your disciples not keep the law our fathers made ? Why do they eat with hands that are not clean ?
41007006	Jesus said to them , Isaiah spoke the truth about you people ! You are not true to yourselves ! He wrote about you this way : " These people respect me with their mouths . But their hearts are far from me . They do not mean it in their hearts when they worship me . Their teachings are only words of men . "
41007008	You do not keep the law of God , but you keep the laws made by people . Those laws are about washing pots and cups . You do many other things like that also .
41007009	You break Gods law so that you can keep your own law .
41007010	Moses said , " Respect your father and your mother . Anyone who says wrong things to his father or his mother will die . "
41007011	You say , " Tell your father or your mother that what you were going to give to them is Corban . " ( That means a gift to God . )
41007012	So you stop him from doing anything for his father and mother .
41007013	You make Gods law to mean nothing so that you can keep your own laws . You do many other things like that also .
41007014	Then Jesus called the people to him again . He said , Listen to me , all of you , and understand what I say .
41007015	What goes into a persons mouth does not make him dirty . But what comes out of a persons mouth makes him dirty .
41007016	Everyone who has ears to hear , listen !
41007017	Jesus left the people and went into a house . His disciples asked him the meaning of the story .
41007018	He said , Do you still not understand ? Do you not know this ? What goes into a person from the outside cannot make a person dirty .
41007019	It does not go into his heart , but into his stomach , and then it goes out of the body . By saying this , Jesus meant that food does not make a person dirty .
41007020	But he said , What comes out of a person makes him dirty . 21 ,
41007021	Here is what comes from the heart : wrong thoughts , all kinds of adultery , stealing , killing , wanting things that other people have , doing very wrong things , fooling people , breaking the law , jealousy , saying wrong things about people , being proud , being foolish .
41007022	All these wrong things come from a persons heart and make him dirty .
41007023	Then Jesus went away to the country of Tyre and Sidon . He went into a house and did not want anyone to know he was there . But he could not hide from the people .
41007024	Right away a woman heard of him . She came and kneeled down before him . Her daughter had a bad spirit in her .
41007025	The woman was not a Jew and had been born in the country of Phoenicia in Syria . She begged Jesus to drive the bad spirit out of her daughter .
41007026	But Jesus said to her , We will give the children all they want to eat first . It is not right to take the childrens food and give it to the little dogs .
41007027	She answered , Yes , Sir . But even the little dogs under the table eat food that falls from the childrens table .
41007028	Jesus said to her , Because you have said this , you may go home . The bad spirit has gone out of your daughter .
41007029	When she came to her house , she found that the bad spirit had left . Her daughter was lying on the bed .
41007030	Jesus went away from Tyre and Sidon and came to the sea of Galilee . He passed through the country of the Ten Towns .
41007031	The people brought a man to Jesus who could not hear and could not talk well . They begged Jesus to put his hand on him .
41007032	So Jesus took him away alone . He put his fingers in the mans ears . Then he spat and touched the mans tongue .
41007033	He looked up to heaven and sighed . He said , Ephphatha ! That means , Be opened !
41007034	Right away the mans ears were opened and his tongue was made free . He could talk well .
41007035	Jesus said , Do not tell anyone . But the more he told them not to tell , the more they told it everywhere .
41007036	The people were very much surprised . They said , He has done everything well . The people who could not hear can hear . The people who could not talk can talk .
41007037	missing fehlt/missing
41008001	Again at that time many , many people came together . They had nothing to eat . Jesus called his disciples . He said ,
41008002	I share the suffering of the people . They have been with me for three days and they have nothing to eat .
41008003	If I send them home hungry , they will get weak and fall on the way . Some of them have come a long way .
41008004	His disciples answered , Where can anyone get enough food in this lonely place to feed so many people ?
41008005	Jesus asked them , How many loaves of bread have you ? They said , Seven .
41008006	He told the people to sit down on the ground . Then he took the seven loaves of bread and thanked God for them . Then he broke the bread and gave it to the disciples . They gave it to the people .
41008007	They had a few small fish . Jesus told the disciples to divide the fish among the people also .
41008008	The people ate and had enough . They gathered seven baskets full of pieces that were left .
41008009	The number of men who ate was about four thousand .
41008010	Jesus sent them away . Then right away he got in the boat with his disciples and went to the country around Dalmanutha .
41008011	The Pharisees came and began to argue with Jesus . They wanted to test him . So they asked him to show them a sign from the sky .
41008012	He sighed deeply in his spirit and said , Why do people today want a sign ? I tell you the truth . No sign will be given to them .
41008013	He left them and went to the other side in a boat .
41008014	The disciples forgot to take food . They had only one loaf of bread with them in the boat .
41008015	Jesus said , Watch ! Take care . Do not let the bread yeast of the Pharisees and Herod spoil you .
41008016	The disciples talked to one another about the matter . They said , He says that because we have no bread .
41008017	Jesus knew what they were saying . He asked , Why are you saying , " We have no bread " ? Do you not yet understand ? Are your minds so slow ?
41008018	Can you not see with your eyes or hear with your ears ? Do you not remember ?
41008019	When I broke five loaves for five thousand people , how many baskets full of broken pieces did you gather ? They said , Twelve .
41008020	He said , When I broke seven loaves for four thousand people , how many baskets full of broken pieces did you gather ? They said , Seven .
41008021	He said to them , How is it that you do not yet understand ?
41008022	Then they came to Bethsaida . Some people brought a blind man to Jesus . They begged him to touch the man .
41008023	Jesus took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village . He spat on his eyes and put his hands on him . Then he asked , Do you see anything ?
41008024	The man looked up and said , I see men , but they look like trees that are walking .
41008025	Jesus put his hands on him again . He made him look up . Then he was healed and could see everybody clearly .
41008026	Jesus sent the man away to his home . Do not go into the village and do not tell it to anyone , he said .
41008027	Jesus went with his disciples to the villages in Caesarea Philippi . On the way he asked his disciples , Who do people say that I am ?
41008028	They answered , People say that you are John the Baptizer . Others say that you are Elijah . And others say that you are one of the prophets from long ago .
41008029	Then he asked them , But who do you say I am ? Peter answered , You are the Christ .
41008030	Jesus said to them , Do not tell anyone about me .
41008031	Then he began to teach them . He said , The Son of Man will have much trouble . The leaders , the chief priests , and the scribes will not believe him . He will be killed . After three days he will rise .
41008032	Jesus said this very plainly . Peter took him to one side and began to tell him not to say such things .
41008033	Jesus turned around and saw the disciples . Then he talked to Peter . He said , Get away from me , Satan ! You are not thinking the way God thinks , but the way people think .
41008034	Jesus called the people and the disciples to him . He said , If anyone wants to come with me he must leave what he himself wants to do . He must be ready to carry his own cross and come with me .
41008035	Anyone who tries to keep his life will lose it . And anyone who gives up his life for my sake and for the sake of the good news will find it .
41008036	What good will it do a man if he gets the whole world for himself but loses his soul ?
41008037	What can a person give to get back his soul ? People have gone away from God and are full of wrong ways . If anyone in this time is ashamed of me and the things I say , the Son of Man also will be ashamed of that person when he comes . The Son of Man will come with his holy angels , and be great like his Father .

41009001	Jesus said to them , I tell you the truth . Some people are standing here who will not die before they see the kingdom of God come with power .
41009002	Six days after this , Jesus took Peter , James , and John with him . He led them up a hill by themselves . Jesus was changed in front of them .
41009003	His clothes were white like light . No person on earth could make them so white .
41009004	Then they saw Elijah and Moses talking with Jesus .
41009005	Then Peter said to Jesus , Master , this is a good place for us . We will make three places , one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah .
41009006	Peter did not know what to say because they were very much afraid .
41009007	Then a cloud came over them . A voice in the cloud said , This is my dear Son . Listen to him .
41009008	They quickly looked around but they saw no one except Jesus there with them .
41009009	When they came down the hill , Jesus said to them , Do not tell anyone what you saw . Do not tell it until after the Son of Man has been raised from death .
41009010	So they kept these things to themselves , asking each other what he meant about rising from death .
41009011	Then they asked Jesus , Why do the scribes [ who know all about the holy writings ] say that first Elijah must come ?
41009012	He said , Elijah does come first . He will get everything ready . But why do the holy writings say that the Son of Man must have much trouble ? They say , " He will have much trouble and the people will not respect him . "
41009013	I tell you that Elijah has come . The people did to him just what they wanted to do . They did just as it is written about him .
41009014	When they came to the disciples , they saw many people around them . Some scribes were talking with the disciples .
41009015	The people were all very much surprised when they saw Jesus . They ran to him and greeted him .
41009016	Jesus asked his disciples , What are you talking about with them ?
41009017	One of the people said , Teacher , I brought my son to you . A bad spirit is in him so he cannot talk .
41009018	Wherever it takes hold of him , it throws him around . It makes him foam at his mouth . It makes him make noises with his teeth . He is getting weak and thin . I asked your disciples to drive the bad spirit out , but they could not do it .
41009019	Jesus said , You people today do not believe . How long must I be with you ? How long must I put up with you ? Bring the boy here to me .
41009020	So they brought the boy to him . As soon as the bad spirit saw him , he threw the boy around . The boy fell on the ground and rolled around . Foam was coming from his mouth .
41009021	Jesus asked the father , How long has he had this spirit ? He answered , Since he was a child .
41009022	Often it has thrown him in the fire and in the water . It has tried to kill him . If you can do anything for him , show us that you share our suffering by helping us .
41009023	Jesus said to him , You say , " If you can . " Anything can be done for the person who believes .
41009024	Right away the father of the child , with tears in his eyes , said loudly , I do believe ! Help me to believe more !
41009025	Jesus saw many people come running together . He talked to the bad spirit : You bad spirit who stops the boy from hearing and talking ! I tell you , come out of him and do not go into him again !
41009026	The bad spirit screamed and threw the boy around . Then it came out of him and left him like a dead person . Many of the people even said , The boy is dead .
41009027	But Jesus took his hand and helped him to get up . The boy stood up .
41009028	Jesus went into the house . His disciples were alone with him . They asked him , Why could we not drive out the bad spirit ?
41009029	Jesus said to them , This kind of bad spirit does not come out unless people talk to God and fast .
41009030	Then they left that place and went through Galilee . Jesus did not want anyone to know it .
41009031	He taught his disciples . He said to them , The Son of Man will be given over to men . They will kill him . When he is killed , he will rise after three days .
41009032	The disciples did not understand what he said and they were afraid to ask him .
41009033	They came to Capernaum . When he was in the house , he asked the disciples , What were you talking about on the way coming ?
41009034	But they said nothing , because on the road they had been talking among themselves about who was the greatest person .
41009035	He sat down and called the twelve disciples to him . He said , The way to be first is to put yourself last and be a servant to the others .
41009036	Jesus took a child and had him stand in front of them . Then he took the child in his arms and said ,
41009037	If anyone takes in a child like this for my sake , he takes in me . If anyone takes in me , he takes in the One who sent me .
41009038	John said to him , Master , we saw a man driving bad spirits out of people . He was using your name , but he is not one of us . So we told him to stop because he is not one of us .
41009039	Jesus said , Do not stop him . Anyone who can do a great work in my name will not be quick to say wrong things about me .
41009040	He that is not against us is on our side .
41009041	I tell you the truth . If anyone gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christ , he will not lose his reward
41009042	These little children believe in me . If anyone makes one of them do wrong , he will be punished . He will have worse trouble than if a big stone were tied to his neck and he were thrown into the deep sea .
41009043	If your hand makes you do wrong , cut it off . It is better for you to enter life with one hand than to have two hands and go into hell . Hell fire never dies .
41009044	In hell their worm will not die and the fire will not stop burning .
41009045	If your foot makes you do wrong , cut it off . It is better for you to enter life with one foot than to have two feet and be thrown into hell . Hell fire never dies .
41009046	In hell their worm will not die and the fire will not stop burning .
41009047	If your eye makes you do wrong , take it out . It is better for you to go into Gods kingdom with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell .
41009048	In hell their worm will not die and the fire will not stop burning .
41009049	Everyone must be tested by fire . Every sacrifice must have salt on it .
41009050	Salt is good . But if the salt has lost its taste , how can it be made salty again ? You must have salt in yourselves and live in peace with one another .
41010001	Jesus left that place and went through the country of Judea on the other side of the Jordan river . Many people came to him there again . He taught them as he always did .
41010002	The Pharisees came to him and asked , Is it right for a man to send his wife away from him ? They asked this to test Jesus .
41010003	Jesus answered , What law did Moses give you ?
41010004	They said , Moses allowed a man to write a paper to show that he does not want her any more . Then he may send her away .
41010005	Jesus said to them , Moses wrote that law because your hearts are so hard .
41010006	From the time God first made people , he made them man and woman .
41010007	That is why a man must leave his father and mother and stay with his wife .
41010008	The two of them will be like one person . So they are not two people any more , but they are one person .
41010009	Man must not separate what God has joined together .
41010010	When they were in the house , the disciples asked Jesus about this matter .
41010011	So Jesus said , If any man sends away his wife and marries another woman , he commits adultery against her . [ He takes another woman who is not his wife . ]
41010012	If a woman sends away her husband and marries another man , she commits adultery .
41010013	They brought children to Jesus . They wanted him to put his hands on them . The disciples tried to stop the people .
41010014	When Jesus saw what the disciples did , he did not like it . He said , Let the children come to me . Do not try to stop them .
41010015	I tell you the truth . If anyone does not believe in the kingdom of God like a child , he will never go in .
41010016	Jesus took the children up in his arms . He put his hands on them and blessed them .
41010017	Jesus started on the way again . A man came running and kneeled down before him . He said , Good Teacher , what must I do so that I will live for ever ?
41010018	Jesus said , Why do you call me good ? Only God is good .
41010019	You know the laws : " Do not commit adultery . Do not kill . Do not steal . Do not tell lies . Do not cheat . Respect your father and your mother . "
41010020	The man answered Jesus . He said , Teacher , I have kept all those laws since I was a boy .
41010021	Jesus looked at him . He loved him . He said , You need one thing more . Go home . Sell everything you have . Give the money to the poor people . You will be rich in heaven . So be ready to carry your own cross and come with me .
41010022	When the young man heard that , he was sad , because he was very rich . So he went away .
41010023	Then Jesus looked around at his disciples and said to them , It is very hard for rich people to enter the kingdom of God .
41010024	The disciples were surprised at his words . But Jesus said again , Children , it is very hard for people who trust in riches to enter the kingdom of God .
41010025	It is easier for a big animal to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God .
41010026	They were very much surprised . They said , Then who can be saved ?
41010027	Jesus looked at them and said , Men cannot do it but God can , because God can do anything .
41010028	Peter began to speak and said to him , See , we have left all things and have come with you .
41010029	, fehlt/missing
41010030	Jesus said , I tell you the truth . If any man has left his house , or his brothers , or his sisters , his mother , or his father , or his children , or farms , for my sake and for the sake of the good news , he will receive his pay in this life . He will have a hundred times as many houses , and brothers , and sisters , and mothers , and children , and farms . He will have trouble also . But in the next world he will live for ever .
41010031	But many people who are first will be last , and those who are last will be first .
41010032	Jesus and his disciples were on the road to Jerusalem . Jesus was walking in front of them . The disciples were surprised . And the people who came behind were afraid . He took the twelve disciples and began to tell them what was going to happen to him .
41010033	He said , We are going to Jerusalem . The Son of Man will be given over to the chief priests and the scribes . They will judge him and say he must die . They will give him over to rulers who are not Jews .
41010034	They will make fun of him . They will spit on him . They will beat him and kill him . After three days , he will rise again .
41010035	James and John , the sons of Zebedee , came to Jesus and said , Master , we want you to do for us anything we ask you .
41010036	Jesus said , What do you want me to do for you ?
41010037	They said , Let one of us sit at your right side and one at your left side when you rule .
41010038	But Jesus said , You do not know what you are asking . Can you drink from the cup that I will drink from ? Can you go through the big trouble that I will go through ?
41010039	Yes , they said . We can . Then Jesus said to them , You will drink what I drink and you will have trouble the way I will have .
41010040	But I cannot choose who will sit at my right hand or at my left . It has been planned who will sit there .
41010041	When the other ten disciples heard about it , they were angry with James and John .
41010042	Jesus called them and said , You know the people who rule over countries make their people obey them . The great will tell the others what to do .
41010043	But that is not the way it is among you . Anyone among you who wants to be great must help the others .
41010044	Anyone among you who wants to be first shall be a servant to the others .
41010045	The Son of Man did not come to have others help him . But he came to help others . He came to give his life to make many people free .
41010046	Then they came to Jericho . As Jesus and his disciples left Jericho , many people followed him . A blind man named Bartimaeus , the son of Timaeus , was sitting by the road . He was begging for money .
41010047	He heard that Jesus of Nazareth was passing . So he shouted , Jesus , Son of David ! Help me !
41010048	Many people said , Be quiet ! But he shouted louder , Son of David ! Help me !
41010049	Jesus stopped and said , Call him . They called the blind man and said to him , Be glad ! Come , get up ! He is calling you .
41010050	The man threw off his coat , jumped up , and went to Jesus .
41010051	Jesus said , What do you want me to do for you ? The blind man said to him , Teacher , I want to see .
41010052	Jesus said , Go home . Because you believe in me , your faith has made you well . Right then he was able to see . He followed Jesus on the road .
41011001	They came to Bethphage and Bethany , near Jerusalem by the hill called Olives . Then he sent two of his disciples ahead .
41011002	He said , Go into the village in front of you . As soon as you go in , you will find an animal tied . No one has ever sat on it . Untie it and bring it to me .
41011003	If anyone asks you , " Why are you doing this ? " tell him , " The Lord needs it . He will send it back soon . "
41011004	The disciples went . They found the animal tied outside a door in the street . They untied it .
41011005	People standing there said , What are you doing , untying the animal ?
41011006	The disciples said what Jesus had told them to say . So they let them go .
41011007	They brought it to Jesus and laid their coats on it . He got on it .
41011008	Many people spread their coats on the road . Others cut leaves and branches from the fields and put them on the road .
41011009	People in front of him and people behind him shouted , Praise God ! God bless him who comes in the name of the Lord !
41011010	God bless the kingdom of our father David which is coming . Praise him in heaven !
41011011	And so Jesus went into Jerusalem and into the temple . He looked at everything . Then he went out with the twelve disciples to Bethany . It was late already .
41011012	In the morning when they were on the way out of Bethany , Jesus was hungry .
41011013	He saw a fig tree a little way off with leaves on it . So he went to see if it had figs . He came to the tree . There was no fruit on it , only leaves . It was not the time for figs .
41011014	Jesus said to the tree , No one will ever eat a fig from you again ! His disciples heard what he said .
41011015	They reached Jerusalem . Jesus went into the temple . He began to drive out the people who were buying and selling in the temple . He threw down the tables of the money changers . He pushed down the seats of those who sold doves .
41011016	He would not let anyone carry anything through the temple .
41011017	He taught the people , saying , The holy writings say , " My house shall be called a house for all tribes and nations , where people talk with God . " But you have made it a place for people who steal !
41011018	The chief priests and scribes heard what he said . They wanted to find some way to kill him . They feared Jesus because all the people were surprised at his teaching .
41011019	In the evening Jesus and his disciples went out of the city .
41011020	The next morning they passed the fig tree again . They saw that it had died from the roots .
41011021	Peter remembered about it . He said , Look Master , you cursed the fig tree and it has died .
41011022	Jesus said , Believe in God .
41011023	I tell you the truth . Anyone may say to this hill , " Go and jump into the sea . " He must not doubt in his heart , but he must believe that he will have the things he asks for and he will have them .
41011024	So I tell you , when you ask God for anything believe that you will get it and you will have it .
41011025	When you stand and talk with God , forgive others for the wrong things they have done to you . Then your Father in heaven will also forgive you for the wrong things you have done .
41011026	But if you do not forgive others , your Father in heaven will not forgive you for the wrong things you have done .
41011027	They came to Jerusalem again . Jesus walked in the temple . The chief priests , the scribes , and the leaders came to him .
41011028	They said , What right have you to do these things ? Who gave you the right to do them ?
41011029	Jesus said , I will ask you a question . If you answer me , I will answer you and tell you what right I have to do these things .
41011030	Who gave John the right to baptise people ? Did God or did men ? Answer me !
41011031	So they talked it over together . They said , If we say , " God gave John the right , " he will say , " Then why did you not believe him ? "
41011032	But what if we say , " Men gave him the right to do it " ? They feared the people because they all believed that John was a prophet of God .
41011033	So they answered Jesus , We do not know . Then Jesus said , Neither will I tell you what right I have to do these things .
41012001	Jesus then began to speak to the disciples in stories . A man planted a farm of vines for growing fruit called grapes . He put a fence of small trees around it . He dug a place to press the juice from the fruit . He built a high house from which men could watch over the farm . Then he let some men pay to use it and went to a country far away .
41012002	At harvest time the owner sent one his servants to get some of the fruit from the farm .
41012003	The men took the servant and beat him . They sent him away without any fruit .
41012004	He sent another servant . They hurt this one also , and cut his head . The things they did to him were very wrong .
41012005	So he sent another servant . The men killed him . He sent many others , and the men beat some and killed others .
41012006	There was one left . He was his own son . He sent him last . He said , " They will respect my son . "
41012007	But the men said to each other , " This is the one who will have everything when his father dies . Let us kill him . Then everything will belong to us . "
41012008	They killed him and threw his body outside the farm .
41012009	What will the man who owned the farm do to them ? He will come back and kill the men in the farm . And he will give the farm to other men to use .
41012010	Have you not read this writing : " The stone which the builders would not use is now the chief stone of the corner . The Lord did this . It looks wonderful to us . " ?
41012012	They tried to catch Jesus but they feared the people . They knew that Jesus had spoken this against them . So they left him and went away .
41012013	They sent some Pharisees and some of Herods people to Jesus . They planned how to make Jesus say something wrong .
41012014	They came and said to him , Teacher , we know that you are true . You do not fear any person or care how great he is . But you teach the true way of God . Tell us , is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or is it not ?
41012015	Should we pay taxes or not ? Jesus knew they were trying to get him into trouble . So he said to them , Why are you trying to get me to do wrong ? Bring me a piece of money . Let me look at it .
41012016	They brought one to him . He asked , Whose picture and name is this ? They answered , Caesars .
41012017	So he said , Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar and give to God what belongs to God . The Pharisees and Herods people were much surprised at Jesus .
41012018	Some of the Sadducees came to Jesus . They say that people do not rise from death . They asked Jesus a question .
41012019	Teacher , they said , Moses gave us this law : if a man dies and leaves a wife but no children , then his brother must marry the wife and raise a family for his brother .
41012020	There were seven brothers . The first one married . He died and left no child .
41012021	e second brother married the wife . He also died and left no child . It was the same with the third one .
41012022	All seven brothers married her . They all had no children . Last of all the woman died also .
41012023	Now then when people rise from death , whose wife will she be ? All seven of them had married her .
41012024	Jesus said to them , You are wrong ! You do not know what the holy writings say . And you do not know what power God has .
41012025	When people rise from death , men and women do not marry . But they are like angels in heaven .
41012026	People do rise from death ! Have you never read what Moses wrote ? It is in the place where we read about the small tree which burned . Moses tells how God said to him , " I am the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . "
41012027	He is not the God of dead people , but of living people . The way you look at things is wrong altogether .
41012028	One of the scribes heard them talking . He saw that Jesus gave them a good answer . Then he came and asked , Which law is the greatest law of all ?
41012029	Jesus answered , The greatest one is , " Hear , O Israel . The Lord our God is one Lord .
41012030	Love the Lord your God with all your heart . Love him with all your soul . Love him with all your mind . And love him with all your strength . "
41012031	The second law is this : " Love your neighbour as you love yourself . " No law is greater than these laws .
41012032	Then the scribe answered Jesus , Teacher , what you say is right . There is one God . There are no other gods .
41012033	Love God with all your heart . Love him with all your understanding . Love him with all your strength . That is much better than to burn offerings and make sacrifices . Love your neighbour as you love yourself . That is better than any of these offerings and sacrifices .
41012034	Jesus saw that the scribe was wise . So he said to him , You are not far from the kingdom of God . After that everyone feared to ask him any more questions .
41012035	Jesus was teaching people in the temple . He said , How can the scribes say that Christ is Davids son ?
41012036	The Holy Spirit spoke through David and he himself said : " The LORD said to my Lord , Sit beside me until I make you master over your enemies . "
41012037	So David calls Christ his Lord . How can Christ be Davids son ? Most of the people were glad to hear Jesus teaching .
41012038	Jesus went on to teach them . He said , Take care . Do not let the scribes fool you by the way they do things . They like to walk about with long gowns . They want people to greet them in the market .
41012039	They want to sit in the front seats in the meeting houses . They want to sit in the best places at feasts .
41012040	They take away the homes of women whose husbands are dead . They cover up the wrong things they do by talking to God a long time . They will be punished more !
41012041	Jesus sat down in the temple near the place where people put in their money . He saw how the people put in money . Many rich people put in much money .
41012042	A poor woman , whose husband was dead , came . She put in two small pieces of money .
41012043	Jesus called his disciples . He said , I tell you the truth . This poor woman has given more money than all the other people .
41012044	All these people had plenty of money and they gave only a part of it . She was poor and she gave everything she had . She has nothing left to live on .
41013001	When Jesus was leaving the temple , one of his disciples said , Look Master , see those big stones and the wonderful houses !
41013002	Jesus said , You see these big houses ? I tell you , not one stone here will be left on top of another . They will all be thrown down !
41013003	Afterwards , he was sitting on the hill called the Mount of Olives , near the temple . Peter , James , John , and Andrew came to him alone .
41013004	They said , Tell us , when will this happen ? What will be the sign when these things are going to be done ?
41013005	Then Jesus began to talk to them . He said , Take care . Do not let anyone fool you .
41013006	Many men will come in my name . They will say , " I am Christ . " They will fool many people .
41013007	You will hear about wars . You will hear that war is coming . But do not fear . These things must happen , but that is not yet the end .
41013008	One tribe will fight against another tribe . And one country will fight against another country . The earth will shake in many different places . People will have no food to eat . These troubles are only the beginning of the troubles that will come .
41013009	But you must take care . Men will take you to court . They will beat you in their meeting houses . They will take you to rulers and kings because you are true to me . You will talk to them about me .
41013010	The good news must first be told to all people .
41013011	When men take you to court , do not be troubled about what you will say . Say whatever comes to your mind at that time . It is not you who speak , but it is the Holy Spirit .
41013012	A brother will take his brother to be killed . A father will take his child . The children will talk against their father and mother and have them killed .
41013013	All people will hate you because you are true to me . But the person who keeps on being true to me until the end will be saved .
41013014	Daniel the Man of God said that people would put something very bad in the temple . ( Let the one who reads this understand it . ) When that happens , the people in Judea must go quickly to the hills .
41013015	A person who is on the top of a house must not go down into the house to get things .
41013016	Those who are working in the fields must not go back to get their coats .
41013017	In those days it will be very hard for women who are to have a child . It will be very hard for mothers who have babies .
41013018	Ask God that you may not have the trouble in the cold time of the year .
41013019	The trouble then will be bigger than any trouble since God made the world . And there never will be any trouble as big as that .
41013020	No person would be saved if the Lord did not make the time of trouble shorter . He will make it shorter for the sake of his chosen people .
41013021	If anyone says to you then , " Look , here is the Christ ! " or , " There he is ! " do not believe it .
41013022	People will come and say they are the Christ . People will come and say they are prophets of God . But they are not true to themselves . They will show big signs and do wonderful things that will fool people . They will fool Gods chosen people if they can .
41013023	Watch ! I have told you all these things before they happen .
41013024	In that time of trouble , the sun will be dark . The moon will not shine .
41013025	The stars will fall from the sky . And the powers in the sky will be shaken .
41013026	Then people will see the sign of the Son of Man in the clouds . He will have much power and be very great .
41013027	He will send out the angels to gather his chosen people . They will gather them from everywhere all over the earth .
41013028	Learn a lesson from the fig tree . As soon as its branches begin to grow and the leaves come , then you know it will soon be the warm time of the year .
41013029	It is the same when you see all these things . You will know that the time is very near , right at the door .
41013030	I tell you the truth . The people who are living then will not die before all these things happen .
41013031	The sky and the earth will pass away , but my words will not pass away .
41013032	But no one knows the day or the hour when the Son of Man will come . Even the angels in heaven and the Son do not know . Only the Father knows .
41013033	So watch ! Stay awake and talk with God . You do not know when the time will be .
41013034	It is like a man who went to a country far away . He left his home and told each one of his servants what work he must do . Then he told the man who guards the door to watch .
41013035	So watch ! You do not know when the master of the house will come . You do not know if he will come in the evening , or at midnight , or when the cock calls , or in the morning .
41013036	Watch , so that you will not be sleeping if he comes quickly .
41013037	What I say to you I say to everybody , and this is " Watch " .
41014001	The Passover Feast and the feast with bread that has no yeast in it was two days later . The chief priests and the scribes planned how to catch Jesus by some trick . They wanted to kill him .
41014002	But they said , Let us not do it on the day of the feast . We do not want the people to start fighting about it .
41014003	When Jesus was in the town of Bethany , he was in Simons house . Simon had leprosy . While Jesus sat at the table , a woman came to him . She had a bottle of oil . It smelled very nice and cost much money . She broke the bottle and poured the oil on Jesus head .
41014004	Some people there were angry . They said , Why was this oil wasted like that ?
41014005	The oil might have been sold for a lot of money . Then the money could have been given to poor people . They said to the woman , You should not have done this !
41014006	But Jesus said , Leave the woman alone . Why do you trouble her ? She has done a good thing to me .
41014007	You will always have poor people with you . Any time you want to , you can do good to them . But I will not always be with you .
41014008	She has done what she could . She has put oil on my body to make me ready to be buried .
41014009	I tell you the truth . Any place in the whole world where people tell the good news , people will also tell what she has done . People will remember her because of it .
41014010	Judas Iscariot , one of the twelve disciples , went to the chief priests . He told them how he could help them catch Jesus .
41014011	They were glad when they heard that . They promised to give him money . So he watched for a good way to help them catch Jesus .
41014012	It was the first day of the feast with bread that has no yeast in it . The sheep had to be killed for the Passover Feast . His disciples asked Jesus Where do you want us to make ready for you to eat the Passover Feast ?
41014013	He sent two of his disciples and said to them , Go into the city . There you will meet a man who is carrying a pot of water . Follow him .
41014014	When he goes into a house , talk to the master of the house . Say to him , " The Teacher says , Where is my room where I can eat the Passover Feast with my disciples ? "
41014015	The man will show you a large room upstairs . It will be all fixed up and ready . Get the Passover food ready for us there .
41014016	The disciples went to the city . They found everything just as he had said . There they made the Passover food ready .
41014017	In the evening he came with the twelve disciples .
41014018	While they were sitting at the table eating , Jesus said , I tell you the truth . One of you who is eating with me will give me over to people who hate me .
41014019	They were sad and troubled . One after the other began to say to him , Lord , is it I ?
41014020	Jesus answered them , It is one of you twelve . It is the one who puts his hand in the same dish with me .
41014021	The Son of Man will go just as the holy writings tell about him . But the man who gives him over will have trouble . It would have been better for that man if he had not been born !
41014022	As they were eating , Jesus took some bread . He thanked God for it and broke it . Then he gave it to the disciples and said , Take this bread and eat it . It is my body .
41014023	He also took a cup . He thanked God for it . Then he gave it to them . They all drank some of it .
41014024	Then he said to them , This is my blood . It is given for many people . It makes the agreement strong .
41014025	I tell you the truth . I will not drink any of the fruit of the vine again until I drink some of it new in the kingdom of God .
41014026	They sang a song and then went out to the hill called Olives .
41014027	Jesus said to them , All of you will leave me this night . the holy writings say , " I will kill the one who takes care of the sheep . And the sheep will run away . "
41014028	But after I am raised from death , I will go to Galilee to meet you .
41014029	Peter said , Even if all the others leave you , I will never leave you .
41014030	Jesus said , I tell you the truth . This very night , before the cock calls two times , you will say three times that you do not know me .
41014031	Peter said , Even if I must die with you , I will never say I do not know you ! They all said the same thing .
41014032	Then they came to a place called Gethsemane . Jesus said to his disciples , Sit here . I will go and talk with God .
41014033	He took Peter , James , and John along with him . Jesus began to be sad and troubled .
41014034	He said to them , My heart is very sad . I am almost dying ! Stay here and watch .
41014035	Jesus went on a little farther . He fell on the ground and asked God that , if it could be so , this big trouble might pass by him .
41014036	He said , Oh , my Father , you can do all things . Take this cup away from me . But do not do what I want , but what you want .
41014037	Jesus went back and found the disciples sleeping . He said to Peter , Simon , are you sleeping ? Could you not watch one hour ?
41014038	All of you must watch and talk with God so that you will not do wrong . A persons heart can want to do it , but his body is weak .
41014039	Jesus went away again and said the same words to God again .
41014040	Jesus went back again and found the disciples sleeping . They could not keep their eyes open . They did not know what to say to Jesus .
41014041	Then he went back the third time . He said , Are you still sleeping and resting ? . It is enough . The time has come now . The Son of Man is given over to bad people .
41014042	Get up . Let us go . Look , here comes the one who will give me over to people who hate me !
41014043	While he was saying this , Judas came . He was one of the twelve disciples . Many people came with him . They had long knives or swords and big sticks . The chief priests , the scribes , and the leaders had sent them .
41014044	The man who was going to help them catch Jesus had told them that he would give them a sign . He said , The man that I kiss is the one . Catch him and take him away safely .
41014045	So when he came , he went to Jesus right away . He said , Master ! And he kissed him .
41014046	Then they caught Jesus and held him .
41014047	One of the men standing by took his sword . He cut off the ear of the high priests servant .
41014048	Jesus said , Have you come to take me with knives and sticks the way you would take a man who steals ?
41014049	Every day I was with you in the temple and taught . You did not catch me then . But what the holy writings say will come true .
41014050	Then all of the disciples left Jesus and ran away .
41014051	A young man went with Jesus . He had a piece of cloth about him . The people caught him .
41014052	But he left the cloth behind and ran away without any clothes on .
41014053	The people took Jesus away to the high priest . All the chief priests , the leaders , and the scribes met there .
41014054	Peter followed far behind Jesus . He went into the yard of the high priests house . He sat down with the people who worked for the high priest . He warmed himself by the fire .
41014055	The chief priests , and all the judges of the court tried to find men to say Jesus had done something wrong so they could kill him . But they found none .
41014056	Many people came and said things that were not true . But one said this thing and the other said that thing .
41014057	Then some stood up to talk against Jesus .
41014058	They said , We heard him say , " I will break down this temple which people have built with hands . In three days I will build another temple but not with hands . "
41014059	Others said , No , that is not what he said .
41014060	The high priest stood up among the people and asked Jesus , Have you no answer ? What do you have to say about this ? They have said something against you .
41014061	But Jesus said nothing at all . Then the high priest asked him , Are you the Christ , the Son of the Blessed One ?
41014062	Jesus answered , Yes , I am . You will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the One who has all power . You will see him coming on the clouds of the sky !
41014063	Then the high priest tore his clothes and said , We do not need any more proof against him .
41014064	What he has said is wrong ! What do you think ? They all said , He should be killed .
41014065	Some people began to spit on him . They covered his face and hit him . They laughed at him and said , Tell us if you know who hit you ! The guards took him away and hit him as they went .
41014066	Peter sat out in the yard . A servant girl who worked for the high priest came .
41014067	She saw Peter warming himself by the fire . She looked at him and said , You were also with Jesus of Nazareth .
41014068	But Peter said , I do not know or understand what you are talking about . Peter went out to the gate . Then a cock called .
41014069	A girl saw Peter there and said to the other people standing by , This man is one of them .
41014070	But again Peter said he was not . A little while after , those standing around said to Peter , Surely you are one of them also . You come from Galilee .
41014071	Then Peter began to curse and say bad words . He said , I do not know this man you are talking about !
41014072	Right then the cock called a second time and Peter remembered that Jesus had said , Before the cock calls two times , you will say three times that you do not know me . Then he broke down and cried .
41015001	As soon as it was morning , the chief priests , leaders , and the scribes talked together . They tied Jesus and took him before Pilate to be judged .
41015002	Pilate asked him , Are you the King of the Jews ? Jesus answered , Yes , I am .
41015003	The chief priests brought many complaints against Jesus .
41015004	Then Pilate asked him , Have you nothing to say ? These people are bringing many complaints against you !
41015005	But Jesus said nothing . Pilate was very much surprised about this .
41015006	At the feast Pilate used to let one prisoner free . He let the people choose the man they wanted to go free .
41015007	In the prison was a man named Barabbas . He had led some people who had been fighting in the city . He had killed a man .
41015008	The people started shouting . They asked Pilate to let one prisoner free , as he used to do .
41015009	Then Pilate asked , Do you want me to let the King of the Jews go free ?
41015010	He knew that the chief priests did not like Jesus . He knew that was why they brought Jesus to him .
41015011	But the chief priests talked to the people . They told them to ask Pilate to let Barabbas go free .
41015012	Pilate asked them , Then what shall I do with the man whom you call King of the Jews ?
41015013	They shouted back , Nail him to a cross !
41015014	Pilate then asked , Why , what wrong thing has he done ? But they shouted even more , Nail him to a cross !
41015015	Pilate wanted to please the people , so he let Barabbas go free . He told the soldiers to beat Jesus and nail him to a cross .
41015016	The soldiers took Jesus to a room . They called all the soldiers together .
41015017	They put a red gown on Jesus . They made a big ring of thorns like a crown and put it on his head .
41015018	Then they began to speak to him as if he were a king . They shouted , Greetings , King of the Jews !
41015019	They hit him on the head with a stick and spat on him . They kneeled down before him as if to give him great respect .
41015020	When they had made fun of him , they took off the red gown and put his own clothes on him again . Then they took Jesus out of the city to nail him to a cross .
41015021	man was coming in from the farms . His name was Simon . He was born in the country of Cyrene . Alexander and Rufus were his sons . The soldiers caught Simon and made him carry Jesus cross .
41015022	They took Jesus to Golgotha . That means the place of a head bone .
41015023	They wanted Jesus to drink wine mixed with something bitter . But Jesus would not drink it .
41015024	Then they nailed him to a cross . They gambled to see how they should divide Jesus clothes .
41015025	It was nine oclock in the morning when they nailed him on the cross .
41015026	They put the complaint they had against him above Jesus head . It was , The King of the Jews .
41015027	They also nailed two bad men on crosses there . One was put on the right side of Jesus and one was put on the left side of Jesus .
41015028	The holy writings say , He was counted as one of the bad people . It came true .
41015029	The people who passed by said wrong things about him . They shook their heads and said , Ha , ha ! You are the man who said you could break down the temple and build it again in three days .
41015030	Save yourself and come down from the cross .
41015031	The chief priests and the scribes also made fun of him . He saved other people , but he cannot save himself !
41015032	If he is the Christ , the king of the people of Israel , he should come down from the cross now . We want to see it and believe ! The bad men who were also nailed to crosses said the same things to him .
41015033	About midday the whole land became dark and stayed dark for three hours .
41015034	About three oclock , Jesus called out loud , Eloi , Eloi , lama sabachthani ? That means , My God , my God , why have you left me alone ?
41015035	Some of the people standing there heard what Jesus said . They said , Listen , he is calling for Elijah !
41015036	One man ran to get something called a sponge . He made it wet with sour wine and put it on the end of a stick . With it he gave Jesus a drink . He said , We will see if Elijah will come and take him down !
41015037	Then Jesus called out loud . Then he died .
41015038	The big cloth that hung in the temple was torn into two pieces . It was torn from the top down to the bottom .
41015039	The captain who stood in front of Jesus saw that he died . He said , Surely , this man was Gods Son .
41015040	Some women were watching from far away . Among these women were Mary Magdalene , Mary the mother of the younger James and Joses , and Salome .
41015041	When Jesus was in Galilee , they came with him and helped him . Some other women who had come to Jerusalem with Jesus were also watching .
41015042	It was now evening of the day before the Sabbath .
41015043	Joseph of Arimathaea was a member of the court . He was a good man . He also was looking for the kingdom of God . He was not afraid , but went to Pilate and asked him for Jesus body .
41015044	Pilate was surprised to hear that Jesus was dead already . He called the captain and asked him if Jesus was dead .
41015045	The captain told him that he was . Then Pilate let Joseph take the body .
41015046	Joseph went to buy some cloth . Then he took Jesus down and wrapped him in the cloth . He laid him in a grave that had been cut in a rock . Then he rolled a very big stone to close the grave .
41015047	Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where they laid Jesus .
41016001	The Sabbath day was past . Mary Magdalene , Mary the mother of James , and Salome came to the grave . They brought spices that smelled very nice to put on the body of Jesus .
41016002	They came to the grave on the first day of the week . It was very early in the morning . The sun was beginning to shine .
41016003	One woman said to the other , Who will roll away the big stone from the grave for us ?
41016004	The stone was very big . When they looked up they saw that the stone was rolled away .
41016005	So they went in the grave . They saw a young man dressed in a white gown . He sat at the right side . They were very much surprised .
41016006	He said , Do not be surprised . You are looking for Jesus of Nazareth who was nailed to a cross . He is risen . He is not here . Look , here is where they laid him .
41016007	Go and tell his disciples and Peter . Tell them he is going to Galilee before you . You will see him there as he said to you .
41016008	Then they left the grave quickly . They were trembling and afraid . They did not talk to anyone about it because they were afraid .
41016009	Jesus rose early on the first day of the week . He showed himself first to Mary Magdalene . Jesus had driven seven bad spirits out of her .
41016010	She went and told the disciples that she had seen him . They were still crying because Jesus was dead .
41016011	Mary told them that he was living . She had seen him . But they would not believe it .
41016012	After this , Jesus came to two disciples . He looked like a different person . They were walking out in the country .
41016013	They went back and told the rest of the disciples , but they would not believe them either .
41016014	Then after that Jesus showed himself to the eleven disciples while they were eating . He said it was very bad for them not to believe and for their minds to be slow . He said they should have believed those who saw him after he rose from death .
41016015	Then Jesus said to them , Go into every part of the world . Tell the good news to everyone .
41016016	The one who believes the good news and is baptised will be saved . But he who does not believe will be judged and punished .
41016017	These signs will be with those who believe . They will drive bad spirits out of people by using my name . They will speak new languages .
41016018	They will take up snakes . If they drink poison , it will not make them sick . They will put their hands on sick people and sick people will get well again .
41016019	So after the Lord Jesus had talked to them , he went up into heaven and sat down beside God .
41016020	Then the disciples went and told the good news everywhere . The Lord worked with them . He made their words come true by the signs that happened after they talked .
42001001	Many people have tried already to write down the things that have happened among us .
42001002	These things were told us by men who saw them happen from the time they began to happen . And these men helped tell the good news .
42001003	I have tried to find out all that has happened from the beginning . And so , Theophilus , great ruler , I myself will write you the whole story .
42001004	Then you will know that the things people have told you are true .
42001005	When Herod was king of Judea , there was a priest named Zechariah . He was one of a group of priests , and Abijah was their leader . Zechariahs wife Elizabeth came from the family of Aaron .
42001006	Both of them were good people as God saw them . They obeyed all the laws and the things that the Lord said they should do .
42001007	But they had no children . Elizabeth was not able to have a baby and they were both very old .
42001008	Zechariah was doing his work one day as a priest to God . It was time for his group to do the work in the temple .
42001009	The priests had a certain way of dividing their work . This day it was Zechariahs turn to go into the temple of the Lord and burn the incense [ that smells sweet when it is burned ] .
42001010	All the people were talking to God outside the temple at this time .
42001011	An angel of the Lord came to Zechariah . He was standing on the right side of the incense table .
42001012	When Zechariah saw him , he was surprised and afraid .
42001013	But the angel said , Do not be afraid , Zechariah . You have been talking to God . He has heard you . Your wife Elizabeth will have a son . Name him John .
42001014	You will be glad and happy . Many people will be glad when he is born .
42001015	He will be great in the way the Lord calls people great . He must not drink wine or any strong drink . He will be filled with the Holy Spirit from the time he is born .
42001016	He will bring back many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God .
42001017	He will go ahead of the Lord . He will have the spirit and power of Elijah . He will turn the hearts of the fathers to their children . And he will bring back the people who do not obey , so that they will want to do what good people do . He will make people ready for the Lord .
42001018	Then Zechariah said to the angel , How can I know that this will happen ? I am an old man and my wife is also old .
42001019	The angel answered him , I am Gabriel and I stand before God . I have been sent to talk to you and to bring you this good news .
42001020	Now listen . You will be silent and not be able to talk until the day that all this has happened . This is because you did not believe what I told you . At the right time all that I said will come true .
42001021	the people were waiting for Zechariah to come out of the temple . They were surprised that he stayed in so long .
42001022	When he came out , he could not talk to them . They knew that he had seen something in the temple . He made signs to them with his hands and did not talk .
42001023	When his time for doing the work of a priest was finished , Zechariah went home .
42001024	After that , his wife Elizabeth found she was going to have a baby . For five months she stayed away from people .
42001025	She said to herself , The Lord has done this for me . At this time he has remembered me so that I need not be ashamed among people anymore .
42001026	Elizabeth was now in her sixth month . God sent the angel Gabriel to the town of Nazareth in Galilee .
42001027	The angel was sent to a young woman there . Her name was Mary . She was promised to a man named Joseph , to be his wife . He was of Davids family line .
42001028	The angel went into the house and said to her , Be happy ! God has blessed you more than other women . The Lord is with you !
42001029	What the angel said troubled Mary . She wondered what this greeting meant .
42001030	The angel said to her , Do not be afraid , Mary . God has blessed you .
42001031	You will have a baby son . Name him Jesus .
42001032	He will be a great man . He will be called the Son of the Highest One [ a name for God ] . The Lord God will make him king where his father David was king .
42001033	He will be king over the people of Israel for ever . He will never stop being king .
42001034	Then Mary said to the angel , How can this happen ? I have no husband .
42001035	The angel answered , The Holy Spirit will come to you . The power of the Highest One will be over you . That is why the holy child who is to be born will be called the Son of God .
42001036	Your cousin Elizabeth is also going to have a baby son , though she is an old woman . This is the sixth month for her . She is one whom people said would not have a baby .
42001037	But God can do anything .
42001038	Mary said , I am the Lords servant . Let it be as you have said . Then the angel left her .
42001039	At that time , Mary got ready and went as quickly as she could to the hill country . She went to a town in Judah .
42001040	She went into the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth .
42001041	When Elizabeth heard Marys greeting , the baby in her moved . Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit .
42001042	She said in a loud voice , God has made you happy and blessed you more than all other women . He has blessed your baby .
42001043	Who am I that the mother of my Lord should come to me ?
42001044	Listen ! When I heard your greeting , the baby inside me moved because he was glad .
42001045	She who has believed what was told her is blessed . What the Lord said to her will come true .
42001046	Mary said , My heart is praising the Lord .
42001047	And my spirit is happy because God has saved me .
42001048	He has remembered his servant even though she is not a great person . From now on all people of all times will say God has blessed me .
42001049	He who has all power has done a big work for me . His name is holy .
42001050	He is kind to people of all times who respect him .
42001051	He has shown how strong he is with his arm . He has taken away people who were proud in their hearts .
42001052	He has moved big rulers from power , and those that were not great he has made great .
42001053	He has given hungry people good things to eat , and sent away the rich people with nothing .
42001054	He has helped his servant Israel .
42001055	He has remembered to be kind just as he said to our fathers of long ago . He promised to be kind to Abraham and his childrens children for ever .
42001056	Mary stayed with Elizabeth for three months . Then she went home .
42001057	The time had now come for Elizabeths child to be born . She had a son .
42001058	When her neighbours and family heard that the Lord had been so kind to her , they were glad , too .
42001059	On the eighth day people came to circumcise [ make a special mark on ] the child . They were going to name him Zechariah like his father .
42001060	But his mother said , No , his name is to be John .
42001061	They said to her , But no one in your family has that name .
42001062	They made signs to the father to find out what name he wanted the child to have .
42001063	He asked for something to write on . He wrote , His name is John . They were all surprised .
42001064	Right then he opened his mouth and his tongue was free . He began to speak and to praise God .
42001065	Everyone who lived around there began to wonder at these things . And everywhere in the hill country of Judea , all these things were talked about .
42001066	All those who heard them thought much about them . They said , What will this child be some day ? They said this because the power of the Lord was with him .
42001067	Then his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke words from God .
42001068	He said , Praise the Lord God of Israel ! He has remembered his people , and set them free .
42001069	He has chosen one from the family of his servant David . He has given him power to save us .
42001070	That is what he promised through his holy prophets of God long ago .
42001071	He said he would save us from our enemies and set us free from those who hate us .
42001072	He said he would be kind to our fathers . He said he would remember his agreement with them .
42001073	That was what he promised our father Abraham he would surely do . He promised to set us free from our enemies . He promised that we should be without fear . He promised that we would worship him and be holy and good before him as long as we live .
42001076	You , my child , will be called the prophet or messenger of the Highest One . You will go ahead of the Lord to make his way ready .
42001077	You will tell his people how to be saved by being forgiven for their wrong ways .
42001078	Our God is kind . A light from heaven will shine .
42001079	That light will shine on those who are in darkness , and are going to die . That light will show us how to walk in peace .
42001080	The child grew . He became strong in spirit . He lived in the desert until the day when he came to the people of Israel .
42002001	About that time , Augustus the Roman ruler made a law . All the people in the world must have their names written down in a book .
42002002	This was the first time names were written in a book in this way . Quirinius was the ruler of Syria at that time .
42002003	Everyone went to his home town to have his name written in the book .
42002004	Joseph also went from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to the town of Bethlehem in Judea . This was Davids town , and Joseph came from Davids family line .
42002005	He went to have his name written in the book . Joseph took Mary with him . She was promised to Joseph to be his wife . She was going to have a baby .
42002006	While they were there , the time came for her baby to be born .
42002007	This was her first child , a son . She wrapped him in a cloth and laid him in a box where cows feed . There was no room for them in the house for strangers .
42002008	In the same part of the country , men were taking care of sheep . They were in the field watching their sheep at night .
42002009	An angel of the Lord came to them and a bright light from the Lord shone all around them . They were very much afraid .
42002010	The angel said to them , Fear not ! Listen , I bring you good news ! This news will make you very glad . It is for all people .
42002011	A saviour has been born for you today in Davids town . He is Christ the Lord .
42002012	This is the way you will know him . You will find a baby wrapped in a cloth , lying in a box where cows feed .
42002013	All at once a great number of angels from heaven were with the angel . They were praising God .
42002014	They said , Praise God in the highest heaven ! Peace on earth and loving mercy towards all people !
42002015	The angels left them and went back to heaven . The men who were taking care of the sheep said to one another Let us go to Bethlehem and see what has happened . It is the Lord who has told us about it .
42002016	They went quickly . They found Mary and Joseph , and the baby lying in the box where cows feed .
42002017	When they saw the child , they told what the angel had said to them about him .
42002018	All those who heard them were surprised at what the shepherds had told them .
42002019	Mary remembered all these things and kept thinking about them .
42002020	Then the men who were taking care of the sheep went back . They praised and thanked God for all they had heard and seen . It was just as they had been told it would be .
42002021	When the child was eight days old , it was time to circumcise him . They named him Jesus . That was the name the angel gave him before the baby began to grow inside Mary .
42002022	The time came when Mary was no longer unclean by the law of Moses . Joseph and Mary took Jesus to Jerusalem to bring him to the Lord .
42002023	This is what is written in the law of the Lord : Every boy who is the first child of his mother will be holy for the Lord .
42002024	They also came to make a sacrifice as an offering to God . The law of the Lord said , A pair of doves or two young pigeons .
42002025	A man named Simeon was in Jerusalem . He was a good man and he loved God . He was watching and waiting for the one who would save Israel . The Holy Spirit was on him .
42002026	The Holy Spirit had shown him that he would not die before he had seen the Lords Christ .
42002027	He came into the temple , led by the Spirit . The parents brought in the child Jesus to do what the law said they should do about him .
42002028	Then Simeon took Jesus in his arms and praised God .
42002029	He said , Lord , now you are letting your servant go in peace , just as you said .
42002030	I have seen with my own eyes the one you have sent to save people .
42002031	You have made this way for all peoples to be saved .
42002032	He is a light which will shine for those who do not know God . He is the one who will bring praise to your people Israel .
42002033	Joseph and Mary were surprised at the things Simeon said about Jesus .
42002034	Simeon blessed them . He said to Mary , the mother of Jesus , He will be a sign that people do not believe in . He will make many people in Israel fall and rise .
42002035	( Yes , a long knife will cut your heart too . ) What people think will be made known .
42002036	Anna , a woman prophet of God , was there too . Her fathers name was Phanuel . She was of the tribe of Asher . She was very old . She had been married and lived with her husband for seven years .
42002037	Then her husband died . Now she had been alone for eighty-four years . She did not leave the temple , but worshipped day and night . She talked with God and fasted [ did not eat food for a time ] .
42002038	While Simeon was talking to Mary , Anna also came along and thanked God . She talked about Jesus to all the people who were waiting for the one who would set Jerusalem free .
42002039	The parents did everything that the law of the Lord said they should do . Then they went back to Galilee to their own town , Nazareth .
42002040	The child grew . He became strong and very wise . And God blessed him .
42002041	Every year his parents went to Jerusalem for the Passover Feast [ a special time to thank God ] .
42002042	When Jesus was twelve years old , they went to Jerusalem for the feast as they always did .
42002043	After the days of the feast were finished , they started home . But the boy Jesus stayed in Jerusalem . His parents did not know it .
42002044	They thought he was coming with the rest of the people . They travelled one day . Then they looked for him among their family and friends .
42002045	But they did not find him . So they went back to Jerusalem and looked for him .
42002046	On the third day they found him in the temple . He was sitting in front of the teachers of the law . He was listening to them and asking them questions .
42002047	All who heard him were surprised at what he knew and his answers .
42002048	His parents were surprised when they saw him . His mother said to him , Son , why have you done this to us ? Your father and I have been looking for you . We have been very troubled .
42002049	He said to them , Why did you look for me ? Did you not know that I had to be in my Fathers house ?
42002050	They did not understand what he meant .
42002051	He went with them back to Nazareth and obeyed them . But his mother remembered all these things .
42002052	Jesus grew and became wiser and taller . He pleased God and also people .
42003001	Tiberius Caesar had been king for fifteen years . Pontius Pilate was the ruler of Judea . Herod was the ruler of Galilee . Herods brother Philip was the ruler of Iturea and Trachonitis . Lysanias was the ruler of Abilene .
42003002	Annas and Caiaphas were high priests . At that time God spoke to John in the desert . John was the son of Zechariah .
42003003	Then John went to all the country around the Jordan River . He told the people to stop doing wrong things , turn back to God and be baptised . And God would forgive them for the wrong things they did .
42003004	Isaiah , the prophet of God , wrote about him long ago in his book : A man is calling out in the desert : " Make the way ready for the Lord . Make the road straight for him .
42003005	Every valley will be filled . Every big hill and every small hill will be cut down flat . Crooked roads will be made into straight roads . Bad roads will be made into good roads .
42003006	And all people will see that God can save . "
42003007	Many people came out to John to be baptised . He said to them , You family of snakes ! Who told you to run away from Gods anger that is coming ?
42003008	Do good things that will show you have stopped your wrong ways ! Do not begin to say to yourselves , " We are Abrahams children . " I tell you , God can make children for Abraham from these stones .
42003009	The axe is ready to cut down the trees . Every tree that does not have good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire .
42003010	The people asked John , What shall we do ?
42003011	John answered them , Any man who has two shirts should give one to a man who has none . Any man who has food should do the same .
42003012	Tax collectors also came to be baptised . They asked John , Sir , what shall we do ?
42003013	He said to them , Do not make people pay more money than you are told to .
42003014	Some soldiers also asked him , What shall we do ? He answered them Do not force people . Do not tell lies about people . Do not want more pay than you get .
42003015	The people were waiting to see what would happen . They were all asking about John . They thought that he might be the Christ , the great king promised by God long ago .
42003016	John said to them all , I baptise you with water . But another person is coming . He is greater than I am . I am not good enough to untie his shoe strings . He will baptise you with the Holy spirit and with fire .
42003017	He has a cleaning fan in his hand and will fan his grain very clean . He will put the grain into his storehouse . But he will burn the chaff in the fire that never goes out .
42003018	By these words and many other ways , he told the people the good news .
42003019	John told Herod the ruler that he had done wrong things . He told him he should not have his brothers wife , Herodias . He also told him about all the other wrong things he had done .
42003020	Later on Herod did another wrong thing after all those wrong things . He put John in prison .
42003021	When all the other people had been baptised , Jesus was also baptised . While he was talking with God , the sky opened .
42003022	The Holy Spirit came down upon him like a dove . And a voice from the sky said , You are my dear Son . I am very pleased with you .
42003023	Jesus was about thirty years old when he began his work . The people thought he was Josephs son .

42004001	Jesus was full of the Holy Spirit . He left the Jordan River , and the Spirit led him into the desert for forty days .
42004002	The devil tried to make him do wrong . Jesus did not eat in those forty days . Then he was very hungry .
42004003	The devil said to him , If you are Gods Son , tell this stone to be changed into bread .
42004004	Jesus answered him , The holy writings say , " Man cannot live on bread only . "
42004005	The devil took Jesus to a high place where he could see all the countries of the world at one time .
42004006	He said to Jesus , I will give you the right to rule over all these countries . They will make you great . All this has been given to me . I can give it to anyone I want .
42004007	So , if you worship and give honour to me , all will be yours .
42004008	Jesus answered him , The holy writings say , " You must worship the Lord your God and he is the only one you are to worship . "
42004009	The devil took Jesus to Jerusalem . He put him on a high part of the temple . He said to him , If you are Gods Son , jump down .
42004010	The holy writings say , " God will tell his angels to take care of you . "
42004011	And " They will hold you up in their hands so that you will not knock your foot on a stone . "
42004012	Jesus answered him , The holy writings say , " You must not test the Lord your God . "
42004013	When the devil finished all his testing , he left him for a while .
42004014	Jesus had the power of the Spirit when he went back to Galilee . People talked about him in all that part of the country .
42004015	He taught them in their meeting houses . All the people praised him .
42004016	He went to Nazareth where he had grown up . He went to the meeting house as he always did on the Sabbath day . He stood up to read .
42004017	A man gave him the book that Isaiah the prophet of God wrote long ago . He opened the book and found the place where it says ,
42004018	The Spirit of the Lord is on me because he chose me to tell the good news to poor people . He has sent me to tell the prisoners they can go free , and to tell the blind people they can see . He has sent me to set free those who have been wrongly held down ,
42004019	and to tell people that the year when the Lord will help them has come .
42004020	Then Jesus closed the book and gave it back to the man . He sat down . Everyone in the meeting house was watching him .
42004021	He began to talk to them . He said , You have heard what the holy writings say . They have come true today .
42004022	They all began to talk about him . They were surprised to hear him say such good words . They asked , Is not this Josephs son ?
42004023	Then Jesus said , I know that you will say this to me " Doctor , heal yourself . We have heard what you did in Capernaum . Do the same things here in your own country . "
42004024	And he went on to say , I tell you the truth . No prophet of God is accepted by the people in his own country .
42004025	I tell you the truth . At the time of Elijah , there were many women in Israel whose husbands were dead . There was no rain for three years and six months . All over the country there was great trouble because there was no food .
42004026	But Elijah was not sent to any of these widowed women in Israel . He was sent to a widow at Zarephath in Sidon .
42004027	Also while Elisha was the prophet of God , many people in Israel had leprosy [ a bad skin disease ] . None of them was healed . The only one who was healed was Naaman from the country of Syria .
42004028	When they heard this , all the people in the meeting house were very angry .
42004029	They jumped to their feet and put Jesus out of the town . Their town was built on a hill . They took Jesus out to the top and wanted to throw him down the hill .
42004030	But Jesus walked out between them and went away .
42004031	Jesus went to the town of Capernaum in Galilee . He taught the people there on the Sabbath day .
42004032	They were surprised at his teaching because he taught them as if he had the right to teach them .
42004033	A man who had a bad spirit in him was in the meeting house . He called in a loud voice .
42004034	He said , Jesus from Nazareth ! What do you want to do to us ? Have you come to kill us ? I know who you are . You are Gods Holy Man .
42004035	Jesus said to him , Be quiet ! Come out of him ! The bad spirit threw the man down in front of them . He came out of the man and did not hurt him .
42004036	All the people were very much surprised . They said to each other , What kind of talk is this ? He can make bad spirits obey him . He tells them to come out and they come out .
42004037	The people in all the places around Capernaum heard about him .
42004038	Jesus left the meeting house and went to Simons house . The mother of Simons wife was sick with a bad fever . They asked Jesus to help her .
42004039	He went and stood beside her . He told the fever to leave her . It left . She got up right away and began to do things for them .
42004040	When the sun went down , the people brought to Jesus all who were sick in any way . He put his hands on every one of them and healed them .
42004041	The bad spirits also came out of many people . They called out , You are the Son of God ! But he stopped them . He would not let them talk because they knew that he was the Christ .
42004042	The next morning Jesus went away to a place by himself . The people went to look for him . When they found him , they did not want him to leave them .
42004043	But he said to them , I must tell the good news to the people in other towns also . It is the news of Gods kingdom . I was sent to tell this .
42004044	So he told Gods word in the meeting houses in the Galilee area .
42005001	The people came close around Jesus to hear Gods word . He was standing by Lake Gennesaret [ the Sea of Galilee ] .
42005002	He saw two boats by the water . The fishermen were not in their boats . They were washing their nets .
42005003	Jesus got into one of the boats . It was Simons boat . Jesus asked him to put the boat out into the water a little way from the land . Then he sat down in the boat and taught the people .
42005004	When he stopped talking , he said to Simon , Put the boat out into deep water and let down your nets to catch some fish .
42005005	Simon answered , Master , we worked hard all night and did not catch anything . But because you say so , I will let down the nets .
42005006	When they did this , they caught many fish . Their nets were so full they were breaking .
42005007	They called their friends in the other boat to come and help them . They came . They filled both boats with so much fish , they began to go down .
42005008	When Simon Peter saw this , he kneeled down in front of Jesus . He said , Lord , leave me because I am a bad man !
42005009	He was very much surprised to see how many fish they had caught . All those who were with him were surprised too .
42005010	James and John , the sons of Zebedee , were helping Simon . They were surprised also . Jesus said to Simon , Do not fear . From now on your work will be to catch men .
42005011	They brought their boats to the land . Then they left everything and went with Jesus .
42005012	Jesus was in one of the cities and a man was there who had leprosy , a bad skin disease . When he saw Jesus , he bowed his face to the ground . He begged Jesus saying , Sir , I know you can heal me if you want to .
42005013	Jesus put out his hand and touched the man . He said , I want you to be healed . Right away the man was free from leprosy .
42005014	Jesus said to him , Do not tell anyone about this . But go and let the priest look at you . Moses gave a law about the sacrifice you must give when you are healed . Give it to prove to the people that you are healed .
42005015	But more people heard about Jesus than before . And many people gathered to hear him , and so be healed .
42005016	Many times Jesus went away to the desert and talked with God .
42005017	One day Jesus was teaching people . Pharisees and other Jewish teachers of the law were sitting there . They had come from every town in Galilee and Judea , and from Jerusalem . Jesus had the power of the Lord to heal the sick .
42005018	Some men brought a sick man on his bed . The man could not move his arms or legs . They tried to bring him in and put him in front of Jesus .
42005019	But they could not get in the house where Jesus was , because there were so many people . So they went up on the roof . Then through a hole in the roof they let down the bed with the sick man on it , until he was in front of Jesus .
42005020	Jesus saw that they believed he would be healed . So he said to him , Man , the wrong things you have done are forgiven .
42005021	The scribes and Pharisees began to talk about this . They said , Who is this man that is not giving respect to God ? No one but God can forgive anyone for the wrong things they have done .
42005022	Jesus knew what they were thinking . He said , Why do you think these wrong things in your hearts ?
42005023	Which is easier , to say , " The wrong things you have done are forgiven , " or to say , " Get up and walk " ?
42005024	I want you to know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive wrong things people have done . So he said to the sick man , I tell you , get up . Take up your bed and go home .
42005025	Right away the man stood up in front of them . He took up his bed and went home praising God .
42005026	The people were all surprised and they praised God . They did not know what to think . They said , We have seen things today that are hard to believe .
42005027	After this , Jesus went out . He saw a tax collector named Levi . Levi was sitting at the place where people came to pay taxes . Jesus said to him Come with me .
42005028	Levi left everything . He stood up and went with Jesus .
42005029	Levi made a big dinner at his house for Jesus . Many tax collectors and other people were sitting at the table with them .
42005030	The Pharisees and their scribes did not like what Jesus disciples did . They said , Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and bad people ? "
42005031	Jesus answered them , People who are well do not need a doctor . But sick people need him .
42005032	I did not come to call good people . I came to call bad people to stop doing wrong things .
42005033	They said to him , The disciples or followers of John are often fasting [ not eating for a time ] , and they talk with God . The disciples of the Pharisees do the same . But your disciples eat and drink .
42005034	Then Jesus said to them , The people at a wedding cannot be sad while the man who is married is with them .
42005035	But the time will come when he will be taken away from them . Then they will be fasting at that time .
42005036	Jesus told them a short story . He said , No one takes a piece from a new coat and sews it on an old coat . If he does , the new coat will have a hole . And the new piece will not be like the old coat .
42005037	No one puts new wine into old wineskins . If he does , the new wine will break the skins . The wine will be lost and the skins will be spoiled .
42005038	New wine must be put into new skins .
42005039	No one wants to drink new wine after he has had old wine . He says , " The old is better . "
42006001	Jesus was walking through the grain fields on a Sabbath day . His disciples picked some of the grain as they went along . They cleaned it by rubbing it in their hands , and ate it .
42006002	Some of the Pharisees said , Why do your disciples do what is not right on the Sabbath day ? "
42006003	Jesus answered them , Have you not read what David did ? He and his men were hungry .
42006004	He went into Gods house . Some bread was there for God . But David took the bread and ate it . He also gave some of it to the men who were with him . Only the priests have the right to eat that bread .
42006005	Jesus said to them , The Son of Man rules over the Sabbath day .
42006006	On another Sabbath day , Jesus went into the meeting house and taught . A man was there whose right hand was thin and weak .
42006007	The scribes and Pharisees watched Jesus to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath day . They wanted to find something wrong about Jesus .
42006008	But Jesus knew what they were thinking . He spoke to the man whose hand was thin and weak . He said , Come and stand here in front The man stood up .
42006009	Jesus said to them , I ask you , is it right to do good things on the Sabbath day , or to do wrong things ? Is it right to heal people so that they will live , or to let them die ?
42006010	He looked around at them all . Then he said to the man , Hold out your hand . The man did so and it was made well like the other hand .
42006011	The Pharisees were very angry and they talked together about what they could do to Jesus .
42006012	About that time Jesus went out of the city on the hill to talk with God . He talked with God all night .
42006013	In the morning he called his disciples to him . He chose twelve of them and called them apostles [ special messengers ] .
42006014	They were Simon , whom Jesus called Peter , and his brother Andrew , James and John , Philip and Bartholomew , Matthew and Thomas , James the son of Alphaeus , and Simon the freedom fighter , Judas the son of James , and Judas Iscariot , the one who gave Jesus over to people who hated him .
42006017	Then Jesus came down the hill with them and stood on the flat ground . Many people came . There were many of his disciples . And there were many people from all parts of Judea , and from Jerusalem , and from the seaside of Tyre and Sidon . They came to hear him and to be healed because they were sick .
42006018	Some were troubled by bad spirits , and they were healed .
42006019	All the people wanted to touch Jesus . Power came from him and he healed them all .
42006020	Jesus looked at his disciples and said , God will make happy you who are poor . The kingdom of God is for you .
42006021	God will make happy you who are hungry now . You will be filled . God will make happy you who cry now . You will laugh .
42006022	God will make you happy when people hate you , when they will not let you belong to their group , when they say wrong things about you and make your name bad . God blesses you when it is for the sake of the Son of Man .
42006023	Be very happy on that day and dance for joy . God will be good to you in heaven . The fathers of these people did the same things to the prophets of God long ago .
42006024	But you who are rich will have trouble . You have already had your good times .
42006025	You who have all you want now will have trouble ! You will be hungry . You who laugh now will have trouble . You will be sad and cry .
42006026	When all the people praise you , you will have trouble ! The fathers of these people did the same things to those who were not true prophets of God .
42006027	But I say to you who hear , love your enemies . Do good things to those who hate you .
42006028	Bless those who use bad words about you . Ask God to do good to those who trouble you .
42006029	If someone hits you on one side of your face , turn the other side also . If someone takes your coat , let him have your shirt also .
42006030	Give to every one who begs you for something .
42006031	Do to other people what you want them to do to you .
42006032	If you love those who love you , what good is there in that ? Even bad people love those who love them .
42006033	If you do good things to those who do good things to you , what good is there in that ? Bad people do the same .
42006034	If you lend to those who will give to you , what good is there in that ? Even bad people lend to bad people , if they think they will get the same from them .
42006035	Love your enemies . Do good things . Lend to people and do not look to get anything back . You will be paid well . You will be sons of the Highest One . He is kind to those who do not thank him and to those who are bad .
42006036	So be kind like your Father .
42006037	Do not judge others and you will not be judged . Do not punish others , and you will not be punished . Let others go free and God will let you go free .
42006038	Give to people and they will give to you . They will fill your cup , press it down , shake it , and let it run over . That is what they will give to you . How much you give to others is how much God will give to you .
42006039	Jesus also told the people a story . He said , A blind man cannot lead a blind man . They will both fall into a hole .
42006040	The one who learns is not better than his teacher . But every one who learns will be like his teacher when his teacher has finished teaching him .
42006041	Why do you look at the small piece of dust in your brothers eye ? And you do not see the big stick in your own eye .
42006042	How can you say to your brother , " Brother , let me take the dust out of your eye " ? But you do not see the stick in your own eye . You are not true to yourselves ! First take the stick out of your own eye . Then you will be able to see to take the dust out of your brothers eye .
42006043	A good tree does not have bad fruit . And also , a bad tree does not have good fruit .
42006044	Every kind of tree is known by its fruit . People do not pick fruit like figs from thorn trees . And they do not pick grapes from bramble bushes .
42006045	A good man has stored up good things in his heart , so he says good things . A bad man has stored up wrong things in his heart , so he will say wrong things . The mouth will say what is in the heart .
42006046	Why do you call me " Lord , Lord , " but you do not do what I tell you ?
42006047	A person comes to me . He hears what I say and obeys me . I will show you who he is like .
42006048	He is like a man who built a house . He dug down deep in the ground and made it stand on a rock . The water in the river came up high . The water beat hard against the house . But the house did not move , because it was built on a rock .
42006049	A man hears what I say but does not obey me . He is like a man who built his house on top of the ground . He did not dig down deep . The water beat hard against it and it fell with a loud noise !
42007001	Jesus finished saying all these things for the people to hear . Then he went to Capernaum .
42007002	An army officer had a servant whom he loved . The servant was sick and almost dying .
42007003	The officer heard of Jesus . So he sent some of the leaders of the Jews to him . He asked him to come and heal his servant .
42007004	They came to Jesus and begged him very much . They said , He is a good man . You should come and do this for him .
42007005	He loves our people and he built the meeting house for us .
42007006	Jesus went with them . When he came near the house , the officer sent some friends to meet him and to say , Sir , do not trouble yourself to come further . I am not good enough to have you come into my house .
42007007	And I did not think I was good enough to come to you . Just say the word and my servant will be healed .
42007008	I myself am a man who takes orders , and I have soldiers who take orders from me . I say to one , " Go , " and he goes . I say to another , " Come , " and he comes . I say to my servant , " Do this , " and he does it .
42007009	Jesus was surprised when he heard this . He turned to the people who followed him . He said , I tell you , I have not found a Jew who believes as this man does .
42007010	The men who had been sent to Jesus went back into the house . They found that the servant who had been sick was well .
42007011	Soon after that , Jesus went to the town of Nain . His disciples and many other people went with him .
42007012	He came near the gate of the town . There he met people carrying out a man who had died . He was the only son of his mother . And her husband was dead too . Many people from the city were with her .
42007013	The Lord saw her . He shared in her sorrows and troubles . He said to her , Do not cry .
42007014	Jesus came and touched the thing on which the body lay . The men who were carrying it stopped walking . Jesus said , Young man , I tell you , get up !
42007015	The dead man sat up and began to talk . Jesus gave him to his mother .
42007016	Everyone was very much surprised . They praised God . They said , A great prophet of God has come to us . God has remembered his people .
42007017	The people all over Judea and all the country around it heard what Jesus had done .
42007018	John also heard about all these things from his disciples .
42007019	He called two of them and sent them to Jesus . He asked , Are you the One who is to come ? Or shall we wait for another person ?
42007020	When the men came to Jesus , they said , John the Baptizer sent us to you . He asks , " Are you the One who is to come ? Or shall we wait for another person ? "
42007021	At that time Jesus healed many people who were sick or had troubles or bad spirits . He made many blind people able to see .
42007022	He answered Johns disciples , Go tell John what you have seen and heard . Blind people see . The lame people walk . People with leprosy are healed . People who could not hear can hear . Dead people are alive again . Poor people hear the good news .
42007023	Happy is the person who is not troubled in his heart about me .
42007024	When Johns messengers had gone away , Jesus began to talk to the people about John . He said , What did you go out into the desert to see ? Did you go out to see a tall grass moving in the wind ?
42007025	What did you go out to see ? A man wearing fine clothes ? People who wear fine clothes and have nice things live in kings houses .
42007026	What did you go out to see ? A prophet of God ? Yes , I tell you , and he is much more than a prophet .
42007027	He is the one the holy writings tell about : " See , I send my messenger ahead of you . He will make the way ready for you . "
42007028	I tell you , no one has ever been born who is greater than John . And yet , the smallest one in the kingdom of God is greater than he .
42007029	All the people and the tax collectors praised God when they heard that . They had been baptised by John .
42007030	But the Pharisees and teachers of the law would not follow Gods way and they were not baptised by John .
42007031	Jesus asked , What will I say that the people of today are like ? What are they like ?
42007032	They are like children who sit in the market . They call to other children . They say , " We played music for you , but you did not dance . We cried , but you did not cry . "
42007033	John the Baptizer came . He does not eat bread or drink wine . You say , " He has a bad spirit in him . "
42007034	The Son of Man came . He eats and drinks . You say , " This man eats and drinks too much ! He is a friend of tax collectors and bad people ! "
42007035	A man is proved wise by what he has done .
42007036	One of the Pharisees asked Jesus to come and eat with him . So Jesus went into the Pharisees house and sat down to eat .
42007037	In that city was a bad woman . When she knew that Jesus was eating at the Pharisees house , she came and brought a bottle of oil . It was oil that smelled very sweet and cost much money .
42007038	She stood behind Jesus by his feet , and she was crying . She began to wash his feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair . Then she kissed his feet and put oil on them .
42007039	The Pharisee who had asked Jesus to his house saw this . He said to himself , If this man were a prophet of God , he would know what kind of woman is touching him . She is a bad woman .
42007040	Jesus said to him , Simon , I have something to say to you . And he said , Teacher , say it .
42007041	Jesus said , There was a man who used to lend money to people . Two people owed him money . One man owed him five hundred pieces of silver money . The other owed him fifty pieces .
42007042	They could not pay the money , so he let them both free . Now which one of them will love him more ?
42007043	Simon answered , I would say the one he let off the most . Jesus said , You are right .
42007044	Then he turned towards the woman . He said to Simon , Do you see this woman ? I came into your house . You did not give me water to wash my feet . But she has washed my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair .
42007045	You did not kiss me . But since she came in , she has kissed my feet again and again .
42007046	You did not put oil on my head . But she has put sweet smelling oil on my feet .
42007047	So I tell you , she has done many wrong things , but she has been forgiven because she loved me so much . But one who has been forgiven a little loves me only a little
42007048	Jesus said to the woman , The wrong things you have done are forgiven .
42007049	Then those who were at the table with him began to say to themselves , Who is this man ? He even forgives people for the wrong things they have done .
42007050	Jesus said to the woman , You are saved because you believed . Go in peace .
42008001	Soon after this , Jesus went through the cities and towns . He told the people Gods word about the good news of the kingdom of God . The twelve disciples were with him .
42008002	Some women were also with him . They had bad spirits and had been sick . But they had been healed . One was Mary , called Magdalene . Seven bad spirits had gone out of her .
42008003	Another one was Joanna , the wife of Chuza , who worked for Herod . Another one was Susanna . And there were many others who gave what they could to help him .
42008004	Many people came to him from many towns . Then he told them a story .
42008005	He said , A man went out to sow his seed . As he sowed it , some seed fell on the road . People stepped on the seed . Birds ate it .
42008006	Some seed fell on the stony ground . It grew but soon died because the place was too dry .
42008007	Some seed fell among the weeds . The weeds grew up and made the new plants die .
42008008	But some seed fell on good ground and it grew well . Those plants gave a hundred times as much grain as the man sowed . When Jesus had said this , he called out , Everyone who has ears to hear , listen !
42008009	His disciples asked Jesus what this story meant .
42008010	He said to them , You can learn the secret things about the kingdom of God . But other people must have stories . They will look , but they will not see . They will hear , but they will not understand .
42008011	Now here is what the story means . The seed is Gods word .
42008012	Some seeds fell on the road . They are like the people who hear the word of God . Then the devil comes and takes the word out of their hearts . He does not want them to believe and be saved .
42008013	Some seeds fell on the stones . They are like people who are glad when they hear the word . But it does not go down deep into their hearts . They believe for a short time . But when they have trouble they stop believing .
42008014	Some seeds fell among the weeds . They are like people who hear the word . But they think about the things of this world . They want to get money and things to be happy in this life . As they go on in life , these things push the message out of their hearts and no good comes from them .
42008015	Some seeds fell on good ground . They are like people who hear the word and remember it . Their hearts are honest and good . These people keep on believing , and much good comes from them .
42008016	No person lights a lamp and covers it with a basket or puts it under a bed . But he puts it on the place for a lamp . Then people who come in can see the light .
42008017	Everything that is hidden will be seen . Everything that is secret will be known and come out to be seen .
42008018	So take care how you listen . Anyone who has something will get more . But he who does not have anything , even the little that he has will be taken away from him .
42008019	The mother of Jesus and his brothers came to him . They could not reach him because there were so many people around him .
42008020	Someone told him , Your mother and brothers are standing outside . They want to talk to you .
42008021	But he said to them , These people who hear the word of God and do it , they are my mother and my brothers .
42008022	One day Jesus got into a boat with his disciples . He said to them , Let us cross over to the other side of the sea . So they started out .
42008023	While they were going , Jesus was sleeping . A bad storm came on the sea . Water was coming into the boat , and they were in trouble .
42008024	The disciples came to Jesus and woke him . They shouted , Master ! Master ! We will die ! Jesus woke and said to the wind and the water , Stop ! They stopped . Then all was quiet
42008025	He said to the disciples , Why do you not believe God ? They were afraid and surprised . They said to each other , What kind of man is this ? He tells the wind and the sea what to do and they obey him .
42008026	They came to the other side of the sea , to the country of the Gadarene people . Their country is on the other side of the sea from Galilee .
42008027	As Jesus got out of the boat a man met him from the town . He had bad spirits in him . He had not worn clothes for a long time . He did not live in a house , but among the graves .
42008028	When he saw Jesus , he screamed loudly and bowed down in front of him . He called out loud , Jesus , Son of the Highest One ! What do you want to do to me ? I beg you , do not hurt me .
42008029	He said this because Jesus had told the bad spirit to come out of the man . Many times the spirit had taken hold of the man . People had guarded him . They had tied him with chains and strong ropes . But he broke the chains and ropes . The bad spirit drove him into the desert .
42008030	Jesus asked him , What is your name ? He answered , My name is An Army . He said this because many bad spirits had gone into him .
42008031	The spirits begged Jesus not to send them away to the big hole that has no bottom .
42008032	Many pigs were feeding on the hill there . The spirits begged Jesus to let them go into the pigs . Jesus let them .
42008033	The spirits came out of the man and went into the pigs . They ran fast down the steep hill into the sea . They died in the water .
42008034	The men who cared for the pigs saw what happened . They ran and told it to the people in the town and in the country .
42008035	The people went out to see what had happened . They came to Jesus . They saw the man from whom the bad spirits had gone . He was sitting near the feet of Jesus . He had clothes on and was not crazy any more . The people were afraid .
42008036	Those who had seen it told the people how the man had been saved from the bad spirits .
42008037	All the people in the country around the Gadarenes asked Jesus to go away from them to some other place . They were very much afraid . So Jesus got into a boat and went back .
42008038	The man from whom the bad spirits had gone begged to go with him . But Jesus sent him away .
42008039	He said , Go home and tell the people what God has done for you . So the man went away and told the people all through the town what Jesus had done for him .
42008040	When Jesus came back , the people were very glad to see him . They were all waiting for him .
42008041	A man named Jairus came to him . He was a ruler in the meeting house . He bowed down in front of Jesus and begged him to come to his house .
42008042	He had only one daughter She was about twelve years old . And she was dying . Many people went with Jesus and pushed against him .
42008043	A woman among them had a sickness for twelve years . She was bleeding all the time . She had given all her money to the doctors , but no one had been able to heal her .
42008044	She came behind Jesus and touched his clothes . The bleeding stopped right away .
42008045	Jesus said , Who touched me ? Everyone said , Not I ! Peter said , Master , the people are all around you and push you .
42008046	But Jesus said , Someone touched me . I know that power to heal went out from me .
42008047	The woman saw that he knew about her . So she came trembling and bowed down in front of him . She told him in front of all the people why she had touched him . She told him that she had been healed right away .
42008048	Jesus said to her , Daughter , you were healed because you believed . Go and do not be troubled .
42008049	While he was still talking , a man came from the rulers house . He said , Your daughter has died . Do not trouble the Teacher any more .
42008050	Jesus heard it . He said , Do not fear . Only believe and she will be healed .
42008051	When Jesus came to the house , he did not let the people go in with him . The only people he let go in were Peter , John and James , and the girls father and mother .
42008052	All the people were crying and making a lot of noise because she had died . But he said , Do not cry . She is not dead , but sleeping .
42008053	They laughed at him because they knew she was dead .
42008054	He took her hand and called out , Little girl , get up .
42008055	Her life came back and she got up right away . He told them to give her something to eat .
42008056	Her parents were very much surprised . Jesus said , Do not tell anyone what has happened .
42009001	Jesus called his twelve disciples together . He gave them power over all the bad spirits , and power to heal sick people .
42009002	He sent them out to tell people about the kingdom of God and to heal sick people .
42009003	He said , Take nothing with you for your trip . Do not take a walking stick , or a bag , or food , or money . And do not take two shirts .
42009004	When you go into a certain house , stay there until you leave the town .
42009005	Some people might not take you in . When you leave that town , shake the dust off your feet . That will be a sign to them .
42009006	The disciples left and went through the towns . They told the good news and healed people everywhere .
42009007	Herod the ruler heard about all that was happening . He did not know what to think . Some people said John the Baptizer had risen from death .
42009008	Some people said Elijah had come back . And other people said that one of the old prophets of God had risen from death .
42009009	Herod said , I cut off Johns head . Now who is this man of whom I hear such things ? He wanted to see Jesus .
42009010	When the apostles came back , they told Jesus all they had done . He took them away with him and they went by themselves to a town called Bethsaida .
42009011	But the people found out and they followed him . He was glad to see them and talked to them about Gods kingdom . He healed those who were sick .
42009012	When it was late in the day , the twelve disciples came to him . They said , Send the people away so they can go to the towns and the farms to sleep and get something to eat . This is a lonely place .
42009013	But Jesus said to them , You give them food to eat . They said , All we have is five loaves of bread and two fish . Shall we go and buy food for all these people ?
42009014	There were about five thousand men . He said to his disciples , Tell the people to sit down in groups of fifty .
42009015	They did what he said , and they made all the people sit down .
42009016	He took the five loaves of bread and the two fish . He looked up to heaven and thanked God for them . Then he broke the bread . He gave it to the disciples to give to the people .
42009017	They all ate and had enough . They picked up twelve baskets full of pieces that were left .
42009018	One day Jesus was alone talking to God . His disciples were there too . He asked them , Who do people say I am ?
42009019	They answered , Some people say you are John the Baptizer . Others say you are Elijah . And others say that one of the old prophets of God has risen from death .
42009020	Jesus said , But who do you say I am ? Peter answered , You are the Christ sent by God .
42009021	Jesus said to them , Do not tell this to anyone .
42009022	Then he went on to say , The Son of Man will have much trouble . The leaders of the people , the chief priests , and the scribes will not believe him . He will be killed . On the third day he will be raised from death .
42009023	And He said to all the people , If anyone wants to come with me , he must leave what he himself wants to do . Every day he must take up his cross [ be ready to die ] and come with me .
42009024	Anyone who tries to keep his life will lose it . And anyone who gives up his life for my sake will find it .
42009025	What good will it do a man if he gets the whole world for himself but loses his life or spoils it ?
42009026	If anyone is ashamed of me and the things I say , the Son of man will be ashamed of that person when he comes . The Son of man will come with his holy angels and be great like his Father .
42009027	I tell you the truth . Some people are standing here who will not die before they see the kingdom of God .
42009028	About eight days after saying these things , Jesus went up on a hill to talk with God . He took Peter , John , and James with him .
42009029	As he was talking with God , he was changed . His face was different . His clothes became very white and shining .
42009030	And then two men were talking with Jesus . They were Moses and Elijah .
42009031	Light was shining from them . They talked about his leaving this world . That would happen when he was in Jerusalem .
42009032	Peter and the others were very sleepy . They woke up and saw the light shining from Jesus . And they saw the two men standing with him .
42009033	When the men were leaving Jesus , Peter said to him , Master , it is good for us to be here . Let us make three places here , one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . Peter did not know what he was saying .
42009034	As he said this , a cloud came over them . They were very much afraid when the cloud came around them .
42009035	A voice in the cloud said , This is my dear Son . Listen to him !
42009036	The talking stopped . Then Jesus was left alone . The disciples did not say anything . They did not tell anyone at that time what they had seen .
42009037	The next day they came down the hill . Many people met him .
42009038	One man among them called out , Teacher , I beg you , look at my son . He is my only child .
42009039	A bad spirit takes hold of him and he screams . It throws him around and makes him foam at his mouth . It beats him badly and does not want to leave him .
42009040	I begged your disciples to drive the bad spirit out , but they could not do it .
42009041	Jesus said , You people today do not believe . You have turned away from God . How long must I be with you ? How long must I put up with you ? Bring the boy here to me .
42009042	While he was coming , the bad spirit knocked him down and threw him around . Jesus told the spirit to stop . He healed the boy and gave him back to his father .
42009043	All the people were surprised to see that God has so much power . While the people were wondering about everything Jesus did , he talked to his disciples .
42009044	He said , Listen well to what I say . The Son of Man will be given over to men ,
42009045	But they did not understand what he said . The meaning was hidden from them so they would not understand it . And they were afraid to ask him about it .
42009046	The disciples started talking among themselves . They quarrelled about which of them was the greatest person .
42009047	Jesus knew what they were thinking . So he took a child and put him by his side .
42009048	Then he said , If anyone takes in a child like this for my sake , he takes in me . And if anyone takes in me , he takes in the one who sent me . The one who takes the least or lowest place among you is the greatest .
42009049	John answered , Master , we saw a man driving bad spirits out of people . He was using your name . We told him to stop because he is not one of us .
42009050	But Jesus said , Do not stop him . Anyone who is not against you is on your side .
42009051	The time was near for Jesus to be taken up to heaven . Then he started off for Jerusalem . He sent messengers ahead of him .
42009052	They went to one of the towns of the Samaritan people to get ready for him .
42009053	But the people would not take him in because he was going to Jerusalem .
42009054	When the disciples James and John saw that , they said , Lord , do you want us to ask for fire to come down from the sky and burn them up ?
42009055	But he turned and said to them , Stop that ! You do not think about what kind of spirit you are showing .
42009056	The Son of Man did not come to kill people , but to save them . And they went on to another town .
42009057	As they went along on the road , a man said to him , I will go anywhere you go .
42009058	Jesus said , Foxes have holes to live in . Birds have nests . But the Son of Man has no place to lie down to rest .
42009059	Jesus said to another man who followed him , Come with me . But the man said , Lord , let me go first and bury my father .
42009060	Jesus said to him , Let those who are dead bury their own dead people . As for you , go and tell people about Gods kingdom .
42009061	Another man said to Jesus , Sir , I will go with you . But let me go first to my home and tell them I am going .
42009062	Jesus said to him , Any person who starts doing something and then keeps looking back is not fit for the kingdom of God .
42010001	After this the Lord chose seventy other men . He sent them ahead of him , two by two . He sent them to every town and village that he was going to visit .
42010002	He said to them , The harvest is much , but there are not many people to gather it . So talk to the Lord of this harvest and ask him to send out people to his harvest .
42010003	Go on your way now . I am sending you out among people . You will be like sheep among bad animals .
42010004	Do not take money , or a bag , or shoes . And do not stop to talk with anyone on the road .
42010005	When you go into a house , first say , " May God give peace to this family . "
42010006	If a man of peace is there , your blessing will stay with him . If not , your blessing will come back to you .
42010007	Stay in that house . Eat and drink what the people give you . The one who works should have his pay for it . Do not move from one house to another house .
42010008	When you go into a town and they take you in , eat what is put before you .
42010009	Heal the sick people in the town . Tell the people , " The kingdom of God has come to you . "
42010010	But when you go into a town and they do not take you in , then go out into the streets of the town .
42010011	Say to the people , " We wipe off even the dust of the town that is on our feet . This will be a sign to you . But remember this , the kingdom of God has come . "
42010012	I tell you this . On the day when people are judged , they will be punished more than the people in the city of Sodom .
42010013	Chorazin , you will have trouble ! Bethsaida , you will have trouble ! If the big works I did in you had been done in the cities of Tyre and Sidon , the people there would have stopped doing bad things long ago . They would wear the clothes people wear to show they are sad , and would sit in ashes .
42010014	But on the day when people are judged you will be punished more than the people in the cities of Tyre and Sidon .
42010015	Capernaum , will you be lifted up to the sky ? No , you will go down to the place of the dead .
42010016	Anyone who listens to you listens to me . Anyone who does not believe you does not believe me . Anyone who does not believe me does not believe the one who sent me .
42010017	The seventy men Jesus had sent out came back very happy . They said , Lord , even the bad spirits obey us when we talk to them in your name !
42010018	Jesus said to them , I saw Satan fall from the sky like lightning .
42010019	I have given you power over all the power of the enemy . Nothing will hurt you .
42010020	Do not be glad that the bad spirits obey you . But be glad that your names are written in the book in heaven .
42010021	At that same time the Holy Spirit made Jesus very happy . Jesus said , Father , you are Lord of heaven and earth . I thank you because you have hidden these things from people who are wise and know many things . But you have shown them to people who are like children . Yes , Father . That was the way you wanted it .
42010022	My Father has given everything to me . No one knows who the Son is but the Father . No one knows who the Father is but the Son and those to whom the Son wants to show him .
42010023	Then Jesus turned to his disciples and said to them alone , God is blessing the eyes of people who see what you see !
42010024	I tell you this . Many prophets and kings wanted to see the things you see . But they did not see them . They wanted to hear the things you hear . But they did not hear them .
42010025	A man who taught Gods law stood up and asked Jesus a question to try him out . Teacher , he said . What must I do so that I will live for ever ?
42010026	Jesus said to him , What does the law say ? What do you read there ?
42010027	The man answered , You must love the Lord your God with all your heart . Love him with all your soul . Love him with all your power , and love him with all your mind . And you must love your neighbour as you love yourself .
42010028	Jesus said , That is the right answer . Do that and you will live for ever .
42010029	But the man wanted to prove that he was all right . So he said to Jesus , Who is my neighbour ?
42010030	Jesus answered , A man was going from Jerusalem to Jericho . Bad men caught him on the road . They took his clothes and beat him . Then they went away and left him half dead .
42010031	A priest happened to be going down that road . He saw the man but he passed by on the other side of the road .
42010032	A man who worked in the temple came along to that place also . He saw the man but he passed by on the other side .
42010033	A man from the country of Samaria was going on that road also , and came to the place . He saw the man and wanted to share in his troubles .
42010034	He went to him and tied up the sores he had from the beating . He washed them with oil and wine . Then he lifted the man up and set him on his own animal to ride . He took him to the house for strangers . And he cared for him .
42010035	The next day he gave two pieces of money to the man who was in charge of the house for strangers . He said , " Take care of this man . If it costs you more than this , I will pay you when I come back .
42010036	Jesus said to the teacher of the law , What do you think ? Which of these three was a neighbour to the man who was caught by the bad men ?
42010037	He said , The man who was kind to him . Jesus said , Go and do as he did .
42010038	Jesus and his disciples went on their way . They came to a town . A woman named Martha took him into her home .
42010039	She had a sister named Mary . Mary sat near the feet of Jesus and she listened to what he said .
42010040	But Martha was very busy doing many things for Jesus . She came to Jesus and said , Lord , my sister has left me to do all the work . Do you not care ? Tell her to come and help me .
42010041	The Lord answered her , Martha , Martha , you are worrying . You are troubled about many things .
42010042	Only one thing is needed . What Mary has chosen is good . And it will not be taken away from her .
42011001	One day Jesus was in a place talking with God . When he had finished , one of his disciples said to him , Lord , teach us to talk with God as John taught his disciples .
42011002	Jesus said , When you talk with God , say , " Our Father in heaven , may your name be kept holy . May your kingdom come .
42011003	Give us our food day by day .
42011004	Forgive us for the wrong things we have done . We forgive everyone who has done wrong to us . Do not lead us to be tested . "
42011005	Jesus said to them , Maybe one of you has a friend . You go to him in the middle of the night and say to him , " Friend , lend me three loaves of bread .
42011006	A friend has come to my house . He has been on the road . I have no food to give him to eat . "
42011007	Maybe the friend in the house answers you and says , " Do not trouble me . The door is locked . And my children and I are in bed . I cannot get up and give you anything . "
42011008	I tell you this . Maybe he will not give him anything because he is his friend . But he will get up and give him what he needs because he keeps on asking for it .
42011009	And I tell you , ask and you will get what you ask for . Look and you will find what you look for . Knock and the door will be opened for you .
42011010	Everyone who asks will get . The one who looks will find . And the one who knocks will have the door opened for him .
42011011	Which of you fathers will give your son a snake if he asks for a fish ?
42011012	Will you give him a scorpion [ an insect with a sting ] if he asks for an egg ?
42011013	You are wrong and yet you know how to give good things to your children . Much more , the Father in heaven will give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him .
42011014	Jesus was driving a bad spirit out of a man who could not talk . When the spirit left him , the man could talk . The people were surprised .
42011015	But some of them said , This man drives out bad spirits by the help of Beelzebub , the chief of bad spirits .
42011016	Other people wanted to test Jesus . They asked him to show them a sign from heaven .
42011017	But Jesus knew what they were thinking . So he said , If one part of any country fights against the other part of the country , that country is spoiled . And if one part of any family fights against the other part of the family , it cannot stand .
42011018	If Satan fights against himself , how will his kingdom stand ? You say I drive out bad spirits by the help of Beelzebub .
42011019	If I drive out bad spirits by the help of Beelzebub , by whose help do your own people drive them out ? Your own people will judge you for this !
42011020	But if I drive out bad spirits by the help of God , then know this , Gods kingdom is here with you now .
42011021	A strong man has something in his hand to fight . He guards his place . He will not lose his things .
42011022	But when a stronger man comes , he catches the man who guards his house . He will take away what is in the mans hand . And he will take his things and give them to his friends .
42011023	Anyone who is not with me is against me . Anyone who does not work with me , works against me .
42011024	When a bad spirit has gone out of a man , he goes through dry places . He looks for a place to rest , but he does not find any . Then he says , " I will go back to my house from where I came . "
42011025	When he comes back , he finds it clean and all fixed up .
42011026	Then he goes and brings seven other spirits who are worse than he is . They go in and live there . Now the man is worse than he was at first .
42011027	As he said this , a woman among the people called out , Happy is your mother who gave birth to you , and fed you as a baby .
42011028	But Jesus said , Happy are those who hear Gods word and obey it !
42011029	More and more people were coming . He started to talk . He said , People today are bad . They want a sign . No sign will be given them but the sign of Jonah the prophet of God .
42011030	Jonah was a sign to the men in the city of Nineveh . In the same way the Son of Man will be a sign to the people today .
42011031	When the people are judged , the Queen from the South will stand up and speak against men who live today . She came a long way to hear the wise words of Solomon . The one who is here is greater than Solomon .
42011032	When people are judged , the men of Nineveh will stand up and speak against the people of today . They stopped their wrong ways when Jonah told them Gods word . And the one who is here is greater than Jonah .
42011033	No person lights a lamp and hides it in a hole or puts it under a basket . But he puts it on a place for a lamp . Then people who come in can see the light .
42011034	Your body gets its light through your eyes . When you have good eyes , all your body has light . But when your eyes are bad , your body is in darkness .
42011035	So be sure that it is not dark in you where it should be light .
42011036	If no part of your body is dark , it will all be light . It will be like a lamp that shines to give you light .
42011037	While Jesus was saying these things , a Pharisee asked him to come to eat at his house . So Jesus went in and sat at the table .
42011038	The Pharisee saw that Jesus did not wash his hands before he ate . He was surprised .
42011039	The Lord said to him , You Pharisees wash the outside of a cup and a dish clean . But inside you are full of greed and wrong ways .
42011040	You are fools ! Did not God make the outside and inside also ?
42011041	Do good , and do it from your heart . Then everything is clean for you .
42011042	You Pharisees will have trouble ! You give to God a tenth part of small garden plants . But you do not judge in the right way . And you do not love God . You should do these things and the other things too .
42011043	You Pharisees will have trouble ! In the meeting houses you want to sit in the front seats . And in the market you want people to greet you .
42011044	You will have trouble ! You are not true to yourselves ! You are like graves that are not marked . Men walk over them and do not know it .
42011045	Then one of the men who taught Gods law said to Jesus , Teacher , when you say these things , you talk against us too .
42011046	Jesus said , You men will have trouble also ! You put heavy loads on peoples backs . But you yourselves will not put up one finger to help carry the loads .
42011047	You will have trouble ! You build places to bury the prophets of God that your fathers killed .
42011048	In this way you show you agree to the things your fathers did . They killed the prophets , and you build places to bury them .
42011049	That is why God , who is wise , said , " I will send prophets and messengers to them . They will kill some of them . And they will trouble some of them . "
42011050	So the people who are living now will be punished for all the blood of the prophets of God that is on the ground since the world was made .
42011051	I mean all the blood from the time of Abel to the time of Zechariah . ( He was killed between the holy table and the temple . ) Yes , I tell you . The people who are living now will be punished for all of it .
42011052	You teachers of Gods law will have trouble ! You have taken away the key of the door where people can go in and know what is true . You yourselves did not go in , and you stopped those who were going in .
42011053	When Jesus left the house , the scribes and Pharisees began to be very angry with him . They asked him questions about many things .
42011054	They wanted him to say something that was wrong so they could make trouble for him .
42012001	Many thousands of people had gathered . They stepped on each other . Jesus began to talk to the disciples . He said , Take care . Do not let the yeast of the Pharisees spoil you . They are not true to themselves .
42012002	Everything that is covered up will be seen . Everything that is hidden will be known .
42012003	What you have said in the dark will be heard in the light . What you have said in secret with the door shut will be told from the tops of the houses .
42012004	You are my friends . I tell you , do not fear people who can kill your bodies . After that they cannot do anything more to you .
42012005	I will tell you whom you must fear . Fear the one who , after he has killed , has the power to throw into hell . Yes , I tell you , fear him !
42012006	Are not five sparrows sold for a tiny sum of money ? Yet God does not forget about one of them .
42012007	Even the number of hairs on your head is known . So do not fear . You are worth more than many sparrows .
42012008	And I tell you . If anyone tells people that he knows me , the Son of Man will also tell the angels of God that he knows him .
42012009	But if anyone tells people he does not know me , the Son of Man will also tell the angels of God that he does not know that person .
42012010	Everyone who says anything against the Son of Man will be forgiven . But anyone who says wrong things against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven .
42012011	When men take you to the meeting houses and to the rulers and to the courts , do not be troubled about what you will answer or say .
42012012	The Holy Spirit will teach you at the right time what you must say .
42012013	One of the people in the crowd said , Teacher , tell my brother to divide with me the things my father left when he died .
42012014	Jesus said , Man , who made me a judge over you or gave me power to divide your things ?
42012015	Then he said to the people , Take care . Do not be greedy in any way to get more and more things . Even if a man has much more than he needs , it cannot give him life .
42012016	Then he told them a story . He said , A rich man had a farm . The things that grew on it were many .
42012017	He said to himself , " What will I do ? I have no place to keep all the food I have grown . "
42012018	So he said , " This is what I will do . I will break down my storehouses and build bigger ones . I will keep in them all the food and everything I have .
42012019	Then I will say to myself , Man , you have much in your storehouses for many years . Rest now . Eat , drink , and have a good time . "
42012020	But God said to him , " You are a fool ! Tonight you will die . Then who will have all the things you have kept for yourself ? "
42012021	So anyone who keeps things for himself is not rich in the way God wants him to be rich .
42012022	Jesus said to his disciples , So I tell you this . Do not be troubled about what you will eat to keep alive . Do not be troubled about clothes to wear on your body .
42012023	Life itself is worth more than food , and the body is worth more than clothes .
42012024	Think of the birds . They do not plant , cut , or keep any food . Yet God feeds them . You are worth much more than the birds !
42012025	Can any of you live any longer by troubling yourself about these things ?
42012026	If you cannot do a small thing like that , why do you trouble yourself about the other things ?
42012027	Think about the flowers . See how they grow . They do not work or make cloth . I tell you , King Solomon was a great man . But he was not dressed as fine as one of these flowers .
42012028	God dresses the grass in the fields so it looks nice . It is in the field one day and the next day it is burned . If God dresses the grass like that , he cares much more that you have clothes to wear . You do not believe in God very much !
42012029	Do not keep asking , " What shall we eat ? " and , " What shall we drink ? " Do not be troubled about that .
42012030	All the people who are not Jews work for these things . Your Father in heaven knows that you need them .
42012031	But work for Gods kingdom . Then you will have all these things also .
42012032	Do not fear , little family . Your Father wants to give the kingdom to you .
42012033	Sell what you have and give it to poor people . Make for yourselves money bags that will not wear out . Keep the things you like in heaven . They will not be lost there . People cannot go in and steal them , and insects cannot spoil them .
42012034	The place where you keep the things you like is where your heart will be also .
42012035	Be dressed and have your lamps lit .
42012036	Be like men who are waiting for their master to come home from a wedding . They are ready to open the door as soon as he comes and knocks .
42012037	Happy the servants who are ready when the master comes ! The servants who are ready when the master comes will be made happy . I tell you the truth . The master will get ready to serve them . He will set them at the table and will come and serve them .
42012038	He may come in the middle of the night or when it is nearly morning . But if they are watching for the master , they will be happy .
42012039	And remember this . If the owner of a house knew at what time a man would come to steal , he would not let the man break into his house .
42012040	So then , be ready . The Son of Man will come at a time when you are not looking for him .
42012041	Peter said , Lord , are you telling this story for us or for all the people ?
42012042	The Lord said , Who is like a wise servant who can be trusted ? His master will put him in charge of his other servants . He gives them food to eat at the right time .
42012043	His master will bless that servant if he is doing this when he comes !
42012044	I tell you the truth . His master will put him in charge of all that he has
42012045	But perhaps that servant says to himself , " My master will not come just now . " Then he begins to beat the other servants . He begins to eat and drink until he is drunk .
42012046	If he does that , his master will come on a day when he is not looking for him . He will not know the time when his master is coming . His master will punish him very much and put him away with those he cannot trust .
42012047	A servant knew what his master wanted . But he was not ready . He did not do what his master wanted him to do . So he will be beaten much .
42012048	But if a servant did not know and did something bad , he will be beaten only a little . To whom much has been given , from him much will be asked . When people give much to anyone , they will ask more from him .
42012049	I came to start a fire on the earth . I wish the fire were already burning !
42012050	I will be going through a big trouble , and I feel like a prisoner until it is all over .
42012051	Do you think that I came to bring peace on the earth ? I tell you , " No " . I came to take away peace .
42012052	From now , if there are five in a family , they will be against each other . Three of them will be against the other two . And two of them will be against the other three .
42012053	A father will be against his son , and the son will be against his father . The mother will be against her daughter , and the daughter will be against her mother . A mans mother will be against his wife , and his wife will be against his mother .
42012054	Jesus also said to the people , When you see a cloud coming up in the west , you say right away , " Rain is coming . " And it comes .
42012055	When the wind is blowing from the south , you say , " It will be very hot . " And it is .
42012056	You are not true to yourselves ! You know the meaning of these signs in the earth and sky . But you do not know the meaning of the signs about the time in which we are living .
42012057	Why do you not judge for yourselves what is right ?
42012058	If someone wants to take you to court , make an agreement with him quickly on the way . If you do not , he will take you to the judge . The judge will give you to the guard , and the guard will put you in prison .
42012059	I tell you , you will not get out of prison until you have paid up every piece of money .
42013001	Some people were there at that time who told Jesus what Pilate had done . He had killed some of the people of Galilee and put their blood with the blood of their sacrifices to God .
42013002	Jesus answered , Do you think it was because they were worse than all the other people in Galilee ?
42013003	I tell you , " No ! " But if you do not stop doing wrong things , then you will all die as they did .
42013004	Eighteen men died when the high house in Siloam fell on them . Do you think they were worse than all the other men who lived in Jerusalem ?
42013005	I tell you , " No ! " But if you do not stop doing wrong things , you will all die as they did .
42013006	Then Jesus told this story : A man had a fruit tree on his farm . He came to look for fruit on it , but did not find any .
42013007	He said to the man who cared for the trees , " For three years I have come to look for fruit on this tree , but I have not found any . Cut it down . Why should it spoil my farmland ? "
42013008	The man who cared for the trees answered , " Sir , let it stay one more year . I will dig around it and put good soil around it .
42013009	If it has fruit on it next year , that will be good . But if it has no fruit , you can have it cut down . "
42013010	Jesus was teaching in one of the meeting houses on the Sabbath day .
42013011	A woman was there who had a spirit that had made her sick for eighteen years . She had to bend down all the time and could not stand up straight .
42013012	Jesus saw her and called her to come to him . Then he said , Woman , you are healed . You are not sick any longer .
42013013	Jesus put his hands on her , and right away she stood up straight . And she praised God .
42013014	The ruler of the meeting house was angry because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath day . He said to the people , There are six days to work . You should come to be healed on those days , and not on the Sabbath day .
42013015	The Lord said to him , You are not true to yourselves ! Every one of you unties his cow or horse and takes it to the water to drink on the Sabbath day . Do you not ?
42013016	This woman belongs to Abrahams family . Satan has tied her for eighteen years . Is it not right that she should be set free on the Sabbath day ?
42013017	When he said that , all those who had talked against him were ashamed . All the other people were very glad for all the wonderful things Jesus did .
42013018	He went on to say , What is the kingdom of God like ? What shall I say it is like ?
42013019	It is like this . A man took a mustard seed and planted it in his field . It grew up big like a tree . The birds came and lived in its branches .
42013020	Then Jesus said again , What else is the kingdom of God like ?
42013021	It is like this . A woman took yeast and mixed it with many cups of flour . The yeast went all through the flour .
42013022	Jesus went through the towns and villages on the way to Jerusalem . He was teaching the people as he went .
42013023	A man asked him , Sir , will only a few people be saved ?
42013024	Jesus answered , Try hard to go in by the small gate . I tell you , many will want to go in but they will not be able .
42013025	The master of the house will get up and lock the door . Then you will be standing outside . You will begin to knock on the door and call , " Sir , open the door for us ! " But he will answer , " I do not know where you belong . "
42013026	Then you will say , " We ate and drank with you . You taught in our streets . "
42013027	But he will say , " I tell you , I do not know where you belong . Go away from me all you who do wrong ! "
42013028	You will see Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , and all the prophets in the kingdom of God . And you will see yourselves thrown out . Then you will cry and make a noise with your teeth .
42013029	People will come from the east , from the west , from the north , and from the south . They will sit down to eat in the kingdom of God .
42013030	Yes , some people who are last will be first , and some who are first will be last .
42013031	At that time some Pharisees came to Jesus . They said to him , Go away from here . Herod wants to kill you .
42013032	He said , Go and tell that fox , " I drive bad spirits out of people and heal people . I do it today and tomorrow . On the third day I will finish what I am doing . "
42013033	But I must go on my way today , tomorrow , and the next day . A prophet of God cannot be killed outside of Jerusalem .
42013034	O Jerusalem , Jerusalem ! You kill the prophets of God . You throw stones to kill men who are sent to you . How often I have wanted to gather your people together as a mother hen gathers her little ones under her wings . But you would not come !
42013035	Now you are left alone in your house . I tell you this . You will not see me again until the time when you say , " God bless him who comes in the name of the Lord . "
42014001	One Sabbath day Jesus went to eat at the house of a ruler . He was a ruler of the Pharisees . They were watching Jesus .
42014002	man stood in front of him . He was sick . His body was filled with water .
42014003	Jesus asked the teachers of Gods law and the Pharisees , Is it right to heal a person on the Sabbath day or not ?
42014004	They did not answer . So he took the man and healed him . Then he sent him away .
42014005	Jesus said to them , If your horse or cow falls into a hole , which one of you will not pull him out right away on the Sabbath day ?
42014006	They could not answer that .
42014007	Jesus told a story to the people who were asked to eat at the house . He saw that they chose to sit at the best places .
42014008	He said to them , When you are called to a wedding , do not sit in the best place . It may be that a better man than you has been called .
42014009	Then the man who called you both will come and say to you , " Get up and let this man sit here . " Then you will be ashamed . And you will go and sit down in the last place .
42014010	But when you are asked to go to a wedding , go and sit down in the last place . Then when the man who called you comes , he will say to you , " Friend , come to a better place . " Then all the people who sit at the table will see how he respects you .
42014011	Everyone who puts himself up in a high place will be brought down to a low place . And everyone who puts himself down in a low place will be brought up to a high place .
42014012	Then Jesus said to the man who had asked him to come , When you make a dinner or a feast , do not ask your friends , or your brothers , or the people in your family , or your rich neighbours . They will repay you by making a dinner for you .
42014013	But when you make a dinner , ask the people who are poor , hurt , lame , or blind .
42014014	You will be made happy because they cannot pay you . You will be repaid when all good people are raised from death .
42014015	One of those who was sitting at the table heard this . He said , Happy is the person who will eat in the kingdom of God !
42014016	But Jesus said to him , A man made a big feast and asked many people to come .
42014017	When the feast was ready , he sent his servant to tell the people who had been asked . He said , " Come . Everything is ready . "
42014018	But the people all began to make excuses . The first one said , I have bought a farm . I must go and see it . I beg you , excuse me from the feast . "
42014019	Another man said , " I have bought ten oxen . I am going to see them . I beg you , excuse me from the feast . "
42014020	Another one said , " I have married a woman , and so I cannot come . "
42014021	The servant came and told his master . Then the master was very angry . He said to his servant , " Go out quickly . Go on all the streets in the city . Bring here people who are poor , hurt , blind , or lame . "
42014022	The servant came back and said , " Sir , I have done what you told me to do . There is still room for more people . "
42014023	Then the master said to the servant , " Go out onto the roads and behind bushes . Find people and make them come in so that my house will be full .
42014024	I tell you , not one of the men who were called first will eat any of my feast .
42014025	, fehlt/missing
42014026	Many people were going with Jesus . He turned to them and said , If any man comes to me , he must hate his father and mother , his wife and children , his brothers and sister . Yes , he must hate himself too . If he does not , he cannot be my disciple .
42014027	If anyone does not carry his cross [ is not ready to die ] and come with me , he cannot be my disciple .
42014028	When any of you wants to build a high house , you sit down first and see how much it will cost . You want to see if you have enough money to finish it .
42014029	If you do not have enough money , you will not be able to finish it after you have made the foundation . Then all the people who see it will laugh at you .
42014030	They will say , " This man started to build a house and could not finish it . "
42014031	When a king goes to fight against another king , he sits down first and thinks about the matter . He will ask himself , " Can I fight him with ten thousand soldiers ? He has twenty thousand soldiers . "
42014032	If he cannot fight him , he will send some men to meet the other king while he is still far away . He will try to make peace with him .
42014033	In the same way , any one of you who does not give up all he has cannot be my disciple .
42014034	Salt is good . But if the salt has lost its taste , how can it be made salty again ?
42014035	It is not good for the land or the dirt pile . People throw it away . Everyone who has ears to hear , listen ! "
42015001	The tax collectors and bad people all came close to Jesus to hear him .
42015002	The Pharisees and scribes did not like it . And they said to each other , This man is glad to have bad people come . He eats with them .
42015003	So Jesus told them this story .
42015004	He said , Which one of you will not do this ? A man has a hundred sheep . He loses one of them . He leaves the ninety-nine in the wilderness , and he goes to look for the one that is lost . He looks until he finds it .
42015005	And when he has found it , he is very glad . He carries it on his back .
42015006	When he comes home , he calls his friends and neighbours to come . He says , " Be glad with me ! I have found my lost sheep . "
42015007	I tell you , the angels in heaven will be glad like that when one bad person stops doing wrong things . The angels will be more glad about that one person than about ninety-nine good people who do not need to change their ways .
42015008	What woman will not do this ? She has ten pieces of silver money . If she loses one of them , she lights a lamp and sweeps the house . She looks for the money until she finds it .
42015009	When she has found it , she calls her friends and neighbours to come . She says , " Be glad with me ! I have found the piece of money I lost . "
42015010	I tell you , the angels of God will be glad like that when one bad person stops doing wrong things .
42015011	Jesus also said , A man had two sons .
42015012	The younger son said to his father , " Father , give me my part of what will belong to me . " So his father divided all he had between the two sons .
42015013	After a few days , the younger son packed up his things . He left home and went to a country far away . There he spent his money in foolish and wrong ways .
42015014	He spent everything he had . There was no food in that country for a long time . He began to be in trouble .
42015015	So he went to stay with a man in the country who had a farm . The man sent him out to his farm to feed the pigs .
42015016	He would have been glad to eat the food the pigs ate . But no one gave him anything .
42015017	Then he started to get sense . He said , " My father has many men who work for him . They have plenty of food . But here I am dying because I have nothing to eat !
42015018	I will get up and go to my father . I will say to him , " Father I have been a bad son . I have done wrong to God in heaven and to you .
42015019	I am not good enough now to be called your son . Let me be like one of these men who work for you . "
42015020	So he got up and went to his father . While he was still far away , his father saw him . He loved him and wanted to share in his troubles . He ran and put his arms around him and kissed him .
42015021	The son said to him , " Father , I have been a bad son . I have done wrong to God in heaven and to you . I am not good enough now to be called your son . Let me be like one of these men who work for you . "
42015022	But his father said to his servants , " Go quickly and bring the best clothes . Dress him . Put a ring on his hand . Put shoes on his feet .
42015023	Bring the fat calf and kill it . Let us have a feast and a good time .
42015024	This is my son . He was dead and now he is alive again . He was lost and is found . " And they began to have a good time .
42015025	The older son was out on the farm . When he came home and was near the house , he heard music and dancing .
42015026	He called one of the servants and said , " What is going on ? "
42015027	The servant said , " Your brother has come home . Your father has killed the fat young cow because your brother is home and he is well . "
42015028	But the older son was angry . He would not go into the house . His father came out and begged him to come in .
42015029	But the son said to his father , " Look . I have worked hard for you for many years . I have always done everything you told me to do . And yet you never even gave me a young goat to make a feast with my friends .
42015030	But now this son of yours has come back . He has spent all your money and was with bad women . And yet you kill the fat calf for him ! "
42015031	The father said , " Son you have always been with me . And all that I have is yours .
42015032	But now we should have a good time and be happy . Your brother was dead and now he is alive again . He was lost and is found . "
42016001	Jesus also talked to his disciples . He said , A rich man had a manager in charge of his things . People told the rich man that the manager was wasting his things .
42016002	he called the manager and asked him , " What is this I hear about you ? Tell me what you have done . You cannot be my manager any more . "
42016003	Then the manager thought to himself , " What will I do ? My master is taking my work away from me . I am not strong enough to go out and dig . I am ashamed to beg .
42016004	I know what I will do . Then , when I lose my job , these people will take me into their own homes . "
42016005	So he called to him everyone who owed his master something . He asked the first man , " How much do you owe my master ? "
42016006	He answered , " A hundred tins of oil . " The manager said , " Take your paper . Sit down right now and write on it fifty . "
42016007	Then he asked the next man , " How much do you owe ? " He said , " A hundred bags of grain . " The manager said , " Take your paper and write on it eighty . "
42016008	Then the master praised the manager who did wrong . He praised him because he did what was wise . The people of this world are wiser than the people who have the Light . They know how to get along with people like themselves .
42016009	I tell you this . Money may be a wrong thing , but use it to make friends for yourselves . Then when your money is spent , they will be glad to see you come into that place where people live for ever .
42016010	Anyone who can be trusted in a little matter can also be trusted in a big matter . Anyone who does wrong in a very little matter will do wrong also in a big matter .
42016011	So if you could not be trusted to use money , which is bad , who will trust you to use true riches ?
42016012	If you could not be trusted with what belonged to another person , who will give you something for yourself ?
42016013	No servant can work for two masters . He will hate one and love the other . Or he will obey one and despise the other . You cannot work for both God and money .
42016014	The Pharisees loved money . They heard all these things . They made fun of him .
42016015	He said to them , You try to make men think you are all right . But God knows your hearts . What men think is fine , God hates .
42016016	The Law and the Prophets gave Gods word until John came . Since then , the good news of Gods kingdom has been told . And now everyone tries hard to get into the kingdom .
42016017	It would be easier to take away the sky and the earth than for the smallest part of the law to fall .
42016018	If a man sends away his wife and marries another woman , he commits adultery . And if the man marries a woman who has been sent away by her husband , he commits adultery .
42016019	There was a rich man who dressed and lived like a king every day .
42016020	A poor man named Lazarus was put at his door . He had many sores on his body .
42016021	He wanted to eat the pieces of food that fell from the rich mans table . Dogs came and licked his sores .
42016022	The poor man died . Angels carried him to be with Abraham . The rich man also died and was buried .
42016023	He was in great pain in the world of dead people . He looked up and saw Abraham far away . With him was Lazarus .
42016024	He called out , " Father Abraham , help me ! Send Lazarus to dip his finger in some water and cool my tongue . This fire is very hot for me . "
42016025	But Abraham said to him , " Son , remember this . You had a good time when you were living . Lazarus had a bad time when he was living . But now he is happy here and you are in pain .
42016026	But that is not all . A wide hole is between you and us . No one can go from here to you if he wanted to . And no one can come from where you are to us . "
42016027	The rich man said , " Then , father , I beg you , send Lazarus to my fathers house .
42016028	I have five brothers there . Tell him to talk to them so that they will not come to this place where there is pain . "
42016029	But Abraham said , " They have Moses and the Prophets . They can listen to them . "
42016030	He answered , " No , father Abraham ! But if a man who had died went to them , they would stop their wrong ways . "
42016031	Abraham said , " If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets , then they will not believe , even if a man were raised from death . "
42017001	Jesus said to his disciples , People will make other people do wrong . But the person who makes another person do wrong will have trouble .
42017002	A big stone should be tied around his neck and then he should be thrown into the sea . That would be better for him than to make one of these little children do wrong .
42017003	Take care ! If your brother does something bad , tell him what he has done . If he is sorry , then forgive him .
42017004	Maybe he will do wrong to you seven times in one day . But if he comes to you seven times in one day and says , " I am sorry for what I did , " then you must forgive him .
42017005	The apostles said to the Lord , Help us to believe more .
42017006	The Lord said , If you believe as much as a little mustard seed , then you can say to this tree , " Come up by the roots and plant yourself in the sea . " And it would obey you .
42017007	If your servant is working in the field or taking care of sheep , what will you say to him when he comes in from the field ? Will you say , " Come now and sit down to eat " ?
42017008	No , you will say , " Get my food ready . Get ready to wait on me . I will eat and drink . After that , then you may eat and drink . "
42017009	Will you thank the servant for doing what you told him to do ?
42017010	It is the same with you . When you have done all you were told to do , you should say , " We are servants . We have not done a big thing . We have only done what we should do . "
42017011	Jesus was going on the road to Jerusalem . He went between the countries of Samaria and Galilee .
42017012	When he was going into a village , ten men who had leprosy came to him . They stood far away .
42017013	And they called out , Jesus , Master , help us !
42017014	When Jesus saw them , he said to them , Go and let the priests look at you . While they were going , they were healed of the leprosy .
42017015	One of them , when he saw that he was healed , turned back . He praised God with a loud voice .
42017016	He bowed down in front of Jesus and thanked him . He was a man from the country of Samaria .
42017017	Then Jesus asked , Were not ten people healed ? Where are the other nine ?
42017018	Is this stranger the only one who has come back to praise God ?
42017019	Then he said to the man , Get up and go on your way . You were healed because you believed .
42017020	The Pharisees asked Jesus , When will the kingdom of God come ? He answered them , You cannot see the kingdom of God when it comes .
42017021	People will not be able to say , " Look , here it is ! " or " There it is ! That is because the kingdom of God is inside you .
42017022	Jesus said to his disciples , The time will come when you will want to see one of the days of the Son of Man . But you will not see it .
42017023	People will say to you , " Look ! Here he is ! " or " Look ! There he is ! " But do not go out or follow them .
42017024	When lightning comes , it lights up the whole sky . It will be like that on the day when the Son of Man comes .
42017025	But first he will have much trouble . The people who are living now will not believe in him .
42017026	The way it was in the time of Noah is the way it will be in the time of the Son of Man .
42017027	People ate and drank . They married and gave their daughters to be married . All this went on until the day when Noah went into his house built on a boat . Then there was much water and all the people outside the boat died .
42017028	It was the same way in the time of Lot . People ate and drank . They bought and sold . They planted and built .
42017029	Then one day Lot went out of the city of Sodom . Then on that day fire and burning rock came down from the sky and killed all the people .
42017030	That is the way it will be on the day when the Son of Man is seen .
42017031	On that day a man will be at the top of his house , and his things will be below . But he must not go down to get his things . In the same way a man will be in the field , but he must not go back home .
42017032	Remember what happened to Lots wife .
42017033	Anyone who wants to keep his life will lose it . And anyone who gives up his life will keep it .
42017034	I tell you , on that night two people may be in one bed . One will be taken away and the other will be left .
42017035	Two women will be making flour together . One woman will be taken away and the other woman will be left .
42017036	Two men will be in a field . One man will be taken away and the other man will be left .
42017037	They asked him , Where will this be , Lord ? He said , The big birds that eat meat will go to the place where the dead body is .
42018001	Jesus told them a story to teach them that they should keep on talking with God and not give up .
42018002	He said , There was a judge in a city . He did not respect God or care about people .
42018003	There was a woman in that city whose husband was dead . The woman came to the judge again and again . She said , " Save me from my enemy ! "
42018004	For a long time he would not do it . But after a time he said , " I do not respect God or care about people .
42018005	But this woman is troubling me . So I will save her from her enemy . If I do not , she will keep coming until I am tired . "
42018006	The Lord said , The judge was a bad man . And yet you should listen to what he says .
42018007	When the people whom God has chosen call to him day and night , he will save them from their enemies . He may let them wait a time .
42018008	But I tell you , he will save them from their enemies soon . But when the Son of Man comes , will he find any people who believe in him ?
42018009	There were some people who thought they were very good . And they thought that other people were not good . Jesus told this story to them .
42018010	He said , Two men went to the temple to talk with God . One was a Pharisee and the other one was a tax collector .
42018011	The Pharisee stood and said to himself , " God , I thank you that I am not like other men . They steal , cheat , and commit adultery . I thank you that I am not like this tax collector .
42018012	Two times in the week I do not eat-I fast . I give away one tenth part of all I get . "
42018013	The tax collector stood far away . He did not even look up towards heaven . But he beat his chest , and said , " God , I am a bad man . Help me ! "
42018014	I tell you , when this man went home , he was right with God . The other one was not . Everyone who puts himself up in a high place will be brought down to a low place . And everyone who puts himself in a low place will be brought up to a high place .
42018015	People brought even small children to Jesus . They wanted him to put his hands on them . When the disciples saw it , they tried to stop the people .
42018016	But Jesus called them to him and said , Let the children come to me . Do not try to stop them . The kingdom of God belongs to people like them .
42018017	I tell you the truth . If anyone does not believe in the kingdom of God like a child , he will never go in .
42018018	A ruler asked Jesus , Good Teacher , what must I do so that I will live for ever ?
42018019	Jesus answered him , Why do you call me good ? Only one is good , and that is God .
42018020	You know the laws , " Do not commit adultery . [ Do not take a man or woman who is not your husband or wife . ] Do not kill . Do not steal . Do not tell lies . Respect your father and your mother . "
42018021	The man said , I have kept all these laws since I was a boy .
42018022	When Jesus heard that , he said to him , You need one thing more . Sell everything you have . Give the money to poor people . You will be rich in heaven . Then come and go with me .
42018023	When the man heard that , he was sad because he was very rich .
42018024	Jesus looked at him and said , It is very hard for rich people to enter the kingdom of God !
42018025	It is easier for a big animal like a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God .
42018026	Those who heard it asked , Then who can be saved ?
42018027	But Jesus said , God can do what men cannot do .
42018028	Peter said , See , we have left all things and have come with you .
42018029	, fehlt/missing
42018030	Jesus said to them , I tell you the truth . If any man has left his house , or his wife , or his brothers , or his father , or his mother , or his children for the sake of the kingdom of God , he will receive many times as much as he has left . He will receive that in this world . And in the next world he will live for ever .
42018031	Jesus took the twelve disciples with him . He said to them , We are going to Jerusalem . The prophets of God long ago wrote about the Son of Man . Everything they wrote will be done to him .
42018032	He will be given over to rulers who are not Jews . They will make fun of him . They will treat him very badly . They will spit on him .
42018033	They will beat him and kill him . On the third day he will rise .
42018034	But the disciples did not understand any of these things . The meaning was hidden from them and they did not understand what he said .
42018035	When he came near the city of Jericho , a blind man was sitting by the road . He was begging for money .
42018036	He heard many people passing by . He asked , Why are so many people passing here ?
42018037	They told him , Jesus of Nazareth is passing this way .
42018038	Then he shouted , Jesus , son of David ! Help me !
42018039	The people in front said , Be quiet ! But he shouted louder and said , Son of David ! Help me !
42018040	Jesus stopped and said , Bring him here . When the man came close , Jesus asked him , What do you want me to do for you ?
42018041	The man said , Sir , I want to see .
42018042	Jesus said , You can see now . You are healed because you believed .
42018043	Right then he was able to see . He went with Jesus and he praised God . All the people saw it and they all praised God too .
42019001	Jesus came to the city of Jericho and was passing through it .
42019002	A man named Zacchaeus was there . He was the head tax collector , and he was a rich man .
42019003	He wanted to see who Jesus was but he could not see him because he was a short man and there were many people around him .
42019004	So he ran ahead and climbed into a tree to see Jesus , for he was coming that way .
42019005	When Jesus came to the tree , he looked up . He said , Zacchaeus , come down right now . I must stay at your house today .
42019006	So Zacchaeus came down right then . He was glad to have Jesus come in his house .
42019007	When all the people saw this , they did not like it . They said , He has gone to visit a bad man .
42019008	Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord , Look , Lord , I will give to the poor people half of all I have . And if I have cheated anyone , I will give him back four times as much as I took .
42019009	Jesus said to him , The head of this house has been saved today ! He also is a son of Abraham .
42019010	The Son of Man came to look for and to save those who are lost .
42019011	While they were listening to this , he started to tell them a story . He did so because they were near Jerusalem and the people thought that the kingdom of God would begin right away .
42019012	So he said , A man who belonged to a respected family went to a country far away . He went to get power to rule . Then he was going to come back .
42019013	Before he left , he called ten of his servants . He gave each of them some money . He said , " Go and trade with this money until I come back . "
42019014	His people hated him . They chose some men and sent them after him to tell the king , " We do not want this man to rule over us . "
42019015	But he was given the power to rule and came back . Then he called the servants to whom he had given the money . He wanted to know how much money each one had made by trading .
42019016	The first one came to him and said , " Sir , your money has made ten times more money . "
42019017	The ruler said , " You have done well . You are a good servant . You will rule over ten cities because you have done well with a very small thing . "
42019018	The second one came to him and said , " Sir , your money has made five times more money . "
42019019	The ruler said , " You will rule over five cities . "
42019020	Then another servant came and said , " Sir , here is your money . I hid it in a cloth and kept it .
42019021	I was afraid of you . You are a hard man . You take in where you put nothing out . You gather where you did not plant . "
42019022	The ruler said " You bad servant ! I will judge you by your own words . You knew that I was a hard man ! You knew that I take in where I put nothing out . You knew that I gather where I did not plant .
42019023	Why did you not put my money in the bank ? Then when you came home I would have had my money with interest . "
42019024	Some men were standing there . He said to them , " Take the money from him . Give it to the man who has ten times as much . "
42019025	They said , " Sir , he has ten times as much already ! "
42019026	The ruler said , " I tell you . Anyone who has some will get more . But he who does not have anything , even the little that he has will be taken away from him .
42019027	But where are those people who hate me and did not want me to rule over them ? Bring them here and kill them right here in front of me . "
42019028	When Jesus had said this , he went on ahead of them towards Jerusalem .
42019029	He came near Bethphage and Bethany by the hill called the Mount of Olives . Then he sent two of his disciples ahead .
42019030	He said , Go into the village in front of you . As soon as you go in , you will find an animal tied up . No one has ever sat on it . Untie it and bring it to me .
42019031	If anyone asks you , " Why are you untying it ? " tell him , " The Lord needs it . "
42019032	They went and found it just as Jesus had said .
42019033	When they were untying the animal , the men who owned it asked them , Why are you untying the animal ?
42019034	They said , The Lord needs it .
42019035	They brought it to Jesus and laid their coats on it . Then they put Jesus on it .
42019036	As he was riding along , people spread their coats on the road .
42019037	He came near the top of the hill called the Mount of Olives . Then all the people who believed in him began to be happy . They sang out loudly , and praised God in a loud voice for all the big works they had seen .
42019038	They said , God bless the King who comes in the name of the Lord ! Peace in heaven where God is praised !
42019039	Some of the Pharisees who were among the people said to Jesus , Teacher , tell your disciples to stop saying that .
42019040	Jesus answered , I tell you , if they do not speak like this the stones will call out .
42019041	When Jesus came near , he saw the city . His heart was very sad and he cried .
42019042	He said , I wish you knew today what things would give you peace ! But now you do not see what they are .
42019043	The time will come when the people who hate you will put a wall all around you . They will shut you up and keep you in on every side .
42019044	They will break you down to the ground . They will kill the people within you . They will not leave one stone of your houses on top of another . That will happen because you did not know the time when God was ready to help you .
42019045	Jesus went into the temple . He began to drive out the people who were buying and selling in the temple .
42019046	He said to them , It is written , " My house shall be a place where people talk with God . " But you have made it a place for people who steal !
42019047	He taught in the temple every day . The chief priests , scribes and the leaders of the people wanted to kill him .
42019048	But they did not find any way they could do it . All the people stayed around to hear what Jesus said .
42020001	One day Jesus was teaching the people in the temple . He was telling them Gods good news . The chief priests and the scribes came to him with the leaders .
42020002	They said to him , Tell us what right you have to do these things . Who gave you the right to do them ?
42020003	He answered , I will ask you a question also . Tell me this .
42020004	Who gave John the right to baptise people ? Did God or did men give it to him ?
42020005	They talked it over together . They said , If we say , " God gave John the right to do it , " he will say , " Then why did you not believe him ? "
42020006	But if we say , " Men gave him the right to do it , " then the people will kill us with stones . They believe that John was a prophet of God .
42020007	So they answered Jesus , We do not know who gave him the right to do it .
42020008	Then Jesus said to them , Neither will I tell you what right I have to do these things .
42020009	Then Jesus began to tell the people this story . A man planted a farm . He let some men use the farm . They paid him money for the rent . Then he went to a country far away and stayed a long time .
42020010	At harvest time the owner sent one of his servants to the men who used the farm . He wanted to have some fruit from the farm . But the men beat the servant and sent him away without any fruit .
42020011	So he sent another servant . They beat this one also , and did wrong things to him . And they sent him away without any fruit .
42020012	He sent a servant the third time . They hurt this one also and threw him out of the farm .
42020013	Then the man who owned the farm said , " What shall I do ? I will send my dear son . Maybe they will respect him . "
42020014	But when the men saw him they said to each other , " This is the one who will have everything when his father dies . Let us kill him . Then everything will belong to us . "
42020015	They dragged him off the farm and killed him . What will the man who owned the farm do to them ?
42020016	He will come back and kill those men . And he will give the farm to other men to use . When the chief priests and scribes heard this , they said , May it not be so !
42020017	But Jesus looked right at them . He said , What about this writing then ? " The stone which the builders would not use is now the chief corner stone . "
42020018	Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces . But if that stone falls on anyone , it will crush him .
42020019	The scribes and the chief priests wanted to catch Jesus right then but they feared the people . They understood that he had told this story against them .
42020020	So they watched for a chance to catch him . And they sent men to spy on him . These men acted as if they were good men . They did this because they wanted to catch him in something that he said . They wanted to give him over to the ruler who would judge and punish him .
42020021	So they asked Jesus , Teacher , we know that you talk and teach what is right . You do not fear any person . But you teach the true way of God .
42020022	Is it right to pay money as taxes to Caesar or is it not ?
42020023	He knew they were trying to get him into trouble .
42020024	So he said , Show me a piece of money . Whose picture and name are on it ? They said , Caesars
42020025	Then he said to them , So give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar , and give to God what belongs to God .
42020026	They were not able to catch him in anything he said in front of the people . They were surprised at his answer and they could not say anything .
42020027	Some of the Sadducees came to Jesus . ( They say that people do not rise from death . )
42020028	They came to ask Jesus a question . Teacher , they said , Moses gave us this law : " If a man dies and leaves a wife but no children , then his brother must marry the wife and raise a family for his brother . "
42020029	There were seven brothers . The first one married . He died and left no children .
42020030	The second one married the wife .
42020031	Then the third one married her . All seven brothers married her . They all had no children and they died .
42020032	Last of all , the woman died also .
42020033	Now then , when people rise from death , whose wife will she be ? All seven of them had married her .
42020034	Jesus said to them , Men and women in this world marry .
42020035	But men and women who are good enough to have a place in the next world and to be raised from death do not marry .
42020036	They cannot die again . They are like angels . They are Gods children because they have been raised from death .
42020037	Even Moses showed that people do rise from death . It is in his book where we read about the small tree which burned . Moses says that the Lord is the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob .
42020038	He is not the God of dead people , but of living people . All people are alive to him .
42020039	Some of the scribes said to him , Teacher , what you say is right .
42020040	After that , people were afraid to ask him any more questions .
42020041	But Jesus asked them , How can people say that Christ is Davids son ?
42020042	, fehlt/missing
42020043	David himself says in the book of the Psalms , " The LORD said to my Lord , sit beside me until I make you master over your enemies . "
42020044	So David calls Christ his Lord . How can Christ be Davids son ?
42020045	Then Jesus talked to his disciples while all the people could hear him .
42020046	He said , Take care . Do not let the scribes fool you . They like to walk about dressed in long gowns . They want people to greet them in the market . They want to have the front seats in the meeting houses . They want to sit in the best places at feasts .
42020047	They take away the homes of women whose husbands are dead . They cover up their wrong ways by talking to God a long time . They will be punished more !
42021001	Jesus looked around in the temple . He saw the place where the people put in their money . Rich people were putting in their money .
42021002	And he saw a poor woman whose husband was dead . She put in two small pieces of money .
42021003	Jesus said , I tell you the truth . This poor woman has given more than all the other people .
42021004	All these people had plenty of money and they gave only a part of it . She was poor and she gave everything she had . She has nothing left to live on .
42021005	Some people were talking about how nice the temple looked . They talked about the fine stones and the things people gave to make the temple .
42021006	Jesus said , You see these things . Not one stone here will be left on top of another . They will all be thrown down !
42021007	They asked him , Teacher , when will this happen ? What will be the sign when these things are going to be done ?
42021008	He said , Take care . Do not let anyone fool you . Many men will come in my name . They will say , " I am Christ . " And they will say , " The time is now . " Do not go after them .
42021009	When you hear about wars and fighting , do not fear . These things must happen first , but it is not the end right away .
42021010	Then he said , One tribe will fight against another tribe . And one country will fight against another country .
42021011	In some places the earth will shake very much . In many places the people will have no food to eat . And many people will be sick . There will be things to make people fear . There will be big signs in the sky .
42021012	But before all these things happen , people will catch you and trouble you . They will take you to the meeting houses to be judged . They will put you in prison . They will take you to kings and rulers because you are true to me .
42021013	This will be a chance for you to talk about me .
42021014	So do not trouble your minds about what you will say .
42021015	I will give you words and sense . All those who are against you will not be able to answer your words or say they are not true .
42021016	Even your parents , brothers , family people , and friends will give you over to trouble . They will kill some of you .
42021017	All people will hate you because you are true to me .
42021018	But you will not lose one hair from your heads .
42021019	If you keep on being true to me , you will live for ever .
42021020	When you see soldiers all around Jerusalem , then you will know that it will soon be broken down .
42021021	Then the people in Judea must go quickly to the hills . Those who are in the city must leave it . Those who are in the country must not come into the city .
42021022	Those will be days of punishment . All that has been written in the holy writings must happen .
42021023	In those days it will be very hard for women who are to have a child . It will be very hard for mothers who have babies . There will be big trouble on the earth . God will show his anger to these people .
42021024	They will be killed by swords or long knives . They will be taken away as prisoners to every country . Jerusalem will be broken down by people who are not Jews . They will walk over it until the end of their allowed time .
42021025	There will be signs in the sun , moon , and stars . And there will be much trouble for the people on earth . They will not know what to do . It will be like the sound of big waves of the sea .
42021026	Men will be weak with fear . They will be afraid of the things that will be happening to the world . The powers in the sky will be shaken .
42021027	Then people will see the sign of the Son of Man in a cloud . He will have much power and will be very great .
42021028	When these things begin to happen , look up . Lift up your heads . You will soon be free .
42021029	Jesus told them a story . He said , Look at a fig tree . Look at all the trees .
42021030	As soon as you see the leaves coming , you know that it will soon be the warm time of the year .
42021031	It is the same way when you see all these things happening . You will know that the kingdom of God is near .
42021032	I tell you the truth . People who are living then will not die before all these things happen .
42021033	The sky and the earth will pass away , but my words will not pass away .
42021034	But take care . Do not think too much about eating , drinking , and things in this life . If you do , that day will come and catch you like a trap .
42021035	That day will come to all people who are living on the whole earth .
42021036	Watch all the time . Ask God to make you strong to do right so that you will not go through all these things that are going to happen . Ask him to make you able to stand in front of the Son of Man .
42021037	Jesus taught in the temple every day . But at night he went out and stayed on the hill called the Mount of Olives .
42021038	Early in the morning all the people came to hear him in the temple .
42022001	It was near the time for the feast with bread that has no yeast in it . This is called the Passover Feast .
42022002	The chief priests and the scribes planned how to kill Jesus . But they feared the people .
42022003	Satan came into the heart of Judas . Judas was one of the twelve disciples . His other name was Iscariot .
42022004	Judas went away and talked things over with the chief priests and captains . He told them how he could help them catch Jesus .
42022005	They were glad , and they said they would give him money for it .
42022006	He agreed . He watched for a good way to help them catch Jesus when there were not too many people around .
42022007	It was the day of the feast with bread that has no yeast in it . The sheep had to be killed for the Passover Feast ,
42022008	So Jesus sent Peter and John , saying to them , Go and get the Passover Feast ready for us to eat .
42022009	They asked , Where do you want us to get it ready ?
42022010	He said , When you go into the city , a man carrying a pot of water will meet you . Follow him into the house where he goes .
42022011	Tell the master of the house , " The Teacher says , Where is the room where I can eat the Passover Feast with my disciples ? "
42022012	He will show you a large room upstairs . It will be all fixed up . Make it ready there .
42022013	So they went and found everything just the way Jesus had said . Then they made the Passover food ready .
42022014	When it was time to eat , he sat down at the table and the apostles sat down with him .
42022015	He said to them , I have wanted very much to eat this Passover Feast with you before my troubles come .
42022016	I tell you this . I will not eat it again until the great feast in the kingdom of God .
42022017	He took the cup and thanked God . He said , Take this . All of you drink from this .
42022018	I tell you this . I will not drink from the fruit of the vine again until the kingdom of God comes .
42022019	He took some bread . He thanked God for it and broke it . He gave it to the disciples and said , This is my body , which is given for you . When you do this , then remember me .
42022020	In the same way he took the cup after they had eaten . He said , This cup is the new agreement made by my blood . It is given for you .
42022021	There is a man who will give me over to my enemies . His hand is here at the table with me .
42022022	The Son of Man will go on as it was planned for him . But the man who gives him over will have trouble !
42022023	The disciples began to ask each other , Which of us will do this ?
42022024	They started to quarrel among themselves about which of them was the greatest person .
42022025	Jesus said to them , The kings of countries make their people obey them . Those who rule give themselves a good name .
42022026	But it must not be so among you . The one who is greatest among you must be like the most unimportant . And the leader must be like one who helps others .
42022027	Which man is greater , the man who sits at the table or the man who helps him ? Is it not the man who sits at the table ? But I am like the man who helps you .
42022028	You have stayed with me through my troubles .
42022029	My Father made me a ruler , and now I make you rulers .
42022030	You will eat and drink at my table in my kingdom . You will sit on chief chairs or thrones and judge the twelve tribes of Israel .
42022031	Simon , Simon , listen ! Satan has asked to have all of you . He wants to shake you like grain with the cleaning fan .
42022032	But I have talked to God about you , Simon , so that you will keep on believing in me . And when you come back , then help your brothers to be strong .
42022033	Simon said , Lord , I will go with you , even to prison or to die .
42022034	Jesus said , I tell you this , Peter . This very day , before the cock calls , you will say three times that you do not know me .
42022035	Jesus said to them , When I sent you out to the towns , I told you not to carry a money bag , or a bag , or shoes . Did you ever need anything at that time ? They said , No .
42022036	He said , But this time , anyone who has money should take it and his bag too . Anyone who has no sword should sell his coat and buy one .
42022037	The holy writings say , " He was counted as one of the bad people . " And I tell you , that means me . And the things that are written about me must happen to me .
42022038	The disciples said , Look , Lord , here are two swords . And he answered , That is enough .
42022039	Then Jesus went out of the room and went to the hill called the Mount of Olives where he often went . His disciples went with him .
42022040	He said to them , Talk with God so that you will not do wrong .
42022041	He went away from them about as far as a person can throw a stone . Then he kneeled down to talk with God .
42022042	He said , Father , if you will , take this cup away from me . But do not do what I want but what you want .
42022043	Then an angel came to him from heaven and helped to make him strong .
42022044	His heart was troubled very much . So he talked with God more than before . His sweat was like big drops of blood falling on the ground .
42022045	He stopped talking with God and got up . He went to his disciples and found them sleeping because they were sad .
42022046	He said to them , Why are you sleeping ? Get up . Talk with God so that you will not do wrong .
42022047	As Jesus was saying this , many men came . One of the twelve disciples , named Judas , was leading the people . He came near Jesus to kiss him .
42022048	Jesus said to him , Judas , will you give over the Son of Man to his enemies with a kiss ?
42022049	The disciples around Jesus saw what was going to happen . They said , Lord , shall we fight with our swords ?
42022050	One of them hit the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear .
42022051	Jesus said , Just let me do this . And he touched the mans ear and healed him .
42022052	The chief priests , the captains of the temple , and the leaders of the people had come to catch Jesus . He said to them , Have you come to take me with swords and sticks , the way you catch a man who steals ?
42022053	I was with you every day in the temple . You did not try to catch me then . But this is your time now , the time of the power of darkness .
42022054	The men caught Jesus and took him away to the high priests house . Peter followed them far behind .
42022055	They made a fire in the yard and sat around it . Peter sat down with them .
42022056	A woman saw Peter sitting by the fire . She looked at him and said , This man was with him also .
42022057	But Peter said , Woman , I do not know him .
42022058	After a while , another person saw him and said , You are one of them also . But Peter said , Man , I am not .
42022059	About an hour later another person said , Surely this man was with him . He comes from Galilee .
42022060	Peter said , Man , I do not know what you are talking about . And right then , while he was talking , the cock called .
42022061	The Lord turned and looked at Peter . Then Peter remembered that the Lord had said to him , Before the cock calls in the morning , you will say three times that you do not know me .
42022062	Peter went out and cried very much .
42022063	The men who guarded Jesus made fun of him and beat him .
42022064	They tied something over his eyes . Then they hit him in the face and said , Tell us if you know who hit you !
42022065	And they said many other wrong things to him .
42022066	In the morning the leaders of the people , the chief priests and scribes met together . They took Jesus to their court .
42022067	They said , If you are the Christ , tell us . Jesus said , If I tell you , you will not believe .
42022068	And if I ask you anything , you will not answer .
42022069	From this time on the Son of Man will sit beside God who has all power .
42022070	They all said , Then are you the Son of God ? " He said , Yes , I am .
42022071	They said , We do not need any more proof against him . We ourselves have heard what he said .
42023001	Then all the people got up and took Jesus to Pilate .
42023002	They began to make a complaint against him . They said , This man is leading our people to do wrong . He says we should not pay taxes to Caesar . He says that he is Christ , a King .
42023003	Then Pilate asked Jesus , Are you the King of the Jews ? " Jesus answered , Yes , I am .
42023004	Pilate said to the chief priests and to the people , I find nothing wrong in this man .
42023005	But they said all the more , He troubles the people by his teaching . He has been teaching people in all the country of Judea . He began in Galilee and has come as far as this city .
42023006	When Pilate heard this , he asked , Is this man from Galilee ?
42023007	When he knew that he came from Herods country , he sent him to Herod . Herod was in Jerusalem at that time .
42023008	He was glad to see Jesus . He had heard about him . And he had wanted to see him for a long time . He was hoping that he would see Jesus do a big work .
42023009	He asked Jesus many questions . But Jesus did not answer him .
42023010	The chief priests and the scribes stood near . They brought strong complaints against him .
42023011	Then Herod and his soldiers laughed at Jesus and made fun of him . He dressed him up in very fine clothes and sent him back to Pilate .
42023012	Herod and Pilate became friends that day . Before that , they had hated each other .
42023013	Pilate then called the chief priests , and the rulers , and the people .
42023014	He said to them , You brought this man to me . You said he is leading your people to do wrong . I have asked questions here in front of you . I have found nothing wrong in this man .
42023015	Herod did the same . He sent him back to us . This man has done nothing for which he should die .
42023016	So I will beat him and let him go .
42023017	At the feast Pilate always let one man go free .
42023018	But they all shouted , Kill this man ! Let Barabbas go free for us !
42023019	( Barabbas had been put in prison because he led some people who had been fighting in the city . He had killed a man . )
42023020	Pilate talked to the people again . He wanted to let Jesus go free .
42023021	But they shouted , Nail him to a cross ! Nail him to a cross ! "
42023022	Pilate said to them the third time , Why , what wrong thing has he done ? I have not found any wrong thing for which he should die . So I will beat him and let him go .
42023023	But they shouted all the more loudly , saying , Nail him to a cross ! And Pilate gave in to their shouting .
42023024	So he said they could have it their way .
42023025	He let the other man go free . ( He was the one who had been put in prison because he fought and had killed a man . He was the one the people asked Pilate to let go free . ) And Pilate did to Jesus what they wanted him to do .
42023026	They took Jesus away . On the way , they caught a man who was coming in from the farms . His name was Simon . He was born in the country of Cyrene . They made him walk behind Jesus and carry his cross .
42023027	Many people followed him . Women cried and were sorry for him .
42023028	But Jesus turned to them and said , Daughters of Jerusalem , do not cry for me . But cry for yourselves and for your children .
42023029	The time will come when people will say , " Happy are the women who have no children or who have never had a child . "
42023030	Then people will begin to say to the big hills , " Fall on us . " They will say to the small hills , " Hide us . "
42023031	If this is what people do when the wood is new , what will they do when it is old ?
42023032	Two men were also led away to be killed with Jesus . They were bad men .
42023033	They came to the place called Calvary ( the head bone . ) There they nailed the two bad men to the crosses also . They put one man on the right side of Jesus and one man on the left side of him .
42023034	Jesus said , Father , forgive them ! They do not know what they are doing . The soldiers played a game to see how they should divide his clothes .
42023035	The people stood around watching . But the rulers made fun of him . They said , He saved other people . He should save himself if he is Gods Christ , Gods chosen one !
42023036	The soldiers made fun of him . They came and brought him wine to drink .
42023037	They said , If you are the King of the Jews , save yourself !
42023038	The sign that was put above Jesus head said , This is the King of the Jews .
42023039	One of the bad men who was hanging there said wrong things against Jesus . He said If you are the Christ , why do you not save yourself and us ?
42023040	But the other bad man told him to stop . He said , Do you not even fear God ? You are being punished just as he is .
42023041	It is right for us to be punished because we have done wrong things . But this man has done nothing bad .
42023042	He said to Jesus , Lord , remember me when you become a King .
42023043	And Jesus said to him , I tell you the truth . Today you will be with me in Gods garden of paradise .
42023044	About noontime the whole land became dark and stayed dark for three hours .
42023045	The sun did not shine . The big cloth that hung in the temple was torn into two pieces .
42023046	Jesus called out loud , Father , I put my spirit into your hands ! When he had said this , he died .
42023047	The captain saw all this . Then he praised God . He said , Surely , this was a good man !
42023048	Many people were around there to look on . When they saw what happened , they all went home beating their chests [ because they were sad ] .
42023049	All Jesus friends and the women who had come with him from Galilee stood far away . They saw all of this .
42023050	There was a man named Joseph . He was a member of the court . He was a good man who lived the right way .
42023051	He had not wanted the people to do what they did . He was looking for the kingdom of God . He was from a town of the Jews , called Arimathea .
42023052	He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus .
42023053	He took the body down from the cross . He wrapped it in a linen cloth and laid it in a grave cut in a rock . No one had ever been put in this grave .
42023054	It was the day before the Sabbath . And it was almost time for the Sabbath to begin .
42023055	Some women had come with Jesus from Galilee . They followed and saw the grave where his body was put .
42023056	Then they went back and got things ready to put on his body . These things were spices that smelled very nice , and sweet kinds of oil . On the Sabbath day they rested as the law said they should .
42024001	On the first day of the week , early in the morning , the women went to the grave . They took with them the things they had made ready .
42024002	They saw that the stone was rolled away from the grave .
42024003	So they went in . But they did not see the body of the Lord Jesus .
42024004	They were troubled about this . Then they saw two men standing near them . They were dressed in white clothes .
42024005	The women were afraid and bowed their faces down to the ground . The men said to them , Why do you look for a living person among dead people ?
42024006	He is not here . He has risen . Remember what he told you when he was still in Galilee .
42024007	He said that the Son of Man would be given over to bad men . He would be nailed to a cross , and he would rise on the third day .
42024008	Then they remembered what he had said .
42024009	They left the grave and went back . They told all these things to the eleven disciples and to all the other people .
42024010	The women who told these things to the apostles were Mary Magdalene , Joanna , Mary the mother of James , and the other women who were with them .
42024011	But Peter got up and ran to the grave . He bowed down and looked in . He saw the linen clothes lying there , but nothing more . Then he left , wondering about what had happened .
42024012	That same day , two of the disciples were going to the town called Emmaus . It was about two hours walk from Jerusalem .
42024013	They were talking together about all the things that had happened .
42024014	While they were talking and asking each other questions , Jesus himself came and walked with them .
42024015	But even though they saw him , they did not know who he was .
42024016	Jesus asked them , What is this that you are talking about as you walk along looking so sad ?
42024017	One of them named Cleophas answered him . He said , Are you a stranger in Jerusalem and do not know what has happened there these last days ?
42024018	Jesus said , What things ? " They said , All that has happened to Jesus of Nazareth . He was a prophet of God . He had power to do big works and to teach the people . He was respected by God and all the people .
42024019	Our chief priests and rulers gave him over to be punished by death , and they nailed him to a cross .
42024020	But we were hoping that he was the one who would free the people of Israel . But that is not all . This is the third day since they did it .
42024021	Some of our women told us things that surprised us . Early this morning they were at the grave .
42024022	They did not find his body there . They came back and said that they saw angels . The angels told them that Jesus was living .
42024023	Some of us went to the grave . And they found everything just as the women said . But they did not see Jesus .
42024024	Then he said to them , You foolish men ! Your hearts are slow to believe all that the prophets of God have said long ago .
42024025	Christ had to have this trouble and go to the place where he will be great , did he not ?
42024026	Then he told them the meaning of all that Moses and all the prophets of God long ago had written about him .
42024027	They came near the village to which they were going . It looked as if he was going on further .
42024028	But they begged him not to go further . They said , Stay with us . It will soon be night . The day is almost finished . So he went in to stay with them .
42024029	He sat down at the table with them . Then he took the bread and thanked God for it . He broke it and gave it to them .
42024030	Then they saw who he was . They knew him . And then suddenly they could not see him any more .
42024031	They said to each other , It was like a fire burning in our hearts when he talked to us on the road and told us the meaning of the holy writings !
42024032	They got up right then and went back to Jerusalem . There they found the eleven disciples together . Some other people were with them .
42024033	These people said , The Lord has really risen ! He came to Simon !
42024034	Then the men from Emmaus told them what had happened on the road . They told how they knew Jesus when he broke bread and gave it to them .
42024035	While they were telling them this , Jesus himself stood there with them . He said to them , Peace to you !
42024036	They were troubled and afraid . They thought they were seeing a spirit .
42024037	He said to them , Why are you troubled ? Why do you wonder about these things in your hearts ?
42024038	Look at my hands and my feet . You can see that it is I myself . Touch me with your hands and see . A spirit does not have a body and bones as you see I have .
42024039	They gave him a piece of cooked fish .
42024040	He took the fish and ate it in front of them .
42024041	Then he said , I told you this while I was with you . I told you that things were written about me in the books of Moses , the Prophets , and the Psalms . And I told you that all of these things must come true .
42024042	Then he taught them so that they understood the things in the holy writings .
42024043	He said , It is written that the Christ must have trouble . On the third day he will rise from death .
42024044	Men will talk in his name to people in all countries . They will tell them to stop their wrong ways and ask to be forgiven . They will begin in Jerusalem .
42024045	You are the men who have seen these things , and will tell people about them .
42024046	I will send you what the Father has promised to give you . So wait in the city of Jerusalem until you have been given power from God .
42024047	Jesus led the disciples out as far as the town of Bethany . He put up his hands and blessed them .
42024048	While he was blessing them , he left them . He was taken up into heaven .
42024049	They bowed down and worshipped him . They were very happy and went back to Jerusalem .
42024050	Every day they were in the temple praising God .

43001001	The Word already was , way back before anything began to be . The Word and God were together . The Word was God .
43001002	Before anything began to be , the Word was there with God .
43001003	God made everything by the Word . Nothing has been made without him .
43001004	Life was in the Word . That life was Light for people .
43001005	The Light shone where it was dark and the darkness did not stop the Light from shining .
43001006	God sent a man named John .
43001007	He came to talk about the Light , so that all people might believe in the Light by what he said .
43001008	He himself was not that Light , but he was sent to talk about the Light .
43001009	The true Light which gives light to every person who comes into the world .
43001010	He , the Word , was in the world . Yes , he even made the world . And yet the world did not know him .
43001011	He came into the world that was his own , but his own people did not receive him .
43001012	But there were people who did believe in his name . They did receive him . He gave all those who received him and believed him the right to become children of God .
43001013	They were born into Gods family by God . That is , they were not born into his family in the way a person is born into this world . It was not by any persons will .
43001014	The Word became man and he lived among us . We saw with our own eyes that he is great . He is great the way God the Father made his only Son great . We saw that he is full of loving kindness and truth .
43001015	John talked about him . He called out saying , Here is the man I told you about . I said that the one who is coming after me is greater than I am , because he lived before I lived .
43001016	He was full of loving kindness , and we have all received so much kindness from him .
43001017	Moses gave the law , but Jesus Christ gave this loving kindness and truth .
43001018	No one has ever seen God . But his only Son is very near to his Fathers heart . He has told us plainly about God .
43001019	The leaders of the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem . They asked John , Who are you ? John told them .
43001020	He did not hide the truth , but he told people plainly . He said , I am not the Christ .
43001021	So they asked him , Well then , are you Elijah ? He answered , No , I am not . They asked , Are you the Prophet ? He answered , No .
43001022	Then those priests said , Who are you ? We want to give an answer to the people who sent us . What do you say about yourself ?
43001023	John said , I am a voice calling in the desert , " Make the road straight for the Lord . " This is what was said by Isaiah , the prophet of God long ago .
43001024	It was the Pharisees who had sent these people to John .
43001025	So they asked him , If you are not the Christ , nor Elijah , nor the Prophet , why then are you baptizing ?
43001026	John answered , I baptize people in water . But there is a man standing among you whom you do not know .
43001027	He is the one coming after me who is greater than I am . I am not even good enough to untie his shoe strings .
43001028	The place where John was baptizing was Bethany on the other side of the Jordan River .
43001029	The next day John saw Jesus coming to him . Look , said John . See Gods special Lamb ! He takes away the wrong ways of the world .
43001030	Here is the man I told you about . I said that the one who is coming after me is greater than I am , because he lived before I lived .
43001031	I myself did not know who he was . But I came and baptized people in water so that the people of Israel would know who he was .
43001032	John also said , I saw the Spirit coming from the sky . He came down on him like a dove . It stayed on him .
43001033	I myself did not know who he was . But he who sent me to baptize people in water told me . He said , " You will see the Spirit coming from the sky on a man . That man will baptize people in the Holy Spirit . "
43001034	I saw the Spirit coming on him , and I have told you . This man is the Son of God .
43001035	The next day , John was standing with two of his followers .
43001036	Jesus walked by . When John saw him , he said , Look , see Gods Lamb !
43001037	The two followers heard what John said , so they went after Jesus .
43001038	Jesus turned . He saw them coming after him . He said to them , What are you looking for ? They said , Teacher , where do you live ?
43001039	Jesus said , Come and see . They went and saw the place where Jesus was staying . The time was about four oclock in the afternoon . They stayed with Jesus the rest of the day .
43001040	Andrew was one of those two followers of John who heard John speak and went after Jesus . He was Simon Peters brother .
43001041	The first thing Andrew did then was to find his brother Simon . He said , We have found the Messiah ! ( Messiah means the Christ , the messenger of God . )
43001042	Andrew brought Simon to Jesus . Jesus looked at him and said , You are Simon , the son of John . Your name will be Cephas . ( Cephas means Peter , a rock or stone . )
43001043	The next day Jesus said , I will go to Galilee . He found Philip and said to him , Come with me .
43001044	Philip was from the town of Bethsaida . Andrew and Peter were also from that town .
43001045	Philip went to find Nathanael . He said We have found the man about whom Moses wrote in the books of the law . The prophets also wrote about him . He is Jesus , from Nazareth . He is the son of Joseph .
43001046	Nathanael said , From Nazareth ? Can any good thing come from there ? Philip said , Come and see for yourself .
43001047	Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him . He said , Here is a man who is truly of Israel . He does not fool people .
43001048	Nathanael asked , How do you know me ? Jesus answered , I saw you when you were under the fig tree . That was before Philip called you .
43001049	Nathanael said , Teacher , you are the Son of God . You are the King of Israel .
43001050	Jesus answered , I told you that I saw you under the fig tree . Is that why you believe in me now ? You will see more wonderful things than that !
43001051	I tell you the truth , said Jesus . You will see heaven open . You will see Gods angels going up and down to the Son of Man .
43002001	Two days later there was a wedding in the town of Cana in the country of Galilee . Jesus mother was there .
43002002	Jesus and his disciples were also asked to the wedding .
43002003	The people needed more wine . Then Jesus mother said to him , They have no wine .
43002004	Jesus said , Woman , why are you telling me about it ? It is not yet the time for me to do something .
43002005	His mother said to the servants , Do all that he tells you to do .
43002006	Six very large water pots made of stone were standing there . The pots were there because the Jews had a certain law about washing themselves .
43002007	Jesus said , Fill the pots with water . So they filled them to the very top .
43002008	Jesus said , Now take some out . Carry it to the one in charge of the feast . They did what he said .
43002009	The man in charge of the feast tasted the water that was now turned into wine . He did not know where it came from , but the servants who drew the water knew . When the man had tasted it , he called the man who was being married .
43002010	He said , Other people give the good wine at the beginning of the feast . When people have had all they want , then they give the wine which is not so good . But you have kept the good wine until now .
43002011	This was the first big work that Jesus did . It was in Cana in Galilee . He showed that he was great . And his disciples believed in him .
43002012	After this he went to the town called Capernaum . His mother , his brothers , and his disciples also went with him . They stayed there for a few days .
43002013	The time for the Passover Feast of the Jews was near . So Jesus went to Jerusalem .
43002014	In the temple he found people buying and selling things . They were selling cows , sheep , and doves . Others were sitting at tables changing money for the people .
43002015	Jesus tied some pieces of cord together to make a whip . Then he drove out all the people who were buying and selling in the temple . And he drove out the sheep and the cows . He threw down the tables of the money changers and their money .
43002016	He said to the people who sold doves , Take these things out of here . Do not make my Fathers house into a market place .
43002017	His disciples remembered that Gods word says , My love for your house is like a fire burning in me .
43002018	The leaders of the Jews said to Jesus , Who gave you the right to do this ? What big work will prove it to us ?
43002019	Jesus answered them , Break down this temple and in three days I will raise it up .
43002020	The Jewish leaders said , It took forty-six years to build this temple . Do you say you will raise it in three days ?
43002021	But Jesus was talking about the temple which was his body .
43002022	After Jesus died and had been raised from death , the disciples remembered that he had said this to them . Then they believed what the holy writings say . They also believed what Jesus had said to them .
43002023	Many people believed in Jesus name when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast . They believed in him because they saw the big works he did .
43002024	But Jesus would not trust himself to them .
43002025	He knew what all people are like . He did not need anyone to tell him about any person , because he knew what was in a persons heart .
43003001	There was a man named Nicodemus . He was a Pharisee , a ruler and leader of the Jews .
43003002	One night Nicodemus came to Jesus . He said , Master , we know you are a teacher sent by God . We know this because no person could do the big works you are doing if God did not help him .
43003003	Jesus said , I tell you the truth . No person can see Gods kingdom if he is not born again .
43003004	Nicodemus said , How can a man be born when he is old ? Can he go inside of his mother again and be born ?
43003005	Jesus said , I tell you the truth . This new birth is by water and by the Spirit . No person can enter Gods kingdom if he has not been born that way .
43003006	That which is born of a person is flesh , and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit .
43003007	You must not be surprised when I say , " You must be born again . "
43003008	The wind blows where it wants to blow . You can hear the sound of it . But you do not know where it comes from , and you do not know where it goes . It is the same way with everyone who is born of the Spirit .
43003009	Nicodemus asked Jesus , How can such things be ?
43003010	Jesus answered , Are you a teacher of the people of Israel and you do not know this ?
43003011	I tell you the truth . We know what we are talking about . We talk about the things we have seen . But you will not believe what we tell you .
43003012	You do not believe what I have told you about things on earth . So how will you believe if I tell you about things in heaven ?
43003013	No one has ever gone up to heaven-only the One who came down from heaven . That One is the Son of Man who is in heaven .
43003014	Moses lifted up a snake on a piece of wood in the desert . So the Son of Man must be lifted up .
43003015	Then everyone who believes in him will not die , but will live for ever .
43003016	God loved the world so very , very much that he gave his only Son . Because he did that , everyone who believes in him will not lose his life , but will live for ever .
43003017	God did not send his Son into the world to judge the world . He sent him to save the world .
43003018	Everyone who believes in the Son will not be judged . But everyone who does not believe in him is judged already , because he does not believe in the name of Gods only Son .
43003019	Light came into the world . But people wanted to be in the dark because they did wrong things . They did not want the light . That is why they are judged .
43003020	Everyone who does wrong things hates light . He does not come to the light because he is afraid people will see what he does and will say it is bad .
43003021	But everyone who does what is right comes to the light . He wants people to see that God helps him to do what is right .
43003022	After this , Jesus and his disciples came into the country of Judea . Jesus stayed there with them and baptized people .
43003023	John was also baptizing people in the river at Aenon , near the town of Salim . There was much water . People came to him and were baptized .
43003024	This was before John was put in prison .
43003025	Johns disciples and the leaders of the Jews were talking about how to be clean , the way God wants us to be clean .
43003026	They came to John and said , Teacher , there was a man with you on the other side of the Jordan River . You were telling people about him . Now he himself is baptizing and all the people are going to him .
43003027	John answered , A man cannot get anything unless God in heaven gives it to him .
43003028	You yourselves heard what I said . I am not the Christ but I have been sent ahead of the Christ .
43003029	The wife belongs to the man who has married her . The mans best friend may stand and listen . And when he hears what that man says , he is very glad for him . So what I hear makes me very glad in the same way .
43003030	He must become more and more great , but I must become less and less great .
43003031	The one who comes from heaven is greater than all other people . The one who is of the earth talks about things on earth . So the one who comes from heaven is greater than all .
43003032	He tells what he has seen and heard , but no one wants to believe what he says .
43003033	If a person believes what the one from heaven says , then he also says God is true .
43003034	The one God sent speaks the words of God . God does not give him the Spirit little by little , but he gives the Spirit in full .
43003035	The Father loves his Son and has put everything in his hand .
43003036	He who believes in the Son will live for ever . He who does not believe in the Son will not live . God will be very angry with him for ever .
43004001	The Pharisees heard that Jesus was getting people to follow him and was baptizing them . ( Jesus disciples baptized them , not he himself . ) He now had more followers than John .
43004002	The Lord knew that they had heard about it . So he left Judea and went back to Galilee again .
43004003	He had to pass through the country of Samaria .
43004004	He came to a town in Samaria called Sychar . It was near the field that Jacob gave to his son Joseph .
43004005	Jacobs well was there . Jesus was very tired from walking on the road . So he sat down by the well . It was about midday .
43004006	A woman from Samaria came to the well to draw water . Jesus said , Please give me a drink of water .
43004007	His disciples had gone into the town to buy some food .
43004008	The woman said to Jesus , Why do you ask me for a drink of water ? You are a Jew and I am from Samaria . ( The Jews are not friends with the people of Samaria . )
43004009	Jesus answered her , You do not know what God gives people . And you do not know who is asking you for a drink . If you knew him , then it is you who would have asked for a drink of water . He would give you living water .
43004010	The woman said , Sir , you have nothing to draw with . The well is deep . Where do you get that living water ?
43004011	Are you greater than our father Jacob who gave us this well ? He drank water from this well , also his children and cattle .
43004012	Jesus answered her , Anyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again .
43004013	But anyone who drinks the water that I will give him will never be thirsty . The water I give him will become a well inside of him that will never be dry . It will give him life for ever .
43004014	The woman said , Sir , give me this water . Then I will never be thirsty again . I will not need to come here to draw water .
43004015	Jesus said , Go , call your husband , then come here .
43004016	She said , I have no husband . Jesus said , You say , " I have no husband . " That is true .
43004017	You have had five husbands , but the man you are living with now is not your husband . You have told the truth .
43004018	The woman said , Sir , this shows me you are a prophet of God .
43004019	Our fathers came to this mountain to worship God . But you people say Jerusalem is the place people must go to worship him .
43004020	Jesus said , Woman , believe what I say . The time is coming when you will not come to this mountain or to Jerusalem to worship my Father .
43004021	You worship one whom you do not know . But we know whom we worship . The Saviour will come of the Jews .
43004022	But the time is coming , yes , the time is here already , when those who worship God will worship him in spirit and in a true way . My Father is looking for that kind of people to worship him .
43004023	God is Spirit . Those who worship him must do so in spirit and in a true way .
43004024	The woman said to Jesus , I know that Messiah is coming . His name is Christ . When he comes he will tell us everything .
43004025	Jesus said to her , I who am talking to you am he .
43004026	When Jesus had said this , his disciples came back . They were surprised to hear him talking to a woman . But not one of them asked , What do you want ? or , Why are you talking to her ?
43004027	The woman left her water-pot and went back to the town .
43004028	She said to the people , Come , I will show you a man who has told me everything I have done . Can this be the Christ ?
43004029	The people left the town and went to him .
43004030	While they were on the way coming to Jesus , the disciples asked him , Teacher , will you please eat .
43004031	Jesus said to them , I have food that you do not know about .
43004032	So the disciples asked one another , Has anyone brought him food to eat ?
43004033	Jesus said to them , My food is to obey the one who sent me and to finish his work .
43004034	Do you not say , " In four months it will be harvest time " ? Listen , I say . Look up and see the fields . The harvest is ready to cut now .
43004035	The one who gathers the harvest receives a reward for it . He gathers a harvest that will live for ever . Then the one who sows and the one who gathers will both be happy .
43004036	This saying is true here : " One sows and another gathers . "
43004037	I sent you to gather what you did not help to plant . Other people have worked hard and you have been helped through their work .
43004038	Many of the people of the town believed in Jesus because of what the woman told them . She said , He told me everything I have done .
43004039	When the people from Samaria came , they begged him to stay with them . So he stayed with them for two days .
43004040	Many more people believed in Jesus because of his own word .
43004041	They said to the woman , Now we believe , not because of what you told us , but because of what he himself has told us . We know it is true . This is the Saviour of the world .
43004042	Two days after this , Jesus left Samaria and went to Galilee .
43004043	Jesus himself said , No prophet is honoured by the people in his own country .
43004044	When he came to Galilee , the people of that country were glad to see him . They had seen all the things he did when he was at the feast in Jerusalem . They had been at the feast also .
43004045	So Jesus came back to the town of Cana in Galilee . That was the place where he had changed water into wine . One of the kings officers was there . His son was sick in the town of Capernaum .
43004046	He heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee , and he went to Jesus and said , I beg you , come and heal my son . He is dying .
43004047	Jesus said to him , If you do not see some signs and big works , then you will not believe .
43004048	The officer said , Sir , I beg you . Come right away before my son dies .
43004049	Jesus said , Go home . Your son will not die . The man believed what Jesus said and went home .
43004050	On the way , his servants met him . They said , Your son is living .
43004051	He asked , What time did he begin to get well ? They said , Yesterday at one hour after midday the fever left him .
43004052	The father knew that was the time when Jesus said to him Your son will not die . So he and all his family believed in Jesus .
43004053	This was the second big work that Jesus did after he came back from Judea to Galilee .

43005001	After that , the Jews had a feast and Jesus went to Jerusalem .
43005002	In Jerusalem , near the Sheep Gate , there is a wide water hole . The Jews called this water hole Bethesda . It had five places with roofs for people to stand under .
43005003	Many sick people were lying on these places . Some of them were blind . Some were lame . Some were very thin and stiff so that they could not move by themselves . All of them were waiting for the water to move .
43005004	An angel came down into the water at a certain time and made it move . The first person who stepped into the water when it moved was healed of any sickness that he had .
43005005	A man was there who had been sick for thirty eight years .
43005006	Jesus saw the man lying there . He knew that he had been sick for a long time . He said to him , Do you want to be healed ?
43005007	The sick man said to him , Sir , I have no man to put me into the water when it moves . While I am trying to get in , some other person comes and gets in before me .
43005008	Jesus said , Get up . Take up your bed and walk !
43005009	The man was healed right away . He took up his bed and walked . This happened on the Sabbath day .
43005010	So the leaders of the Jews talked to the man who was healed . They said , It is the Sabbath day . It is not right for you to carry your bed .
43005011	But he answered them , The man who healed me said to me , " Take up your bed and walk . "
43005012	They asked him , Who is the man who told you to take up your bed and walk ?
43005013	The man who was healed said , I do not know who he is . Many people were at the place and Jesus had gone away .
43005014	After that , Jesus saw the man in the temple . He said to him , See , you are healed . Do no more wrong things . If you do , something worse may happen to you .
43005015	The man went away and told the leaders of the Jews that it was Jesus who had healed him .
43005016	The Jewish leaders made trouble for Jesus because he did this on the Sabbath day .
43005017	But Jesus answered them , My Father is still working and I am working also .
43005018	This was why the leaders of the Jews tried much more to kill Jesus . He had broken the law of the Sabbath day . And also he called God his Father . In that way , he was making himself equal with God .
43005019	Jesus said to them , I tell you the truth . The Son cannot do anything alone . He sees what his Father is doing and he does the same .
43005020	My Father loves his Son . He shows him all that he himself is doing . He will show his Son bigger works than these so that you may be surprised .
43005021	My Father raises people who were dead , and gives them life . So his Son gives life to anyone he wants to .
43005022	My Father judges no one , but he has made his Son to be the judge of everything .
43005023	He did this so that all people would respect the Son , just as they respect his Father . My Father has sent his Son . Anyone who does not respect his Son does not respect the Father .
43005024	I tell you the truth . The person who hears what I say and believes in him that sent me will live for ever . He will not be judged . He has already passed from death to life .
43005025	I tell you the truth . The time is coming . Yes , the time is here when the dead people will hear the voice of the Son of God . Those who hear his voice will live .
43005026	My Father has life in himself . And so he has made his Son to have life in himself .
43005027	He has given his Son power also to judge because he is the Son of Man .
43005028	Do not be surprised at what I say . The time is coming when all who are in the graves will hear his voice .
43005029	They will come out of the graves . Those who have done what is good will come out to live . But those who have done what is wrong will come out to be punished .
43005030	I have no right to do anything myself . I judge the way I am told to judge . The way I judge people is right . I do not do what I myself want to do , but I do what my Father wants me to do . He sent me .
43005031	If I talk about myself , then what I say is not true .
43005032	But someone else also speaks about me . I know what he says about me is true .
43005033	You sent someone to John and he has told you the truth about me .
43005034	I do not need to listen to what a person says about me . But I tell you this so that you may be saved .
43005035	John was a light burning and shining . For a while you were happy to be in his light .
43005036	But I have something greater than John to talk for me . It is the works that I do . My Father has given me works to finish . The works that I do tell that he sent me .
43005037	And my Father who sent me has himself talked about me . You have never heard him speak and you do not know what he is like .
43005038	The word he talks is not in your hearts , because you do not believe the one he sent to you .
43005039	You read holy writings carefully . You think that there you will find out how to live for ever . In the same writings you will read about me .
43005040	And yet you will not come to me for that life .
43005041	I do not want people to call me great .
43005042	But I know that you do not love God in your hearts .
43005043	I have come in my Fathers name , but you will not receive me . If another person comes in his own name , then you will receive him .
43005044	How can you believe ? You are always calling each other great , but you do not want the only God to make you great .
43005045	Do not think that I will carry a complaint against you to my Father . Moses has already carried the complaint against you . He is the very one you trust .
43005046	If you really believed Moses , you would believe me too , because he wrote about me .
43005047	But if you do not believe what he wrote , how will you believe what I say ?
43006001	Then Jesus crossed over the sea of Galilee . ( Another name for this sea was Tiberias . )
43006002	Many people followed him because they saw the big works he had done in healing the sick people .
43006003	Jesus went up on a hill and sat down with his disciples .
43006004	The time for the Passover Feast of the Jews was near .
43006005	When Jesus looked up , he saw many people coming to him . He said to Philip , Where shall we buy food for these people to eat ?
43006006	Jesus knew what he himself would do , but he said this to see what Philip would do .
43006007	Philip answered him , It would take nearly a years wages to buy enough food for them , even if each one gets only a little .
43006008	One of Jesus disciples , Andrew , the brother of Simon Peter , talked to Jesus .
43006009	He said , A boy here has five loaves of bread and two small fish . But what can that little bit of food do for so many people ?
43006010	Jesus said , Tell the people to sit down . Much grass was there . The number of men who sat down was about five thousand .
43006011	Then Jesus took the bread and thanked God for it . He gave it to the disciples and they divided it among those who were sitting . He did the same thing with the fish . The people had all they wanted .
43006012	When they had eaten enough , he said to his disciples , Gather up all the pieces that are left so that nothing will be lost .
43006013	They gathered all the pieces of the five loaves . Twelve baskets full were left over after all the people had eaten enough .
43006014	When those men saw the big work that Jesus did , they said , Truly , this is the Prophet that is to come into the world .
43006015	The people wanted to take Jesus by force to make him a king . When he saw this , he left again and went on the hill by himself .
43006016	In the evening his disciples went down to the lake [ called the sea of Galilee ] .
43006017	They got in a boat and crossed over the sea toward the town of Capernaum . It was dark , but Jesus had not come back to them .
43006018	A strong wind was blowing . It made the water very rough .
43006019	They rowed the boat into the middle of the lake . Then they saw Jesus walking on the water . He came close to the boat . They were afraid .
43006020	But Jesus said to them , It is I . Do not fear .
43006021	Then they were glad to take him into the boat . Then at once the boat reached the land to which they were going .
43006022	The people who stayed back on the land had seen one boat only . They had seen the disciples get in it and go away without Jesus .
43006023	But there were some other boats from Tiberias . It was near the place where they had eaten bread , after the Lord had thanked God for it .
43006024	The next day the people saw that Jesus and his disciples were not there . Then they went to Capernaum in boats to look for Jesus .
43006025	When they found Jesus on the other side of the lake , they said , Teacher , when did you get here ?
43006026	Jesus said , I tell you the truth . You do not want me because you saw the big works I did , but you want me because you ate all the bread you wanted .
43006027	Do not work for the food that spoils , but work for the food that will never spoil , the food that will give you life for ever . The Son of Man will give you that food . God my Father has chosen him to do that .
43006028	They asked him , What works does God ask us to do ?
43006029	Jesus answered them , The work that God asks you to do is to believe in the one whom he has sent .
43006030	They said , What big work will you do ? We want to see it and believe you . What work are you are going to do ?
43006031	Our fathers ate bread in the wilderness . The holy writings say , " He gave them bread from heaven to eat . " Jesus said to them , I tell you the truth . It was not Moses who gave you that bread from heaven . But my Father gives you true bread from heaven .
43006033	He who comes down from heaven is the bread that God gives . He is the one who gives life to the world .
43006034	They said to him , Lord , give us this bread always !
43006035	Jesus said , I am the bread that gives life . Anyone who comes to me will never be hungry . Anyone who believes in me will never be thirsty .
43006036	But I said to you that you have seen me , and yet you will not believe in me .
43006037	All those whom my Father gives me , they will come to me . I will never turn anyone away who comes to me .
43006038	I did not come down from heaven to do what I myself want to do . I came to do what the one who sent me wants me to do .
43006039	My Father sent me . He wants me to lose nothing that he has given me . And he wants me to raise it up on the last day .
43006040	My Father wants everyone who sees his Son and believes in him to live for ever . I will raise him up on the last day .
43006041	The leaders of the Jews did not like Jesus to say , I am the bread that has come down from heaven .
43006042	They said , Is he not Josephs son , Jesus ? We know his father and mother . How can he say , " I have come down from heaven " ?
43006043	Jesus answered them , There is no need for you to talk against me to each other .
43006044	No one can come to me if my Father does not draw him . He sent me . I myself will raise up the one who comes to me . I will bring him back to life on the last day .
43006045	The prophets wrote , " God will teach all people . " So then , every person who listens to his words and learns what he says , he will come to me .
43006046	But no person has seen my Father . The only one who has seen him is the one who comes from God . He has seen my Father .
43006047	I tell you the truth . The person who believes in me will live for ever .
43006048	I am the bread that gives life .
43006049	Your fathers ate bread in the desert long ago , but they died .
43006050	Here is bread that comes down from heaven . The person who eats this bread will never die .
43006051	I am the bread that gives life . I came down from heaven . If anyone eats this bread , he will live for ever . I will give bread so that the world may live . I am that bread .
43006052	The leaders of the Jews began to quarrel with each other about what Jesus said . They said , How can he give us himself to eat ?
43006053	Jesus said , I tell you the truth . If you do not eat the Son of Man and do not drink his blood , you will not have life .
43006054	Anyone who eats me and drinks my blood will live for ever . I will raise him up at the last day .
43006055	I am real food , and my blood is real drink .
43006056	Anyone who eats me and drinks my blood is in me and I in him .
43006057	My Father is living . He sent me . I have my life from him . In the same way , the person who eats of me will live because of me .
43006058	This bread which came down from heaven is not like the bread that your fathers ate . They ate bread but they died . Anyone who eats this bread from heaven will live for ever .
43006059	Jesus was in the meeting house in Capernaum when he was teaching people these things .
43006060	Many of his disciples heard it . They said , This is a hard teaching . Who can listen to it ?
43006061	But Jesus knew that his disciples did not like what he said . He asked , Is this hard for you ?
43006062	What would you do if you saw the Son of Man go up to the place where he came from ?
43006063	It is the Spirit that gives life . The flesh does not help . The words I say to you are Spirit and life .
43006064	But even so , some of you do not believe me . Jesus knew right from the beginning which ones of them would not believe . He knew who was going to give him over to people who hated him .
43006065	Then Jesus said , That is why I said to you , " No one can come to me unless my Father lets him come . "
43006066	After that , many of the followers of Jesus left him and stopped travelling around with him .
43006067	Jesus said to the twelve disciples , Will you also leave me ?
43006068	Simon Peter answered , Lord , to whom shall we go ? It is you who has told us how we may live for ever .
43006069	We believe now , and we know it is true . You are the Christ , the Son of the living God .
43006070	Jesus said to them , Did I not choose you twelve ? And one of you is a devil !
43006071	Jesus was talking about Judas , the son of Simon Iscariot . Judas was the one who was going to give him over to people who hated him . Judas was one of these twelve disciples .
43007001	After this , Jesus travelled around in Galilee . He would not travel around in Judea because the leaders of the Jews wanted to kill him .
43007002	Every year the Jews had a feast to remember the time when their fathers lived in tents in the desert . The time was near for that feast .
43007003	Jesus brothers said to him , Go away from here to Judea . Let your disciples also see the work you are doing .
43007004	When a person wants people to know about him , he does not hide what he is doing . If you are doing these big things , let the world see you .
43007005	Even his brothers did not believe in Jesus .
43007006	Jesus said to them , It is not yet the time for me to go . But you may go any time you want to .
43007007	The people of the world cannot hate you . But they hate me because I say what they do is wrong .
43007008	Go to the feast yourselves . I am not going to the feast until it is the right time for me to go .
43007009	He said this to them and stayed in Galilee .
43007010	After his brothers went to the feast , Jesus went also . He did not go with the other people , but he went by himself .
43007011	The leaders of the Jews at the feast tried to find him . They said , Where is he ?
43007012	People were talking among themselves about Jesus . Some said , He is a good man . Others said , No . He is leading people to do wrong things .
43007013	But they were afraid of the Jewish leaders , so no one talked about him out in the open .
43007014	When the feast was half finished , Jesus went to the temple and taught the people .
43007015	The Jews were very much surprised . How can this man know books ? He never went to school .
43007016	Jesus answered the people , I am not teaching you my teaching . It is the teaching of the one who sent me .
43007017	If any man wants to do what God wants him to do , he will know the teaching . He will know if it is Gods teaching or if I am speaking from my own mind .
43007018	The person who speaks from his own mind only wants to be great himself . But the person whom God has sent wants to show that God is great . That person is true . He is not a bad man .
43007019	Did not Moses give you the law ? Not one of you is keeping the law . Why are you trying to kill me ?
43007020	The people answered Jesus , A bad spirit is in you ! Who is trying to kill you ?
43007021	Jesus answered them , I have done one thing . You are all surprised about it .
43007022	Moses gave you the law of circumcision . You obey the law , not because it came from Moses , but because it came from the fathers long ago . You circumcise a baby boy on the Sabbath day .
43007023	You do it on the Sabbath day so that you will not break the law of Moses . If you do that , then why are you angry with me because I healed a man on the Sabbath day ?
43007024	Do not judge by what you see , but judge in the right way .
43007025	Some people from Jerusalem said , Is not this the person they are trying to kill ?
43007026	See , he does not fear to speak and yet they say nothing to him ! Do the rulers really know that this man is the Christ ?
43007027	But we know where this man comes from . When the Christ comes , no one will know where he comes from .
43007028	Jesus was teaching in the temple . He spoke loudly saying , You know me and you know where I come from . I have not come in my own power . The one who sent me is true . He is the one you do not know .
43007029	I know him because I came from him . He sent me .
43007030	Then the people wanted to catch him . But no one put a hand on him . It was not yet the time for that .
43007031	Many of the people believed in Jesus . They said , When Christ comes , will he do greater works than this man has done ?
43007032	The Pharisees heard what the people said about him . The chief priests and the Pharisees sent soldiers to catch him .
43007033	Jesus said , I will stay with you a short time longer . Then I will go back to him who sent me .
43007034	You will look for me , but you will not find me . You will not be able to go to the place where I will be .
43007035	The Jews said to one another , Where will he go that we cannot find him ? Will he go to our people who are living in other countries ? Will he teach them ?
43007036	What does he mean by this : " You will look for me and will not find me . You will not be able to go to the place where I will be " ?
43007037	The last day of the feast was a big day . On that day Jesus stood up and shouted , If anyone is thirsty , he may come to me and drink .
43007038	If anyone believes in me , the holy writings say , " Rivers of water that give life will flow out of his heart . "
43007039	This is what Jesus meant : those who believe in him would receive the Spirit . At that time no one had received the Holy Spirit because Jesus had not yet been lifted up to heaven
43007040	When some of the people heard this they said , Truly , this is the Prophet .
43007041	Other people said , This is the Christ . But some said , The Christ will not come from Galilee . Shall Christ come out of Galilee ?
43007042	Do not the holy writings say that Christ will be of Davids family ? Will he not come from Bethlehem where David lived ?
43007043	The people did not all say the same thing about him .
43007044	Some of them wanted to catch Jesus , but no one put hands on him .
43007045	The soldiers came back to the chief priests and the Pharisees . They asked the soldiers , Why did you not bring him ?
43007046	The soldiers replied , No person has ever talked like he does !
43007047	The Pharisees said , Has he fooled you also ?
43007048	None of the rulers and none of the Pharisees have believed on him , have they ?
43007049	These poor people do not know the law . They will die !
43007050	Nicodemus , the man who came to Jesus by night , was one of them .
43007051	He said , Is it right to judge any man by our law before we hear him and learn what he has done ?
43007052	They answered him , Are you from Galilee also ? Study what is written . You will see that no prophet is to come from Galilee .
43007053	Then every one of them went home .
43008001	Then Jesus went to the hill called the Mount of Olives .
43008002	Early the next morning he came again to the temple . All the people came to him . He sat down and taught them .
43008003	The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman to Jesus . They had caught her having sex with a man who was not her husband . They made the woman stand in front of them .
43008004	They said , Teacher , this woman has committed adultery . She was caught doing it .
43008005	The law of Moses tells us that the people who do that should be killed with stones . What do you say ?
43008006	They said this to see what Jesus would do , because they wanted to find something wrong with him . Jesus bent down and wrote on the ground with his finger .
43008007	They kept on asking him . He stood up and said to them , The one among you who has never done any wrong thing may throw the first stone at her .
43008008	And Jesus bent down again and wrote on the ground .
43008009	When the people heard what he said , they went out , one by one . The oldest one went out first . Jesus was left alone with the woman in front of him .
43008010	Jesus looked up and said to her , Woman , where are the people ? Has no one judged you ?
43008011	She said , No one , Sir . Jesus said , I also do not judge you . Go , and do no wrong thing again .
43008012	Then Jesus talked to the people in the temple . He said , I am the Light of the world . The one who comes with me will never walk in the dark , but he will have light that gives life .
43008013	The Pharisees said , You are talking about yourself . What you say is not true .
43008014	Jesus said to them , Even if I do talk about myself , what I say is true . I know where I come from and I know where I am going . But you do not know where I came from , or where I am going .
43008015	You judge in the way people judge matters . I do not judge any person .
43008016	But even if I do judge , I judge right . I am not alone . My Father who sent me is with me .
43008017	Even in your law it says that when two people say the same thing , it is true .
43008018	I talk about myself , and my Father who sent me talks about me .
43008019	They asked him , Where is your Father ? He said , You do not know me and you do not know my Father . If you knew me , you would know my Father also .
43008020	When Jesus said these words he was teaching in the temple . He was in the place where the money is kept . No one caught him because it was not yet his time .
43008021	Jesus talked to them again . He said , I am going away . You will try to find me and will die doing wrong things . You cannot come where I am going .
43008022	Then the Jews said , Will he kill himself ? He says , " You cannot come where I am going . "
43008023	Jesus said to them , You are from below . I am from above . You belong to this world . I do not belong to this world .
43008024	That is why I said , " You will die doing wrong things . " If you do not believe that I am who I said I am , then you will die doing wrong things .
43008025	They said to him , Who are you ? Jesus answered , I am what I told you from the beginning .
43008026	I have many things to say to you and to judge you in many things . But he who sent me is true . I tell the world what he has told me .
43008027	The people did not understand that Jesus was talking to them about his Father .
43008028	So Jesus said , When you have lifted up the Son of Man , then you will know that I am he . You will know that I do nothing by my own power , but I talk the way my Father taught me .
43008029	He who sent me is with me always . I always do what he wants me to do .
43008030	Many people believed in Jesus while he was talking this way .
43008031	Jesus said to the Jews who believed in him , If you obey my word , you are truly my disciples .
43008032	And you will understand the truth and the truth will make you free .
43008033	They said to him , We are Abrahams children . We have always been free . Why do you say to us , " You will be free " ?
43008034	Jesus answered them , I tell you the truth . People who do wrong things are not free . They become a slave of the wrong things they do .
43008035	A slave does not belong to the family for ever . But a son belongs for ever .
43008036	So if the Son makes you free , you will be truly free .
43008037	I know that you come from Abraham . But you want to kill me because you do not like what I tell you .
43008038	I tell you about the things that I have seen where my Father is , and you do what you have seen your father do .
43008039	They answered him , Abraham is our father . Jesus said , If you were Abrahams children , you would do what Abraham did .
43008040	But you want to kill me because I told you the truth which I learned from God . Abraham did not do that .
43008041	You are doing your fathers work . Then they said to him , We were not born of an unmarried woman . God is the Father of us all .
43008042	Jesus said to them , If God were your Father you would love me , because I have come from God . I did not come by my own power . God sent me .
43008043	Why do you not understand what I say ? I will tell you why . It is because you do not want to understand it .
43008044	The bad spirit , the devil , is your real father . You gladly do the wrong things he wants you to do . From the beginning he killed people . He has nothing to do with what is true . His way is to tell lies . He himself is a liar and all lying comes from him .
43008045	You do not believe me because I tell you what is true .
43008046	Which one of you can prove that what I have done is bad ? I tell you what is true . Why then do you not believe me ?
43008047	The person who comes from God listens to what God says . You do not come from God . That is why you do not listen to me .
43008048	The leaders of the Jews answered him , We say what is true . We say that you come from Samaria . And we say that a bad spirit is in you .
43008049	Jesus said , I have no bad spirit in me . I respect my Father but you do not respect me .
43008050	I do not want to make myself great . There is one who makes me great . He judges the matter .
43008051	I tell you the truth . If anyone obeys my word , he will never die .
43008052	The leaders of the Jews said to him , Now we know it is true that a bad spirit is in you . Abraham died . So did the prophets . And yet you say , " If anyone obeys my word , he will never die . "
43008053	Are you greater than our father Abraham and the prophets of God who died long ago ? Who do you make yourself out to be ?
43008054	Jesus answered , If I make myself great , then I am not great . But my Father makes me great . You say he is your God .
43008055	But you do not know God . I know him . If I say , " I do not know him , " I am a liar , just as you people are . But I know him and I obey his word .
43008056	Your father Abraham was glad that he would see my coming . He did see it and he was very glad .
43008057	The Jewish leaders said to him , You are not fifty years old yet . How could Abraham see you ?
43008058	Jesus answered , I tell you the truth . I already was before Abraham was born .
43008059	Then they picked up stones to throw at him . But Jesus got out of their way . He left the temple and they did not know where he went .
43009001	On his way out of the temple Jesus saw a man who had been born blind .
43009002	His disciples asked Jesus , Master , was this man born blind because of the wrong things he did , or was it the wrong things his parents did ?
43009003	Jesus answered , It was not that he or his parents did any wrong thing . But it was so that people would see what God will do in him .
43009004	There is one who has sent me . I must do his work while it is still daylight . Night is coming . Then it will be too dark to work .
43009005	As long as I am in the world , I am the Light of the world .
43009006	When Jesus had said this , he spat on the ground . Then he put some of the wet dirt on the mans eyes .
43009007	And he said , Go . wash your eyes in that water hole called Siloam . ( Siloam means Sent . ) The man went and washed his eyes . After that , he was able to see .
43009008	His neighbours and other people had seen him when he was blind . They said , Is not this the same man who used to sit here and beg ?
43009009	Some people said , Yes , this is the same man . Others said , He is like that man . But the man himself said , I am that man .
43009010	They asked him , How is it that you can see now ?
43009011	He answered them , That man whose name is Jesus made some mud . He rubbed it on my eyes and told me to go and wash them in the water hole Siloam . And when I had washed my eyes , I could see .
43009012	Where is the man ? they asked . He said , I do not know .
43009013	They brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind .
43009014	The day Jesus made the mud and healed the man was the Sabbath day .
43009015	Then the Pharisees also asked the man , How is it that you can see now ? He answered them , The man put mud on my eyes . I washed my eyes and now I can see .
43009016	Then some of the Pharisees said , This man is not from God . He does not obey the Sabbath day law . The others said , But how can a bad man do such a big work ? So the Pharisees did not agree together in what they thought about Jesus .
43009017	Then they asked the man who had been born blind , What do you say about the man who healed you ? He answered , I say he is a prophet from God .
43009018	But the leaders of the Jews did not really believe what they heard about the man . They did not believe that first he had been blind and now was able to see . So they called the parents of the man who could now see .
43009019	Tell us , they said . Is this your son who you say was born blind ? How is it that now he can see ?
43009020	The parents answered , We know that this is our son . And we know that he was born blind .
43009021	But we do not know how it is that he can now see . We do not know who healed him . Ask him . He is old enough to talk for himself .
43009022	The parents said this because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders . They knew that the leaders of the Jews had already agreed that if anyone said Jesus is the Christ , they would be put out of the meeting place .
43009023	That is why the parents said , He is old enough to talk for himself . Ask him .
43009024	Then again they called the man who had been blind . They said to him , You must praise God for this . We know that the man who healed you is a bad man .
43009025	He answered them , I do not know if he is a bad man or not . But one thing I do know . I know that first I was blind , but now I can see .
43009026	Then they said to him again , What did he do to you ? How did he heal you ?
43009027	He answered them , I told you already . You did not listen . Why do you want me to tell you again ? Do you also want to be his disciples ?
43009028	This made them angry . They said , You are his disciple , but we are disciples of Moses .
43009029	We know that God talked to Moses . But this man , we do not know where he comes from .
43009030	The man who had been blind said , This surprises me ! He healed me and yet you do not know where he comes from !
43009031	We know that God does not listen to bad people . But God listens to the person who shows him respect and who obeys him .
43009032	Before this , no one has ever healed a man who was born blind . Such a thing has not been heard of since the world was made .
43009033	If this man did not come from God , he could not do anything like this .
43009034	They answered , You have been a bad man ever since you were born ! Now are you trying to teach us ? And with that they put him out of the meeting place .
43009035	Jesus heard that the people had put him out . When he found him , he said , Do you believe in the Son of God ?
43009036	He answered , Sir , who is the Son of God ? Tell me , so that I may believe in him .
43009037	Jesus said , You have already seen him . The person who is talking to you now , he is the Son of God .
43009038	The man said , Sir , I do believe . He kneeled down in front of Jesus and worshipped him .
43009039	Jesus said , I came into the world so that people may be judged . I came so that those who are blind may see . And I came so that those who see may become blind .
43009040	Some of the Pharisees were with Jesus and heard him say this . They asked him , You mean to say that we are blind also ?
43009041	Jesus answered them , If you agreed that you were blind , you would not be bad people . But you say , " We can see . " So then you are still bad people .
43010001	Then Jesus went on to say , I tell you the truth . A person must get to the sheep through the door . Anyone who climbs over the wall to get in is a bad man and steals things . He has come to steal the sheep .
43010002	But the man who comes in through the door , he is the one who takes care of the sheep .
43010003	The guard will open the door for him . The sheep will listen to him . He calls his own sheep by their names and leads them out .
43010004	When all his own sheep are out of the house , he goes ahead of them . The sheep come behind him because they know his voice .
43010005	They will not go after a stranger . They will run away from him because they do not know the voice of strangers .
43010006	Jesus told this story to the Pharisees , but they did not understand what he was trying to tell them .
43010007	So Jesus told them again . He said , I tell you the truth . I am the door of the sheep house .
43010008	All those who came before me are bad people and steal things . They came to steal the sheep . But the sheep did not listen to them .
43010009	I am the door . Anyone who comes in through me will be saved . He will go in and out as he wants to , and will have food to eat .
43010010	The thief comes only to steal the sheep and to kill them and spoil them . I have come so that people may live and that they may enjoy life to the full .
43010011	I am the good shepherd . I am the one who really cares for the sheep . The good shepherd is willing to die to save his sheep .
43010012	Some people work for pay . The one who does that is not the one who really cares . The sheep do not belong to him . When he sees a bad animal coming , he will leave the sheep and run away . He will let the animal take the sheep and make the sheep run away .
43010013	He does that because he is only working for pay and does not care what happens to the sheep .
43010014	I am the good shepherd , the one who really cares for the sheep . I know my sheep and my sheep know me .
43010015	So my Father knows me and I know him . I am willing to die to save the sheep .
43010016	I have some other sheep which are not with these sheep . I must bring them also . They will listen to my voice . Then all the sheep will be together and there will be one person who cares for all of them .
43010017	My Father loves me because I am willing to die . But when I die , I will live again .
43010018	No one kills me . I die only because I choose to die . I have power to die and I have power to live again . This is what my Father has told me to do .
43010019	The Jews did not all say the same thing because of what Jesus said .
43010020	Many of them said , A bad spirit is in him . He is crazy . Why do you listen to him ?
43010021	But others said , A person who has a bad spirit in him does not say the things this man says . Can a bad spirit make blind people see ?
43010022	At that time there was a feast in Jerusalem at the temple . It was the cold time of the year .
43010023	Jesus was walking in that part of the temple called Solomons resting place .
43010024	The Jews came around Jesus and said , How long will you keep us wondering about this matter ? If you are really the Christ , then tell us plainly .
43010025	Then Jesus said , I have already told you and you did not believe it . My Father has given me the power to do big works . These works tell you who I am .
43010026	And yet you do not believe because you are not my sheep . I told you this before .
43010027	My sheep listen to me . I know them . They come to me .
43010028	I give them life that lasts for ever . They will never die . No one will take them out of my hand .
43010029	My Father gave the sheep to me . He is greater than anyone else . No one is able to take them out of my Fathers hand .
43010030	My Father and I are one .
43010031	Then the leaders of the Jews picked up stones again to kill him .
43010032	So Jesus said to them , I have done many good things that come from my Father . For which one of those are you going to kill me ?
43010033	Then the Jewish leaders answered him , We do not kill you for doing any good thing . But you do not respect God . You are only a man , and yet you say you are God .
43010034	Jesus answered them , In your own books it is written that God said , " You are gods . "
43010035	, fehlt/missing
43010036	Nothing can change the words in the holy writings . It is written that God spoke to men and that he called them gods . So he called some men gods . Then why do you say I do not respect God when I say that I am the Son of God ? I am the one God chose and sent into the world .
43010037	If I am not doing my Fathers work , then do not believe me .
43010038	But if I am doing my Fathers work , believe the work that I do , even though you do not believe me . Then you will know and you will believe that my Father is in me and I am in him .
43010039	Because of what he said , they tried to catch Jesus again . But he got away from them .
43010040	He went away again to the other side of the Jordan River . He went to the place where John [ the Baptizer ] was when he first baptized people . Jesus stayed there for a while .
43010041	Many people came to him there . They said , John himself did not do any big work . But everything that John said about this man is true .
43010042	Many people believed on Jesus there .
43011001	A man named Lazarus was sick . He lived at Bethany , the home of Mary and her sister Martha .
43011002	Mary was the same woman that put oil on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair . It was her brother Lazarus who was sick .
43011003	So the sisters sent someone to tell Jesus . They said , Lord , the one whom you love is sick .
43011004	Jesus heard the message . He said , The man is sick , but he will not die from it . But this will show people that God is great , and his Son also .
43011005	Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus .
43011006	When he heard that Lazarus was sick , he stayed where he was for two days more .
43011007	After that , he said to his disciples , Let us go back again to Judea .
43011008	They said , Master , it is not long since the Jews wanted to kill you with stones . Are you going back there again ?
43011009	Jesus answered them , Are there not twelve hours in the day ? If a person walks in the daylight , then he will not fall . He can see by the light that is in the world .
43011010	But if a person walks at night , he will fall because there is no light for him to see .
43011011	After he said this , he said also , Our friend Lazarus is sleeping , but I am going to wake him up .
43011012	His disciples said , Lord , if he is sleeping then he will get well again .
43011013	But Jesus meant that Lazarus had died . The disciples thought that Lazarus was sleeping to have a rest .
43011014	Then Jesus told them plainly . He said , Lazarus is dead .
43011015	For your sake I am glad that I was not there . You will really believe in me . But come , let us go to him .
43011016	Then Thomas , who was called the Twin , said to the other disciples , Let us all go and die with Jesus .
43011017	When Jesus came , he found that Lazarus had been buried four days .
43011018	Bethany was only about two miles from Jerusalem .
43011019	Many Jews had come out to see Martha and Mary . They came to comfort them because their brother had died .
43011020	As soon as Martha heard that Jesus was coming , she went to meet him . But Mary just stayed in the house .
43011021	Martha said to Jesus , Lord , if you had been here , my brother would not have died .
43011022	But even yet , I know that God will give you anything that you ask for .
43011023	Jesus said , Your brother will rise again .
43011024	Martha said , I know that he will rise when the dead people are raised up on the last day .
43011025	Jesus said , I am the one who will raise people up and give them life . The person who believes in me will live , even though he has died .
43011026	Anyone who is living and who believes in me will never die . Do you believe this ?
43011027	She said , Yes , Lord , I believe that you are the Christ . I believe that you are the Son of God who was to come into the world .
43011028	When she had said this , she went back to call her sister . She said quietly , Mary , the Master has come . He is calling you .
43011029	When Mary heard that , she got up quickly and came to him .
43011030	Jesus was not in the town yet . He was at the same place where Martha had met him .
43011031	The Jews who were in the house to comfort Mary saw her get up quickly and go out . They went after her . They said , She is going to the grave to cry .
43011032	Mary reached the place where Jesus was . When she saw him , she kneeled down before him and said , Lord , if you had been here , my brother would not have died .
43011033	Jesus saw her crying . He saw the Jews who came with her crying also . Then his heart was troubled very much .
43011034	Where have you buried him ? he said . Come , Lord , and see , they said .
43011035	Then Jesus cried .
43011036	Look , the Jews said . He truly loved him very much !
43011037	Then some of them said , This man made the blind see . Could he not have saved Lazarus from dying ?
43011038	Jesus heart was troubled very much again . Then he came to the grave . It was a hole in the side of a large rock . A stone covered the hole .
43011039	Jesus said , Take the stone away . Martha , the sister of the dead man , said , Lord , he will smell bad by this time . He has been dead four days already .
43011040	Jesus said to her , Did I not tell you that if you believed God you would see that he is great ?
43011041	So they pushed the stone away from the grave . Jesus looked up and said , Father , I thank you because you have heard me .
43011042	I know that you always hear me . But I have said this so that the people who are standing here might believe that you have sent me .
43011043	When he had said this , he shouted , Lazarus , come out !
43011044	Out came the dead man ! The cloth that they had buried him in was tied around his hands and feet . Another small cloth was tied around his face . Jesus said to the people , Take off the cloths and free him !
43011045	When they saw the things Jesus did , many of the Jews who had come with Mary believed on Him .
43011046	But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done .
43011047	So the chief priests and the Pharisees met together . They said , What are we going to do ? This man is doing many big works .
43011048	If we do not stop him , everybody will believe on him . Then the Roman rulers will come and break down our holy town and our nation .
43011049	One of them , Caiaphas , was high priest that year . He said to them , You know nothing .
43011050	You do not understand . It is better for us if one person dies for the people . Then the whole nation will not be broken down .
43011051	He himself did not understand what he was saying . But he was the high priest that year . God spoke through him to say that Jesus should die for those people .
43011052	Jesus would die , not only for those people , but he would gather together all of Gods people who are out in different places .
43011053	So from that day on they planned to kill Jesus .
43011054	That is why Jesus did not go among the Jews in the open . But he went to another part of the country , to a town called Ephraim . He stayed there with his disciples .
43011055	The time for the Passover Feast of the Jews was near . Many people from all around the country went to Jerusalem . They had to make themselves clean according to the law before the Passover Feast .
43011056	They were looking around for Jesus . As they were standing in the temple they talked to one another . They said , What do you think ? Do you think that he will come to the feast ?
43011057	Both the chief priest and the Pharisees had told the people , If any man knows where he is , tell us . We want to catch him .
43012001	Six days before the Passover Feast Jesus came to Bethany where Lazarus lived . This was the Lazarus that Jesus had raised from death .
43012002	The people made supper for Jesus . Martha helped give food for the people , and Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with Jesus .
43012003	Mary had a jar of oil . It smelled very nice and cost much money . She put some of it on Jesus feet . Then she wiped his feet with her hair . The smell of oil went all through the house .
43012004	Judas , the son of Simon Iscariot , was there . He was one of the disciples , the one who was going to give Jesus over to the people who hated him .
43012005	He said , This oil is worth a years wages ! Why did we not sell it and give the money to poor people ?
43012006	Judas did not say this because he cared for poor people . But he used to steal . He carried the disciples money bag and he used to take money out of the bag for himself .
43012007	Then Jesus said , Leave her alone . She has kept this oil for the time when they will bury me .
43012008	You will have poor people with you always . But you will not always have me with you .
43012009	Many of the Jews knew that Jesus was at Bethany . So they came because Jesus was there . But they also came to see Lazarus , whom Jesus had raised from death .
43012010	The chief priests planned to kill Lazarus also .
43012011	Many of the Jews left the priests and believed in Jesus , because of Lazarus .
43012012	The next day Jesus went to Jerusalem . Many people who were at the feast heard that he was coming .
43012013	So they took branches of palm trees and went to meet him . They shouted , Praise God ! God bless the King of Israel ! He is coming in the name of the Lord !
43012014	Then Jesus found a young donkey and rode on it . He did as the holy writings say ,
43012015	Do not fear , people of Jerusalem . Your King is coming . He will be riding on a young donkey .
43012016	His disciples did not understand this at first . But when God had made Jesus great , then they remembered what the holy writings said about him . They remembered that people had done these things to him .
43012017	Many people were with Jesus when he called Lazarus out of the grave and raised him from death . They had talked about what he did .
43012018	That is why many people went out to meet Jesus . They had heard about the big work he did .
43012019	The Pharisees said to each other , See , you cannot stop this thing . People everywhere are going after him .
43012020	Some of the people who came to worship God at the feast were Greek people .
43012021	They came to Philip who was from Bethsaida in Galilee . They said , Sir , we want to see Jesus .
43012022	Philip came to Andrew and told him . Then they both went and told Jesus .
43012023	Jesus said , The time has come when the Son of Man will be made great .
43012024	I tell you the truth . If a seed of grain is not put in the ground to die , it will be only a seed . But if it dies , it will bear many seeds .
43012025	Anyone who tries to keep his life will lose it . Anyone who gives up his life in this world will live for ever in the next world .
43012026	If anyone wants to do my work , he must go where I go . Then he and I will be together . My Father will honour everyone who works for me .
43012027	Now my heart is very sad . Shall I say , " Father , save me from this time of trouble " ? No , I have come to this time just so that I might go through it .
43012028	Father , do what will make your name great . Then a voice from the sky said , I have already done that and I will do it again .
43012029	Some people were standing near . When they heard the voice , they said , It is thundering . Other people said , An angel talked to him .
43012030	Jesus answered them , This voice did not come for my sake , but it came for your sake .
43012031	It is time now for the world to be judged . The ruler of this world will be put out .
43012032	And as for me , if they lift me up from the earth , I will draw all people to me .
43012033	He said this to show how he would die .
43012034	The people answered him , Our law book tells us that Christ will stay here for ever . Why do you say , " The Son of Man will be raised up from the earth " ? Tell us who this Son of Man is .
43012035	Then Jesus said to them , You have light for a short time longer . Walk while you have the light so that you will not need to walk in the dark . The person who walks in the dark cannot see where he is going .
43012036	Believe in the light while you have the light , so that you may be a people who have the light in you . When Jesus had said this , he left them . They did not know where he was .
43012037	Even though they had seen Jesus doing many big works , they did not believe in him .
43012038	What the prophet Isaiah said came true . He said , Lord , who has believed what we told them ? Who has believed even though they have seen the power of Gods hand ?
43012039	, fehlt/missing
43012040	So they could not believe . Isaiah said also , God has made them blind . Their hearts have no feeling . They cannot see . They do not understand with their heart . They will not turn to God . If they did turn , he would heal them .
43012041	Isaiah said this about the Christ when he saw how great he was .
43012042	Some of the chief rulers believed in Jesus , but they did not tell anyone that they believed in him . They were afraid the Pharisees would put them out of the meeting place .
43012043	They wanted the praise of men more than the praise of God .
43012044	Jesus called out , Anyone who believes in me does not believe just in me , but in the one who sent me .
43012045	Anyone who sees me sees the one who sent me .
43012046	I am a light and have come into the world . Anyone who believes in me will not be in the dark .
43012047	If anyone hears what I say and does not believe it , I do not judge him . I did not come to judge the world . I came to save the world .
43012048	The one who will not believe in me and will not listen to what I say will be judged anyway . The same things that I have said will judge him on the last day .
43012049	I have not said this from my own mind , but my Father who sent me told me what to say . He told me what to tell you .
43012050	I know that what he told me to say has power to give life for ever . So I say everything my Father has told me to say .
43013001	Before the Passover Feast had started , Jesus saw that the time had come for him to leave this world . The time had come for him to go back to his Father . He loved his own people who were in the world . And he loved them the same way right to the end .
43013002	He and his disciples were eating together . The devil had already put it into Judas heart to give Jesus over to people who hated him . ( Judas was the son of Simon Iscariot . )
43013003	Jesus knew that his Father had put everything into his hands . He knew he had come from God . He knew he was going back to God .
43013004	Jesus stood up where he had been eating . He took off his outer clothing . And he took a towel and tied it around him .
43013005	Then he poured water into a pan and began to wash the disciples feet . He wiped their feet with the towel he had tied around him .
43013006	He came to Simon Peter . Peter said to him , Lord , are you going to wash my feet ?
43013007	Jesus answered him , You do not understand now what I am doing , but you will understand it later .
43013008	Peter said to him , You will never wash my feet ! Jesus answered him , If I do not wash you , then you do not belong to me .
43013009	Simon Peter said to him , Lord , wash my feet , and my hands , and my head also !
43013010	Jesus said , A person who has bathed himself needs to wash his feet only . He is all clean . You are clean , but not all of you .
43013011	Jesus knew who was going to give him over to people who hated him . That is why he said , You are not all clean .
43013012	After Jesus had finished washing their feet , he took his gown and sat down again . Do you understand what I have done to you ? he asked .
43013013	You call me Master and Lord . What you say is right . I am your Master and Lord .
43013014	I am your Lord and Master and have washed your feet . If I do that , then you should wash one anothers feet .
43013015	I have shown you what to do . Now you do as I have done .
43013016	I tell you the truth . The servant is not better than his master . The one who is sent is not better than the one who sent him .
43013017	Do you understand what I have told you ? If you do , you will have much happiness for doing it .
43013018	I am not talking about all of you but I know the people I have chosen . So Gods word comes true . The holy writings say , " He who is eating my bread has turned against me . "
43013019	I am telling you this now before it happens . So when it happens you will believe who I am .
43013020	I tell you the truth . The person who receives the one I send , receives me . He that receives me , receives the one who sent me .
43013021	When Jesus had said this , he was troubled in his heart . He said , I tell you the truth . One of you will give me over to people who hate me .
43013022	The disciples looked at one another . They did not know which one of them Jesus was talking about .
43013023	The disciple Jesus loved was at his right side .
43013024	Simon Peter nodded to that disciple . He said , Tell us who he is talking about .
43013025	He who was at Jesus right side said to Jesus , Lord , who is it ?
43013026	Jesus answered , I will put a piece of bread in the dish . Then I will give it to that one . He put in the bread , then he took it and gave it to Judas , the son of Simon Iscariot .
43013027	Right after Jesus had given the bread , Satan came into Judas . Then Jesus said to him , What you are going to do , do right away .
43013028	No one at the table knew why Jesus said , Do it right away .
43013029	Judas had the money bag . Some thought that Jesus was telling him , Buy what we need for the feast , or that he wanted Judas to give something to the poor people .
43013030	Judas went out right after he had taken the bread . It was night .
43013031	When he had gone out , Jesus said , Now the Son of Man is very great . And he has made Gods name great .
43013032	If he has made Gods name great , God also will make him great by his own power . He will do it right away .
43013033	My children , I am with you for a short time longer . You will look for me . What I said to the Jews I say to you now : " You cannot come to the place where I am going . "
43013034	I give you a new law . That law is , " Love each other . " As I have loved you , so you also love each other .
43013035	This is how all people will know that you are my disciples .
43013036	Simon Peter said to him , Lord , where are you going ? Jesus answered him , You cannot go with me where I am going now . Later on you will go with me .
43013037	Peter said to him , Lord , why can I not go with you now ? I am willing to die for you .
43013038	Jesus answered him , Will you die for me ? I tell you the truth . Before the cock calls , you will say three times that you do not know me .
43014001	Jesus said , Do not let anything trouble your heart . You believe in God and you must believe in me also .
43014002	In my Fathers house are many rooms . If it were not so , I would have told you . I am going to make a place ready for you .
43014003	If I go to make a place ready for you , I will come again . I will come to take you so that you may be with me .
43014004	You know where I am going , and you know the way .
43014005	Thomas said to Jesus , Lord , we do not know where you are going . How can we know the way ?
43014006	Jesus said to him , I am the way . I am the truth . I give life . No one can come to my Father unless I take him there .
43014007	If you knew me , you would have known my Father also . But from now on you do know him because you have seen him .
43014008	Philip said to him , Lord , show us the Father , then we will be happy .
43014009	Jesus said to him , Philip , you mean to say that I have been with you all this time and yet you do not know me ? The person who has seen me has seen my Father also . Why do you say , " Show us your Father " ?
43014010	Do you not believe that I am in my Father and my Father is in me ? The things that I say , I speak not from my own mind . But my Father lives in me and he does the work .
43014011	I tell you that I am in my Father and my Father is in me . But you do not believe me . So then let the work that I do prove it to you .
43014012	I tell you the truth . The person who believes in me will do the big work that I do . And he will do even bigger work because I go to my Father .
43014013	I will do anything you ask of my Father in my name . In that way the Son will make my Fathers name great .
43014014	If you ask anything in my name , I will do it .
43014015	If you love me , you will obey me .
43014016	I will ask my Father . He will give you another one to help you and to be with you always .
43014017	He will send you the Spirit of truth . The world cannot receive the true Spirit because it does not see or know him . You know him because he is with you and will be in you .
43014018	I will not leave you without someone to help you . And I myself will come back to you .
43014019	In a short time the world will not see me again , but you will see me again . Because I live , you will live also .
43014020	At that time you will know that I am in my Father . You are in me , and I am in you .
43014021	He who knows the things I tell him to do and does them , really loves me . My Father will love him and I also will love him . I will show him who I am .
43014022	Judas ( not Iscariot ) said to Jesus , Lord , how are you going to make yourself real to us , and not to the rest of the world ?
43014023	Jesus said to him , If a person loves me , he will obey me . My Father also will love him . And we will come to him and will live with him .
43014024	The person who does not love me does not obey me . The word which you hear is not my word . It is my Fathers word . He is the one who sent me .
43014025	I have told you these things while I am still with you .
43014026	But the Holy Spirit is the one who will help you . My Father will send him in my name . He will teach you everything that I have said to you . His Helper will remind you of all that I said .
43014027	Peace is what I leave for you . I give you my own peace . People of the world also say , " Peace " to you . I do not say it as they say it . Do not let anything trouble your hearts . Do not fear .
43014028	You heard me say , " I am going away and then I will come back to you . " If you really loved me , then you would have been very glad that I am going to my Father . My Father is greater than I am .
43014029	I have told you this before it happens . Then when it does happen , you will believe .
43014030	After this I will not talk much with you . The ruler of this world is coming . He has no power over me .
43014031	I will do what my Father tells me to do so that the people of the world may know that I love my Father . Get up now ! We must go .
43015001	I am the real fruit tree . My Father is the One who takes care of the tree .
43015002	He takes away from me every branch that does not bear fruit . And he cleans every branch that bears fruit so that it will bear more fruit .
43015003	What I said to you has made you clean already .
43015004	But you must be in me and I will be in you . The branch cannot bear fruit by itself . It must be joined to the tree . And you cannot do any good thing if you are not joined to me .
43015005	I am the fruit tree and you are the branches . I will be in the person who is in me . That person will have a fruitful life . But you can do nothing without me .
43015006	If any person is not in me , he is cut off like a branch and dies . People gather the dry branches and throw them into the fire to be burned .
43015007	If you are in me and obey me , you may ask me for anything you want and I will give it to you .
43015008	If you do much good and become my disciples , you will make my Fathers name great .
43015009	I have loved you just as my Father has loved you . So let me love you always .
43015010	If you obey me , I will love you always . That is what I have done . I have obeyed my Father . And he will love me always .
43015011	I have told you these things so that you may be glad in the same way I am glad . Then you will be very glad always .
43015012	I am telling you to love each other as I have loved you .
43015013	The strongest love anyone can have is this . He will die to save his friends .
43015014	You are my friends if you do what I tell you to do .
43015015	I do not call you servants anymore , for the servant does not know what his master is doing . But I have called you friends because you know everything that my Father has told me .
43015016	You did not choose me , but I chose you . I gave you a big work to do . That work is to go out and do good things and to make the good things that you do remain strong . If you do that , my Father will do anything you ask in my name .
43015017	Here is the law I gave you . Love each other .
43015018	If the world hates you , remember that it hated me before it hated you .
43015019	If you belonged to this world , the world would love you . But you do not belong to the world . I have chosen you out of the world . That is why the world hates you .
43015020	Remember what I told you . I said , " The servant is not better than his master . " If the people in the world have troubled me , they will also trouble you . If they obey me , they will also obey you .
43015021	They will do all these things to you because you are true to me . They do not know the one who sent me .
43015022	I came and spoke to them . If I had not done that , then what they did would not have been a wrong thing . But now they have no excuse for doing it .
43015023	The person who hates me hates my Father also .
43015024	No other person has ever done the work that I have done . If they had , then what they did would not be a wrong thing . But now they have seen me and hated me and my Father also .
43015025	This has happened in order to make the words of their law book come true . It says , " They hated me for no reason . "
43015026	I will send the true Spirit to comfort you . He will come from my Father . When he comes , then he will talk about me .
43015027	You also will talk about me because you have been with me from the time I began my work .
43016001	I have told you these things so that you will not turn back .
43016002	The people will put you out of the meeting place . Yes , the time is coming when someone will kill you and think he is working for God .
43016003	They will do these things because they do not know my Father nor me .
43016004	I have told you all these things now . Then when that time comes , you will remember that I told you about them . I did not tell you these things in the beginning because I myself was with you .
43016005	But now I am going back to him who sent me here . Yet not one of you is asking me , " Where are you going ? "
43016006	Your hearts are very sad because I have told you these things .
43016007	Anyway , I am telling you the truth . It is better for you if I go away . If I do not go away , the one who is to help you will not come to you . But if I go away , I will send him to you .
43016008	When the Helper comes , he will prove this to the people of the world that they are wrong . They are wrong about what they call bad and about what they call good . He will show them how to be right with God . He will show them about Gods judgement .
43016009	He will prove it is a bad thing that they do not believe in me .
43016010	He will show what really is right , because I am going to my Father and you will not see me any more .
43016011	He will show them how to judge right , because the ruler of this world himself will be judged .
43016012	I have many other things to tell you , but you cannot understand them now .
43016013	When the truth-giving Spirit comes , he will show you everything that is true . He will not speak his own message , but he will tell you the things that he has been told to tell you . He will tell you what is going to happen .
43016014	He will make my name great . He will take what is mine and tell it to you .
43016015	Everything that belongs to my Father belongs to me also . That is why I said , " He will take what is mine and tell it to you . "
43016016	Very soon now , you will not see me . A little while after that , you will see me again , because I go to my Father .
43016017	Some of the disciples talked among themselves and said , He says , " Very soon now , you will not see me . A little while after that , you will see me . " And he says , " Because I go to my Father . " What does he mean by " a little while " ?
43016018	We do not know what he means .
43016019	Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him this question . So he said to them , Are you asking each other what I mean by saying , " Very soon you will not see me . Then in a little while after that you will see me " ?
43016020	I tell you the truth . You people will cry and be very sad , but the people in the world will be very glad . At first you will be sad , but after that you will not be sad . You will be glad .
43016021	Any woman is sad just before her baby is born . She has much pain because the time has come for the baby to be born . But as soon as the baby is born , she forgets the pain she had . She is very glad because a person has been born into the world .
43016022	So you also are very sad now . But I will see you again . Then you will be very glad . And no one can take your joy from you .
43016023	When that time comes , you will not ask me for anything . I tell you the truth . My Father will do for you anything you ask in my name .
43016024	You have not asked for anything in my name yet . Ask my Father and he will give it to you . That is what will make you very glad always .
43016025	I have told you these things by a story . The time will come when I will not talk by stories . I will tell you about my Father plainly .
43016026	When that day comes , you will ask in my name . I do not say that I will ask my Father for you .
43016027	My Father himself loves you . He loves you because you have loved me . And he loves you because you have believed that God sent me .
43016028	My Father sent me into the world . And now I will leave the world and go back to my Father .
43016029	The disciples said to him , Yes , now you are telling us plainly . You are not telling us with words we do not understand .
43016030	We know now that you know everything . No one needs to ask you questions . This makes us believe that God sent you .
43016031	Jesus answered them , Do you really believe now ?
43016032	Listen , the time is coming . No , the time is here when you will run away . Every man will go to his own home . You will leave me on my own . And yet I am not alone , because my Father is with me .
43016033	I have told you these things so that you may have peace . I give you peace . The world will trouble you much . But be glad . I have power over the world .
43017001	When Jesus had said these things , he looked up to heaven and said , Father , the time has come now . Make your Sons name great , so that your Son may make your name great .
43017002	You have given your Son power over all people . So all those you have given him will live for ever .
43017003	You are the only true God . If they know you , and Jesus Christ whom you sent , they will live for ever .
43017004	I made your name great on earth . I have done the work you gave me to do .
43017005	So now , Father , let my name be great with you . Make my name as great as it was when I was with you before the world was made .
43017006	I have shown these men who you really are . They are men whom you gave me from the world . They belonged to you and you gave them to me . They have obeyed you .
43017007	Now they really know that everything you gave me comes from you .
43017008	I have told them the things that you told me to tell them . And they have believed my words . They know it is true that I was with you before I came . They have believed that you sent me .
43017009	It is these men I am asking you for . I am not asking you for the people of the world . But I am asking for those you gave me , because they belong to you .
43017010	All those I have are yours . And all you have are mine . And they make my name great .
43017011	I am not in the world any longer . But they are in the world . And I am coming to you . Holy Father , keep them in your name , which you have given me . Then they will be one , just as you and I are one .
43017012	While I was with them , I took care of them in your name , which you gave me . I have taken care of them . Only one of them is lost . That is the one who was born to be lost . What your book says came true .
43017013	Now I am coming to you . I say these things while I am in the world so that they may be very glad , as I am .
43017014	I have told them what you said . The world has hated them because they do not belong to the world . So also , I do not belong to the world .
43017015	I do not ask you to take them out of the world . But I ask you to take care of them , so that the evil one of this world will not harm them .
43017016	They do not belong to the world , even as I do not belong to the world .
43017017	Make them clean by the true word and keep them for yourself . Your word is true .
43017018	I have sent them into the world as you sent me into the world .
43017019	I have made myself clean and kept myself for them , so that they may be clean and be kept for you also by the truth .
43017020	I do not ask this for these people only; I ask it also for the people who will believe in me when they hear what these people say .
43017021	I do this so that the people will all be one . That is the same way with us . You , my Father , belong to me and I belong to you . I ask that they also may be joined to us . Then the world will believe that you have sent me .
43017022	I have made them great the way you have made me great . That makes us one , as we are one .
43017023	I belong to them and you belong to me , so that they all may be really one together . Then the world will know that you have sent me and that you have loved them just as you have loved me .
43017024	Father , I want the people that you have given me to be with me . Then they will see that you made me great , because you loved me before you made the world .
43017025	Father , you are the one who is right . The world has not known you . But I have known you . These people know that you have sent me .
43017026	I have told them who you are . I will tell them again and again . Then they will love each other as much as you have loved me . And I will live in them .
43018001	When Jesus had finished saying this , he and his disciples went through the valley called Kidron . There was a garden with trees . He and his disciples went into the garden .
43018002	Jesus had gone to this place often with his disciples , so Judas knew where the place was . He was the one who gave Jesus over to the people who hated him .
43018003	The chief priests and the Pharisees sent soldiers and guards with Judas . They had lamps , and torches , and things to fight with .
43018004	Jesus knew everything that was going to happen to him . So he went out and said to them , Who are you looking for ?
43018005	They answered , Jesus from Nazareth . Jesus said to them , I am he . Judas , who had given Jesus over to them , was standing with them .
43018006	When Jesus said to them , I am he , they all drew back suddenly and fell down .
43018007	So Jesus asked them again , Who are you looking for ? And they said , Jesus from Nazareth .
43018008	Then Jesus answered , I have already told you that I am he . If you are looking for me , let these men go .
43018009	So his words came true . He had said , I did not lose one of those you gave me .
43018010	Simon Peter had a long knife or sword . He took it out and hit the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear . The servants name was Malchus .
43018011	Jesus said to Peter , Put your sword back in its place . Must I not drink the cup that my Father has given me ?
43018012	Then the soldiers , and the captain , and the guards caught Jesus and tied him up .
43018013	First they took him to Annas . He was the father of Caiaphas wife . Caiaphas was the high priest that year .
43018014	This was the same Caiaphas that had talked to the leaders of the Jews . He had said , It is better for one man to die for the people .
43018015	Simon Peter and one other disciple went after Jesus . The other disciple knew the high priest , so he went right in with Jesus through the gate of the high priests large house .
43018016	But Peter stood by the gate outside . The other disciple who knew the high priest talked to the servant at the door and brought in Peter .
43018017	The servant at the door said to Peter , Are you one of this mans disciples too ? Peter said , No , I am not !
43018018	It was cold there . The servants and the officers had made a small fire . They stood by it and warmed themselves . Peter stood by the fire also and warmed himself .
43018019	The high priest then asked Jesus about his disciples , and about his teaching .
43018020	Jesus answered him , I have talked so that anyone who wanted to could hear me . I have always taught in the meeting houses and in the temple . That is where the Jews always go . I have not said anything in a secret way .
43018021	Why do you ask me ? The people heard me talk . Ask them what I told them . They know what I said .
43018022	When he had said this , one of the officers who stood there hit Jesus . He said , Is that the way you answer the high priest ?
43018023	Jesus answered him , If I have said anything bad , tell me plainly what wrong thing I have said . If I have told the truth , why do you hit me ?
43018024	Jesus was still tied up . Annas sent him over to Caiaphas the high priest .
43018025	Simon Peter stayed by the fire and stood warming himself . So the people said to him , Are you not one of his disciples also ? He said , No , I am not !
43018026	A servant was there . He was of the same family as the one whose ear Peter had cut off . He said , Did I not see you in the garden with him ?
43018027	Again Peter said , No ! And just then a cock called out .
43018028	Then the Jewish leaders took Jesus from Caiaphas to the court house . It was early in the day . They themselves did not go into the court house . They did not want to become unclean . They wanted to eat the Passover Feast .
43018029	Pilate went out to the Jewish leaders and said , What complaint do you bring against this man ?
43018030	They said to him , If he were not a very bad man , then we would not have brought him to you .
43018031	Pilate said , Take him and judge him by your own law . The leaders of the Jews said , But we are not allowed to kill anyone .
43018032	So this is the way the words of Jesus came true . He had said how he was going to die .
43018033	Then Pilate went back into the court house again . He called for Jesus and asked him , Are you the King of the Jews ?
43018034	Jesus answered , Do you ask me because you yourself think I am , or do you ask me because others said I am ?
43018035	Pilate answered , Am I a Jew ? Your own people and the chief priests have brought you here to me . Tell me , what have you done ?
43018036	Jesus answered him , I am not a king in this world . If I were , my people would fight so that I would not be given to the Jews . But I am not a king in this world .
43018037	So Pilate said , So you really are a king then ? Jesus answered , You say that I am a king . The reason that I was born was that I should tell what is true . That is why I came into the world . Everyone who likes what is true listens to what I say .
43018038	Pilate said , What is truth ? When he had said this , he went out to the Jews again . He told them , I find nothing wrong in this man .
43018039	But at the Passover Feast you always want me to let one prisoner go free for you . Do you want me to let the King of the Jews go free ?
43018040	Then they all shouted again , Not this man , but Barabbas ! Barabbas was a man who had stolen things .
43019001	Pilate took Jesus and had him beaten .
43019002	The soldiers made a big ring of thorns like a crown and put it on Jesus head . They put a red gown on him .
43019003	They said , Greetings , King of the Jews ! They beat him with their hands .
43019004	Then Pilate went out to the people again and said to them , See , I bring the man before you . This is to show you that I find nothing wrong in him .
43019005	Then Jesus came out . He had the crown of thorns on his head and had the red gown on him . Pilate said , Here is the man !
43019006	When the chief priests and the officers saw Jesus , they shouted , Nail him to a cross ! Nail him to a cross ! Pilate said to them , You take him and nail him to a cross . I find nothing wrong in him .
43019007	The leaders of the Jews answered him , We have a law . That law says he should die , because he calls himself the Son of God . When Pilate heard what they said , he was very much afraid .
43019009	He went into the court house again and said to Jesus , Where do you come from ? But Jesus did not answer him .
43019010	Then Pilate said , Do you not answer me ? Do you not know that I have power to nail you to a cross , or to let you go free ?
43019011	Jesus said , You would have no power over me if God did not give you power . So then , the man who gave me up to you has done something worse than you .
43019012	After that Pilate tried to let Jesus go free . But the Jews shouted , If you let this man free , you are not Caesars friend ! Anyone who makes himself a king is fighting against Caesar !
43019013	When Pilate heard this , he brought Jesus out . Then Pilate sat on the bench where the judge sits . The place was called the Street of Stone . The Jews called it Gabbatha .
43019014	It was about the middle of the day before the Passover Feast . Pilate said to the Jews , See , here is your King !
43019015	But they shouted , Take him away ! Take him away ! Nail him to a cross ! Pilate said to them , Shall I nail your King to a cross ? The chief priests answered , Caesar is the only king we have .
43019016	Then Pilate gave them Jesus to be nailed to a cross .
43019017	They took Jesus and led him away . Jesus went out carrying his own cross . They went to a place which the Jews called Golgotha . That means the place of the skull bone .
43019018	There they nailed Jesus to the cross . Two other people were also nailed to crosses . One was put on each side of Jesus . Jesus was put in the centre .
43019019	Pilate wrote a sign and put it on the cross . He wrote , Jesus from Nazareth , the King of the Jews .
43019020	Many of the Jews read this sign . The place where Jesus was nailed to a cross was near the city . The sign was written in the Jewish , Greek , and Latin languages .
43019021	Then the chief priests among the Jews said to Pilate , Do not write , " The King of the Jews , " but write , " This man said he is King of the Jews . "
43019022	Pilate answered , What I have written I have written !
43019023	When the soldiers had nailed Jesus to the cross , they took his clothes . They divided them into four parts and gave each soldier one part . Then they took his coat . It was not sewn together but the cloth was all made in one piece from the top to the bottom .
43019024	So the soldiers said to one another , We will not tear this . But let us gamble for it . What the holy writings say came true . They say , They divided my clothes among them . They gambled for my coat . That is what the soldiers did .
43019025	Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother , his mothers sister , Mary the wife of Cleophas , and Mary Magdalene .
43019026	Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing near . He said to his mother , Woman , see your son !
43019027	And he said to the disciple , See your mother ! From that time on , that disciple took her to live in his own home .
43019028	Jesus now knew that everything had happened that the holy writings said . He said , I am thirsty .
43019029	A bowl of bad wine was there . They took something called a sponge and made it wet with the wine . Then they put it on a stick and put it to Jesus mouth .
43019030	Jesus took the wine . Then he said , It is finished . And he bowed his head and died .
43019031	It was the day before the Sabbath day . The Jewish leaders did not want the bodies to stay on the cross on the Sabbath day because it was a big day . So they begged Pilate to break the legs of those who had been nailed to crosses . Then they could be taken away .
43019032	The soldiers came and broke the legs of the one nailed to the cross on one side of Jesus . Then they broke the legs of the one on the other side of him .
43019033	When they came to Jesus , they saw that he was dead already . So they did not break his legs .
43019034	One of the soldiers stuck a spear into the side of Jesus body . Right away , blood and water came out .
43019035	The man who saw it told what he saw , so that you may believe . What he said is true and he knows that it is true .
43019036	What the holy writings say came true . They say , Not one of his bones shall be broken .
43019037	They also say , They shall look at the one into whom they stuck the spear .
43019038	A man named Joseph , from the town of Arimathea , was a disciple of Jesus . But he did not say so because he was afraid of the leaders of the Jews . After all this had happened , he went to Pilate . He asked him to let him take Jesus body away . Pilate let him . So he came and took his body .
43019039	Nicodemus also came . He was the one who had come to Jesus at night . He brought with him a heavy bag of sweet-smelling spices called myrrh and aloes . It was mixed together .
43019040	They wrapped linen cloth around the body of Jesus and put the myrrh and aloes in with the cloth . That is how Jews bury a person .
43019041	There was a garden at the place where Jesus was nailed to the cross . In the garden was a new grave cut in the rock . No one had ever been laid in it .
43019042	They laid Jesus body there because it was the day before the Sabbath day , and the grave was near .
43020001	Mary Magdalene came to the grave on the first day of the week . It was early in the morning and not very light . She saw that the stone had been taken away from the grave .
43020002	So she ran and met Simon Peter and the other disciple , whom Jesus loved . She said to them , They have taken the Lord out of the grave ! We do not know where they have laid him !
43020003	Then Peter and that other disciple also went to the grave .
43020004	Both of them ran . The other disciple ran faster than Peter and got to the grave first .
43020005	He bent down and looked in . He saw the linen cloths lying there , but he did not go inside .
43020006	Then Simon Peter came up behind him . He went into the grave and saw the linen cloths lying there .
43020007	He also saw the small cloth that had been wrapped around Jesus head . It was not with the other cloths , but it was folded together by itself in another place .
43020008	Then the other disciple , who got there first , also went in . He saw and believed .
43020009	Until this time they did not understand the holy writings where it says , He must rise from death .
43020010	Then the disciples went away again to their own homes .
43020011	But Mary stood outside the grave crying . As she cried , she bent down and looked into the grave .
43020012	She saw two angels with white clothes on . They were sitting where Jesus body had been . One sat at the head and one at the foot .
43020013	They said to her , Woman , why are you crying ? She said to them , They have taken away my Lord and I do not know where they have laid him .
43020014	When she had said this , she turned around . She saw Jesus standing there , but she did not know that it was Jesus .
43020015	Jesus said to her , Woman , why are you crying ? Who are you looking for ? She thought he was the man who took care of the garden . So she said to him , Sir , if you have carried him away , tell me where you have laid him . I will take him away .
43020016	Jesus said to her , Mary . She turned around again and said , Master !
43020017	Jesus said to her , Do not hold me , because I have not yet gone up to my Father . But go to my brothers and tell them that I am going up to my Father . He is your Father also . I am going up to my God . He is your God also .
43020018	Mary Magdalene went to the disciples . She said , I have seen the Lord ! And she told them what he had said to her .
43020019	It was the first day of the week . In the evening the disciples were in a house together . The doors were shut because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders . Jesus came and stood there with them . He said to them , Peace to you !
43020020	When he had said this , he showed them his hands and his side . The disciples were glad when they saw the Lord .
43020021	Jesus said to them again , Peace to you ! My Father sent me : now I am sending you in the same way .
43020022	When he had said this , he breathed on them and said , Receive the Holy Spirit .
43020023	Whoever you make free from the wrong things they have done will be free . Whoever you do not make free from the wrong things they have done will not be free .
43020024	Thomas , one of the twelve disciples , was called the Twin . He was not with them when Jesus came .
43020025	The other disciples told him about it . They said , We have seen the Lord ! Thomas said , I will not believe unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands . I will not believe unless I put my finger on the mark and feel his side with my hand .
43020026	Then eight days later his disciples were in the house again . This time Thomas was with them . The doors were shut . Then Jesus came and stood there with them . He said to them , Peace to you !
43020027	Then he said to Thomas , Put your finger here . Look at my hands . Feel my side with your hand . Do not doubt anymore , but believe .
43020028	Thomas said to him , My Lord and my God !
43020029	Jesus said to him , You yourself have seen me . Is that why you now believe ? God will bless people who believe though they have not seen me .
43020030	Jesus did many other big works when he was with the disciples . They are not written in this book .
43020031	But these things are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ , the Son of God . And when you believe in his name , then he will give you power to live .
43021001	The next time the disciples saw Jesus was at the Sea of Tiberias [ Galilee ] . This is how Jesus showed himself to them .
43021002	Some of the disciples were in one place . They were Simon Peter , Thomas called the Twin , Nathanael of Cana in Galilee , the sons of Zebedee , and two other disciples of Jesus .
43021003	Simon Peter said to the others , I am going fishing . The others said , We are going with you also . They went out in a boat right away . That night they caught nothing .
43021004	Early in the morning , Jesus was standing there by the sea . The disciples did not know it was Jesus .
43021005	He said to them , My children , did you catch any fish ? They answered , No .
43021006	He said to them , Throw out your net on the right side of the boat , then you will catch some . They threw out their net and caught many fish , so that they were not able to bring in the net .
43021007	That disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter , It is the Lord ! As soon as Simon Peter heard it was the Lord , he put on his coat and his belt . He had taken off some clothes to work . Then he jumped into the water .
43021008	The other disciples came in a small boat . They were pulling the net . It was full of fish . They were not far from the land , only about a hundred yards .
43021009	When they came to the land , they saw a small fire . Fish and some bread lay on the fire .
43021010	Jesus said to them , Bring some of the fish which you have just caught .
43021011	Simon Peter went to the boat . He pulled the net to land . It was full of big fish . There were a hundred and fifty three fish . But even with so many fish the net did not break .
43021012	Jesus said to them , Come and eat . The disciples were all afraid to ask him , Who are you ? They knew it was the Lord .
43021013	Jesus came . He took bread and gave it to them . Then he took fish and gave it to them .
43021014	This was the third time that Jesus showed himself to the disciples after he had risen from death .
43021015	After they had eaten , Jesus said to Simon Peter , Simon , son of John , do you love me more than these ? He said , Yes , Lord . You know that I like you . I am your friend . Jesus said to him , Feed my lambs .
43021016	He asked him the second time , Simon , son of John , do you love me ? Peter said , Yes , Lord . You know that I like you . I am your friend . Jesus said to him , Take care of my sheep .
43021017	Then he asked Peter the third time , Simon son of John , do you like me ? Peter was sad because of the way Jesus asked him the third time . So he answered him , Lord , you know everything . You know that I love you as a close friend Jesus said to him , Feed my sheep .
43021018	I tell you the truth . When you were young , you put on your own belt . You went where you wanted to go . But when you are old , you will put out your hands . Others will put your belt on for you . They will take you where you do not want to go .
43021019	Jesus said this to show how Peter would die and make Gods name great . When he had finished saying this , he said to him , Come and follow me !
43021020	Peter turned around . The disciple whom Jesus loved was coming with Jesus also . He was the one who was at Jesus right side at the supper table . He had said to Jesus , Lord , who will give you over to people who hate you ?
43021021	When Peter saw him , he said to Jesus , Lord , what about this man ?
43021022	Jesus said to him , If I want him to wait till I come , what is that to you ? I want you to come and follow me .
43021023	So the report went around among the brothers that that disciple would not die . Jesus had not said to him , You will not die . But he had said , If I want him to wait till I come , what is that to you ?
43021024	The same disciple said these things and wrote them . We know what he said is true .
43021025	Jesus did many other things also . If every one were written down , I think that the world would be too small to hold all the books that would need to be written . Yes , it is so !
44001001	Theophilus , in the first book I wrote to you , I wrote about all the things Jesus began to do and to teach .
44001002	He did those things until the day he was taken up to heaven . Before he went up , he gave orders by the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen .
44001003	In many ways he proved to them that he was living again after his terrible death . For forty days they often saw him . Then he told them things about Gods kingdom .
44001004	One day when he was eating with them , he told them not to leave Jerusalem . He said , Wait here for what the Father promised you . I have told you about that promise already .
44001005	John baptised with water . But you will be baptised with the Holy Spirit when a few days have passed .
44001006	When they had come together , the apostles asked Jesus , Lord , are you now going to set up the kingdom of Israel ?
44001007	He answered them , You will not know the days or the months which the Father has chosen .
44001008	But when the Holy Spirit comes upon you , you will receive power . You will speak of me in Jerusalem and all around in Judea and Samaria and everywhere in the world .
44001009	When Jesus had said this , he went up . They watched him going . Then a cloud hid him , and they did not see him any more .
44001010	While they were looking at the sky as he went up , two men stood by them in white clothes .
44001011	They said , You men from Galilee , why do you stand there looking at the sky ? Jesus has gone up into heaven . In the same way that you saw him go up , he will come again .
44001012	Then they left the hill called the Mount of Olives . They went back to Jerusalem which was not far away . ( It was how far the law said people may walk on the Sabbath day . )
44001013	When they reached Jerusalem , they went to a room up in a house . Here lived Peter and John , James and Andrew , Philip and Thomas , Bartholomew and Matthew , James the son of Alpheus , and Simon the freedom fighter , and Judas the son of James .
44001014	All of these people were talking to God . The women , Jesus mother Mary , and Jesus brothers were there talking to God also .
44001015	About one hundred and twenty people were gathered together . Peter stood up among them to speak to them .
44001016	He said , My friends and brothers , Judas showed the people where Jesus was so they could take him . The Holy Spirit spoke through king David long ago about Judas before he did it . What was written about him has now happened .
44001017	Judas was one of us . He had his part of the work to do . (
44001018	Judas received money for the wrong thing he did . He bought a field with the money and fell on his face . His belly burst open and all his insides came out .
44001019	All the people who live in Jerusalem know about this . In their language they named the field Akeldama , which means The Field of Blood . )
44001020	The book of Psalms says , " His house must be empty . No one may live in it . " And it also says , " Someone else must do his work . "
44001021	Here are men who have been with us all the time that the Lord Jesus was with us .
44001022	They were with us from the time John baptised people until the day Jesus was taken up from us . One of these men must help us tell people that Jesus was raised from death .
44001023	They took two men . One was Joseph , named Barsabbas , who had another name Justus . The other man was Matthias .
44001024	Then the people talked to God . They said , Lord , you know what is in everybodys heart . Show us which of these two men you have chosen to have a part in this work and to be an apostle . For Judas left this work and went to the place where he belonged .
44001026	Then they picked out the name of Matthias . He was chosen to be with the eleven apostles .
44002001	On the day of Pentecost these people were all in one place .
44002002	Then , suddenly , a sound came from heaven . It was like a very strong wind blowing . It went all through the house where they were sitting .
44002003	And then they saw tongues like fire . These were divided and came on each one of the people there .
44002004	All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit . They began to speak the words of God in other languages as the Spirit spoke through them .
44002005	Crowds of Jews were staying in Jerusalem . They had come from every country in the world . They were good men who believed in God .
44002006	Many people came together when they heard the apostles speaking . They did not know what to think . Everyone heard someone speaking in his own language .
44002007	They were all very much surprised and said to each other , These men who are speaking , are they not all from Galilee ?
44002008	How is it then that each one of us hears the language of our own country ?
44002009	We people from the countries of Parthia and Media and Elam all hear the wonderful things God has done . So also do the people who live in the countries of Mesopotamia , and in Judea in Cappadocia , in Pontus , and Asia , in Phrygia , and Pamphylia , and in Egypt , and in some parts of Lybia around Cyrene , people from the city of Rome who are now living in Jerusalem , both Jews and those who joined themselves to the Jews , the people from Crete and Arabia . These men from Galilee are speaking in our own languages .
44002012	They were all very much surprised and could hardly believe it . What does this mean ? they asked each other .
44002013	Other people laughed about it and said , These men have been drinking too much new wine .
44002014	Peter stood up with the eleven apostles . He shouted , You men of Judea and all who stay in Jerusalem , listen to me ! I will tell you the truth .
44002015	You think that these men are drunk . That is not so . It is only nine oclock in the morning .
44002016	The thing that has happened is what the prophet Joel told about .
44002017	He said , " God says , In the last days I will send my Spirit on all people . I will speak through your sons and daughters . Your young men will see visions and your old men will have dreams .
44002018	In those days I will send my Spirit on the men and women who serve me and I will speak through them .
44002019	In the sky above and on the earth below I will show wonderful signs with blood and fire and clouds of smoke .
44002020	The sun will be dark and the moon will be like blood . These things will happen before the day of the Lord comes . It will be a great day that will be remembered always .
44002021	And anyone who calls out to the Lord will be saved . "
44002022	You men of Israel , listen to this . God showed you that he was pleased with this man , Jesus of Nazareth . He proved it by the big works and the wonderful signs which he did by Jesus right here among you people . And you yourselves know it .
44002023	This same Jesus was given up . You let bad men take him . You let them nail him to a cross and kill him . This is just the way God had planned it . He knew how it would happen . But God raised him back to life . He set him free from the pain of death . Death could not hold him .
44002025	King David spoke about Jesus long ago . He said , " I saw the Lord before me always . He is at my right hand so that I may not be shaken .
44002026	That made my heart very happy . It made my tongue sing for joy . And even my body also will rest in peace because you will not leave my body in the grave . You will not let your Holy One die and be spoiled .
44002028	You have shown me the ways of life . You will make me very happy when I am with you . "
44002029	My brothers , I can talk very plainly to you about your father , David . He died and was buried . His grave is still here today .
44002030	He was a prophet . He knew that God had promised him that someone born of his family would sit on his chair to rule . That one was Christ .
44002031	David knew what would happen . So he said that Christ would be raised from death . Christ was not left in the grave . His body was not spoiled . David said all this before it ever happened .
44002032	And now we all saw it . We are telling people that God raised this Jesus back to life .
44002033	God made him great by making him sit at his right side . God gave him the Holy Spirit as he had promised . So he sent this which you now see and hear .
44002034	David himself has not gone up into the heavens . What he said was , " The LORD God said to my Lord , Sit at my right hand till I bring your enemies down and put your feet on them . "
44002036	So let all the people of Israel know this : God has made Jesus to be Lord and Christ . This is the same Jesus whom you nailed to the cross .
44002037	What Peter said cut the peoples hearts when they heard it . They knew they had done wrong . They said to Peter and the rest of the apostles , Brothers , what shall we do ?
44002038	Stop your wrong ways and turn back to God , answered Peter . And then everyone of you can be baptised in the name of Jesus Christ . Your wrong ways will be forgiven you , and you will receive the Holy Spirit .
44002039	This promise is for you and your children and for all those whom the Lord our God calls , even though they are far away .
44002040	Peter went on talking and teaching the people . Do not follow the wrong ways of people today , he begged .
44002041	Then those who gladly received his words and believed were baptised . That same day about three thousand new believers joined them .
44002042	They kept on being taught by the apostles . And they kept on being with them . They ate bread together and talked with God .
44002043	All the people were very much surprised . Many wonderful things and signs were done by the apostles .
44002044	All the believers were together; and everything they had was for the use of all .
44002045	They sold their things and divided the money among the believers . They gave each person what he needed . 46 ,
44002046	And every day the believers kept on gathering in the temple . They ate bread in each others homes . They ate their food gladly and with open hearts . They praised God . All the people respected them . Day by day , the Lord added to the church those who were saved .
44002047	missing fehlt/missing
44003001	One day at three oclock , Peter and John went to the temple to talk with God .
44003002	There was a man who had been born lame . He was carried and was laid at the gate of the temple every day . The gate was called Beautiful . He was brought there to beg . He asked for money from the people who went into the temple .
44003003	This man saw Peter and John ready to go into the temple . He begged them to give him something .
44003004	Peter and John looked at him . Peter said , Look at us .
44003005	The man looked at them . He thought they would give him something .
44003006	Then Peter said , I have no money . But I will give you what I have . In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth , get up and walk !
44003007	He took the mans right hand and raised him up . Right away his feet and ankles became strong .
44003008	He jumped to his feet and walked into the temple with them . He was so happy he jumped around and praised God .
44003009	All the people saw him walking and praising God .
44003010	And they knew that this was the man who sat begging at the temple gate which was called Beautiful . They were very much surprised at what had happened to him . They could hardly believe it .
44003011	While the man still held on to Peter and John , all the people came running to them . It was in the part of the temple which is called Solomons porch . They were still very excited .
44003012	When Peter saw this , he talked to the people . He said , Men of Israel , why are you so surprised at this ? Do you think that we have power or are good enough to make this man walk ? Why do you look at us that way ?
44003013	The God of Abraham , Isaac , Jacob , and of our fathers , has made his Son Jesus great . You gave him up to Pilate . You did not want to believe who he was . You did not want him back when Pilate agreed to let him go free .
44003014	You would not receive the one who was holy and good . You asked for a bad man , who killed people , to be given to you .
44003015	You killed the one who gives life , the one whom God brought back from death . We saw it and are telling people about it .
44003016	This man whom you see and know , believed in the name of Jesus Christ . This mans faith in that name has healed him . Yes , believing in Jesus Christ has made him well here in front of you all .
44003017	My brothers , I know that you and your rulers killed Jesus because you did not understand what you were doing .
44003018	But in this way God did what he had told us would happen . Through all the prophets he had told us that Christ would suffer .
44003019	Stop doing wrong things . Turn to God again . Then the wrong things you have done will be wiped away altogether . The Lord will give you a new start and make you very glad .
44003020	He will send you Jesus . He was the one God chose to be the Christ .
44003021	But he must wait in heaven until the time when all things will be made new again as they were at first . By his holy prophets God spoke of all this from the beginning .
44003022	Moses himself said , " The Lord God will raise up for you a Prophet like me . He will be one of your brothers . You must listen to everything that the Prophet says to you .
44003023	And everyone who does not obey that Prophet will be cut off from his people altogether . "
44003024	Prophets spoke at the time of Samuel , and prophets spoke after that time . They all have told about these days also .
44003025	You are the people who have received what the prophets promised . And you have received the agreement which God made with your fathers . He said to Abraham , " Through your children all the nations of the earth will receive blessing . "
44003026	God raised up and sent his Son to you first to bless you . He blesses you when each one of you stops doing wrong things .
44004001	Peter and John were talking to the people . The priests , and the captain of the temple , and the Sadducees came to them .
44004002	They were angry at Peter and John because they taught the people . They were angry because they told them that Jesus was brought back from death .
44004003	They caught them and put them in prison until the next day , because it was already evening .
44004004	But many of the people who heard them speak the word of God , believed what they said . The number of men who believed was about five thousand .
44004005	The next day their rulers , leaders , and scribes met in Jerusalem .
44004006	Annas the high priest , Caiaphas , John , Alexander , and all of the high priests family were there also .
44004007	Peter and John were brought before them . They asked the apostles , By what power or in what name have you done this ?
44004008	Then Peter , filled with the Holy Spirit , said to them , Rulers of the people and leaders of Israel , have you brought us to court today because of the good thing that was done to the lame man ? Do you want to find out how he was healed ?
44004010	Well , let it be known by all the people of Israel . This man standing before you is healed by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth . He has done this . You nailed him to a cross , but God raised him from death .
44004011	Jesus Christ is the stone which you , the builders , would not use . But he is now the chief corner stone .
44004012	No one else can save us . Of all the people in the world , God chose him to save us . It is by him we must be saved .
44004013	They saw that Peter and John were not afraid to speak out . They knew that they were like any other men . They did not have much training . So the people were very much surprised . They knew that Peter and John had been with Jesus .
44004014	They saw the man who had been healed standing beside them . So they could say nothing against them .
44004015	They told Peter and John to leave the court . Then they talked the matter over among themselves .
44004016	They said , What shall we do to these men ? All the people who live in Jerusalem know about this big work they have done . And we cannot say they did not do it .
44004017	But we do not want any more people to hear about it . So let us say to these men , " Take care ! Never speak to anyone in this name again . "
44004018	They called them in and said , Never speak or teach in this name again .
44004019	But Peter and John answered them , How does God look at it ? Is it right for us to obey you or to obey him ? You judge that for yourselves .
44004020	As for us , we must tell the things we have seen and heard .
44004021	So the high priest and those with him told them again . Then they let them go . They could not punish them because of the people . They all praised God for what had been done .
44004022	The man who had been healed was more than forty years old .
44004023	When they were free , Peter and John went back to their own friends . They told them all that the chief priests and leaders had said to them .
44004024	When they heard it , they talked to God together . They said , Lord , you are God . You made the sky , and the earth , the sea , and all that is in them .
44004025	Our father David was your servant . Through him you said by the Holy Spirit , " Why are the people who are not Jews so angry ? And why do the people plan things for nothing ?
44004026	The kings of the earth joined their forces . And the rulers met together against the Lord and his Christ . "
44004027	It is true that Herod and Pontius Pilate met together with Jews and those who were not Jews here in this city . They met to make secret plans against your holy Son Jesus , whom you made Christ .
44004028	But they only did what you had already planned should be done .
44004029	Lord , hear their words . Listen to the wrong things they say against us . We are your servants . Help us to speak your word without fear . And heal the sick by your own power . Let signs and wonderful things be done in the name of your holy Son Jesus .
44004031	When they had talked to God , the room they were in shook . They were all filled with the Holy Spirit . And they spoke the word of God without fear .
44004032	All the believers were one in heart and mind . Not one of them said , This is mine . But everything they had was for the use of all .
44004033	With much power the apostles told how the Lord Jesus was raised from death . And God blessed them all very much .
44004034	None of them was in need of anything . Those who owned fields and houses sold them . They brought the money to the apostles . Then the apostles gave each one what he needed .
44004036	There was a man named Joseph , a Levite . He was born in the country of Cyprus . The apostles called him Barnabas . That means " one who helps . "
44004037	He had a field and sold it . He brought the money to the apostles and gave it to them .
44005001	A man named Ananias and his wife , Sapphira , sold a field . He brought some of the money to the apostles . But he kept the rest of it . His wife knew what he had done .
44005003	Peter said , Ananias , why has Satan filled your heart ? Why do you lie to the Holy Spirit ? You have kept some of the money which you got for the field .
44005004	As long as you had the field , it belonged to you . When you had the money , you could do what you wanted to do with it . Why then did you plan to do a thing like this ? You have not lied to men , but to God .
44005005	As Ananias heard Peters words , he fell down and died . All who heard these things were very much afraid .
44005006	The young men came and wrapped him up . They carried him out and buried him .
44005007	About three hours later , his wife came in . She did not know what had happened .
44005008	Peter asked her , Tell me , did you sell the field for so much money ? and she answered , Yes , that is how much it was .
44005009	Then Peter said to her , Why did you two agree together to test the Spirit of the Lord ? Listen , I hear the footsteps of the men who buried your husband . They are at the door . They will carry you out too .
44005010	And she fell down at Peters feet and died . The young men came in and saw that she was dead . They carried her out and buried her beside her husband .
44005011	Then all the church people , and all the people who heard about this were very much afraid .
44005012	The apostles did many signs and wonderful things for the people who met together in the place called Solomons porch .
44005013	Other people feared to join them , but they spoke well of them .
44005014	Many more men and women believed and came to the Lord .
44005015	They brought sick people out into the streets and laid them on beds and mats . They hoped that at least Peters shadow would touch them as he passed by .
44005016	Many people also came from the cities around Jerusalem . They brought others who were sick and those who were controlled by bad spirits . Every one of them was healed .
44005017	Some Sadducees were with the high priest . They all became very jealous .
44005018	They caught the apostles and put them in prison .
44005019	But that night the angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out .
44005020	Go , said the angel . Stand in the temple and tell the people all about this new life .
44005021	When the apostles heard that , they went into the temple early in the morning and taught the people there . The high priest and his men came . They called a meeting of the court and all the leaders of the Jews . Then they sent men to the prison to bring the apostles out .
44005022	When the men came to the prison , they did not find the apostles there . Then they went back and told the high priest and those with him .
44005023	They said , The prison was locked very well . And the police were guarding the doors . But when we opened the doors , no one was inside .
44005024	When the high priest , the captain of the temple , and the chief priests heard this , they did not know what to think . We wonder what will come from all this , they thought .
44005025	Just then someone came and told them , The men you put in prison are standing in the temple teaching the people .
44005026	Then the captain went with the men and brought the apostles quietly . They did not bring them by force because they were afraid the people would kill them with stones .
44005027	So they brought them in and put them before the court . The high priest asked them , Did we not tell you that you must never teach again in this name ? But here you are , teaching people all over Jerusalem in this name . You are trying to put on us the blame for this mans death .
44005029	Then Peter and the other apostles answered them , We must obey God rather than men .
44005030	The God of our fathers raised up Jesus , the one you killed by hanging on a dead tree .
44005031	God has made him great at his right side . He has made him leader and Saviour . He has done this so that the people of Israel may stop doing wrong things and be forgiven .
44005032	We know these things are true . So does the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey him .
44005033	When the judges heard this , they were very , very angry and wanted to kill them .
44005034	Then a lawyer named Gamaliel stood up in the court . He was a Pharisee and all the people respected him . He asked that the apostles be taken out for a while .
44005035	Then he said , Men of Israel , you had better take care what you plan to do to these men .
44005036	Before this time , there was a man named Theudas . He tried to make people believe that he was a great man . He had about four hundred followers . He was killed , and all of his followers were scattered , and the whole thing ended .
44005037	Then after that , at tax time , another man named Judas from Galilee made trouble . Many people followed him . He also was killed and all of his followers were scattered . 38 ,
44005038	So now , I say , do nothing to these men . Leave them alone . If this is the teaching or work of men , it will come to an end . But if it is of God , you cannot stop these men . You might even be fighting against God !
44005040	They agreed to do what he said . They called in the apostles and had them beaten . They told them not to speak in the name of Jesus . Then they let them go .
44005041	The apostles left the court . They were very glad to think that God let them be punished for the name of Jesus .
44005042	Every day , in the temple and in homes , they kept on teaching and talking about Jesus Christ .
44006001	At that time more and more people joined the disciples . Then there was trouble about a certain matter . The Jews who spoke the Greek language complained against the other Jews . They said that each day when the food was being divided , their women whose husbands were dead did not get their part .
44006002	Then the twelve apostles called all of the disciples together . They said , It is not right for us to stop preaching Gods word to divide the food .
44006003	So then , brothers , you choose seven men who you know are good men . Choose men who are full of the Holy Spirit and are wise . We will give them the work to divide the food .
44006004	But we ourselves will keep on talking with God and telling his word .
44006005	This pleased all the people . The men they chose were Stephen , a man who believed God and was full of the Holy Spirit , Philip , Prochorus , Nicanor , Timon , Parmenas , and Nicolaus from Antioch who had joined the Jews .
44006006	These men were brought before the apostles . When the apostles had talked with God , they put their hands on their heads [ to bless them ] .
44006007	The word of God spread further and further , and many people in Jerusalem believed . Many of the priests also believed .
44006008	Stephen received much blessing and power from God . He did many wonderful things and signs among the people .
44006009	But some of the Jews argued with Stephen , and said he was wrong . ( They belonged to the meeting place of the Free Men . They were Jews who came from Cyrene , Alexandria , Cilicia and Asia Minor . ) They did not agree with Stephen .
44006010	But they could not say anything against his wise words and the Spirit by whom he spoke .
44006011	So they paid some people to say , We have heard him say wrong things about Moses and God .
44006012	They talked to the people , the leaders , and the scribes , and made them angry . They went quickly and caught Stephen and took him into the court .
44006013	They brought in the men who told lies about him . They said , This man is always saying wrong things about this holy place and the laws .
44006014	We have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will break down this place and that he will change the law which Moses gave us .
44006015	Then all the judges who sat in the court looked at him and they saw that his face was like the face of an angel .
44007001	Then the high priest asked , Is this true ?
44007002	Stephen replied , Men , brothers and fathers , listen to me . When our father Abraham was in the country of Mesopotamia , before he lived in the country of Haran , the God who is great and wonderful came to him .
44007003	God said , " Leave your country and your family and come to the country that I will show you . "
44007004	Then Abraham came out of the country of the Chaldeans and lived for a while in the country of Haran . After his father died , God led him from there to this country where you are living now .
44007005	But God did not give any of the land to Abraham , not even a small part . But he promised that the land would belong to him . After him it would belong to his children , even though he did not have a child then .
44007006	This is what God told Abraham . He told him that his children would travel and live in another land . They would be slaves to the people there . They would have a hard time for four hundred years .
44007007	And God said , " I will judge the people who make them slaves . After that , they will come out of that land and serve me here . "
44007008	God made the agreement of circumcision with Abraham . Abraham had a son Isaac . He made the mark of circumcision on the childs body and circumcised him on the eighth day . Isaac had a son Jacob , and Jacob had twelve sons who were our fathers .
44007009	Because they were jealous , they sold Joseph to be a slave in the country of Egypt . But God was with Joseph .
44007010	He took him out of all his troubles . He blessed him and made him wise in the eyes of Pharaoh , the king of Egypt . Pharaoh made him president in Egypt and a ruler over all the people of his house .
44007011	For a long , long time there was no rain in Egypt and Canaan . And so there was very little food . This caused much trouble . Our fathers had nothing to eat .
44007012	Then Jacob heard that there was food in Egypt . He sent his sons on their first trip to buy some . They were our fathers of long ago .
44007013	The second time they went , Joseph told his brothers who he was . And Pharaoh found out who Josephs family was .
44007014	Then Joseph sent for Jacob his father and all the family to come . There were seventy-five people .
44007015	So Jacob went to Egypt . There he and our fathers died .
44007016	They were taken back to the place called Shechem and buried . Abraham had bought a grave from the family of Hamor in Shechem . He had paid money for it .
44007017	Then it was almost time for God to do what he had promised to Abraham . The family of Jacob had become very large in Egypt .
44007018	Then a new king who did not know Joseph ruled over Egypt .
44007019	This king was not kind to our fathers but he gave them a hard time . They had to put their babies outside to die .
44007020	Moses was born during that time . He was a very fine baby . For three months he was raised in his own fathers home .
44007021	When he was put outside to die , Pharaohs daughter took him . She raised him as her own son .
44007022	Moses was taught all the things the Egyptians knew . He knew how to talk and could do great things .
44007023	When he was forty years old he decided to visit his own family , the people of Israel .
44007024	There he saw one of them being hurt by an Egyptian . So he helped him . He fought for him and knocked down the Egyptian .
44007025	He thought his people would know that God wanted him to make them free . But they did not understand .
44007026	The next day he saw two of his own people fighting and he wanted to make peace . " You are brothers , " he said . " Why are you fighting ? "
44007027	But the one who was fighting his neighbour pushed Moses away . He said , " Who made you our ruler and our judge ?
44007028	Do you want to kill me as you did the Egyptian yesterday ? "
44007029	When Moses heard these words , he left Egypt at once . He lived as a stranger in the country of Midian . While he was there , two sons were born to him .
44007030	When forty years had passed , he was in the wilderness near the hill called Sinai . There he saw fire in a small tree . An angel of the Lord was in the fire .
44007031	Moses looked at it . He was very much surprised . He came closer to look at it better . Then he heard the Lord speak to him .
44007032	The Lord said , " I am the God of your fathers . I am the God of Abraham , of Isaac , and of Jacob . " Moses began to shake . He was afraid to look .
44007033	Then the Lord said , " Take off your shoes . You are standing on holy ground .
44007034	I have looked and seen the trouble my people have in Egypt . I have heard them crying and I have come to make them free . Now come , I will send you to Egypt . "
44007035	This is the same Moses the people would not accept when they said , " Who made you our ruler and our judge ? " This is the one God sent to be their ruler and to make them free when he spoke through the angel in the small tree .
44007036	It was Moses who led the people out of Egypt . He had done wonderful things and signs there , and in the Red Sea , and in the wilderness , for forty years .
44007037	This is the same Moses who said , " God will raise up one of your brothers to be a prophet , as he did me . Listen to him . "
44007038	This is the same Moses who was with Gods people in the wilderness at the hill called Mount Sinai . He was with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai , and with our fathers of long ago . It was he who received the words of life to give to us .
44007039	Our fathers would not obey Moses . They did not want him to lead them . They wished they were back in Egypt .
44007040	They said to Aaron , " Make gods to lead us . We do not know what has happened to this Moses who brought us out of Egypt . "
44007041	They made a young cow at that time and gave sacrifices to this god which was not the true God . They were very happy . What they had made pleased them .
44007042	Then God turned away from them . He let them worship the sun , moon , and the many stars in the sky . The prophets of God wrote about it long ago . They said , " You people of Israel , did you sacrifice animals to me forty years in the wilderness ?
44007043	You carried the house of the god called Moloch and the star of the god called Rephan . You made gods of them to worship . I will carry you away to the other side of Babylon . "
44007044	Our fathers had the tent for the laws of God in the wilderness . It was built the way God showed Moses to make it .
44007045	Our fathers brought that tent with them when they came to this country . Joshua was their leader . God put aside the people who lived here first . Our fathers kept that tent with them until the time of David .
44007046	God blessed David who asked God to let him make a better house for Jacobs God .
44007047	But it was Solomon who built a house for him .
44007048	But even so , God is above all . He does not live in houses that people make with their hands . The prophet says ,
44007049	" The Lord said , The sky is the big chair from which I rule . I put my feet on the earth . So then , what kind of house will you build for me ? Or where will I rest myself ?
44007050	I have made all these things myself .
44007051	You hard-hearted people ! You have hearts and ears like the people who are not Jews . You always fight against the Holy Spirit just as your fathers did long ago .
44007052	What did your fathers do to the prophets of God ? They made a lot of trouble for every one of them . They killed the ones who told that the Right and True One would come . He is the One you gave up to be killed . You are the killers .
44007053	You received the law given by angels , but you have not kept it .
44007054	When the men heard what Stephen said , they were very angry . They made noises with their teeth to show they hated him .
44007055	But Stephen was full of the Holy Spirit . He looked at the sky and saw the greatness of God . He saw Jesus standing at Gods right side .
44007056	Look , he said , I see the sky open . I see the Son of man standing at Gods right hand side .
44007057	Then the men shouted . They put their fingers in their ears . All together they ran at Stephen .
44007058	They put him out of the city and threw stones at him . ( Those who had talked against him laid their clothes down by the feet of a young man named Saul . )
44007059	They kept on throwing stones at Stephen . He spoke to God and said , Oh , Lord Jesus , receive my spirit .
44007060	Then he kneeled down and said in a loud voice , Lord , do not punish them for this wrong thing they are doing , After he said this , he died .
44008001	Saul agreed to Stephen being killed . At that time the church people at Jerusalem had much trouble . The church people all went into Judea and Samaria . Only the apostles stayed on at Jerusalem .
44008002	Good men buried Stephen . They were very sad because he died .
44008003	Saul made much trouble for the church people . He went into every house , pulled out men and women , and put them into prison .
44008004	The people who left Jerusalem went all around telling the good news about Jesus .
44008005	Then Philip went to the city of Samaria and told people about Christ .
44008006	And all the people together listened to what Philip said because they heard and saw the big works which he did .
44008007	Many people who were held by bad spirits were made free from them . The spirits came out of them crying loudly . Many other sick people were healed too . People who could not stand , and others who were lame , were healed .
44008008	The people all over the city were very glad .
44008009	But there was one man named Simon , a witch-doctor , who fooled the people of Samaria . He tried to make people believe that he could do big things .
44008010	And all the people , young and old , listened to him . They said , This man is a big power of God .
44008011	He had fooled them for a long time with his work as a witch . That is why they listened to him .
44008012	But Philip came and told them about Gods kingdom and the name of Jesus Christ . The people believed him . Then both men and women were baptised .
44008013	Simon believed also . When he was baptised , he went with Philip . He was very much surprised when he saw the signs and the big works which were done .
44008014	Then the apostles at Jerusalem heard that the people of Samaria believed Gods word . So they sent Peter and John to them .
44008015	When they came to them , they prayed for them to receive the Holy Spirit .
44008016	Until that time , none of the people there had received the Holy Spirit . They had only been baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus .
44008017	Then the apostles put their hands on the people and they received the Holy Spirit .
44008018	Simon saw that the people received the Holy Spirit when the apostles put their hands on them . Then he brought money to the apostles .
44008019	He said , Give me this power , too , so that anyone on whom I put my hands will receive the Holy Spirit .
44008020	Peter said , May you and your money be destroyed ! You thought that you could buy the gift of God with money .
44008021	You have no part in this matter . You cannot have any of this because God sees that your heart is not right .
44008022	Stop your wrong ways . Ask the Lord . Perhaps God will forgive you for the wrong things you wanted to do .
44008023	I see that you are very bitter . Your wrong ways control you all together .
44008024	Simon said , Ask the Lord for me , so that none of the things you have talked about will happen to me .
44008025	The apostles told the people the word of the Lord . Then they went back to Jerusalem . On the way they told the good news in many villages in Samaria .
44008026	The angel of the Lord spoke to Philip . Get up , said the angel . Go south to the road that goes from Jerusalem to Gaza . It is desert there .
44008027	So Philip went . He saw a man from the country of Ethiopia . This man was a servant of Candace , the queen of the Ethiopian people . She gave this servant much power . He took care of her money . He had gone to Jerusalem to worship .
44008028	Now he was on his way back . He sat in his carriage reading from the book which was written long ago by Isaiah , the prophet of God .
44008029	The Spirit of the Lord said to Stephen , Go over to that man in the carriage .
44008030	So Philip went running to him . He heard him reading from the book of the prophet Isaiah . Do you understand what you are reading ? Philip asked .
44008031	How can I ? I have no man to teach me , he answered . He asked Philip to get into the carriage and ride with him .
44008032	This is what he was reading : He was led as a sheep to be killed . A lamb says nothing while its wool is being cut , so he also says nothing .
44008033	He was put down very low . He was not allowed to have a proper trial . He had no children to follow after him . For his life is taken from the earth .
44008034	Then the man from Ethiopia asked Philip , Please tell me , who is the prophet talking about , himself or some other man ?
44008035	Then Philip told him about Jesus . He began with what the man read in the book .
44008036	While they were going along , they came to some water by the road . The man said , See , here is water . What is there to stop me from being baptised ?
44008037	Philip answered , If you believe with all your heart , you may be baptised . The man said , I do believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God .
44008038	The man told the driver to stop . Then both he and Philip went down into the water , and Philip baptised him .
44008039	When they came up out of the water , the Spirit of the Lord took Philip away . The man did not see him again , but he went on his way and was very happy .
44008040	Next , Philip came to the town of Azotus . He told the good news in all the cities through which he passed . Then he came to Caesarea .
44009001	Saul was still very angry with the Lords disciples . He said he would kill them . He went to the high priest .
44009002	He asked him for letters to take to the meeting places at Damascus . In this way he was given the power to catch any men or women disciples . He could tie them and bring them back to Jerusalem .
44009003	He went on his way . All at once , near the city of Damascus , a light from the sky shone around him .
44009004	He fell to the ground and heard someone say , Saul , Saul , why are you troubling me ?
44009005	Saul said , Who are you , Lord ? The Lord said , I am Jesus . You are troubling me .
44009006	But get up and go to the city . There you will be told what you must do .
44009007	The men who had come with Saul stood there . They did not say a word . They heard a voice but did not see anyone .
44009008	Saul got up off the ground . When he opened his eyes , he was blind . They took his hand and led him to Damascus .
44009009	For three days he could not see , and he did not eat or drink .
44009010	A disciple named Ananias lived in Damascus . The Lord came to him in a vision and said . Ananias . He replied , Here I am , Lord .
44009011	The Lord said , Go into the street which is called Straight . At the house of Judas , ask for a man named Saul , from the city of Tarsus . He is there , talking with God .
44009012	In a vision he has seen a man named Ananias coming to him . He has seen him put his hands on him so that he may see again .
44009013	Then Ananias replied , Lord , often I have heard of this man . He has brought much trouble to your people at Jerusalem .
44009014	The chief priests have given him power in this city to put into prison all those who call on your name .
44009015	The Lord said , Go , I have chosen him to take my name to the people who are not Jews , to kings , and to the people of Israel also .
44009016	I will show him how much he must suffer for my names sake .
44009017	Then Ananias went . He went into the house and put his hands on Saul . He said , Brother Saul , the Lord Jesus came to you on the road while you were coming here . He has sent me to you so that you may see again , and that you may be filled with the Holy Spirit .
44009018	At once some kind of skin which had covered Sauls eyes came off . He was able to see again from then on . He got up and was baptised .
44009019	And when he had eaten food , he was strong again . Saul stayed for some days with the disciples at Damascus .
44009020	Right away he went to the Jewish meeting places and told the people that Jesus is the Son of God .
44009021	All the people who heard him were surprised . They said , This man killed the people who called on Jesus name in Jerusalem . He came here to catch them and tie them and take them to the chief priests !
44009022	But Saul became stronger and stronger . He proved that Jesus is the Christ and made it so plain that the Jews at Damascus did not know what to say .
44009023	Then some time after that , the leaders of the Jews planned to kill Saul .
44009024	But he found out that they were waiting for him . The Jewish leaders watched the gates of the city night and day . They were waiting for a chance to kill him .
44009025	Then one night the disciples put him in a basket and let him down outside the city wall .
44009026	When Saul came to Jerusalem , he wanted to join the disciples , but they were all afraid of him . They did not believe that he was a disciple .
44009027	But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles . He told them , Saul has seen the Lord on the road . The Lord has talked to him . After that he told Gods word in the name of Jesus , without fear at Damascus .
44009028	So Saul stayed with the apostles and went around in Jerusalem . He told Gods word in the name of the Lord Jesus without fear .
44009029	He talked to the Jews who spoke the Greek language . But they did not agree with Saul , and so they made plans to kill him .
44009030	When the Christian brothers knew that , they took him to Caesarea . Then they sent him to Tarsus [ the city where he was born ] .
44009031	After that , the churches in Judea , Galilee , and Samaria were not troubled any more and they believed more strongly . The people obeyed the Lord , and the Holy Spirit helped them to believe . And many more people joined them .
44009032	While Peter was travelling through all the towns , he came to visit Gods people who lived in the city of Lydda .
44009033	There he saw a man named Aeneas who was sick . He could not stand up . He had been on his bed for eight years .
44009034	Peter said to him , Aeneas , Jesus Christ heals you . Get up and make your bed ! The man got up at once .
44009035	All the people who lived at Lydda and Sharon saw him , and they turned to the Lord .
44009036	In the city of Joppa there was a disciple . Her name was Tabitha . That means Dorcas or Gazelle . She did much good work and she gave many things to the poor people .
44009037	She became sick and died . They bathed her body and put her in a room upstairs .
44009038	Lydda was near Joppa . When the disciples heard that Peter was at Lydda , they sent two men and asked for him to come quickly .
44009039	Peter got up and went with them . When he got there , they took him to the room upstairs . Women whose husbands were dead stood there crying . They showed Peter the clothes and coats that Dorcas had made for them while she was with them .
44009040	Peter put them all out . He kneeled down and talked to God . He turned to the body and said , Tabitha , get up . She opened her eyes . When she saw Peter , she sat up .
44009041	He took her hand and helped her get up . Then he called in Gods people and the women , and he gave her back to them alive .
44009042	All over Joppa people heard about this . Many people believed on the Lord .
44009043	Peter stayed in Joppa for many days . He was with a man named Simon , who made skins into leather .
44010001	In Caesarea lived a man named Cornelius . He was a big captain in the army . His soldiers were called the Italian Group .
44010002	He was a good man . He and all the people of his house obeyed God . He gave many gifts to the poor . He always talked with God .
44010003	About three oclock one afternoon , he clearly saw an angel from God coming to him in a vision . Cornelius , said the angel .
44010004	Cornelius looked at him . He was afraid and asked , What is it , Sir ? The angel answered him , God has heard what you said to him . He has remembered your gifts to the poor .
44010005	Send men to Joppa to call Simon , whose other name is Peter .
44010006	He is staying with Simon , the man who makes skins into leather . His house is by the sea . Peter will tell you what you should do .
44010007	When the angel which spoke to him had gone , Cornelius called two of his house servants . He also called one of the soldiers who believed in God and who always helped him .
44010008	He told them carefully all about his vision . Then he sent them to Joppa .
44010009	They went the next day . They were coming near to the city . About midday , Peter went up on the flat roof of the house to talk with God .
44010010	He became very hungry and wanted to eat . While food was being made ready , something like a dream came over him .
44010011	He saw the sky open . A bundle like a big blanket was tied by the corners . It was let down to earth .
44010012	In the bundle were all kinds of animals and snakes and birds .
44010013	Then Peter heard a voice saying to him , Get up , Peter . Kill some and eat .
44010014	But Peter said , No , Lord , for I have never eaten anything that is not holy or not clean .
44010015	Then the voice spoke to him again , saying , What God has made clean you must not call unholy .
44010016	This happened three times . Then the thing was taken up right away into the sky .
44010017	I have seen a strange thing , Peter said to himself . I wonder what it all means . He was thinking about all this . And the men whom Cornelius sent had asked the way to Simons house . Now they stood at the gate .
44010018	Is this where Simon Peter is staying ? they called .
44010019	Peter was still thinking about what he had seen . Then the Spirit of God said to him , Three men are looking for you .
44010020	Get up . Go down and go with them . Do not fear to go , because I have sent them .
44010021	Then Peter went down to the men whom Cornelius had sent to him . He said , Here I am . You are looking for me . Why have you come ?
44010022	They answered , God sent a holy angel to Cornelius . He told him to call you to his house and hear what you have to say . Cornelius is a captain in the army . He is a good man . He does what is right and obeys God . All the Jews speak well of him .
44010023	Peter said , Come in . He had them stay as his guests . The next day he and some of the Christian brothers from Joppa went with the men .
44010024	The day after that , they reached Caesarea . Cornelius was waiting for them . He had called his family and close friends together .
44010025	Peter was about to enter the house . Cornelius met him . He kneeled down at his feet and worshipped him .
44010026	But Peter raised him up and said , Please stand up . I too am only a man .
44010027	Peter talked to him and went in with him . He saw many people who had come together .
44010028	He began to talk with them . He said , You yourselves know it is against our law for a Jew to visit and be friends with someone who is not a Jew . But God has shown me that I should not call any man unholy or unclean .
44010029	So when you sent for me , I did not say " No " . Now I ask , why did you send for me ?
44010030	Cornelius answered , Four days ago , it was just at this time , three oclock . I was in my house talking with God . I had not eaten any food . A man stood in front of me wearing shining clothes .
44010031	He said to me , " Cornelius , God has heard what you said to him . He has remembered your gifts to the poor .
44010032	Send men to Joppa to call for Simon Peter . He is staying with Simon , the man who makes skins into leather . His house is by the sea . "
44010033	So I sent for you right away . You have done well to come . Now we are all here before God to hear all that the Lord has told you to tell me .
44010034	Then Peter began to speak , I really understand now . God does not love some people more than others .
44010035	But he takes anyone who obeys him . He takes anyone who does what is right . It does not matter to what nation they belong .
44010036	To the people of Israel God has sent the good news . He gives peace through Jesus Christ . He is Lord of all !
44010037	You yourselves know the story of what happened all through Judea . It started in Galilee after the baptism which John talked about .
44010038	God gave Jesus of Nazareth the Holy Spirit and power . Jesus went about doing good deeds . He healed all those who were held by the devil . God was with him .
44010039	We saw all the things which he did in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem . And they hung him on a piece of wood and killed him .
44010040	On the third day , God raised him up to let people see him .
44010041	Not all the people saw him . But God had chosen us to see and to talk about him . We saw him . We ate and drank with him after he rose from death .
44010042	He told us to tell the people that God chose him to judge both the living people and the dead people .
44010043	All the prophets tell about him . They say , " Everyone who believes in him will have his wrong ways forgiven through his name . "
44010044	While Peter was saying this , the Holy Spirit came on all those who heard the message .
44010045	The believers who came with Peter were Jews . They were very much surprised that the Holy Spirit was also sent to those who were not Jews . 46 ,
44010046	They heard them speak in tongues of other languages and praise God . Then Peter said , These people have received the Holy Spirit just as we have . Can anyone say they may not be baptised in water ?
44010048	So he said they were to be baptised in the name of Jesus Christ . They begged him to stay with them for a while .
44011001	The apostles and other Christian brothers were in Judea . They heard that some people who were not Jews had also believed Gods message .
44011002	When Peter went back to Jerusalem , the leaders of the Jews found fault with him .
44011003	They asked , Why did you visit people who are not Jews ? Why did you eat with them ?
44011004	Peter explained to them all that had happened from the beginning .
44011005	I was in the city of Joppa talking with God , he said . Something like a dream came over me . I saw a vision . I saw a bundle like a big blanket tied by the corners . It was let down from the sky . It came down to me .
44011006	When I looked at it , I wondered about it . I saw different kinds of tame animals , wild animals , snakes , and birds .
44011007	And I heard a voice say to me , " Get up , Peter . Kill some and eat . "
44011008	But I said , " No , Lord , for I have never eaten anything that is not holy or clean . "
44011009	Then the voice spoke from the sky a second time , saying , " What God has made clean , you must not call unholy . "
44011010	This happened three times . Then everything was taken up into the sky again .
44011011	Right then three men came to the house where we were . They had come from Caesarea for me .
44011012	The Spirit told me to go with them and not to fear . These six brothers went with me too . We went into the mans house .
44011013	He told us that he had seen Gods angel standing in his house . The angel said to him , " Send men to Joppa to call Simon whose other name is Peter .
44011014	He will tell you and all your family how to be saved . "
44011015	And when I began to speak , the Holy Spirit came on them just as he had come on us at the beginning .
44011016	Then I remembered that the Lord said , " John baptised with water , but you will be baptised with the Holy Spirit . "
44011017	God gave then the same gift as he gave to us who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ . If God gave them this gift , how could I stop him ? I am only a man .
44011018	When the people heard this , they were satisfied . They praised God saying , God has allowed the people who are not Jews to turn to him and live .
44011019	Some of the people had gone to other countries because of the big trouble when Stephen was killed . They went as far as Phoenicia , Cyprus , and Antioch . They told Gods word to the Jews only .
44011020	Some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene . They went to Antioch . They also spoke to those who were not Jews , and they told them about the Lord Jesus .
44011021	The Lord was with them . Many believed and turned to the Lord .
44011022	The people in the Jerusalem church heard this news . They sent Barnabas to go to Antioch .
44011023	When he reached there , he saw what had been done by the power of God . He was very glad . He talked to them . He begged them all to keep on following the Lord with all their heart .
44011024	Barnabas was a good man . He believed in God and was filled with the Holy Spirit . Many people came to the Lord .
44011025	Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to get Saul .
44011026	When he found him , he took him to Antioch . For a whole year they met with all who believed in Jesus Christ . They taught many people . Antioch was the first place where the disciples were called Christians .
44011027	At that time , prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch .
44011028	One of them named Agabus stood up . He told them the Spirit had shown him that much trouble would come to all the world . There would not be much food for the people . ( This trouble came when Claudius Caesar was ruler . )
44011029	Then the disciples decided to help the Christian brothers who lived in Judea . They would each one send what he could .
44011030	They did so . They sent Barnabas and Saul to carry it to the church leaders [ in Jerusalem ] .
44012001	At that time Herod the king caught some of the church people and troubled them .
44012002	He killed James the brother of John with a long knife or sword .
44012003	He saw that this pleased the leaders of the Jews , so he caught Peter also . This happened at the Jewish feast which they had each year to remember leaving Egypt . ( It was called the Passover Feast . )
44012004	After Herod had caught Peter , he put him in prison . He told four groups of soldiers to guard him . There were four soldiers in each group . He planned to bring him out for trial before the people . But he would do it after the Passover Feast .
44012005	So Peter was kept in prison . And the church people asked God to help him .
44012006	The night before Herod was going to bring him out , Peter was sleeping between two soldiers . He was tied to them with two chains . Guards were at the door of the prison .
44012007	An angel from the Lord came to him and a light shone in the prison . He hit Peters side and woke him up . Be quick , he said . Get up ! His chains fell off his hands .
44012008	Put on your belt and your shoes , said the angel . Peter did so . And now , said the angel , put on your coat and follow me .
44012009	Peter followed him out . He did not know that what the angel had done was true . He thought he was dreaming .
44012010	They passed the first and the second guard . Then they came to the iron gate out to the city . It opened for them by itself . So they went all the way down a street . Then the angel left him .
44012011	When Peter came to himself , he said , Now I know truly that the Lord has sent his angel . He has saved me from Herod and from all that the Jewish leaders are hoping will happen to me .
44012012	And when he thought about this , he went to Marys house . Mary was John Marks mother . Many people were meeting there , talking to God [ about Peter ] .
44012013	Peter knocked at the outside door . A young servant woman named Rhoda went to answer .
44012014	When she knew it was Peters voice , she was very glad . She did not open the door . But she ran in and told the people that Peter was at the door .
44012015	They said , You are crazy . But she kept on saying that Peter was really there . Then they said , It must be his angel .
44012016	Peter kept on knocking . When they opened the door and saw him , they were very much surprised .
44012017	He put out his hand for them to be quiet . Then he told them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison . He said , Tell James and the brothers about this . Then he went away to another place .
44012018	In the morning the soldiers tried hard to find Peter .
44012019	Herod had looked for him and had not found him . So he questioned the guards and ordered them to be taken away and killed . And then Peter went from Judea to Caesarea to live for a while .
44012020	Now Herod was angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon . But they got Blastus to speak to the king for them . Blastus was one of the men who worked in the kings house . They came to Herod together . They wanted to make peace with him because their country got its food from his country .
44012021	On a certain day Herod put on his kings robes and sat on his chair and made a speech .
44012022	The people shouted , A god is talking to us . He is not a man .
44012023	At once an angel from God put a bad sickness on Herod because he did not give God the praise . Worms ate him and he died .
44012024	The word of God spread further and further and more people believed .
44012025	Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had finished their work . They brought John Mark with them .
44013001	In the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers . They were Barnabas , Simeon Niger , Lucius from Cyrene , Manaen who grew up with Herod the ruler , and Saul .
44013002	They were worshipping the Lord and fasting [ not eating food for a time ] . The Holy Spirit said , Give me Barnabas and Saul to do the work for which I have called them .
44013003	The men fasted and talked to God . Then they laid their hands on Barnabas and Paul and sent them on their way .
44013004	Barnabas and Saul left Antioch . The Holy Spirit sent them to the town of Seleucia . From there they went in a boat to the island of Cyprus .
44013005	When they reached the town of Salamis , they told Gods word in the meeting places of the Jews . John was with them to help .
44013006	They went through all the island to the town of Paphos . There they met a witch doctor . He was a Jew named Bar-Jesus . He was not a true prophet .
44013007	This witch-doctor was with Sergius Paulus , the ruler of the country . Sergius Paulus was a wise man . He wanted to hear Gods word , so he called for Barnabas and Saul .
44013008	The witch-doctor was also called Elymas . He tried to stop them . He did not want the ruler to believe the truth .
44013009	Then Saul , who is also called Paul , being filled with the Holy Spirit , looked at him .
44013010	You son of the devil ! he said . You do nothing but tell lies and make much trouble . You hate everything that is right . The Lords way is right . Will you not stop spoiling his way ?
44013011	See now , the Lords hand is upon you . You will be blind and will not be able to see the sun for a while . And right then something like a dark cloud came over Elymas eyes . He went around begging someone to take his hand and lead him .
44013012	The ruler saw what had happened . And he was very much surprised at the teaching about the Lord . He believed it .
44013013	Paul and his friends left Paphos in a boat . They went to the town of Perga in the district of Pamphylia . There John left them and went back to Jerusalem .
44013014	The others went on from Perga . They came to Antioch in the district of Pisidia . On the Sabbath day they went into the meeting house and sat down .
44013015	First , someone read from the books of the law and the prophets . Then the rulers of the meeting house called Paul and Barnabas and said , Men and brothers , have you something to say that will help us ? Please say it .
44013016	Then Paul stood up and put out his hand . He said , Men of Israel and you who worship and fear God , please listen to me .
44013017	The God of the people of Israel chose our fathers . He made the people into a large tribe when they were strangers in the land of Egypt . God brought them out of Egypt by his power .
44013018	For forty years in the wilderness God cared for them like a father .
44013019	God took seven tribes out of the land of Canaan . Then he divided the land among our people .
44013020	God gave judges to rule over them until Samuel the prophet came . About four hundred and fifty years had passed .
44013021	Then the people asked for a king . God gave them Saul . He was the son of Kish , a man from Benjamins family . Saul was their king for forty years .
44013022	Then God took him away . He made David king over them . This is what God said about him , " David , Jesses son , is the kind of man I love . He will do all that I want him to do . "
44013023	God has given Israel a Saviour from Davids family , as he promised to do . His name is Jesus .
44013024	Before he came , John [ the baptiser ] talked to all the people of Israel . He said they should stop doing wrong things and be baptised .
44013025	When John was finishing his work , he said , " Who do you think I am ? I am not the one . But wait , someone else will come after me . I am not good enough to untie his shoe strings . "
44013026	Men and brothers , sons of Abraham , and all of you who worship God , the news of this way to be saved has been sent to us .
44013027	The people who live in Jerusalem and their rulers did not know who this Jesus really was . They did not understand the words of the prophets of God long ago which were read every Sabbath day . But even so , they did what the prophets had said they would do . They judged him .
44013028	They could not prove that he did anything wrong for which he should die . Yet they begged Pilate to kill him .
44013029	They did all the things that the prophets had written about him . Then they took him down from the cross made from a tree . They laid him in a grave cut from the rock .
44013030	But God raised him from death .
44013031	People had come with Jesus from Galilee to Jerusalem . They saw him many days . Now they tell people what they saw .
44013032	And we are bringing you this good news . God made a promise to our fathers long ago . Now he has made his promise come true .
44013033	We , their children , have now received the promise . He sent Jesus just as it was written in the second psalm , " You are my Son . Today I have become your Father . "
44013034	God raised Jesus from death . His body did not go back to the grave to be spoiled . Here is what God said about it . " I will give to you the blessings which I promised David . "
44013035	In another psalm it says , " You will not let the body of your Holy One be spoiled . "
44013036	As for David , he did the work God wanted him to do for the people in his time . Then , after that , he died . He was buried with his fathers . His body spoiled .
44013037	But God has raised one from death . His body did not spoil .
44013038	Men and brothers , understand this . It is because of this Jesus that we tell you your wrong ways will be forgiven you .
44013039	The law of Moses could not make you free . But this man makes you free . You will not be judged if you believe in him .
44013040	Be careful then , so that what the prophets said will not happen to you .
44013041	They said , " Look , you people who despise everything . You will look in wonder before you die . I will do something in your time . I will do something that you will not believe even if someone told you what it is . "
44013042	As Paul and Barnabas left the meeting house the people said , Tell us these things again next Sabbath day .
44013043	The meeting was finished . There were many Jews , also those who were not Jews but worshipped God . They followed Paul and Barnabas . Paul and Barnabus kept talking to the people and told them to keep on living in the way that will bring Gods blessing .
44013044	The next Sabbath day almost all of the people in that city gathered to hear Gods word .
44013045	The leaders of the Jews saw that many people came . They were very jealous . They talked back to Paul and said he was not telling the truth . They also said wrong things about him .
44013046	But Paul and Barnabas did not fear the Jewish leaders . They said , We had to tell Gods word to you first but you will not listen to it . By that you are saying you Jews are not good enough to live for ever . So we will go to the people who are not Jews .
44013047	That is what the Lord told us to do . He said , " I have made you to be a light to the people who are not Jews . You will tell people everywhere in the world how to be saved . "
44013048	Those who were not Jews heard this . They were glad and they thanked God for his message . All those who had been chosen to live for ever believed .
44013049	The word of the Lord was told through all that part of the country .
44013050	But the leaders of the Jews talked to the leading women who worshipped God and to the chief men of Antioch . They made plenty of trouble for Paul and Barnabas . They made them leave that part of the country .
44013051	So Paul and Barnabas shook the dust off their feet and left them . They went on to Iconium .
44013052	And the followers were filled with joy and the Holy Spirit .
44014001	In Iconium Paul and Barnabas did as they had done before in other places . They went into the Jews meeting place and spoke . Many of the Jews and the other people believed .
44014002	But the Jews who did not believe said wrong things about them . They spoiled the minds of those who were not Jews so that they hated the Christians .
44014003	Paul and Barnabas stayed there a long time anyway . They did not fear to talk about the Lord . The Lord proved that the message about his blessing was true . He worked through Paul and Barnabas . They did signs and wonderful things .
44014004	The people of the city were divided . Some of them agreed with the Jewish leaders . Some of them agreed with the apostles .
44014005	Then some of those people who were not Jews joined together with the Jews and their leaders . They made a plan to give the apostles much trouble and to kill them with stones .
44014006	Paul and Barnabas found out about this . So they left quickly . They went to Lystra and Derbe in the district of Lycaonia and the country around .
44014007	There they told people the good news .
44014008	At Lystra a man was sitting . He was not able to walk because he had no strength in his feet . He had never walked since he was born .
44014009	This man heard Paul speak . Paul looked at the man . He saw that the man believed he would be healed .
44014010	Paul said , Stand up on your feet ! The man jumped up and walked .
44014011	When the people saw what Paul had done , they shouted in their own language , The gods have become like men ! They have come down to visit us .
44014012	They named Barnabas , Jupiter . And they named Paul , Mercury , because he was the one who talked .
44014013	There was a temple of Jupiter in front of the city . The priest of the temple brought animals and flowers to the gates to make a sacrifice . All the people were with him .
44014014	But when the apostles , Barnabas and Paul , heard of it , they tore their clothes and ran in among the people shouting .
44014015	They said , Why are you people doing this ? We are only men like you . You should leave these gods which cannot help you . You should turn to the living God . He made the sky , the earth , the sea , and all that is in them .
44014016	In the time that is past , God allowed all people to do what they wanted to do .
44014017	But even then he had some ways to make himself known . He did things that were good . He gave us rain from the sky and good harvests . And he gives you all the food you need and makes you very happy . Surely these things speak for him .
44014018	By saying these things they stopped the people from making sacrifices to them .
44014019	Some of the Jewish leaders from Antioch and Iconium came to Lystra and won the people to their side . They threw stones at Paul . Then they carried him out of the city because they thought he was dead .
44014020	But as the disciples gathered around him , he got up and they went back into the city . The next day Paul and Barnabas left and went to Derbe .
44014021	They told the good news to the people in Derbe . Many people believed what they taught . Then they went back to Lystra , to Iconium . and to Antioch .
44014022	They talked to the disciples to help them . They told them to keep on believing . They said , We must go through much trouble to get into Gods kingdom .
44014023	They chose leaders for them in every church . They talked with God and fasted . When they were finished , they gave the leaders over to the Lords care , because they believed in him .
44014024	They went through the district of Pisidia to Pamphylia .
44014025	They told the good news to the people in Perga . Then they went to the town of Attalia .
44014026	From there they went in a boat to Antioch . It was there that the people had given them over to Gods care . They had asked him to bless them in this work . Now they had finished the work .
44014027	When they reached the city , they called all the church people together . They told them all that God had done for them . They said , Now God has opened the way to believe for those who are not Jews .
44014028	Paul and Barnabas stayed a long time with the disciples at Antioch .
44015001	Some men came from Judea and taught the Christian brothers . They said , You must be circumcised with the mark made on your body in the way Moses taught us . If you are not circumcised you cannot be saved .
44015002	Paul and Barnabas did not agree with them . There was much talking about it . Then they decided that Paul and Barnabas and some of the other men should go to Jerusalem . They would ask the apostles and church leaders there about it .
44015003	So the church people sent them on their way . They passed through the districts of Phoenicia and Samaria . They told them that some who were not Jews were believing in God . This news made all the Christian brothers very happy .
44015004	When they reached Jerusalem , they were welcomed by the church people , the apostles , and the church leaders . They told all that God had done as he worked with them .
44015005	But some of the believers who belonged to the Pharisee group stood up and said , They must be circumcised [ like the Jews ] . We must tell them to keep all the laws of Moses .
44015006	The apostles and the church leaders met together to talk the matter over .
44015007	After much talking about it , Peter stood up . He said , Men and brothers , you know what happened in the first days . God chose me to tell the good news to those who are not Jews . They believed .
44015008	God knows what is in a persons heart . He proved that they believed . He gave them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us .
44015009	God made no difference between them and us . He made their hearts clean when they believed .
44015010	So now why are you doing what God did not do ? You give the disciples a hard thing to do . Our fathers could not do it . And we cannot do it .
44015011	We believe that the Lord Jesus saves us because he is kind . And that is why he saves them .
44015012	Then all the people stopped talking . They listened to what Paul and Barnabas had to say . They told them about all the signs and wonderful things that God had helped them to do among the people who were not Jews .
44015013	When they had finished talking , James said , Men and brothers , listen to me .
44015014	Simeon has told us how God came the first time to the people who are not Jews . God chose some of them to belong to him and be his people .
44015015	This is what the prophets of God said long ago .
44015016	They said , " After this , I will come back and build up again the house of David which has fallen down . I will take the broken pieces and build a house again .
44015017	Then all the other people will find God , even those who are not Jews but who belong to me . So says the Lord , who is doing all these things . "
44015018	He told us these things long ago .
44015019	So now , this is what I think . We should not trouble those who are not Jews but who have turned to God .
44015020	We should write them a letter and tell them what they must not do . They must not eat food that has been given to idols . They must not have sex with someone who is not their husband or wife . They must not eat the meat of animals that are killed by choking . They must not taste blood .
44015021	Since the times of long ago there have been men who told about Moses in every city . They read his laws in the meeting places every Sabbath day .
44015022	Then the apostles , and the leaders , and all the church people chose men from among themselves . They sent them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas . They chose Judas , whose other name was Barsabbas , and Silas . They were leaders among the Christian brothers .
44015023	They sent a letter with them . It said , The apostles , the church leaders , and the Christian brothers send greetings to the Christians who are not Jews in Antioch , Syria , and Cilicia .
44015024	We have heard that some of our people visited you and talked to you . They taught things that troubled you and made you believe wrong things . They said , " You must be circumcised like the Jews and keep the law . " We did not tell them to teach you this .
44015025	All of us gathered here have chosen some men . We are sending them with our dear brothers , Barnabas and Paul .
44015026	Barnabas and Paul have been willing to die for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ .
44015027	We are sending Judas and Silas . They will tell you the same things that we have written in the letter .
44015028	The Holy Spirit and we thought it was not good to give you a hard thing to do . But here is what you must not do .
44015029	You must not eat food that has been given to idols . You must not eat the meat of animals that are killed by choking . You must not taste blood . You must not commit adultery . If you keep away from these things , you will do well . Goodbye .
44015030	So the men left and went to Antioch . There they called the people together and gave them the letter .
44015031	When the people read the letter , they were very glad . It helped them to become stronger in what they believed .
44015032	Judas and Silas were prophets . They said many things to the Christian brothers and helped them to believe more strongly .
44015033	They stayed there for a while . Then the brothers sent them back to those who had sent them . They sent a greeting of peace with them .
44015034	But Silas thought it was good to stay at Antioch .
44015035	Paul and Barnabas stayed there too . They taught the people and told them the Lords message . Many other men did this also .
44015036	Some days later , Paul said to Barnabas , Let us go back and visit the brothers in every city where we have told the Lords message . Let us see how they are doing .
44015037	Barnabas wanted to take John Mark with them .
44015038	But Paul did not think that they should take him . John Mark had left them when they were at Pamphylia . He had not gone along with them to do the work .
44015039	The feeling about this matter was very strong between Barnabas and Paul , so they did not go together . Barnabas took Mark and went in a boat to Cyprus .
44015040	Paul chose Silas . The Christian brothers asked the Lord to bless Paul . Then he went on his way .
44015041	Paul travelled through Syria and Cilicia . He helped the church people to believe more strongly .
44016001	Then he came to Derbe and Lystra . A disciple named Timothy was there . His mother was a Jew , a believer , and his father was a Greek .
44016002	The Christian brothers at Lystra and Iconium spoke very well of Timothy .
44016003	Paul wanted him to go with him . He circumcised him because all the Jews in those places knew that his father was a Greek .
44016004	They went from town to town and talked to the people . They told them what the apostles and church leaders at Jerusalem had said should be done . So the church people became stronger in what they believed . Every day more people joined the church .
44016005	missing fehlt/missing
44016006	Paul and Silas went through the district of Phrygia and Galatia . The Holy Spirit said they should not tell Gods word in the country of Asia Minor .
44016007	After they came to the district of Mysia , they wanted to go to the country of Bithynia but the Holy Spirit did not allow them .
44016008	So they went by Mysia and came to the city of Troas .
44016009	In the night Paul had a vision : he saw a picture like a dream . He saw a man of Macedonia standing and calling to him , Come over into Macedonia and help us .
44016010	After Paul had seen the vision , we tried to leave for Macedonia right away . We believed that the Lord had called us to tell the people there the good news .
44016011	So we left Troas in a boat and went straight across the water to the town of Samothrace . The next day we went to Neapolis .
44016012	From there we went to Philippi . This was the big city of the district of Macedonia . It was a free city . We stayed there for some time .
44016013	On the Sabbath day we went out of the city to the river . We thought this was a place where people met to talk with God . So we sat down and talked to the women who had come there .
44016014	One woman named Lydia listened to us . She was from the city of Thyatira , and she sold red cloth . She worshipped God . He worked in her heart and she believed what Paul said .
44016015	She and all the people in her house were baptised . Then she begged us and said , If you really feel that I believe in the Lord , come and stay at my house . And she would not allow us to say no .
44016016	One day we were going to the meeting place where people talked with God . We met a girl who had a bad spirit . She used to tell people what was going to happen . Her masters received much money when she did this .
44016017	This girl kept on following Paul and us . She was shouting , These men are servants of the High God . They are telling us how to be saved .
44016018	She did this for many days . This troubled Paul . He turned and said to the spirit in her , In the name of Jesus Christ , I say to you , come out of her ! And the spirit came out at once .
44016019	Her masters saw that they had lost this way of getting money . They caught Paul and Silas and took them by force to the rulers in the court .
44016020	When they had brought them before the judges , they said , These men are Jews . And they are making much trouble in our city .
44016021	They are teaching people laws which we may not obey because we are Roman people .
44016022	All the people standing around were against Paul and Silas . The judges tore off the clothes of Paul and Silas . They gave orders that they should be beaten .
44016023	They beat them very hard . Then they put them in prison . Take care , they said to the prison guard . Be sure that these prisoners do not run away .
44016024	And so the guard put them in the back room in the prison . They locked their feet in holes cut in heavy pieces of wood .
44016025	At midnight , Paul and Silas were talking with God . They were singing and praising God . The other prisoners were listening to them .
44016026	Then all of a sudden the earth shook very much . Even the floor of the prison was shaking . All the doors came wide open . The things that held the prisoners all came off .
44016027	The prison guard woke up . He saw all the prison doors open . So he took a long knife and was going to kill himself . He thought that all the prisoners had run away .
44016028	Paul shouted , Stop ! Do not hurt yourself . We are all here !
44016029	The guard called for a light and went in quickly . He kneeled down before Paul and Silas , trembling with fear .
44016030	He brought them out of the prison and said , Sirs , what must I do to be saved ?
44016031	They replied , Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved . All the people in your house must do the same .
44016032	They talked to him and all the people in the house . They told them the word of the Lord .
44016033	Paul and Silas had sores from the beating in prison . So that same hour of the night the guard washed them . Then he and all the people of his house were baptised .
44016034	He took Paul and Silas to his home and gave them food to eat . He and all the people in his house were very happy . They now believed in God .
44016035	In the morning the judges sent soldiers to the guard with a message . Let those men go free , they said .
44016036	The guard told Paul . He said , The judges have sent a message that you may go free . So now , come out and go on your way . You will have no more trouble .
44016037	But Paul said , We are Romans . And they have beaten us outside where people can see . They have put us in prison without proving we have done wrong . Now , are they going to take us out of prison secretly ? No , they themselves must come and take us out .
44016038	The soldiers told this to the judges . They were very much afraid when they heard that Paul and Silas were Romans .
44016039	So they came to Paul and Silas . They said they were sorry for what they had done . They brought them out of prison and asked them to leave the city .
44016040	When Paul and Silas came out of prison , they went back to Lydias house . They saw their Christian brothers and talked to them . This helped the Christians to believe more strongly . Then Paul and Silas went on their way .
44017001	Paul and Silas went through the cities of Amphipolis and Apollonia . Then they reached the town of Thessalonica . Here the Jews had a meeting place .
44017002	As he had done in other places , Paul went into it . On three Sabbath days he explained what was written in the holy writings .
44017003	He proved these things from the writings . He said . It was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise again from death . And this Jesus , whom I am talking about , is the Christ .
44017004	Some of the people believed him and they followed Paul and Silas . Some of them were Greek people who worshipped God . And some were leading women .
44017005	But some Jews did not believe , and they were jealous . So they called some of the bad men together and made a crowd . They started to fight and to make plenty of trouble and noise in the city . At Jasons house they went in by force to find Paul and Silas . They wanted to bring them outside to the people .
44017006	But they did not find them . So they took Jason and some of the Christian brothers to the rulers of the city . They shouted , These men have turned the world upside down . Now they have come here also .
44017007	Jason has taken them into his house . None of them obeys the laws of Caesar . They say there is another king named Jesus .
44017008	All the people and the rulers of the city became angry when they heard this .
44017009	They made Jason and the other Christians pay much money . Then they let them go .
44017010	That night the Christian brothers sent Paul and Silas to the town of Berea . When they reached there , they went into the Jews meeting place .
44017011	The people in Berea were better than the people of Thessalonica . They were glad to listen to Pauls words . Every day they studied the holy writings to see if what Paul said was right .
44017012	Through this , many of them believed . Some of the leading women of the Greek people and some of the men also believed .
44017013	The leaders of the Jews in Thessalonica heard that Paul told the word of God to the people at Berea . They came to Berea and talked to the people . They said things that made the people very angry against Paul .
44017014	The Christian brothers sent Paul to the seaside right away . But Silas and Timothy stayed on at Berea .
44017015	The men took Paul to the city of Athens . Paul told them to tell Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as they could .
44017016	Paul was waiting for Silas and Timothy at Athens . He saw that the city was full of idols . His spirit was troubled about this .
44017017	In the meeting place he talked with the Jews and those who believed in the true God . In the market every day , he talked to people he met there .
44017018	There were some wise men who believed the teachings of Epicurius . They believed the teaching of other wise men called Stoics . Some of them began to talk with Paul . And some said , What does this talker have to say ? Others said , He seems to be talking about new gods . This was because he was telling them about Jesus and how he was raised from death .
44017019	So they took Paul and brought him to a meeting at the hill called Areopagus . They said , We want to know what this new teaching is that you are talking about .
44017020	You are telling us things we never heard before . We want to understand them .
44017021	All the people of Athens and the strangers who lived there passed their time in one way . They liked to tell and to hear some new thing .
44017022	Then Paul stood up in the court and said , You men of Athens , I see that you are very religious and worship many gods .
44017023	As I walked about , I looked at the things you worship . I saw one place where you make sacrifices . You have written on it , " To the God we do not know . " You are worshipping that God , but you do not know him . I will tell you about him .
44017024	He made the world and everything in it . He is the Lord of the sky and the earth . He does not live in houses that people make with their hands .
44017025	Men cannot worship him by things they make with their hands because he does not need anything . He is the one who gives life and breath and everything else to all people .
44017026	God made one man . From that one man he has made all the nations of men to live on the whole earth . He has given to each nation a certain time and a certain place to live .
44017027	He did this so they would look for him . He wanted them to reach out and find him . But he is not far from each one of us .
44017028	In him we live , and move , and are alive . Some of your own writers have said , " We have come from him " .
44017029	Therefore we have all come from God . So we should not think that God is something made of gold , or silver , or stone . He is not made by mens hands .
44017030	In times past God did not look at what people did . They did not know any better then . But now he is calling all people to stop doing those things .
44017031	God has set a day when he will judge the whole world in the right way . He has chosen a man to do this . He has proved to all people who the man is . He has raised him from death .
44017032	When the people of Athens heard that someone had been raised from death , some of them laughed . Others said , We want to hear you talk about this matter again some time .
44017033	So then Paul left them .
44017034	But some men followed him and believed . Among those who believed was Dionysius . He was a judge in the Areopagus court . And a woman named Damaris believed . There were others also .
44018001	After this Paul left Athens and went to the city of Corinth .
44018002	There he met a Jew named Aquila , born in Pontus . A short time before this he and his wife Priscilla had come from the country of Italy . They left Italy because Claudius the ruler had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome . This was the big city in Italy . Paul went to the house of Aquila and Priscilla .
44018003	Pauls work had been the making of tents , and that is what they did . So he stayed with them . They worked together .
44018004	Every Sabbath day he talked with the people in the meeting place for the Jews . He tried to talk so that the Jews and the Greeks would believe .
44018005	When Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia , Paul felt in his heart that he must prove to the Jews that Jesus is the Christ .
44018006	But the people talked back to Paul . And they said wrong things about him . Paul shook his clothes and said to them , If you are lost , it is your own fault , not mine ! From now on I will go to those who are not Jews .
44018007	So he left . He went to the house of a man named Justus who worshipped God . His house was next to the meeting place .
44018008	Crispus was the head ruler of the meeting house . He and his whole family believed in the Lord . Many of the people in Corinth heard and believed . And they were baptised .
44018009	The Lord said to Paul in a vision in the night , Do not fear . Keep on speaking . Do not stop .
44018010	I am with you . nobody will hurt you . I have many people in this city .
44018011	So Paul stayed there for one year and six months . He taught the people Gods word .
44018012	When Gallio was the ruler of the province of Achaia , the Jews got together to stop Paul . They took him to court .
44018013	They said , This man is talking to the people . He is trying to make them worship God in a way that is against our law .
44018014	Paul wanted to speak . Then Gallio said to the Jews , You Jews , if it were a matter of wrong or of doing something very bad , I would listen to you .
44018015	But this is a matter about words and names and about your own law . So you must go and take care of it yourselves ! I will not judge such things .
44018016	And he drove them out of the court .
44018017	They caught a man . His name was Sosthenes . He was the head ruler of the meeting house . They beat him in front of the judge , but Gallio did nothing about it .
44018018	Paul stayed there for many days . Then he said goodbye to the Christian brothers and went in a boat to the country of Syria . Priscilla and Aquila went with him . In the town of Cenchrea he cut his hair off . This was because he had made a promise to God .
44018019	When they reached the city of Ephesus , Paul left the others there . He himself went to the meeting place and talked with the Jews .
44018020	The Jews begged him to stay longer but he would not stay .
44018021	Goodbye , he said . I will come back to you again if it is Gods will . Then he got in a boat and left Ephesus .
44018022	When he reached Caesarea , he went to greet the church people . Then he went on to Antioch .
44018023	He stayed there for a while . Then he left and went through all the countries of Galatia and Phrygia . He helped the disciples to believe more strongly .
44018024	A Jew came to Ephesus . His name was Apollos . He was born in Alexandria . He spoke with power and was able to explain the holy writings well .
44018025	This man had been taught the way of the Lord . He was strong in spirit as he talked to people . What he taught them about the Lord was true . But he knew only about the baptism of John .
44018026	He began to speak without fear in the meeting place . When Aquila and Priscilla heard him , they took him to their house . They explained the way of God so that he knew more about it .
44018027	Apollos decided to go into Achaia . The Christian brothers wrote to the disciples there and asked them to receive him . When he reached Achaia , he helped very much those who believed . They believed because God was kind to them .
44018028	He talked strongly with the Jews before the people . He proved to them from the holy writings that Jesus is the Christ .
44019001	While Apollos was at Corinth , Paul went over land and came to the city of Ephesus . There he met some disciples .
44019002	Paul asked them , Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed ? They said , No . We have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit .
44019003	Paul asked them , How were you baptised ? They said , We were baptised in Johns way .
44019004	Then Paul said , John baptised people when they stopped their wrong ways . He told people that they should believe on the one who would follow him . That one is Jesus .
44019005	When they heard this , they were baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus .
44019006	Paul put his hands on them . Then the Holy Spirit came on them and they spoke in tongues of other languages and spoke words from God .
44019007	In all , there were about twelve men .
44019008	Paul went into the meeting place . For three months he talked without fear to the people there . He tried to talk so that people would obey God .
44019009	Some of them were fixed in their minds and would not believe . They said , The Christian way is not good They said this in front of all the people . So Paul left them and took the disciples away . He talked and answered the questions of the people every day in the school of a man named Tyrannus .
44019010	This went on for two years , and all the people who lived in the province of Asia , both the Jews and the Greeks , heard the Lords word .
44019011	God did big works through Paul . Even some pieces of cloth he had touched were carried to sick people and they were healed . Also , people who had bad spirits in them were made free .
44019012	missing fehlt/missing
44019013	Some Jews were there who travelled about from place to place . They had power over bad spirits like witch-doctors . They tried to make people free from bad spirits by using the name of the Lord Jesus . They said to the spirits , I tell you , in the name of Jesus , the one Paul talks about , come out !
44019014	There was a Jew named Sceva . He was a chief priest . He had seven sons who did this .
44019015	But the bad spirit answered , I know Jesus and I know Paul . But who are you ?
44019016	And the man who had the bad spirit in him jumped on them . He beat them all because he was stronger than they were . Their bodies were bleeding and their clothes were torn . They ran out of the house .
44019017	When all the Jews and the Greeks at Ephesus knew about this , they all feared . And they had great respect for the name of the Lord Jesus .
44019018	Many of the people who believed , told God all the bad things they used to do .
44019019	Many had been witch-doctors . They brought their books and burned them in front of all the people . All the books together had cost about 50,000 silver coins .
44019020	Gods word spread with power . It reached more and more people .
44019021	After this , Paul decided he would go through Macedonia and Achaia and then to Jerusalem . After I have been there , he said , I must go to see the city of Rome also .
44019022	He sent Timothy and Erastus , two of his helpers , into Macedonia . But he himself stayed in Asia Minor for a while .
44019023	About that time there was much trouble because of the Christian way .
44019024	A man named Demetrius made things from silver . He made little silver houses like the big house of the idol-god Diana . He and other men got much money from this work .
44019025	Demetrius called them all together . He said , Men , you know that we get our money from this work .
44019026	Now you see and hear how this man Paul has talked . He has turned away many people in Ephesus . Not only that , but he has turned away the hearts of many people in almost all of Asia Minor . He says that things made by mens hands are not really gods .
44019027	This will spoil our work . Not only that , but people will not respect the house of the great idol goddess Diana any more . All the people in Asia and in the whole world worship her now . But they will despise her !
44019028	When they heard this , the men were very angry and shouted , Great is Diana of Ephesus !
44019029	All the people in the city were excited . They caught two men from Macedonia . Their names were Gaius and Aristarchus . They had travelled with Paul . Then they all rushed to the big meeting place with them .
44019030	Paul wanted to go in and talk to the people , but the disciples would not let him .
44019031	Some of the leaders in Asia Minor liked Paul . They sent word to him and begged him not to go into the meeting place .
44019032	Some of the people were shouting one thing and some another . They were all stirred up . Most of the people did not know why they had come together .
44019033	The Jews pushed Alexander forward . Some of the people put him in front . He put up his hand and wanted to talk to the people .
44019034	But when they saw that he was a Jew , they all shouted together for two hours , Great is Diana of Ephesus !
44019035	At last the city chief stopped the shouting . He said , Men of Ephesus , everyone knows that all the people of Ephesus take care of the house of the great Diana . And they take care of the stone which fell from the sky .
44019036	No person can say it is not true . So you should be quiet and not do anything foolish .
44019037	The men whom you have brought here have not taken anything from the house . They have not even said anything wrong about our goddess .
44019038	Now then , if Demetrius and the men who work with him have any complaint , let them take it to law . We have a court and we have judges .
44019039	If you want anything more than that , it must be done in a meeting which has been called by law .
44019040	We may have trouble because of what has happened today . There is not one good reason for it .
44019041	When he had said this , he closed the meeting .
44020001	When everything was quiet , Paul called the disciples . He talked to them so they would not be afraid . Then he said goodbye and left . He went to Macedonia .
44020002	He went through that country and talked to the people . He helped them to believe more strongly . Then he went to Greece .
44020003	He stayed there for three months . When he was ready to go to Syria by boat , he heard that the Jewish leaders were planning to catch him . So he said , I will go back through Macedonia .
44020004	Some men went with him as far as Asia Minor . They were Sopater from Berea , Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica , Gaius from Derbe , and Timothy , and also Tychicus and Trophimus from Asia Minor .
44020005	These went on ahead and waited for us at Troas .
44020006	After the days of the Passover Feast , we left Philippi by boat . Five days later we met them in Troas . We stayed there for seven days .
44020007	On the first day of the week the disciples met together to break bread . Paul was ready to leave the next day . He talked a long time to the people at the meeting until long into the night . They were gathered in an upstairs room with many lights .
44020009	A young man named Eutychus sat in the window . He became very sleepy . When Paul kept talking so long , Eutychus was very deep in sleep and fell down from the third floor . When the people picked him up he was dead .
44020010	Paul went down stairs . He lay on him and put his arms around him . Do not fear , he said . He is alive .
44020011	Then Paul went upstairs again . He broke bread and ate some food . He talked for a long time , until daybreak . After that , he left .
44020012	The people took the young man . They were very glad because he was alive .
44020013	We went by boat to the town of Assos . We were going to meet Paul there and take him on the boat . He told us to do that because he wanted to walk .
44020014	We met him at Assos , took him on the boat , and went to Mitylene .
44020015	Then we went by boat the next day and came to Chios . The next day we passed the town of Samos . We reached Miletus on the third day .
44020016	Paul decided not to stop at Ephesus . He did not want to spend time in Asia Minor . He kept going as fast as he could , because he hoped to be at the feast in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost .
44020017	He sent a message from Miletus to Ephesus to call the leaders of the church to come to him .
44020018	When they came , he said , You know how I have lived all the time that I have been with you . I lived that way from the first day I came into Asia .
44020019	You know how I have served the Lord without being proud . And I have even cried for you . I served the Lord when I had troubles and when the leaders of the Jews tried to catch me .
44020020	I have not feared to tell you everything that would help you . I have taught you in meetings and in your homes .
44020021	I have told both the Jews and the Greeks to stop doing wrong things . I have told them to believe in our Lord Jesus Christ .
44020022	And now I feel in my spirit that I must go to Jerusalem . I do not know what will happen to me there .
44020023	But in every city the Holy Spirit tells me I will be put in prison . I will have much trouble .
44020024	But none of these things trouble me . I do not try to save my life . All I want is to finish what I must do with joy . The work which the Lord Jesus gave me is to tell the good news that God is kind .
44020025	I know that you all will never see me again . I have told you about Gods kingdom .
44020026	So I tell you today that if any one is lost , it is not my fault .
44020027	I have not feared to tell you all that God wants you to know .
44020028	The Holy Spirit has made you leaders over his people . Watch yourselves . Like one who takes care of his sheep , so you must take care of the church people . They are the Lords people . He gave his blood for them .
44020029	I know this , that there are people as bad as wild animals . After I leave you , they will come to you . They will trouble Gods people .
44020030	Also , some men will come from among you . They will teach things that are not true . They want people to follow them .
44020031	So then , watch and remember this . For three years , through the night and in the day , I told every one of you to be careful . I even cried as I told you .
44020032	And now , my brothers , I give you to God . I leave with you his word which brings blessing . That word is able to make you strong . It will give you your share in the good things of God promised by him . He gives these good things to people who are pure and holy .
44020033	I did not want anyone to give me money or clothes .
44020034	You yourselves know that I worked with my own hands to pay for the things that I and my friends needed .
44020035	I have always shown you that you must work hard , as I have . You must help those who cannot work . By so doing you are remembering the words of the Lord Jesus . He said , " It makes you more happy to give something than to get something . "
44020036	When Paul had said this , he kneeled down and talked to God with them all .
44020037	They all cried much . They put their arms around his neck and kissed him .
44020038	They were sad most of all because he had said they would not see him again . And they went with him to the boat .
44021001	When we had said goodbye to them , we left them . We went straight across the water to the island of Cos . The next day we came to the island of Rhodes . Then we went to the city of Patara .
44021002	There we found a boat going to the country of Phoenicia , so we went there .
44021003	When we saw the island of Cyprus , we went on the right side of it to Syria . We landed at Tyre because they unloaded the boat there .
44021004	We found some Christians and stayed for seven days . The Holy Spirit spoke through them to Paul , Do not go on to Jerusalem .
44021005	When the seven days had passed , we left and went on our way . All of the men , women , and children went with us out of the city . There by the sea we kneeled down and talked to God .
44021006	We said goodbye to each other . Then we got on the boat and they went back to their homes .
44021007	From Tyre we went to Ptolemais . There we greeted the Christian brothers and stayed with them one day .
44021008	The next day we left and came to Caesarea . We went into the house of Philip . He was a man who went out telling the good news . He was one of the seven helpers in the church .
44021009	He had four daughters who spoke words from God . They were not married .
44021010	While we were staying there for some days , a prophet named Agabus came from Judea .
44021011	When he came to us , he took Pauls belt . He tied his own hands and feet with it . Then he said , The Holy Spirit has told me that in the same way the leaders of the Jews in Jerusalem will tie the man who owns this belt . They will give him over to the people who are not Jews .
44021012	When we heard this , both we and the people there talked to Paul and begged him not to go to Jerusalem .
44021013	Then Paul answered , Why are you crying and making me sad like this ? I am ready to be tied and also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus .
44021014	So when we saw that he would not change his mind , we stopped begging him . We said , May the Lord do what he wants to be done .
44021015	After that , we took our things and went to Jerusalem .
44021016	Some of the Christians from Caesarea went with us . One of them was Mnason , a man born in Cyprus . He was one of the first Christian believers . We stayed in his house .
44021017	When we reached Jerusalem , the Christian brothers were glad to see us .
44021018	The next day Paul went with us to see James . All the church leaders were there .
44021019	First , Paul greeted them . Then he told them one by one the things God had done as he worked among the people who were not Jews .
44021020	When they heard it , they praised the Lord . They said to Paul , Brother , there are many thousands of Jews who believe . They all say we must obey the law of Moses .
44021021	They have heard that you teach all the Jews who live in other lands . They heard that you tell them not to obey Moses law : that they need not circumcise their children like the Jews do; and they can leave the Jewish ways of living .
44021022	What should we do about it ? Many people will gather together because they will surely hear that you have come .
44021023	Now then , do the thing we tell you . We have four men who have made a promise .
44021024	Take them with you . Make yourself clean with them , the way the law says to do . Pay the cost for having their hair cut . Then all the people will know that all the things they heard about you are not true . They will know that you live the way the law says you should live .
44021025	We sent a letter to those who are not Jews and have believed . Here is what we told them they must not do . They must not touch things that have been given to idols . They must not taste blood . They must not eat the meat of animals that were killed by choking . And they must not take part in any kind of wrong sexual behaviour between men and women .
44021026	Then Paul took the men with him . The next day he made himself clean with them the way the law says to do . Then he went into the temple . He told the priests which day they would finish making themselves clean . On that day a sacrifice would be made for each one of them .
44021027	The seven days were almost over . The Jewish leaders from Asia Minor saw Paul in the temple . They got all the people there excited . They caught hold of him .
44021028	They shouted , All you men of Israel , come and help us ! This is the man who teaches everyone everywhere not to respect our people . He says we need not obey the law or respect this temple . And what is more , he has brought Greek people into the temple . He has made this holy place unclean .
44021029	They said this because they had seen a man from Ephesus named Trophimus . He was in the city with Paul . And they thought that Paul had brought him into the temple .
44021030	So all the people in the city were excited . They came running . They caught Paul and took him out of the temple by force . Then the doors were shut behind them .
44021031	They were trying to kill him . The officer in charge of the soldiers heard that all the people of Jerusalem were making trouble .
44021032	Right away he took some soldiers and officers with him and ran down to the people . When the people saw them they stopped beating Paul .
44021033	Then the officer came up and took Paul . He had him tied with two chains . Then he asked who he was and what he had done .
44021034	Some of the crowd shouted one thing and some of them shouted something else . The captain could not find out what was true . The people were shouting too much . So he told his soldiers to take Paul into their army house .
44021035	When Paul came to the steps , the soldiers carried him because the people were fighting to get him .
44021036	They were all following , shouting , Kill him !
44021037	Just as the soldiers were going to take Paul into their army house , he said to the officer , May I tell you something ? So , you speak the Greek language ! said the officer . I thought you were the man from the country of Egypt who made trouble a while ago . I thought you were the one who led four thousand bad men into the desert .
44021039	Paul said , I am a Jew . I was born in the city of Tarsus in Cilicia . I belong to a great city . Please let me talk to these people .
44021040	So the officer let him talk . Paul stood on the steps and put up his hand . Then all the people were very quiet . He talked to them in the Jews language .
44022001	Paul said , Men , brothers , and fathers , listen while I tell you my side of this matter .
44022002	When the people heard him speak in the Jews language , they were even more quiet . Then Paul said , I am a Jew . I was born in the city of Tarsus in Cilicia . But I was raised here in this city . Gamaliel was my teacher . He taught me very well in the law of our fathers . I was trying hard to obey God , just as you all are today .
44022004	I troubled very much the people who believed this Way . I even killed them . I had men and women tied and put into prison .
44022005	The high priest and all the leaders know that this is true about me . They wrote letters for me to carry to the leaders of the Jews in the city of Damascus . I went to have the Christians there tied and brought to Jerusalem to be punished .
44022006	I was on my way and was near Damascus . It was about midday . All at once a very bright light from the sky shone all around me .
44022007	I fell to the ground and heard someone say to me , " Saul , Saul , why are you troubling me ? "
44022008	I said , " Who are you , Lord ? " He answered , " I am Jesus of Nazareth . You are troubling me . "
44022009	The men who were with me saw the light . They were afraid . But they did not hear the one who spoke to me .
44022010	Then I said , " Lord , what shall I do ? " And the Lord said to me , " Get up and go to Damascus . There someone will tell you all you must do . "
44022011	I could not see because the light was so bright . My friends led me by the hand to Damascus .
44022012	A man named Ananias was there . He obeyed the law of Moses , and all the Jews who lived there spoke well of him .
44022013	He came to see me . He stood by my side and said to me , " Brother Saul , you can see again ! " And right then I was able to see him .
44022014	He said , " The God of our fathers has chosen you to know his will . He chose you to see the One who is right and to hear him speak .
44022015	You will speak for him . You will tell all the people what you have seen and heard .
44022016	Now , why do you wait ? Get up and be baptised . Wash away your wrong ways by calling on the name of the Lord ! "
44022017	After I went back to Jerusalem , I was talking to God in the temple one day . Something like a dream came over me .
44022018	I heard the Lord say to me , " Leave Jerusalem quickly , right away . The people will not listen to the things you say about me . "
44022019	And I said , " Lord , they know that I put in prison those who believed in you . I beat them in all the meeting houses .
44022020	And I stood by and let people kill Stephen . He was one who talked for you . I looked after the clothes of the men who killed him . "
44022021	But the Lord said to me , " Go ! I will send you far away to the people who are not Jews . "
44022022	The people listened to Paul until he said that . Then they shouted , Kill him and get him off the earth . A man like that should not live !
44022023	The people shouted . They waved their clothes about and threw dust in the air .
44022024	The man in charge of the soldiers ordered Paul to be brought into the army house . He said that he should be beaten hard to make him tell why the people shouted so much at him .
44022025	When they had tied him with ropes , Paul said to the captain who was standing by , Is it right for you to beat a man who belongs to Rome without judging his case ?
44022026	When the captain heard this , he told the commanding officer . He said , What are you going to do ? This man is a Roman !
44022027	Then the commanding officer came to Paul and said , Tell me , are you a Roman ? Yes , I am , replied Paul .
44022028	Then the officer said , I paid much money to become a Roman . Paul said , I was born a Roman .
44022029	Then the men who were going to beat him left him . The officer was afraid when he knew Paul was a Roman , because he had tied him up .
44022030	The officer wanted to know the real reason why the Jewish leaders were angry with Paul . So the next day he had Paul untied . He called the chief priests and the leaders to hold a court meeting . Then he took Paul down and brought him in before them .
44023001	Paul looked at the members of the court and said , My brothers , I have done what I thought God wanted me to do , right up to this day .
44023002	Ananias , the high priest , said to those who were standing near Paul , Hit his mouth !
44023003	Paul said , God will hit you down , you dirty wall painted white ! You sit there to judge me by the law and you break the law by telling them to hit me .
44023004	The people who stood near Paul said , Do you say a wrong thing like that to Gods high priest ?
44023005	Paul said , I did not know that he is a high priest . The holy writings say , " You shall not say anything wrong about a ruler of your people . "
44023006	Paul knew that some of the men were from the Sadducee group and some of them were from the Pharisee group . So he called out in the court , My brothers , I am a Pharisee . My fathers were Pharisees . I am being judged because I believe that the dead will be raised to life again .
44023007	When he had said that , the Pharisees and the Sadducees began to talk back and forth . The men in the court were divided .
44023008	The Sadducees say the dead will not be raised again . They say there is no angel or spirit . But the Pharisees believe in all these three things .
44023009	There was much shouting . Some of the clever men who were Pharisees got up . They said , We do not think this man has done wrong . Perhaps some angel or spirit really did speak to him .
44023010	The people started fighting . The commanding officer was afraid they would tear Paul into pieces . So he told the soldiers to take Paul and bring him into the army house .
44023011	The next night the Lord stood beside Paul . He said , Be glad , Paul . You have told people about me in Jerusalem . You must also talk about me in Rome .
44023012	In the morning , some of the Jewish leaders planned together . They made a promise that they would not eat or drink until they had killed Paul .
44023013	There were more than forty Jews who made this secret plan together .
44023014	They came to the chief priests and leaders and said , We have made a promise for ourselves . We will not eat anything until we have killed Paul .
44023015	So now , you and the members of the court send word to the commanding officer . Tell him to bring Paul down to you . Make him think you want to find out more about Paul . We will be ready to kill him before he gets there .
44023016	The son of Pauls sister heard about their secret plan . So he went into the army house and told Paul .
44023017	Paul called one of the officers and said to him , Take this young man to the commanding officer . He has something to tell him !
44023018	So the officer took him to the commanding officer . He said , Paul , the prisoner , called me . He asked me to bring this young man to you because he has something to tell you .
44023019	The officer took the young man by the arm . He went to one side so they could be alone . He asked , What do you want to tell me ?
44023020	The young man said , The leaders of the Jews have made a plan . They will ask you to bring Paul down to court tomorrow . They will say that they wish to find out more about him .
44023021	But you must not do this . More than forty Jews are waiting for him . They have made a promise to themselves . They will not eat or drink until they have killed him . They are ready now and waiting for your agreement .
44023022	So the commanding officer sent the young man away . He said , You must not tell anyone that you have told me about these things .
44023023	The commanding officer called two officers to him . He said , Get two hundred soldiers ready by nine oclock tonight to go to Caesarea . Send seventy men with them who will ride on horses and two hundred men who will carry spears .
44023024	Also have horses ready for Paul to ride . Take him safely to Felix , the ruler .
44023025	The officer wrote a letter to Felix like this :
44023026	Claudius Lysias sends greetings to you , great ruler Felix .
44023027	This man was caught by the Jews . They were ready to kill him . But I came with my soldiers and took him away , because I found out that he is a Roman .
44023028	I wanted to find out what complaint they had against him , so I brought him into their court .
44023029	I found out that their complaints were to do with their law . But he had not done anything wrong enough to die or to be put into prison .
44023030	When I heard that the Jewish leaders were planning to catch him , I sent him to you at once . I told those who are making complaints against him that they must bring the matter to you .
44023031	So the soldiers took Paul as they had been told to do . They went with him that night as far as the town of Antipatris .
44023032	The next day the soldiers went back to the barracks . Only the men who were riding horses went with Paul .
44023033	When they reached Caesarea , they gave the letter to the ruler and brought Paul to him .
44023034	He read the letter . Then he asked Paul what country he came from . He heard that Paul was from Cilicia . Then he said , I will hear all you have to say when the men who have made the complaint come here . He ordered Paul to be kept in the house which is called Herods palace .
44023035	missing fehlt/missing
44024001	Five days later , Ananias the high priest came from Jerusalem . He brought with him some of the leaders and a lawyer named Tertullus . They told the ruler their complaint against Paul .
44024002	Paul was called in . Tertullus began to bring the complaints . Great ruler Felix , he said , we have peace because of what you have done . These people have a better life because of you .
44024003	We are always very glad for this everywhere we go .
44024004	I do not want to take much of your time . But please be kind and listen to a few words from us .
44024005	We have found this man to be a real trouble-maker . He talks to the Jews all over the world and causes them to disobey the laws . He is the leading trouble-maker of the Nazarene group .
44024006	He even tried to make the temple unclean . But we caught him and were going to judge him by our law .
44024007	But Lysias the commanding officer came . He took Paul away from us by force .
44024008	He told those who have complaints against him to come to you . Ask him yourself and you will find out from him about all these complaints we have brought against him .
44024009	The Jews agreed with what Tertullus the lawyer said . They said , Yes , yes , he is telling the truth .
44024010	The ruler made a sign for Paul to speak . So Paul said , I know that for many years you have judged matters for this people .
44024011	So I am happy to speak for myself . Not more than twelve days ago I went to Jerusalem to worship . If you ask the people , you will find this out .
44024012	They did not find me quarrelling with anyone in the temple . I was not making trouble among the people in the meeting houses or in the city .
44024013	They cannot prove the things they have said against me here .
44024014	But I myself tell you this . I worship the God of my fathers in the Christian way . They say this is not the right way . I believe everything that the law teaches . I believe everything that the prophets have written .
44024015	I believe that God will raise from death both the good people and the bad people . These people here believe the same thing .
44024016	I always try to do what is right to God and to men .
44024017	I was away for a few years and I had come to Jerusalem to bring gifts to my people , and to give offerings .
44024018	While I was doing this , they found me in the temple . I had made myself clean the way the law says to do . I did not have many people around me . I was not making trouble .
44024019	Some Jews were there from Asia Minor . They should be here before you and talk against me if they have anything to say .
44024020	Or let these men here tell if they found anything wrong with me when I stood in their court .
44024021	I did this one thing . I shouted while I was standing among them , " I am being judged today because I believe that the dead will be raised again . "
44024022	Felix sent them away because he knew many things about the Christian way . He said , When Lysias , the commanding officer , comes down , I will know everything about this matter .
44024023	He said to the officer , Keep Paul in prison but let him have some freedom . Let his friends come to visit him and to do things for him .
44024024	Some days after that , Felix came with his wife Drusilla . She was a Jewess . He sent for Paul and listened to what Paul said about believing in Christ Jesus .
44024025	Paul talked about what is right , about living the right way , and about the time when all people will be judged . Felix was very much afraid when he heard these things . He said to Paul , You may go now . When I have time , I will call you again .
44024026	He hoped that Paul would give him money to free him . And so he often sent for Paul and talked with him .
44024027	After two years , a man named Porcius Festus came to rule in Felixs place . Felix had wanted to please the Jewish leaders , so he left Paul in prison .
44025001	Three days after Festus came to the country , he went to Jerusalem from Caesarea .
44025002	Then the chief priests and the leaders of the Jews told him what they had against Paul .
44025003	Please do something for us , they begged . Send for Paul to come to Jerusalem . They had made a secret plan to kill him on the road .
44025004	Festus said , Paul is being kept in prison in Caesarea . I myself am going there soon .
44025005	Let the men among you who are able come with me . If Paul has done anything wrong , then they can talk against him .
44025006	Festus stayed only eight or ten days more among them . Then he went to Caesarea . The next day he sat on his chair in the court and had Paul brought in .
44025007	When Paul came in , the Jewish leaders who had come from Jerusalem stood around Paul . They talked much against him . But they could not prove that the things they said were true .
44025008	Paul spoke for himself . He said , I have done no wrong to the law , or to the temple , or against Caesar the ruler of the Romans .
44025009	Festus wanted to please the Jewish leaders , so he said to Paul , Will you go to Jerusalem and let me judge you there about these things ?
44025010	Paul said , I am standing in Caesars court . That is where I should be judged . I have done nothing wrong to the Jews . You yourself know that well .
44025011	If I have done wrong things , or any wrong thing for which I should die , then I do not ask to live . But if the things these people say are not true , then no one has power to give me up to the leaders of the Jews . I ask to go to Caesar .
44025012	So Festus talked the matter over with the court . Then he said to Paul , You have asked to go to Caesar . All right , you will go to Caesar !
44025013	Some time after that , king Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to greet Festus .
44025014	They stayed for many days . Festus brought Pauls matter to the king . He said , Felix left a man in prison here .
44025015	When I was in Jerusalem , the chief priest and leaders of the Jews came to me . They talked against him , and they asked me to punish him .
44025016	I told them that the Romans do not do it that way . They do not punish a man until he has met those who talk against him . Then he has a chance to speak for himself .
44025017	So they came here with me . I did not wait . The very next day I sat on my chair in the court and had the man brought in .
44025018	When they stood up , they did not say the wrong things against him that I thought they would .
44025019	But instead , they had a quarrel with him about the things they believe in . The quarrel is about a man named Jesus who died . Paul said he is alive .
44025020	I did not know how to judge such things . So I asked if he would go to Jerusalem and be judged there about these matters .
44025021	But Paul asked to wait and let Caesar judge his case . So I had him put in prison to be kept there until I can send him to Caesar .
44025022	Agrippa said to Festus , I should like to hear the man myself . Festus said , Tomorrow you shall hear him .
44025023	So the next day Agrippa and Bernice came , making a big show of themselves . They went into the room to hear Paul talk . Officers and the leading men of the city also went in . When Festus called for Paul , he was brought in .
44025024	Then Festus said , King Agrippa and all you men here with us , you see this man . All the Jewish leaders , both in Jerusalem and here , came together and talked about him . They shouted , " He must die ! "
44025025	But I found out that he had not done anything wrong for which he should die . He himself asked to go to Caesar , so I decided to send him .
44025026	But I have no real complaint about him to write to my ruler . So I have brought this man before you all , and most of all before you , king Agrippa . When you have heard him , I hope I will have something to write about him .
44025027	I think that it does not make sense to send a prisoner and not say what wrong he has done .
44026001	Then Agrippa said to Paul , You may speak for yourself . So Paul put out his hand and began to speak .
44026002	King Agrippa , I am happy to speak for myself before you today . I will talk about all the things the leaders of the Jews have said against me .
44026003	You know all the ways of the Jews . You know what they believe . So please take time to listen to me .
44026004	All the Jews know the way I lived from the time I was young . From the beginning I lived with my own people at Jerusalem .
44026005	They have known me for a long time . They know , if they would tell it , that I lived like the Pharisee group . They obey the law better than any others who worship God the way we do .
44026006	I believe that God will keep the promise that he made to our fathers long ago . That is why I am standing here being judged today .
44026007	All the people of our twelve tribes serve God faithfully day and night . They do this because they believe they will receive what he has promised . Because I believe this , king Agrippa , the Jewish leaders are talking against me .
44026008	Why is it so hard for any of you to believe that God should raise the dead ?
44026009	I used to think that I must do many things against the name of Jesus of Nazareth .
44026010	I did this in Jerusalem . The chief priests gave me power . I put many of Gods people in prison . And when they were killed , I agreed to it .
44026011	Often I punished them in all the meeting places . I tried to make them say wrong things about Christ . I was very , very angry . I even went to other cities to trouble them .
44026012	And so I was on my way to the city of Damascus . The chief priests had given me power and a letter .
44026013	I was on the road at midday , king Agrippa , and I saw a bright light . It came from the sky and was brighter than the light of the sun . It shone all around me and the men who were travelling with me .
44026014	We all fell to the ground . I heard someone say to me in the Jews language , " Saul , Saul , why are you troubling me ? You hurt yourself when you kick against the sticks which guide you . "
44026015	I said , " Who are you , Lord ? " And the Lord said , " I am Jesus , the one you are troubling .
44026016	But get up . Stand on your feet . Here is why I have shown myself to you . I have chosen you to work for me . I have chosen you to tell people what you saw when you saw me today . You are to tell them also about the other times when I will show myself to you .
44026017	I will keep you safe from your own people , the Jews . And I will keep you safe from those who are not Jews . I am sending you to them .
44026018	I send you to them to open their eyes . Then they will turn from darkness to light . You are to take them out of Satans power and turn them to God , to be forgiven of their wrong ways . Then they will be among those who are made clean and pure by believing in me . "
44026019	So , king Agrippa , I obeyed what the one from heaven told me to do .
44026020	I told the good news to the people of Damascus and Jerusalem . Then I told it all over Judea . I went to those who are not Jews . I told everyone that they must stop doing wrong things and turn to God . I told them they must show by the way they live that they have stopped doing wrong things .
44026021	That is why the leaders of the Jews caught me in the temple and tried to kill me .
44026022	God has always helped me up to today . I have stood and talked to both small people and great people . I have said nothing more than what the prophets and Moses said would happen .
44026023	They said Christ must suffer . They said he would be the first person to rise from death . He would be the first person to bring news of light to the Jews and those who are not Jews .
44026024	While Paul was saying these things Festus shouted , Paul , you are crazy ! All your book learning is making you crazy .
44026025	Paul said , No , great ruler Festus , I am not crazy . But what I say is true . It makes good sense .
44026026	The king knows about these things . I am not afraid to talk to him about them . I am sure that not one of these things happened without his knowing about it . This did not happen in secret .
44026027	King Agrippa do you believe the prophets ? I know you believe them .
44026028	Then Agrippa said to Paul , You are trying to make me a Christian right away .
44026029	Right away or later , said Paul . I wish that all who hear me today might be what I am . That is , what I am without these chains .
44026030	Then king Agrippa stood up . Festus and Bernice and those who were sitting there with them stood up also .
44026031	They left the room and talked the matter over . They said , This man is not doing anything wrong for which he ought to be in prison or die .
44026032	Agrippa said to Festus , We could let this man go free if he had not asked to go to Caesar .
44027001	It was planned that we would go by boat to Italy . An officer named Julius was put in charge of Paul and some other prisoners . Julius was an army captain in the Augustan group .
44027002	We got on a boat which was from the city of Adramyttium . This boat was going along the coast of Asia Minor . And so we went out to sea . A man named Aristarchus from the city of Thessalonica in Macedonia came with us also .
44027003	The next day we stopped at the city of Sidon . Julius was kind to Paul . He allowed him to go to see his friends so they could care for him .
44027004	Then we started out to sea again . We went near the island of Cyprus , because the wind was blowing against us .
44027005	We crossed the sea by the countries of Cilicia and Pamphylia . Then we reached the city of Myra in Lycia .
44027006	There the officer found a boat from the city of Alexandria going to the country of Italy . So he put us on that boat .
44027007	We went slowly for many days . And after much trouble , we reached the city of Cnidus . The wind was blowing hard against us . We could not go on . So we went around the south side of the island of Crete , past Cape Salmone .
44027008	We had trouble going along near the coast , but at last we came to a place called Fair Havens . This was near the town of Lasea .
44027009	It was now so late in the year that it was a bad time to go by boat . So Paul spoke to them about it .
44027010	He said , Sirs , I see that if we go on by boat , we will have much trouble . Something bad will happen to the things on the boat and to the boat itself , and also to us .
44027011	The officer did not listen to what Paul said . But he listened to the captain and the owner of the boat .
44027012	This place was not a good place for the boat to stay through the winter months of the year . So most of the men wanted to go on . They thought they might be able to reach Phoenicia and stay there for the winter . Phoenicia is a good place on the island of Crete . Boats can stay there . The winds do not blow against them .
44027013	When the south wind began to blow a little , they thought they had what they wanted . So they started off . They went along very close to the land of Crete .
44027014	But soon a very strong north-east wind blew from Crete .
44027015	The wind blew against the boat and it could not go into the wind . So they let the boat go where the wind took it .
44027016	We came close to a small island called Clauda . There we had a hard time to pull up the small boat .
44027017	However , at last they got it up . Then they put ropes around the boat to make it strong . They were also afraid they would get stuck in a bad place in the sand . So they took down the big sail cloth that was up to catch the wind . Then they let the boat go where the wind took it .
44027018	The next day the storm was very bad . They threw out the things that were in the boat .
44027019	And the third day they threw off the things they used on the boat , with their own hands .
44027020	For many days we could not see the sun or the stars . The bad storm kept on . We did not think that we would be saved .
44027021	The men of the boat had not eaten anything for a long time . Then Paul stood up and said , Sirs , you should have listened to me and not left Crete . But you did leave . So you have had much trouble and have lost all these things .
44027022	Now I tell you to be glad . Not one of you will die . Only the boat will break and be lost .
44027023	I belong to God and worship him . Last night his angel stood before me .
44027024	He said , " Paul , do not be afraid . You must stand before Caesar . And see , God has given you the lives of all these men who are travelling with you . "
44027025	So be glad , sirs . I believe God . It will be just the way he told me .
44027026	However , we will have to go on an island .
44027027	On the fourteenth night we were being blown across the Adrian Sea . About midnight the boatmen thought that we must be near some land .
44027028	So they tested how deep the water was there . They found that the line went down twenty arm lengths . A little later they tested and found that it was only fifteen arm lengths deep .
44027029	Then they were afraid that we would hit the rocks . There were four heavy iron hooks called anchors . They let them down into the water at the back end of the boat . Then they wished that morning would come .
44027030	The boatmen wanted to get off and leave the boat . They even put down the small boat into the water . They said they were going to put more anchors out from the front of the big boat .
44027031	But Paul said to the officer and soldiers , If these men do not stay on the boat , you cannot be saved .
44027032	Then the soldiers cut the ropes holding the small boat and let the water carry it away .
44027033	When it was almost morning , Paul begged them all to eat . He said , Today is the fourteenth day that you have been watching and have not eaten anything .
44027034	So now , I beg you , eat something . You need it to make you strong so you can save yourselves . Not one of you will lose even one hair from your head .
44027035	When he had said this , he stood in front of them all . He took some bread and thanked God for it . Then he broke it and began to eat it .
44027036	Then they all were glad and ate some food themselves .
44027037	In all , we were 276 people on the boat .
44027038	They ate all they wanted . Then they threw the grain into the water , so that the boat would not be so heavy .
44027039	In the morning they saw land . But they did not know what country it was . They saw a sandy place . So they talked it over and thought they would try to get the boat on it .
44027040	They cut off the anchors and left them in the water . At the same time , they untied the wood that guided the boat . They put up the big sail to catch the wind and tried to get the boat onto that sandy place .
44027041	But they came to a place where there was sand under the water . The boat stuck in it . The front end stuck so badly that they could not make it go . The back end began to break up because the water beat it so hard .
44027042	The soldiers wanted to kill the prisoners so that none of them would swim to land and run away .
44027043	But the officer wanted to save Paul , so he stopped the soldiers . He told the people , Those of you who can swim , jump into the water first and get to the land .
44027044	Then the rest of you jump in and go on planks and other pieces of the boat . So in this way they all got to the land safely .
44028001	When we were safe on land , we found that the island we were on was called Malta .
44028002	The people there were very kind to us . They made a fire for us and took care of us . It was cold and raining .
44028003	Paul gathered some sticks of wood . He put them on the fire . A bad snake came out of the heat and hung onto his hand .
44028004	The people of Malta saw the snake hanging on his hand . Oh , they said to each other . This man has no doubt killed someone . He did not die in the water , but it is not right for him to live .
44028005	Paul shook the snake off into the fire . It did not hurt him .
44028006	The people thought surely he would swell up or would drop down dead at once . They waited a long time and saw that nothing bad happened to him . Then they said , We were wrong . He must be a god .
44028007	The ruler of the island was a man named Publius . He owned some of the land there . He took us to his house for three days and was very kind to us .
44028008	The father of Publius was sick with fever , and blood was coming from his body . Paul went to see him . He talked to God and put his hands on the man . He healed him .
44028009	After this , other sick people on the island came to Paul . And they too were healed .
44028010	They gave us many things . When we went away , they put on the boat for us the things that we would need .
44028011	A boat from the town of Alexandria was at the island all through the winter time . It was marked with a sign of the Twin Brothers . After we had been on the island for three months , we went on that boat .
44028012	Then we went to the city of Syracuse and stayed for three days .
44028013	After that we turned the boat along the coast . We reached the town of Rhegium . When we had been there for a day , a south wind began to blow . On the second day we came to the city of Puteoli .
44028014	There we found some Christian brothers . They asked us to stay with them for seven days . Then we went to Rome . Some of the Christians at Rome had heard about us . They came to places called the Market Place of Appius and the Three Hotels . There they met us . When Paul saw them , he thanked God . It made him strong and glad to see these brothers .
44028016	When we came to Rome , Paul was allowed to stay in a house by himself with the soldier who guarded him .
44028017	After three days , Paul called for the leaders of the Jews at Rome . When they had come , he said to them , My brothers , I have done nothing against our people . I have obeyed the laws of our fathers . And yet I was made a prisoner at Jerusalem and was given over to the Romans .
44028018	When the Romans judged my case in court , they wanted to let me go free . They said there was no reason to kill me .
44028019	But the Jewish leaders did not agree to let me go free , so I had to ask to be brought before Caesar . I did not have anything to say against my people .
44028020	Now , here is why I have asked to see you and to talk to you . I am a prisoner tied with chains because I believe the same promise the Jews believe .
44028021	They said to him , The people of Judea have not written us any letter about you . When our brother Jews have come here , not one of them has told or said anything wrong about you .
44028022	But we want to hear from you what you think . We know that people everywhere are talking against this Christian group .
44028023	So they chose a certain day . On that day many of them came to the house where Paul was staying . He told them about Gods kingdom . He tried to make them understand about Jesus by the things that were written in the law of Moses and in the books of the prophets . He talked from morning until evening .
44028024	Some of the people were ready to believe what he said , but others did not believe .
44028025	They did not agree among themselves . So they started to go away . But before they left , Paul said one more thing . What the Holy Spirit said was right . He spoke to your fathers long ago through Isaiah , the prophet of God .
44028026	He said , " Go to these people and say , You will hear but never understand . You will look but never see .
44028027	The hearts of these people have become hard . They do not hear with their ears . They have shut their eyes . They do not want to see with their eyes . They do not want to hear with their ears . They do not want to understand with their hearts . If they did , they would turn back to me and I would forgive them . "
44028028	Paul said , Therefore know this . The message that God will save them has been sent to those who were not Jews . They will listen to it .
44028029	When Paul had said these words , the Jewish leaders went away . They were talking amongst themselves about these things .
44028030	Paul stayed in Rome for two whole years in a house he paid money to live in . He was glad to see all who came to him .
44028031	He told them about Gods kingdom and taught them about the Lord Jesus Christ . He did this freely without fear . No one stopped him .
45001001	I am Paul , a servant of Jesus Christ . He called me to be an apostle and to tell Gods good news .
45001002	Through his prophets long ago God promised this good news to people , in the holy writings .
45001003	The good news was about his Son . He is Jesus Christ our Lord . He was a man born in Davids family .
45001004	He came alive from death . That showed he was Gods Son . He had Gods power . Gods Holy Spirit did all this .
45001005	This same Jesus Christ was kind to me . And he made me an apostle . I am sent in his name so that people in all nations will obey him .
45001006	You are some of them . You were called to belong to Jesus Christ .
45001007	I send greetings to all the Christians who live in the city of Rome . God loves you and has called you to be his people . May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you . In their kindness may they give you peace .
45001008	People in all the world have heard that you believe . I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you .
45001009	God knows that I always talk to him about you . I worship him in my heart while I tell the good news about his Son .
45001010	I ask God that in some way now I may be able to visit you , if he wishes me to do it .
45001011	I want very much to see you . I want to give you some gift from the Holy Spirit to make you stronger .
45001012	I mean to say that we will both be helped . I will be helped because you believe , and you will be helped because I believe .
45001013	My brothers , I want you to know that I have often planned to come to you . But something has stopped me until now . I planned to come so that I might see good things happen among you . I have done this in the other nations which are not Jewish .
45001014	This is something I must do for the Greek people and for all other people . I must do it for people who are wise and for people who are not wise .
45001015	That is why I want so much to tell the good news to you people in the city of Rome also .
45001016	I am not ashamed of the good news of Jesus Christ . The good news is the power God uses to save every one who believes . The good news was for the Jews first , but also for those who are not Jews .
45001017	The good news shows how God puts a person right . God puts a person right when that person believes in his Son and keeps on believing . The holy writings say , A person who is put right because he believes , will live for ever .
45001018	God is angry . He has shown it from heaven . He is angry because of all the bad and wrong things people do . These people hold back Gods truth by the wrong things they do .
45001019	They know about God . God himself has shown them .
45001020	People cannot see that God has power which lasts for ever . They cannot see that he is really God . But ever since he made the world , he has clearly shown this by the things he made . So they cannot say , I did not know about God .
45001021	Even though they knew he was God , they did not worship him as God . They did not thank him . Their thoughts were no good . Their foolish minds became dark .
45001022	They said they were wise people , but they were foolish people .
45001023	They did not worship God who cannot die . But they worshipped things made to look like a man who does die . They worshipped things made to look like birds and animals and snakes .
45001024	So God left them to do the things their hearts wanted to do . They did the things that are not right to do with their bodies . They did not respect their own bodies .
45001025	They would not believe what was true about God . They believed a lie . They worshipped and worked for something that was made by God . They did not worship God-God who made all things . He is the one to worship for ever . Amen . May it be so !
45001026	That is why God left them to do the wrong things they wanted to do . Their women left the right way for women and did things that are wrong for women to do .
45001027	Their men also left the right way with women . They wanted to have sex with one another . They did wrong things with other men . Their own bodies were punished because of the wrong things they did .
45001028	They did not want to know God . So he left them to their wrong thoughts and to do things that are not right .
45001029	They were very bad . They did every kind of wrong thing . They were greedy . They hated people . They were very jealous . They killed many people . They fought . They fooled people . They told lies about people . They carried stories from one person to another .
45001030	They said wrong things about people . They hated God . They did not respect people . They were proud . They talked big . They even thought of new wrong things to do . They did not obey their parents .
45001031	. They were foolish . They did not do what they said they would do . They did not love people . They were not kind .
45001032	They know that God says that people who do such things should die . Even so , they not only do them , but they praise other people who do them .
45002001	Do you judge another people ? You your-selves have done wrong things . So when you judge others , you judge yourselves , because you do the same things . You judge them and yet you do the same things .
45002002	We know that God judges people who do such things . And he judges them by what is true .
45002003	Man , you judge people who do such things and yet you do them yourself . Do you think that God will not judge you ?
45002004	Or do you not respect him for being kind , very patient , and for waiting a long time ? Do you not know that God is kind , and he wants to lead you away from doing wrong things ?
45002005	But your hearts are hard . You will not stop . That is why God will be angry with you . He will be angry on the day when people will see that he judges in the right way .
45002006	He will pay every man for what he has done .
45002007	He will give life for ever to people who keep on doing good . These people want to have glory and honour from God , and to live for ever .
45002008	But God will be very angry with the people who think of themselves first before others . They do not obey what is right . They do wrong things .
45002009	Every one who does what is wrong will have much trouble and a hard time . This will happen to the Jews first , then to those who are not Jews .
45002010	And every one who does what is good , will be made great . He will have honour and peace . This will happen to the Jews first and then to those who are not Jews .
45002011	God does not love some people more than others .
45002012	All those who do not know the law [ of God given to Moses ] and did what was wrong , will die . But they will not be judged by the law . All those who know the law and did what was wrong will be judged by the law .
45002013	( God does not say people are good because they have heard the law . But people who obey the law will be called good people .
45002014	Some people do not have the law . But they do what the law says because their own hearts tell them to . They have a law of their own , even though they do not know the law .
45002015	They show that the law is written in their hearts . They know what is right to do and what is wrong to do . Their own thoughts tell them they have done what is wrong or what is not wrong . )
45002016	This will be on the day when God judges the things men have kept secret . Jesus Christ will be the judge . That is part of the good news I tell people .
45002017	But you call yourselves Jews . You believe the law . You are proud of your God .
45002018	You know what he wants people to do . You know the thoughts that are good because you have been taught the law .
45002019	You are sure that you can lead people who are like blind men . You are like a light for people who are in the dark .
45002020	You are sure that you can tell foolish people what is right . You can teach people who are like children . You know what you need to know and you know what is true because you have the law .
45002021	You teach another person . Do you not teach yourself ? You say people must not steal . Do you steal ?
45002022	You say people must not commit adultery . Do you commit adultery ? You hate idols . Do you steal things from the houses of idols ?
45002023	You are proud that you have the law . Do you break the law , and in that way show you do not honour God ?
45002024	The holy writings say , People who are not Jews say wrong things about the name of God . They do it because of what you Jews do .
45002025	Circumcision of the body is a good thing if you obey the law . But if you break the law , you are like a man who has not been circumcised with this mark of the Jew .
45002026	So if a man who has not been circumcised obeys the law , will he not be like a man who has been circumcised ?
45002027	Some people have not been circumcised , but they obey the law . They will show that you should be punished . You have the written law and you have been circumcised , and yet you break the law .
45002028	If a person is a Jew only on the outside , he is not really a Jew . And true circumcision is not something that is done on the outside of the body .
45002029	If a person is a Jew inside , he is really a Jew . It is God who praises him , not people . True circumcision is done in the heart . It is in the spirit , not in the body . Such people are not praised; but God praises them .
45003001	Then what does a Jew have that others do not have ? Or what good is it if a person has been circumcised ?
45003002	It is much better in every way . First , Gods law was given to the Jews .
45003003	But some Jews did not keep his law . Does that mean that God cannot be trusted ?
45003004	No , it does not mean that . God must be true , even if every man is not true . The holy writings say this about God : People will see that you are right in what you say . You will be without fault when you are judged .
45003005	When we do wrong things , we show that God is right . What shall we say about that ? Does God do wrong when he punishes us ? ( I speak the way people would think about it . )
45003006	No , he does not . If he did wrong , how could he judge the world ?
45003007	Maybe I say what is not true . And that makes people praise God more because he is true . Then why does God still judge me and say I have done wrong ?
45003008	Some people say wrong things about us . They say that we say , Let us do wrong things so that good things will happen . People who say such things should be punished .
45003009	So what shall we say ? Are we Jews any better than other people ? No , we are not ! I have already shown that all men , both Jews and people who are not Jews have done wrong things .
45003010	The holy writings say , No one is good . No , not one person .
45003011	No one is wise . No one wants to know God .
45003012	They all have turned away from the straight road . Together they have gone the wrong way . No one does good , not even one person !
45003013	Their mouth is like an open grave . They have used their tongues to fool people . The poison of bad snakes is under their lips .
45003014	Their mouths are full of cursing and saying bad words to people .
45003015	Their feet run quickly to kill people .
45003016	Death and trouble are on the ways they go .
45003017	They do not know the way of peace .
45003018	They do not fear God .
45003019	We know that everything the law says , it says to the people who have the law . Then no one can say a word for themselves . All the people in the world will be brought to God to be judged .
45003020	No one will be put right with God because he has tried to obey the law . The law only makes people know what they have done wrong .
45003021	So now God has shown how people can be put right with him without the law . The law and the prophets said he would do it .
45003022	God puts people right with himself when they believe in Jesus Christ . He does this for all who believe . They are all alike .
45003023	All have done wrong and all are far from being as good as God .
45003024	But God is kind and makes them right with himself . It is a gift . He does it because Christ Jesus paid the price to set them free .
45003025	God gave him as a sacrifice . When people believe in him , his blood pays for the wrong things they have done . This shows that God is good and right . He was right when he forgave the wrong things that people did long ago .
45003026	God also shows that he is right now . He does this when he makes right any person who believes in Jesus .
45003027	Then what have we to be proud of ? Nothing at all . Why not ? Does God put us right with himself because of anything we have done ? No . He does it because we believe .
45003028	We know that if a person believes in Christ , God makes him right again . It is not because that person has obeyed the law .
45003029	Is God the God of the Jews only ? Is he not the God of other people also ? Yes , he is . There is only one God of all peoples .
45003030	He will put right people who have been circumcised [ the Jews ] because they believe . And he will also put right people who are not circumcised when they believe .
45003031	When we believe , does that make the law no good to us ? No . That is not so . When we believe , we show that the law is right .
45004001	So what shall we say about Abraham ? He is the father of our family on earth .
45004002	If Abraham was put right with God , because of what he did , he has something to be proud of . But he has nothing to be proud of when he stands before God .
45004003	What do the holy writings say ? It says , Abraham believed God . And God said that he was a good man .
45004004	When a person works , his pay is not a gift to him . His pay belongs to him .
45004005	But no person can work to put himself right with God . It is God alone who makes a bad person right . The one who believes in him-even a bad person is put right .
45004006	David also says that God blesses a man . God calls him a good man but not because he has kept the law .
45004007	David said , God blesses people who have been forgiven the wrong things they have done . God covers over the wrong things they have done .
45004008	The Lord blesses people when he forgets the wrong things they have done .
45004009	Does God bless only people who have been circumcised ? Or does he also bless those who are not ? We say , because Abraham believed God , God called him a good man . His faith made him right with God .
45004010	When did God say that ? Was it when Abraham was circumcised ? Or was it before ? It was not when he was circumcised : it was before .
45004011	Abraham was circumcised as a sign . It was a sign that he was a good man , because he believed when he was not yet circumcised . That makes him the father of all people who believe , even those who are not circumcised . God says they are good people .
45004012	That makes him also the father of those who are circumcised . I mean people who are circumcised and do as our father Abraham did . Even when he was not circumcised , he believed .
45004013	God promised Abraham and his family that the world would belong to them . God did not make the promise because Abraham obeyed the law . But he made the promise because Abraham believed him and was put right with God .
45004014	If the world will belong to people who obey the law , it is of no use to believe God . And the promise is no good .
45004015	Because of the law , God is angry . Where there is no law , no one breaks the law .
45004016	That is why people must believe . Because God is kind , he makes the promise sure for all of Abrahams children . The promise is for those who have the law and also for those who believe as Abraham did . He is the father of us all .
45004017	the holy writings say , I have made you the father of many nations . Abraham was made the father of many nations by God . He believed God . He believed that God could make dead people live . He believed God when he said that things were true even though they had not happened yet .
45004018	Abraham believed and hoped , though there was nothing to give him hope . He believed that he would become the father of many nations . God had told him this would happen .
45004019	He did not stop believing when he thought about his own body . It was almost dead . He was about one hundred years old . He did not stop believing when he thought about Sarah , even though she had never given birth to any children .
45004020	He did not stop believing Gods promise . He believed God very much . He did not praise God for his own faith , but for Gods promise .
45004021	He was sure that God was able to do what he had promised to do .
45004022	He was put right with God because he believed the promise .
45004023	The holy writings do not say that for Abraham only .
45004024	They say it for us too . God will say we are put right if we believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from death .
45004025	He was killed because we did wrong things . He was raised from death in order that we might be made right with God .
45005001	We are made good people and put right with God when we believe in Jesus Christ . So now we have peace with God because of what our Lord Jesus Christ did .
45005002	Because we believe , Christ has brought us to the place where God can do us good . We are in that place now . We are very happy because we have the hope that we shall see Gods greatness .
45005003	And not only is that true , but we are very happy in our troubles , because we know that trouble makes us stronger .
45005004	When we are strong to take trouble , we prove that we believe . When we prove that we believe , we have hope .
45005005	We will not be disappointed by this hope . God has given us the Holy Spirit . And the Holy Spirit has put Gods love in our hearts .
45005006	We could not help ourselves . So at the right time , Christ died to save us bad people .
45005007	Almost no one would die to save even a good man . But perhaps someone would die to save a very good man .
45005008	God shows his love for us in this way : Christ died to save us while we were bad people .
45005009	The blood of Christ has now put us right with God . So even more , he will save us from Gods strong anger .
45005010	When we were enemies , the death of his Son brought us back to God . Now that we are made right with God , it is the life of Jesus that will save us .
45005011	Not only is that true , but it is through our Lord Jesus Christ that we can enjoy God . This is for all who have been brought back to God by him .
45005012	One man [ Adam ] did a wrong thing . And the wrong thing he did made him die . So all men die because all have done wrong things .
45005013	People in the world were not right with God before he gave the law . But wrong things are not punished when there is no law .
45005014	Yet death ruled over people from Adams time to Moses time . It even ruled over the people who were not as wrong as Adam . Adam was like a person who would come later .
45005015	But the free gift is not like the wrong thing . Many people died because one man did a wrong thing . This is sure . God was very kind and he gave a free gift . This gift was given to many people because one man , Jesus Christ , did a very kind thing .
45005016	The free gift is not like the wrong thing one man did . Because of that one man people were judged . And they were punished . Because many people did wrong things , God gave his free gift and many people were made right with him .
45005017	One man did a wrong thing . And so death ruled over people because of that one man . God has been kind to people and given them his free gift . That gift is to make people right with God . People who take that gift will live and rule because of one man , Jesus Christ .
45005018	One man did a wrong thing . And so all people were punished through him . But Christ did the right thing . And so all people can have the free gift of life through being put right with God .
45005019	One man did not obey . And so many people were bad people . One man obeyed . And so many people will be made right with God .
45005020	When the law came , it showed how wrong people really were . But when people were really bad , God was even more kind .
45005021	The wrong things people did ruled over them , and they died . Now God has been very kind . He has made people right with him . So now Gods blessing will rule over them , and they will live for ever . Jesus Christ our Lord has done this for them .
45006001	What shall we say then ? Shall we keep on doing wrong things so that God will be more kind to us ?
45006002	No , surely not ! We died to our wrong ways and no longer live in them .
45006003	All of us have been baptised in water . This means we are joined to Christ Jesus . We were baptised into his death . Do you know that ?
45006004	We were buried when he was buried because we were baptised into his death . Christ was raised from death by the wonderful power of the Father . So we also must live a new life .
45006005	Have we shared with Christ and died as he died ? Then we shall share with him by rising from death as he arose .
45006006	We know this is true . The old person we used to be was nailed to the cross with him , so that our bodies which do wrong things would die . Then we will no longer be like slaves to the wrong things we used to do .
45006007	Anyone who has died no longer does wrong things .
45006008	If we have died with Christ , we believe that we will also live with him .
45006009	We know that Christ was raised from death and will not die again . Death has no power over him any more .
45006010	He died . And he died once for all time , so that people would stop their wrong ways . But now he lives . And he lives for God .
45006011	So you also must think you are dead , and stop your wrong ways . And you must think you are living for God along with Christ Jesus our Lord .
45006012	Do not let wrong things rule over your bodies that are going to die . Do not do the things your bodies want .
45006013	Do not use your bodies to do wrong things . But give yourselves to God like men who have been raised from death to life . Give your bodies to God and use them to do good things .
45006014	Wrong ways will not be your masters . The law does not rule over you now , but Gods loving kindness rules over you .
45006015	What then ? The law does not rule over us now . Gods loving kindness rules over us . So , shall we do wrong things ? No , never !
45006016	If you give yourselves to be slaves and obey your master , you are not free . You are his slaves . Do you not know this : you may be slaves to wrong things ? But you will not live for ever . Or you may be slaves to obey God . Then you will be made good people and live with him .
45006017	You were at one time slaves to wrong things . But I praise God that you obeyed what your teachers taught you . And you obeyed because you wanted to obey .
45006018	You were made free from doing wrong things . You were made slaves to good things .
45006019	I speak the way people would think about such things , because your minds are weak . At one time you gave your bodies to be slaves to your unclean ways , and to do more and more wrong things . So now give your bodies to be slaves to doing what is right , and to being good .
45006020	When you were slaves to wrong things , you were free from doing good things .
45006021	You are now ashamed of those things . What good did they do you ? For the end of those things is death .
45006022	But now you have been made free from wrong ways and you have been made Gods slaves . You are made good and you will live for ever .
45006023	The reward that wrong ways give is to die . But the gift which God gives is to live for ever . Christ Jesus our Lord has done this for us .
45007001	My brothers , I am saying this to you people who know the law . Do you not know that the law is master over a person only while he lives ?
45007002	A married woman belongs to her husband by law as long as he lives . But if her husband dies , she is free from the law that made her belong to her husband .
45007003	So if she belongs to another man while her husband is living , she commits adultery . But if her husband dies , she is free from that law . Then if she belongs to another man , she does not commit adultery .
45007004	In the same way my brothers , you died when Christ died . And you are free from the law . Now you belong to another person . You belong to the one who has been raised from death . Because of that , we are able to do what God wants us to do .
45007005	One time we lived in the way our bodies wanted to live . The law made us think about doing wrong things . And we did things that made us die .
45007006	But now we have been made free from the law . We died , and so we are no longer slaves to the one who was our master . Now we are slaves to God in our new life . This new life is ruled by the Spirit . We do not work for the old written law .
45007007	So what shall we say ? Shall we say that the law is bad ? No ! I would not have known what is wrong if there had been no law . The law says , Do not want to take other peoples things . That is how I know it is wrong to want another persons things .
45007008	My wrong ways used the law to make me want all kinds of things . When there is no law , the thing within me that wants to do wrong is dead .
45007009	Once I had no law , and I lived . But when the law came , that which wanted to do wrong things came to life , and I died .
45007010	The same law which was meant to make a person live , made me die .
45007011	My wrong ways used the law to fool me and kill me .
45007012	So the law is holy . And what the law says is holy and right and good .
45007013	So did that good thing make me die ? No . The wrong things I did made me die , because that good thing showed they were wrong . And the law shows that the wrong things are very , very bad .
45007014	We know that the law came from the Holy Spirit . But I am a weak man . I have been sold like a slave to do wrong things .
45007015	I do not know why I do the things I do . I do not do what I want to do . But I do the things I hate .
45007016	And if I do what I do not want to do , I agree that the law is good .
45007017	So now it is no longer I who do it , but my wrong ways in me .
45007018	I know that no good thing lives in me . I mean , no good thing lives in my body . I want to do what is good , but I cannot do it .
45007019	I do not do the good thing I want to do , but I do the wrong thing that I do not want to do .
45007020	If I do the thing I do not want to do , it is no longer I who do it , but the wrong thing in me that does it .
45007021	So there is a law I find that it is at work in me . When I want to do what is right , I can only do what is wrong .
45007022	In my own mind I am glad to obey the law of God .
45007023	But I see that in my body there is another law fighting against the law in my mind . And that makes me like a prisoner to the law of wrong things in my body .
45007024	I am a very sad man . Who will save me from this body that will make me die ?
45007025	Thank God for Jesus Christ our Lord who will do it ! So this is the way it is . In my mind I am a slave to do the law of God , but in my body I am a slave to do the law of wrong things .
45008001	So now those who belong to Christ Jesus will not be judged .
45008002	The Spirit gives life in Christ Jesus . And the law of the Spirit has set me free from the law of wrong things , and the law of death .
45008003	God has done what the law could not do . The things people did made the law weak . God sent his own Son in a body of man . His body was like the bodies which others use to do wrong things . He sent him because people have done wrong things . And he judged the wrong things people have done in their bodies .
45008004	He did this so that we might be good people as the law said we should be . We are good people if we live the way the Spirit wants us to live , not the way our bodies want to live .
45008005	Some people live the way their bodies want to live . They think only about the things their bodies want to do . Other people live the way the Spirit wants them to live . They think about the things the Spirit wants them to do .
45008006	If you keep your mind on the things your bodies want to do , you will die . But if you keep your mind on the things the Spirit wants , you will live and have peace .
45008007	People who think about the things of this life are Gods enemies . They do not obey Gods law . They cannot obey it .
45008008	People who do what their bodies want cannot please God .
45008009	Does Gods Spirit live in you ? If he does , then you are not living the way the body wants , but you are living the way the Spirit wants . If anyone does not have Christs Spirit , he does not belong to Christ .
45008010	But if Christ is in you , your bodies are dead because of the wrong things you have done . But your spirits live because you have been made right with God .
45008011	God raised Christ Jesus from death . Does Gods Spirit live in you ? Then God will also give life to your bodies which die . He does this through his Spirit who lives in you .
45008012	So , my brothers , we must not live the way our bodies want us to live . We must not be ruled by our wrong ways .
45008013	If you live the way your bodies wants to live , you will die . But if , by the help of the Spirit , you stop doing the wrong things your bodies want to do , you will live .
45008014	All who do what Gods Spirit leads them to do are Gods sons .
45008015	The Holy Spirit you have received does not make you a slave again so that you are afraid . But the Spirit you have received makes you sons of God .
45008016	So we say , Father ! Father ! The Spirit himself also , along with our own spirits , tells us that we are Gods children .
45008017	If we are his children , God will give us the good things that children receive . He will give us these blessings along with Christ . He will give it to us if we suffer with Christ . If we suffer with Christ , we will also be made great with him .
45008018	I think that the troubles we have in this life are nothing when we think of the great things that we shall have .
45008019	The whole world is waiting for the time when the sons of God will be seen .
45008020	The world was spoiled . It did not want to be spoiled , but God allowed it .
45008021	And it hoped to be free like Gods children when they are made great .
45008022	We know that the whole world has been crying . It has had much pain until now .
45008023	And not the world only , but we ourselves also cry out . We have the first blessing God gives of his Spirit . But we cry out in our hearts . We are waiting for God to finish making us his sons . Then our bodies will be set free .
45008024	That is what we hoped for when we were saved . When the thing hoped for is seen , there is no more hoping . When a person sees a thing , how can he hope for it ?
45008025	But if we hope for something we do not see , we keep on waiting for it .
45008026	Also the Spirit helps us because we are weak . We do not know how we should talk to God . But the Spirit himself talks to God for us , while we cry and cannot say any words .
45008027	God looks to see what is in peoples hearts . And he knows what the Spirit is going to do . The Spirit talks to God for Gods people . And he asks for them what God wants them to have .
45008028	We know that God works out everything for the good of those who love him . They are the people who are part of his plan .
45008029	He knew all along that he would choose them . He chose them to be made like his Son . Then his Son would be the first one of many brothers .
45008030	He chose them and he also called them . He called them to himself as if they had never been bad people . He made them right with himself and he also made them great in heaven .
45008031	So what shall we say about this ? If God is on our side , who can be against us ?
45008032	He did not keep his own Son , but gave him up for us all . Because he has given him to us , will he not also give us all other things ?
45008033	Who will say anything against Gods chosen people ? For it is God himself who says they have been put right with him .
45008034	Who will say they are not right ? Jesus Christ died . Yes , he was raised from death . He is at the right side of God . And he talks to God for us .
45008035	Who can take us away from Christs love ? We may have trouble . We may have hard times . People may make us suffer because we believe . We may have no food to eat and no clothes to wear . We may be in danger . We may be killed with big knives . Can any of these things take us away from Christs love ?
45008036	The holy writings say , For your sake we are killed all day . We are like sheep ready to be killed .
45008037	But Christ loved us . He has helped us to win great victory in all these things .
45008039	I know this . Death , life , angels , rulers , things happening now , things that will happen , high things , low things; nothing else in all the world can come between us and Gods love in Christ Jesus our Lord .
45009001	What I say is true and Christ knows it is . I do not tell a lie . My heart tells me it is true . And the Holy Spirit knows this .
45009002	I am very sad . I am always troubled . could almost wish I were taken away from Christ for the sake of my brothers , the people of my own nation .
45009003	They are Jews . God gave them the right to be his sons . He showed them how great he is . He made agreements with them . He gave them the law . He told them how to worship him . He gave them the promises .
45009004	The great men were their fathers . Christ was born a Jew . He is God over all . Praise him for ever ! Yes , he is !
45009005	God will do what he said he would do . Not all who are Jews belong to the real Israel .
45009006	Not all the people in Abrahams family are his children . But the holy writings say , It is Isaacs family who will be called your family .
45009007	This means that not all who were born in Abrahams family are Gods children . God promised Abraham a son [ Isaac ] . His children [ the Jews ] are the ones that God called Abrahams true family .
45009008	For this is what God promised , About this time next year I will come and Sarah shall have a son .
45009009	And that is not all . Rebecca also had children . Their father was Isaac , our father .
45009010	, fehlt/missing
45009011	When the children were not yet born , they had done nothing good or bad . God chooses the people he wants . He does not choose people because of what they have done . He chooses people who will answer his call . So he said to Rebecca , The older one will be a slave of the younger one .
45009012	The holy writings also say , I loved Jacob , but I hated Esau .
45009013	So what shall we say ? Does God do what is not right ? No , never !
45009014	He says to Moses , I will be kind to a person if I choose to be kind to him . I will share in the suffering of others if I choose to be sorry for them .
45009015	God is not kind to a person because the person wants God to be kind to him . God is not kind to him because the person runs to him to ask him for help . God is kind because he chooses to be kind .
45009016	In the holy writings it says to Pharaoh , That is why I made you live . I wanted to show my power through you . I wanted people to know about me all over the earth .
45009017	So God is kind to any person if he wants to be kind to him . And God makes a mans heart hard if he wants to do that .
45009018	So you will ask me , Why does God still blame us ? Who can fight against what God has planned ?
45009019	But you are only a man . Will you tell God what to do ? Can the pot say to the man who made it , Why did you make me like this ?
45009020	The person who makes pots has power over the mud . He can make two different pots out of one pile of mud . One pot will be fine and another will not be fine . Can the potter not make them so ?
45009021	God has a right to be very angry if he wants to be . He has the right to show his power . God was very angry with some people who deserved to die . And yet he waited a long time before he did anything to them .
45009022	He did it to show how very great he is . He was kind to some people . He planned for them to be made great .
45009023	That means he also called us . He called not only those who are Jews , but also those who are not Jews .
45009024	In the book written long ago by the prophet Hosea , God says They were not my people . But I will call them " my people " . I did not love her , but I will call her " the one I love . "
45009025	And in the very place where it was said to them , " You are not my people , " they will be called " sons of the living God . "
45009026	Isaiah the prophet of God said long ago about Israel , Even if the people of Israel are as many as the sand by the sea , only some of them will be saved .
45009027	The Lord will do what he said he will do on the earth . He will do it all and do it soon .
45009028	And Isaiah also said , The Lord who has power , left some of our children . If he had not , we would have been like Sodom . We would have been destroyed like Gomorrah .
45009029	So what shall we say ? The people who are not Jews have been put right with God . They did nothing to make themselves right with God . But they were put right because they believed God .
45009030	But the Jews tried to obey the law that could make them good people . But they did not obey it all .
45009031	Why was that ? They did not trust in God . They only trusted in doing the things of the law . They therefore hit their feet on the stone on which men hit their feet .
45009032	That is what the holy writings say , I put in Zion a stone on which people will hit their feet . It is a rock that will make them fall down . Anyone who believes in him will not be ashamed .

45010001	My brothers , with all my heart I want the Jews to be saved . And I ask God to save them .
45010002	I can say this about them , they want very much to obey God . But they do not know the right way .
45010003	They did not know the way God makes people right with him . They tried to make themselves good people . So they did not obey Gods way to become right with him .
45010004	Christ has made an end to the law as a way of getting right with God . Everyone who believes in him is put right with God .
45010005	Moses wrote this : A man who obeys the law will live by it .
45010006	But the holy writings also speak about those who are put right by believing : Do not say in your heart , " Who will go up into heaven ? " ( That means , Who will go up to heaven to bring Christ down ? )
45010007	Do not say , " Who will go down into the hole that has no bottom ? " ( That means , Who will go down to bring Christ up from the dead people ? )
45010008	But what do the holy writings say ? They say , The word is near you , in your mouth and in your heart . That means , the word to believe which we tell people .
45010009	If you say with your mouth that Jesus is Lord , and if you believe in your heart that God has raised Christ from death , you will be saved .
45010010	A person believes with his heart , and he is made right with God . He speaks with his mouth and so is saved from his wrong ways .
45010011	The holy writings say , Anyone who believes in him will not be let down .
45010012	The Jews and other people are alike . The same Lord is Lord of all people . He richly blesses all who call out to him .
45010013	The holy writings say , Everyone who calls out to the Lord will be saved .
45010014	But how can people call someone if they have not believed in him ? And how can they believe in him if they have not heard about him ? And how can they hear about him if no one tells them about him ?
45010015	And how can people tell about him if no one sends them ? The holy writings say , How good are the feet of those who bring the good news of peace and happiness .
45010016	But they have not all obeyed the good news . It is as Isaiah said it would be , Lord , who has believed what we have told them ?
45010017	So people believe because they hear . They hear because people tell them about Christ .
45010018	But I ask , have they not heard ? Yes , they have . The holy writings say , Their voice has gone out all over the earth . And their words have gone out all over the world .
45010019	But I ask , did not the Jews know ? First the book of Moses says , I will make you jealous through people who are not a nation like the Jews . I will make you angry through people who do not even know or understand these things .
45010020	But the book of Isaiah says even stronger words . The people who did not look for me have found me . I have shown myself to those who did not ask for me .
45010021	But he says about the Jews , All day I held out my hands to a people who did not obey me , who said wrong things against me .
45011001	So I ask , has God left his people ? No , he has not ! I myself am a Jew . I was born in Abrahams family . I belong to the tribe of Benjamin .
45011002	God has not left his people whom he knew from the first . Do you not know what the holy writings say about the prophet Elijah ? He talked to God against the people of Israel .
45011003	He said , Lord , they have killed your prophets . They have pulled down your holy places . I am the only one that is left , and they are trying to kill me .
45011004	But what did God answer him ? He said , I have seven thousand men who have not kneeled down to the idol god Baal .
45011005	So now some are left because God was kind to them , and chose them .
45011006	But if it was a gift because he was kind to them , then it was no longer because of the things they did . Or else a gift would no longer be a gift .
45011007	So what does that mean ? The Jews did not get what they tried to get . Only the people God chose got it . The hearts of the rest of the people became hard .
45011008	The holy writings say , God made them dull with sleep . He gave them eyes that could not see , and ears that could not hear . They have been like that until today .
45011009	And David said long ago , May the table where they eat be like a net and like a trap . May it make them fall down . May it punish them .
45011010	Make their eyes become blind so that they cannot see . Make their backs bent all the time .
45011011	So I ask , Have their feet been caught so that they have really fallen down ? No . But because they began to fall , the people who are not Jews were told how to be saved . That would make the Jews jealous .
45011012	The people who are not Jews have been richly blessed because the Jews failed . So it will be even better for them when the Jews no longer fail God .
45011013	Now I say this to you who are not Jews . I am an apostle to those who are not Jews , so I think highly of the work I have been sent to do .
45011014	I want the people of my own nation , the Jews , to be jealous . Then I may be able to save some of them .
45011015	God turned away from the Jews in order to bring the world back to himself . Then if that is true , when he takes the Jews back to himself , will not that be like making dead people live ?
45011016	If the first piece of bread is holy , so is all the rest which came from the same bread mix . If the root of a tree is holy , the branches are holy also .
45011017	Maybe some of the trees branches were broken off . And you , a branch from a wild olive tree , were made to grow on the tree among the branches . You then have the good water that comes from the root of the olive tree .
45011018	But do not think that you are better than the trees own branches . If you do , remember it is not you that holds the root in place . But it is the root that holds you .
45011019	Then you will say , The branches were broken off so that I might be joined to the tree .
45011020	That is true . They were broken off because they did not believe . And you have your place only because you believe . So do not be proud , but fear .
45011021	If God punished the trees own branches , he will punish you also .
45011022	See how kind God is . And see how hard he is . He is hard on those who have fallen . But God is kind to you if you go on following in his ways . If you do not , you also will be broken off .
45011023	God will also put back the other branches if they believe . God is able to put the Jews back where they belong .
45011024	You were cut off from a wild olive tree . And you were put on a good olive tree . That is not the way trees grow . But it can be done . And so , even more , the Jewish branches will be put back on their own olive tree .
45011025	My brothers , I want you to know something that has been a secret . Then you will not be proud of yourselves . The secret is this . Some Jews will have hard hearts until the right number of other people have come in .
45011026	Then all the Jews will be saved . The holy writings say , Someone will come from Zion to save people . He will take away the wrong ways of our father Jacob .
45011027	This will be my agreement with them when I take away the wrong things they have done .
45011028	The Jews make themselves enemies of God because they do not want the good news of Jesus Christ . That helps you since the good news has then come to you . But God still loves the Jews because of the promise he made to their fathers long ago .
45011029	God does not change his gifts or his call to people .
45011030	At one time you did not obey God . But now he has been kind to you because the Jews did not obey him .
45011031	So now , they also have not obeyed him . But he will also be kind to them because he was kind to you .
45011032	God allowed people to disobey him . He did it so that he might be kind and forgive all people .
45011033	God is very kind . He is very wise . He knows much . No one can understand why he judges the way he does . No one can find out why he does the things he does .
45011034	The holy writings say , Who has known what the Lord thinks ? Who has ever told him what to do ?
45011035	Who has given a gift to God first , so that God would give him something also ?
45011036	All things come from God , through God , and return to God . Praise him for ever ! Yes , it is so !
45012001	God has been kind to you . So I ask you , brothers , give your bodies to him like a living sacrifice . That is , a holy sacrifice . It will please God . And it is what you should do for him .
45012002	Do not be like the people of this world , but have a new mind . Then you will prove for yourselves what God wants you to do . That will be good . It will please God . And it will be all right .
45012003	God has given me this gift . So I say this to every one of you . Do not think you are better than you really are . But think of yourself as you are . You are what you are because God has given you something when you believed .
45012004	In a body there are many parts , but all the parts do not do the same thing .
45012005	In the same way , we are many people . But we are one body because we are all joined together in Christ . Each one of us is a part of all the others .
45012006	We have different gifts because God has blessed us in different ways . If a person can speak words from God , he must say what he believes he should say .
45012007	If a person can help others , he must help others . If a person can teach , he must teach .
45012008	If a person can talk to others , he must talk to others . If a person can give something , he must give it gladly . If a person can be a leader , he must try to be a good leader . If a person can help someone , he must do it gladly .
45012009	Your love must be real love . Hate what is wrong . Hold to what is good .
45012010	Love one another very much , like brothers . Honour other people more than you honour yourself .
45012011	Do not hold back in what you do . Let the Spirit burn in you . Work hard for the Lord .
45012012	Be very happy because you have a hope . Be strong when you have trouble . Keep on talking with God .
45012013	Give to Gods people who need it . Be glad to take care of strangers in your house .
45012014	Bless those who do wrong things to you . Bless them . Do not curse them .
45012015	Be happy with people who are happy . Cry with people who cry .
45012016	Agree with one another . Do not be proud , but be friends with anybody . Do not think you are wiser than you are .
45012017	When people do wrong things to you , do not do wrong things to them also . But try to do good things for all people .
45012018	As much as you can , live in peace with everyone .
45012019	My dear brothers , do not punish people who do wrong to you . But let Gods anger punish them . In the holy writings the Lord says , I myself will punish people . If they have done wrong things , I will do wrong things to them also .
45012020	But , If your enemy is hungry , give him food . If he is thirsty , give him a drink . When you do that , it will be as if you put a pile of coals from the fire on his head .
45012021	Do not let wrong things win a victory over you . But win a victory over wrong things by the good things you do .
45013001	Every person must obey the rulers over him . Every ruler has his power from God . And the rulers are put there by God .
45013002	So anyone who fights against the ruler , fights against what God put there . And those who fight will be punished .
45013003	The rulers do not bring fear to a good man , but they bring fear to a bad man . If you do not want to be afraid of a ruler , do what is good and he will praise you .
45013004	Such a person is Gods servant and will do what is good for you . But if you do what is wrong , you should fear him . He has great power and he will use it . He is Gods servant and will punish those who do wrong .
45013005	So you must obey , not only because of the punishment , but because you know it is right .
45013006	That is why you also pay taxes . The rulers serve God and they give all their time to their work .
45013007	Pay them all that they should have . Pay taxes to the person who should have the taxes . Pay money to the person who should have the money . Respect the people who should be respected . Honour a person who should be honoured .
45013008	Do not have any debts , but love each other . Anyone who loves his neighbour has done all that the law says we should do .
45013009	The law says , Do not commit adultery . Do not kill . Do not steal . Do not want things that belong to other people . These laws and others are all in this one law : Love your neighbour as you love yourself .
45013010	Anyone who loves his neighbour will do no wrong to him . So love does all that the law says to do .
45013011	In all this you know what a special time it is . It is time now for you to wake up from your sleep . The time when we will be saved is nearer to us now than when we first believed .
45013012	The night is almost past . Morning is near . Let us stop doing the wrong things people do in the dark . Let us do the good things that people do in the light .
45013013	Let us live in the right way like people who are in the light . We must not take part in noisy feasting with dancing , or get drunk . We must not do any kind of wrong thing with sex . We must not quarrel or be jealous .
45013014	But you must take the Lord Jesus Christ into your hearts . And do not plan to do the wrong things your bodies want to do .
45014001	Be ready to take a person into the church even if he does not know and believe all you believe . Do not judge what he thinks about things .
45014002	One person believes he may eat anything . Another person , who does not believe that , eats only things that grow in the garden .
45014003	The one who eats anything must not despise the one who does not eat everything . And the one who does not eat must not judge the person who does . God has accepted him as he is .
45014004	Why do you judge another persons servant ? He stands or he falls before his own master . But he will stand because the Lord can give him power to stand .
45014005	One man thinks , This day is better than that day . But another man thinks , All days are alike . Every man should be sure in his own mind what he believes .
45014006	One man honours the day to honour the Lord; another man does not honour the day to honour the Lord . The person who eats everything , eats it because he honours the Lord . And he thanks God . And the person who will not eat every kind of food also does so to honour the Lord . And he still gives thanks to God .
45014007	Not one of us lives for himself . And not one of us dies for himself .
45014008	If we live , we live for the Lord . And if we die , we die for the Lord . So then , if we live or if we die we belong to the Lord .
45014009	Christ wanted to be Lord , both of dead people and of living people . That is why he died and lived again .
45014010	Why do you judge your brother ? Or why do you despise your brother ? We shall all stand before God to be judged .
45014011	The holy writings say , The Lord says , " As sure as I live , every knee will bow to me . Every tongue will praise God . "
45014012	So each of us will tell God about what he has done .
45014013	So we must not judge each other any longer . But it is better for us to judge this . Never put anything in a brothers way that will hurt him or that will make him fall down .
45014014	As a Christian , I know and believe that nothing in itself is not right to eat . But it is not right for anyone to eat who thinks it is not right to eat .
45014015	Does what you eat trouble your brother ? If it does , you are no longer living in love . Do not destroy the faith of someone because of what you eat . Christ died for him .
45014016	What is good for you must not be something that other people say is wrong .
45014017	The kingdom of God is not about what a person eats and drinks . But it is about living in a way which is right with God . It is peace . It is joy because a person has the Holy Spirit .
45014018	A person who does the work of Christ in this way pleases God . And people like him .
45014019	But we must do the things that make peace and that help each other to do better .
45014020	Do not spoil what God has done because you want some food . Everything is right . But it is wrong for anyone to eat anything if that will make his brother fall .
45014021	The right thing is to eat no meat , and drink no wine , and not do anything that makes your brother fall .
45014022	Keep to yourself and God what you believe about these things . God blesses a man who does not feel he has done wrong when he did what he thought was right .
45014023	But a man who is not sure that he should eat something , does wrong if he eats it . That is because he does not believe the thing he is doing is right to do . And it is wrong to do what you do not believe is right .
45015001	We who are strong must help those who are not strong . We must not do what pleases us .
45015002	But each of us must please his neighbour . He must do what is good for him and what will help him do better .
45015003	Christ did not please himself . But the holy writings say , I took upon myself the wrong things that people said against you .
45015004	Everything that is in the holy writings was written to teach us . They give hope and strength when we have troubles . The holy writings comfort our hearts .
45015005	God gives people power to take their troubles and he comforts their hearts . I ask him to help you to think the same way as Christ did .
45015006	Then , together you will praise the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
45015007	So , accept one another , as Christ has accepted you . Then people will know that God is great .
45015008	What I say is this . Christ came to serve the Jews . He did this to prove that what God said was true . He proved that God kept his promises to the fathers .
45015009	He did this so that people who are not Jews would praise God because he is kind . The holy writings say , So I will praise you among the people who are not Jews . I will sing songs to your name .
45015010	The holy writings also say , People who are not Jews , be glad with those who are Gods people .
45015011	And they also say , People who are not Jews , praise the Lord . All peoples should praise him .
45015012	Also , Isaiah says , Someone from Jesses family will come . He will come to rule the people who are not Jews . People who are not Jews will have hope in him .
45015013	God gives hope . May he make you very happy . May he give you peace because you believe . Then the power of the Holy Spirit will give you much hope .
45015014	My brothers , I myself believe that you are very good people . I believe that you know many things and are able to teach one another .
45015015	I have written strong words to you . There are some things I want you to remember . I have written because of the gift God has given to me .
45015016	I am a servant of Christ Jesus to the people who are not Jews . I am like a priest to them , to tell them Gods good news . Then I offer the people to God . That pleases God . They have been accepted by him and made holy by the Holy Spirit .
45015017	So , because of Christ Jesus , I am proud of my work for God .
45015018	I will speak only of what Christ has done through me . People who are not Jews have obeyed the good news . They have obeyed because of what I told them and because of what I did .
45015019	I had the power to do signs and wonderful things through the power of the Holy Spirit . So I have told the good news of Christ all the way from the city of Jerusalem to the country of Illyricum .
45015020	I have wanted to tell the good news where people have not heard the name of Christ . I did not want to work where another man had started to work .
45015021	The holy writings say , They were not told about him , but they will see him . And the people who have not heard of him will understand .
45015022	So I have been stopped many times from coming to you .
45015023	But now , I am no longer needed to work in these places . And I have wanted for many years to come to you .
45015024	When I go to the country of Spain , I hope to see you on my way there . I hope you will help me on my way to that place . But first I will be happy to be with you for a little while .
45015025	But now I am going to Jerusalem with a gift to help Gods people .
45015026	The people of Macedonia and Achaia wanted to send a gift to help Gods people in Jerusalem who are poor .
45015027	They wanted to do it , and they should do it for them . The Jews gave the people who were not Jews the good things their spirits need . So the people who were not Jews should give the Jews the good things their bodies need .
45015028	I will finish doing this , and I will give them what the people send them . Then I will go by you on my way to Spain .
45015029	And I know that when I come to you , I will bring great blessings from Christ .
45015030	My brothers , I ask you to do this for the sake of the Lord Jesus Christ and because the Spirit has given you love . Talk to God for me . And I also will talk to him .
45015031	Ask him to save me from the people in Judea who do not believe . Ask him that the gift I take to Jerusalem may please Gods people there .
45015032	Ask him to let me come to you and have a good time with you .
45015033	God gives peace . I ask that he will be with you all . He will !
45016001	I want to tell you good things about our sister Phoebe . She helps in the church in Cenchrea .
45016002	I want you to take her in because she is a Christian . That is what Gods people should do . Help her in any way she needs help . She has helped many people and has helped me too .
45016003	I send greetings to Priscilla and Aquila , who worked with me for Christ Jesus .
45016004	They almost died to save me . I am not the only one who thanks them . All the churches who are not Jews thank them also .
45016005	Give my greetings also to the church in their house . Give my greetings also to dear Epaenetus . He was the first person in Asia Minor to believe in Christ .
45016006	Give my greetings to Mary . She worked hard to help us .
45016007	Give my greetings to Andronicus and Junia . They belong to my family . We were in prison together . The apostles think they are good men . They were Christians before I was .
45016008	Give my greetings to Amplias . I love him because he is a Christian .
45016009	Give my greetings to Urbanus . He worked with us for Christ . Give my greetings to dear Stachys also .
45016010	Give my greetings to Apelles . He has proved himself to be a Christian . Give my greetings to the family of Aristobulus .
45016011	Give my greetings to Herodion . He belongs to my family . Give my greetings to the family of Narcissus . They are Christians .
45016012	Give my greetings to Tryphena and Tryphosa . They worked for the Lord . Give my greetings to dear Persis . She has worked hard for the Lord .
45016013	Give my greetings to Rufus . The Lord chose him . Give my greetings also to his mother who is like a mother to me .
45016014	Give my greetings to Asyncritus , Phlegon , Hermas , Patrobas , Hermes , and the brothers who are with them .
45016015	Give my greetings to Philologus , Julia , Nereus , and his sister , and Olympas , and all Gods people who are with them .
45016016	Greet one another with a holy kiss . All the Christian churches send greetings to you .
45016017	Brothers , I ask you to do this . Watch the people who make quarrels . They make people do wrong because they teach things you have not been taught . Have nothing to do with those people .
45016018	Those people do not work for our Lord Jesus Christ . They work only for themselves . With their words of praise they fool people who do not know what is wrong .
45016019	People everywhere know that you obey . I am very happy about you . I want you to be wise and know what is right . I want you to know nothing about what is wrong .
45016020	God gives peace . He will soon crush Satan under your feet . May our Lord Jesus Christ bless you .
45016021	Timothy sends you greetings . He worked with me . Luke , Jason , and Sosipater send you greetings . They belong to my family .
45016022	( I , Tertius , send you Christian greetings . I am writing this letter for Paul . )
45016023	Gaius sends you greetings . I am staying in his house . The whole church that meets in his house sends you greetings too . Erastus sends greetings to you . He takes care of the money for the city . Our brother Quartus sends you greetings .
45016024	I ask our Lord Jesus Christ to show you his loving kindness . He will !
45016025	Praise God ! He is able to make you stand firm . That is the good news that I tell . That is what the message about Jesus Christ says . The message was kept secret for a long time in the past . But it has now been made known .
45016026	The books of the prophets have told this message . The God who lives for ever told the prophets to write this message so that all the people who are not Jews will believe and obey .
45016027	God is the only one who is wise . Praise him for ever because of Jesus Christ . Yes , it is so !
46001001	I am Paul . God called me to be an apostle of Jesus Christ . He did this because he wanted to .
46001002	Our Christian brother Sosthenes and I send greetings to the people who are the church of God in the city of Corinth . You are people whom Christ Jesus has made holy . You , too , are chosen to be Gods people . And we send greetings to all the people everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ . He is their Lord , just as he is our Lord .
46001003	May God show you his kindness and peace which come from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
46001004	I am always thanking God for the blessings he has given you through Jesus Christ .
46001005	He has made you rich in all ways , in all that you say and in all you know .
46001006	Christ has done for you just what he promised to do .
46001007	You have every blessing you need while you wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to come again .
46001008	And right to the end Jesus Christ will surely keep you safe . Then no one will find anything wrong about you on the day our Lord Jesus Christ comes .
46001009	God never fails anyone . It is he who called you to belong to his Son , Jesus Christ our Lord .
46001010	My Christian brothers , I beg you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , agree in what you say . Do not divide into groups . You should all think in the same way and decide to do the same things .
46001011	My brothers , I say this because I have been told by some of Chloes family that you are quarrelling .
46001012	This is what I mean . Some of you say , I belong to Paul . Others say , I belong to Apollos . And others say , I belong to Cephas . And yet others say , I belong to Christ .
46001013	Is Christ divided ? Was Paul nailed to the cross for you ? No ! Were you baptized in Pauls name ? No !
46001014	I thank God that I did not baptize any of you but Crispus and Gaius .
46001015	So no one can say you were baptized in my name .
46001016	( However , I also baptized the people of the house of Stephanas . I do not know of any one else that I baptized . )
46001017	Christ did not send me to baptize people , but he sent me to tell the good news . I must not tell it with the clever words of this world . That would not show what the death of Christ on a cross truly means .
46001018	When people who are turning away from God hear about the cross , they say , That is foolish ! But for us who are being saved , the cross is the power God uses to save us .
46001019	God says in the holy writings , I will fool the wise people . I will bring to nothing the understanding of the clever people .
46001020	Where are your wise people , the men who know books , the men who like to talk about the things of this world ? God has shown that the clever things of this world are nothing .
46001021	God is wise . But the people of the world were not wise enough to know God . So he chose to save people who believe the good news that we tell them , even though the good news may seem to be foolish .
46001022	The Jews say , We must see a sign . Those who are not Jews say , We want something we can understand .
46001023	But we tell people about Christ who died on a cross . The leaders of the Jews do not like this , and those who are not Jews laugh at it .
46001024	But some have been called by God . They are chosen , both Jews and other people . Christ is Gods power to save them . This shows how wise he is .
46001025	When God seems foolish , he is more wise than men . When God seems weak , he is stronger than men .
46001026	My brothers , remember what you were when God chose you . Not many of you were wise by the way people look at it . Not many of you had power . Not many of you came from a family with a big name .
46001027	But God chose things that look foolish to the people of the world . He has used those foolish things to put the wise people to shame . God chose the weak things to put to shame the strong people .
46001028	And God chose the small things , things that people despise . Yes , he chose even the things which seem to be nothing . He did this to destroy the big things .
46001029	He did this so that people would not be proud before God .
46001030	You are Gods children through Christ Jesus . Christ came from God and made us wise . He put us right with God . He made us holy . He set us free from our wrong ways .
46001031	Just as the holy writings say , No one should be proud of anything but of the Lord .
46002001	So , my brothers , when I came to you , I did not come to tell you Gods message in big or wise words .
46002002	I made up my mind that I would talk about only one thing while I was with you . That one thing was Jesus Christ and his death on a cross .
46002003	I was weak , afraid , and trembling when I visited you .
46002004	My words and my message were not in wise words to win you . But the power of the Spirit of God proved my words to be true .
46002005	I did this so that you would not believe because of mans wise words , but you would believe because of Gods power .
46002006	However , our words are wise words to those who really believe . But they are not the kind of wise words that the people of this world speak . They are not the kind of wise words that the rulers of this world speak . Those rulers will die .
46002007	Our wise words are Gods wise words about things people do not understand . Before God made the world he planned those things for our glory and blessing .
46002008	None of the rulers of this world knew about these things . If they had , they would not have killed on a cross the Lord who was full of Gods glory .
46002009	The holy writings say , No eye has seen the things God has made ready for those who love him . No ear has heard about them . No persons heart has ever thought of them .
46002010	God has shown these things to us by his Spirit . The Spirit understands everything , even the things that God has kept secret .
46002011	The only one who really knows what a person is thinking is the spirit of the person himself . So also , no one knows what God is thinking , only the Spirit of God .
46002012	We have not received the spirit of the world . But we have received the Spirit of God . In this way we may understand the blessings which God has freely given to us .
46002013	We do not tell you these things in wise words which men taught us . But the Holy Spirit taught us . We teach things about the Spirit which we know about through the Spirit .
46002014	The person who does not have the Spirit does not receive the blessings of the Spirit of God . He thinks they are foolish . He cannot understand them because only people who have the Spirit of God can test them .
46002015	He who has the Spirit of God tests all things . But others cannot test him .
46002016	The holy writings say : Who knows the mind of the Lord so that he may teach him ? As for us , we really do have the mind of Christ .
46003001	My brothers , I could not talk to you at first as to people who have the Spirit of God . But I talked to you as people who have the spirit of this world . I talked to you as people who are very new-born , baby Christians .
46003002	I gave you milk to drink , not food to eat . You were not ready for food . And even now you are not ready for it .
46003003	You still have the spirit of this world in you . You are jealous of each other and you are quarrelling . The spirit of this world is still in you and you live like people of this world .
46003004	One says , I belong to Paul . Another says , I belong to Apollos . Does not that show that you have the spirit of this world ?
46003005	After all , who is Apollos ? And who is Paul ? We both work for God . You believed because of the work we did . The Lord gave each of us our work to do .
46003006	I planted the seed . Apollos put water on the seed . But God made the seed grow .
46003007	So then the man who plants is nothing and the man who waters is nothing . God alone makes the seed grow .
46003008	The man who plants and the man who waters are equal . Each one will be paid for his own work .
46003009	We work together for God . You are Gods farm . You are Gods house .
46003010	I built the lower walls of the house because God showed me the best way to do it . Now another man builds on top of this foundation . Each man must take care how he builds on it .
46003011	Jesus Christ himself is the foundation . No one can make another one .
46003012	People build with gold , silver , very fine stones , wood , grass , or straw on top of the foundation .
46003013	But the day will come when everyones work can be seen . Their work will be tested by fire and the fire will show what kind of work each one did .
46003014	If the work a man did is not burned up in the fire , he will be paid for his work .
46003015	But if a mans work is burned up , he will lose everything . He himself will be saved , like a man pulled out of the fire .
46003016	You know that you are Gods house . The spirit of God lives in you .
46003017	God will punish anyone who spoils his house . His house is holy , and you are the house .
46003018	Do not be fooled . If any one of you thinks that he is wise in the things of this world , he should count himself as not being wise . Then he would really be wise .
46003019	The things that look wise to the people of this world look foolish to God . The holy writings say , He catches the wise people in their own tricks .
46003020	It also says , The Lord knows that the wise mens thoughts are good for nothing .
46003021	So do not be proud of men . Everything belongs to you .
46003022	Paul , Apollos , Peter , the world , life , death , the things which are now , and the things which are to come , everything is yours !
46003023	And you belong to Christ and Christ belongs to God !
46004001	People should look at us as men who are servants of Christ . We take care of the secret things of God .
46004002	A man who takes care of things must be a person his master can trust .
46004003	As for me , I care very little what you think about me or how any man judges me . I do not even judge myself .
46004004	I do not know of anything wrong in me , but that does not say I am right . The Lord is my judge .
46004005	So do not judge me before it is time . Wait until the Lord comes . The things which have been kept hidden in the dark he will bring out into the light . He will show what is in peoples hearts . At that time God will tell each man how good his work is .
46004006	My brothers , I have said these things about Apollos and myself so that you will learn from us to live the way the holy writings say . Then you will not be proud and say , This teacher is better than that one .
46004007	If you are better , who made you that way ? Everything you have was given to you . So then , why are you proud of it ? Was it not given to you ?
46004008	So you think you now have everything you need and are rich ! You think you are kings and do not need us ! I wish that you really were kings . Then we would be kings along with you .
46004009	It seems to me that God has put us apostles at the end of the line . We are like men who are to be put to death . The whole world , angels and men , look at us .
46004010	We are fools for Christs sake ! But you think Christ has made you wise . We are weak , but you are strong ! You have glory , we have shame !
46004011	Even now we are hungry and thirsty . We need clothes . We are beaten and we have no home .
46004012	We work hard with our hands . People curse us , but we bless them . They trouble us much , but we must take it .
46004013	They talk behind our backs , but we still try to win them . People treat us as a dirt pile , the rubbish of the world . And they still do these things .
46004014	I do not write these things to make you ashamed . But you are my dear children and I want to teach you .
46004015	Even if you have ten thousand people to take care of you as Christians , yet you do not have many fathers . I am your Christian father because I brought you the good news .
46004016	So I beg you , do as I do .
46004017	That is why I am sending Timothy to you . I love Timothy very much . He is my Christian son . I can trust him . He will tell you again my Christian ways of living . I teach these same ways in every church meeting everywhere .
46004018	Some of you are proud of yourselves . You think I am not coming to visit you .
46004019	But I will come soon if it is the Lords will . Then I will find , not the talk of those proud people , but their power .
46004020	The place where God rules is not a matter of talk , but of power .
46004021	Which do you want ? Shall I come to you with a stick to beat you , or shall I come with love and a kind spirit ?
46005001	I have heard a very bad report about you . I hear there are wrong sexual ways among you . Even the people who are not Jews do not allow wrong sex such as this among them . A man is living with his fathers wife !
46005002	Can it be that you are still proud ? This should make you very sad . The man who has done this should be put out of the church meeting .
46005003	My body is not with you , but my spirit is . Just as if I were right there , I have decided what to do about the man who did such a thing as this .
46005004	Do this in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ . When you meet together my spirit will be with you . Then , with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ , give this man over to Satan . Let Satan punish his body . By this the mans spirit may yet be saved when the Lord Jesus comes .
46005005	Surely it is not right for you to be proud . Do you not know that only a little yeast in the bread will make all the bread rise ?
46005006	Clean out the old yeast so that you will become like new bread . You are free from the old things . Christ , the Passover Lamb , has been killed for us .
46005007	Let us then remember the feast of Passover and have our bread . But let us not have our feast with old yeast in the bread . To do bad and wrong things is like that old yeast . But let us have it with new bread that has no old yeast in it . To be honest and true is like the new bread .
46005008	I wrote a letter to you . I told you not to be friends with people who use sex the wrong way [ with a person they are not married to ] .
46005009	I did not mean the people of the world [ people who are not Christians ] - some of them use sex the wrong way; or always want more things; or steal; or worship idols . To keep away from them altogether would mean you would have to go out of the world .
46005010	But I wrote to you not to be friends with anyone who says he is a Christian and uses wrong sex , or always wants more , or has idols , or curses , or drinks too much strong drink , or steals . I told you not even to sit down to eat with such a person .
46005011	Why should I judge the people who are outside the church ? You are to judge the church people .
46005012	God judges those who are outside . The holy writings say , Send the bad person away from among you .
46005013	missing fehlt/missing
46006001	When one of you has some complaint against a Christian brother , why does he take him to be judged by those who are not Christians ? Why does he not take him to Gods people ?
46006002	Do you not know that some day Gods people will judge the world ? If you are going to judge the world , can you not judge small things now ?
46006003	Do you not know that we shall judge angels ? Then we should surely be able to judge things in this life !
46006004	So if you have complaints about things in this life , why do you take them to those who are not church people ?
46006005	Shame on you ! Are none of you wise enough to judge between two Christian brothers ?
46006006	But now one Christian brother takes another Christian brother to be judged by people who are not Christians .
46006007	It is wrong for you to take each other to court at all . You should be willing to take wrong . It would be better to lose .
46006008	Instead , you are doing wrong to your own Christian brothers .
46006009	Do you not know that bad people will have no part in the kingdom where God rules ? Do not be fooled . There are some people who will not have part in that place . They are those who commit adultery of any kind , those who have idols , or steal , or are always wanting more , or talk wrong things about people , or drink plenty of strong drink , or take things by force , or curse .
46006011	Some of you were like that . But now you have been washed and made holy . The Spirit of our God has made you right by the name of the Lord Jesus .
46006012	I am free to do anything I want , but some things are not good for me to do . I am free to do anything , but I will not become a slave of anything .
46006013	Food is for the body , and the body is for food . But God will bring both to an end . The body is not made to be used for wrong sex behaviour , but for the Lord . And the Lord is for the body .
46006014	God raised up the Lord and he will also raise us up by his power .
46006015	Do you not know that your bodies belong to Christ ? Shall I take parts of Christ and join them to a bad woman ? No , never !
46006016	Do you not know that the person who joins himself to a bad woman becomes one person with her ? The holy writings say , The two people shall be like one body .
46006017	But the one who joins himself with the Lord becomes one spirit with him .
46006018	Run away from every kind of wrong sex ! Every other wrong thing which a person does is done outside of his body . But the person who uses sex the wrong way does a wrong thing to his own body .
46006019	Do you not know that your body is the house of the Holy Spirit who lives in you ? God gave the Holy Spirit to you . Remember , you do not belong to yourself .
46006020	But you were bought and paid for . So then , bring glory to God with your bodies .
46007001	You wrote me a letter . Here is my answer to the things in the letter . It is good if a man has nothing to do with a woman .
46007002	But wrong sex is always a danger to us . So it is better for each man to have his own wife and each woman to have her own husband .
46007003	The husband should give his wife what is right . So also , the wife should give her husband what is right .
46007004	The wife does not have full right over her own body . But her husband has a right to it . In the same way , the husband does not have full right over his own body . But his wife has a right to it .
46007005	Do not keep from the other what is right for them to have . It is all right to stay from each other for a while , if you both agree to it . Then you will have time for prayer . Afterwards , come together again . If you do not , Satan might tempt you to do wrong .
46007006	I say you may do this . I do not say that you must do it .
46007007	I wish that all men were like I am . But God has made everyone different . One man can live one way and another man can live another way .
46007008	Here is what I say to those who are not married and to those whose husbands are dead . It is good for them to stay the way I am .
46007009	But if they cannot keep themselves under control , then they should marry . It is better to marry than to burn with desire for sex .
46007010	And here is what I say to those who are married . ( And yet it is not what I say . It is what the Lord has said . ) The wife may not leave her husband .
46007011	But if she does leave him , she must not marry again , or she must come back to her husband again . And the husband may not send away his wife .
46007012	Here is what I say to other people . ( This is my word , not the Lords . ) Perhaps a Christian brother has a wife who is not a Christian . If she wants to stay with him , then he should not send her away .
46007013	Perhaps a woman has a husband who is not a Christian . If he wants to stay with her , then the woman should not leave him .
46007014	The husband who is not a Christian is made holy by the wife . And the wife who is not a Christian is made holy by the husband . If this were not so , then your children would not be holy . But they are holy .
46007015	If the one who is not a Christian really wants to leave , let him go . The Christian husband or wife is free then . God has called us to live in peace .
46007016	Wife , you do not know . Perhaps you will win your husband to the Lord . Husband , you do not know . Perhaps you will win your wife to the Lord .
46007017	Only let me say this . Every man should go on living in the way which the Lord chooses for him . He should go on as he was when God called him to be a Christian . I say this to people in all the churches .
46007018	If a man was already circumcised when God called him , he should not try to change the marks of it . If a man was not circumcised when God called him , he should not be circumcised .
46007019	It does not matter whether one is circumcised or not . The thing that matters is doing what God says we must do .
46007020	Everyone should stay the way he was when God called him .
46007021	If you were a slave when God called you , do not let that trouble you . But if there is some way for you to get free , then do so .
46007022	If a man was a slave when the Lord called him , he is the Lords free man . So also if a man was free when he was called , he is Christs slave .
46007023	You were bought and paid for . Do not become slaves of men !
46007024	So , Christian brothers , everyone should go on living as he was when God called him . But now he lives with God .
46007025	Here is what I say about those who are not married . ( I have no law from the Lord about this . But here is what I think . You can trust me because the Lord has helped me . )
46007026	I think that , since there is now trouble in the world , it is good for each one to stay as he is .
46007027	If you have married a wife , do not try to be free from her . If you have no wife , do not look for one .
46007028	But , if you marry , it is not wrong . And if a woman marries , it is not wrong . People who marry will have trouble in this life . And I want to keep you out of it .
46007029	Here , my brothers , is what I mean . The time is short . In the time that is left , men who have wives should live as though they did not .
46007030	People who cry should live as though they were not sad . People who laugh should live as though they were not glad . People who buy things should live as though they did not own them .
46007031	And people who are busy with things in this world should not be too busy . The world as we see it is passing away .
46007032	I want your minds to be free . The man who is not married thinks about the things of the Lord . He tries to please the Lord .
46007033	But the man who is married thinks about the things of this world . He tries to please his wife .
46007034	In the same way , there is a difference between the woman who is married and the one who is not . The woman who is not married thinks about the things of the Lord . She wants her body and her spirit to be holy . But the married woman thinks about the things of this life . She tries to please her husband .
46007035	I say this to help you , not to make it hard for you . I want to show you what is good . I do not want anything to stop you from serving the Lord .
46007036	And if a man feels that he is doing the right thing for the woman he is to marry , then let him marry her . That is , if she is no longer young , and if he wants her very much . Then he must do as he thinks best . It is not wrong for him to do it .
46007037	But the man who has made up his mind not to marry his woman will do well . That is , if he does not have to marry her , and is able to control himself , and if he is sure about it in his own mind .
46007038	So the man who marries his woman will do what is good . But the man who does not marry her will do better .
46007039	A wife may not leave her husband as long as he is living . But if he dies , she is free to marry any man she wants . Only this , he must be a Christian .
46007040	But I think that she is happier if she stays as she is and does not marry again . ( I think too that I am saying what the Spirit of God wants me to say in this matter . )
46008001	Now here is what I say about food given to idols . We all know something about this matter . Yet knowledge makes us proud . Love is the real teacher .
46008002	If anyone thinks he knows much , then he does not know what he really should know .
46008003	But if anyone loves God , then God knows him .
46008004	So here is what I say about eating food that has been given to idols or false gods . We know that an idol really is nothing in this world . There is only one true and living God .
46008005	There are things in the sky and on earth which are called gods . Yes , there are many gods and lords .
46008006	Yet for us there is only one God . He is the Father . All things come from him . He is the one for whom we live . And there is only one Lord . He is Jesus Christ . He made all things . He is the one who gives us life .
46008007	But not every Christian knows these things . Some of them have always believed in idols . And when they eat food which has been given to an idol , they think the food belongs to the idol . And because they are weak Christians they feel they do wrong when they eat it .
46008008	One thing is sure , food will not bring us closer to God . If we eat it , it will not make us right with God . And if we do not eat , it will not make us wrong .
46008009	Perhaps you feel it is all right for you to do it . But be careful ! It might make the weak Christian do wrong .
46008010	You know it is not wrong for you to eat these things . But if a weak Christian sees you eating in the idols house , he will also want to eat food that has been given to an idol . He will do what is against his own belief .
46008011	You know the truth , and yet your knowledge will make your weak brother do wrong . You have hurt the faith of a brother , for whom Christ died .
46008012	In this way you do wrong to your brother . You hurt him because he is weak . And in so doing you do wrong to Christ .
46008013	If eating such food makes my brother do wrong , I will never eat it . I do not want my brother to do wrong .
46009001	Am I not free ? Am I not an apostle ? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord ? Are you people not proof of the work I do for the Lord ?
46009002	If other people do not call me an apostle , yet surely I am an apostle to you . You people are the proof that I am an apostle for the Lord .
46009003	Here is what I say to the people who say wrong things about me .
46009004	Do we not have the right to eat and drink ?
46009005	Do we not have the right to have a Christian wife with us as do the other apostles , and the brothers of our Lord , and Cephas ?
46009006	Must Barnabas and I work for our living though the other apostles do not ?
46009007	What soldier pays for his own food when he goes to war ? Who plants a garden and does not eat what grows in it ? Who takes care of animals and does not get any of the milk ?
46009008	Am I saying only what men say ? Does not Gods law also say the same ?
46009009	Moses wrote in his books of the law of God , Do not tie shut the mouth of an ox when it is treading the grain . Does God care about the oxen ?
46009010	Does he not say this altogether for our sakes ? Yes , he said it for our sakes . There are people who plough the ground and beat the grain . They do this work because they believe they will have a part of the food for themselves .
46009011	We have planted seed by teaching you the good things of the Spirit . So we should receive something from you to help us to pay for our living .
46009012	If it is right for other teachers to receive something from you , then we have more of a right to receive it . But we did not use our right . Instead , we do anything we can so that we will not stop the good news of Christ from going out .
46009013	You know there are men who do the work in the temple . They get their food from the temple . Those who help to make sacrifices in the temple get a part of the sacrifice .
46009014	It is the same with those who work telling the good news . The Lord said they should get their living from that work .
46009015	And I am not writing this to ask you to do these things for me . I would rather die ! It is something I am proud of , and no one shall take it away from me .
46009016	My telling the good news is not something for me to be proud of . It is something I must do . Yes , it would be very , very wrong for me if I did not tell the good news .
46009017	If I do it because I want to do it , I get my pay . But if I do not want to do it , it is still my duty to do it .
46009018	So what is my pay ? My pay is to tell the good news and not be paid for it ! That is why I do not use my right to take pay for telling the good news .
46009019	Even though I am no ones slave , yet I have made myself a slave to everyone . I have done this so that I might win more people to Christ .
46009020	When I was with the Jews , I lived like the Jews , so that I might win the Jews to Christ . I was not under the law . But I lived as if I was under the law of the Jews . I did this so that I might win to Christ those who are under the law .
46009021	When I was with those who do not have the law of the Jews , I lived as if I did not have the law of the Jews . I did this so that I might win them also . Of course , I myself have laws . I follow the laws of Christ .
46009022	When I was with weak people , I lived like a weak person . I did this so that I might win weak people to Christ . I lived like all kinds of people to save some of them .
46009023	I do all this for the good news , so that I also will have some of its blessing .
46009024	You know when people are running a race , they all run . But only one man will win . The way you should run is to run to win .
46009025	Everyone who wants to show his strength must control himself in every way . They do it for a prize that will spoil . But what we do , we do for a reward that will never , never spoil .
46009026	So I do not run as if I did not know where I was going . And I do not fight like a man just beating the air .
46009027	But I control my own body really well . I make my body obey me . After telling others the good news , I myself do not want to be left out .
46010001	My brothers , here is something you should know . Long ago , all our fathers were led by the cloud of God over them . They all went through the Red Sea .
46010002	It was as if they were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea .
46010003	They all ate the same food from the Spirit .
46010004	They all drank the same water sent by the Spirit . The water they drank came from a Rock of the Spirit which went with them . That Rock was Christ .
46010005	But God was not pleased with most of them . They died in the wilderness .
46010006	This teaches us not to want wrong things as they did .
46010007	Do not worship idols , as some of them did . The holy writings say , The people sat down to eat and drink . Then they got up and danced .
46010008	We must not use sex the wrong way as some of them did . Twenty-three thousand people died in one day !
46010009	We must not test the Lord , as some of them did . They were bitten by bad snakes and died !
46010010	Do not grumble , as some of them did . They were killed by the Angel of Death !
46010011	These things happened to them to teach other people . They were written in the holy writings to teach us who are living in the last days of the world .
46010012	Therefore , when a person thinks , I am strong; I can stand , let that person be careful , or he will fall .
46010013	No testing has come to you that other people do not have . But God will not fail you . He will not allow the testing to be too hard for you . No . When the testing comes , God will make a way out for you , so that you can go through the testing .
46010014	So then , my dear brothers , do not worship idols .
46010015	I talk to you as people with good sense . Decide for yourselves about what I say .
46010016	We ask God to bless the cup at the Lords supper . When we drink from this cup it means that the blood of Christ is for us all . We break the bread . When we eat this bread , it means that the body of Christ is for us all .
46010017	The bread is all one loaf . In the same way , we are many people but we are one body . We all eat from the same loaf .
46010018	See what the Jews do . Those who eat the sacrifices all eat things that are sacrificed .
46010019	What do I mean by saying this ? Is the food that has been given to idols really something holy ? Or is an idol really something like God ?
46010020	No . What I mean is this . Those people give the food to bad spirits and not to God . I do not want you to have anything to do with bad spirits .
46010021	You cannot drink from the cup of the Lord and from the cup of bad spirits . You cannot eat food at the table of the Lord and at the table of bad spirits .
46010022	Do we want to make the Lord jealous ? Are we stronger than he is ? No !
46010023	We are free to do anything we want to do . Yes , but some things do not make people better . It is better if we do not do such things .
46010024	A person must not think only of himself . But he should think of the other person as well .
46010025	Eat any meat that is sold at the market . Do not ask any questions about it because you think , Is it wrong to eat it ?
46010026	The holy writings say , The earth belongs to the Lord and everything that is in it .
46010027	If one who is not a believer asks you to come and eat , if you want to go , then eat the food he gives you . Do not ask any questions about it because you fear it might be wrong to eat it .
46010028	But if anyone says to you , This food has been given to an idol , then do not eat it . Do not eat it because of the one who told you and because it might seem wrong . I mean it might seem wrong , not to you , but to him .
46010029	Since I am free , is it wrong for me to eat just because someone else thinks it is ?
46010030	I thank God for my food . So why should anyone say it is wrong for me to eat what I thank God for ?
46010031	So , whether you eat , or drink , or whatever you do , do everything to bring praise to God .
46010032	Do nothing that will make Jews , or Greeks , or those who belong to the church of God , turn away from God .
46010033	I , also , try to please everyone in all I do . I do not think of what will be good for me , but I think of what will be good for many people . I want them to be saved .
46011001	Do as I do , for I am doing as Christ did .
46011002	You are doing well . You remember everything I told you . And you are doing what I taught you to do .
46011003	But I want you to know this . Christ is the head of every man . The husband is the head of the wife . And God is the head of Christ .
46011004	Any man who talks to God or speaks words from God with his head covered brings shame on his head .
46011005	But any woman who talks to God or speaks words from God with her head not covered brings shame on her head . She is just the same as a woman who has cut off all her hair .
46011006	If a woman does not cover her head , she might as well cut off her hair . But if it is a shame for a woman to cut off her hair , or to shave her head , then she should have her head covered .
46011007	A man does not need to cover his head because he was made like God is . Man is Gods glory . Woman is mans glory .
46011008	Man was not made from woman , but woman was made from man .
46011009	And man was not made for woman , but woman was made for man .
46011010	She should show this by having her head covered , because of the angels .
46011011	But the Lord did not make woman without man , and he did not make man without woman .
46011012	As woman comes from man , so man is born by woman . And everything comes from God .
46011013	What do you think ? Does it look right for a woman to talk to God in public with her head not covered ?
46011014	It would be a shame for a man to have long hair . Everyone knows this .
46011015	But long hair is something for the woman to be proud of . Her hair has been given to her for a covering .
46011016	Does anyone still want to quarrel about this matter ? This is what we do . And this is what the churches of God do also .
46011017	In the next thing I have to talk about , I cannot say that you are doing well . Your meeting together is more bad than good .
46011018	First , I hear that in the church meeting you divide yourselves into groups . I think this may be true .
46011019	You also have groups of people who do not think the same way . Because of them you will soon learn which people please God the most .
46011020	When you meet together , it is not the Lords supper that you eat .
46011021	People take their own food and eat it without waiting . One gets nothing to eat . Another person drinks too much .
46011022	Do you not have your own homes where you can eat and drink ? Do you have no respect for the church of God ? Do you want to make poor people ashamed ? What shall I say to you ? Shall I say you are doing well ? No , you are not doing well in this matter !
46011023	The Lord gave me what I taught you . This is what it was . On the night when the Lord Jesus was sold to his enemies , he took bread .
46011024	He thanked God for it . Then he broke it and said , Take this bread and eat it . This is my body which is broken for you . Do this so that you will remember me .
46011025	In the same way , after they had eaten , he took the cup . He said , This cup is the new agreement made by my blood . Every time you drink from this cup , do it to remember me .
46011026	Every time you eat this bread and drink from this cup you tell about the Lords death , until he comes again .
46011027	So then , when anyone eats the bread and drinks from the cup in a way that is not right , he has done wrong to the body and blood of the Lord .
46011028	Each one must look into his own heart carefully . When he has done that , he may eat the bread and drink from the cup .
46011029	The person who eats and drinks in a wrong way will be punished . He does not take it as the Lords body .
46011030	That is why many of you are weak and sick . Many have died .
46011031	But if we took time to look into our hearts first , then we would not be punished .
46011032	When we are punished , the Lord is teaching us to do right , so that we will not be punished with the rest of the people of the world .
46011033	So , my Christian brothers , when you come together to eat the Lords supper , wait on your turn .
46011034	If a man is hungry , he should eat at home . Then when you meet , you will not be found in the wrong . There are other matters . I will talk about them when I come to see you .
46012001	Now , my Christian brothers , I want you to know something about the gifts given by the Holy Spirit .
46012002	You know that before you believed in God , you were led by other men to believe in idols that could not talk .
46012003	Therefore , I want you to understand this . No person who has the Spirit of God ever curses Jesus . And no one can say , Jesus is Lord , if he is not controlled by the Holy Spirit .
46012004	There are different gifts , but there is only one Spirit .
46012005	There are different kinds of work , but there is only one Lord .
46012006	There are different ways of working , but there is only one God . He works in all people and does it all .
46012007	And the Holy Spirit gives each one a gift so that all people may be helped .
46012008	The Spirit gives one person wise words to say . The same Spirit gives another person words of good understanding .
46012009	To another person the same Spirit gives faith , and to another person he gives the power to heal people .
46012010	To another person the Spirit gives the power to do big works . Another can speak words from God . To another person he gives the power to know the difference between spirits . To another person he gives the gift to speak the words of God in other tongues or languages , and to another the meaning of these different tongues .
46012011	And the same Spirit gives the power for all these things . He gives each person what he wants to give to them .
46012012	A person has only one body , and the body has many parts . It is the same with Christ .
46012013	The one Spirit baptized us all to make one body . It made no difference whether we were Jews or Greeks , whether we were slaves or free men . We were all given to drink of one Spirit .
46012014	I say again , the body is not all one part , but has many parts .
46012015	Perhaps the foot says , I am not the hand , so I do not belong to the body . But it is still a part of the body .
46012016	Perhaps the ear says , I am not the eye , so I do not belong to the body . But it is still a part of the body .
46012017	If all of the body were an eye , how could we hear ? If all the body were an ear , how could we smell ?
46012018	The way it is now , God has put each part in the body in the place he wanted it .
46012019	If they were all one part , how could it be a body ?
46012020	The way it is now , there are many parts , but it is one body .
46012021	The eye cannot say to the hand , I do not need you . And the head cannot say to the feet , I do not need you .
46012022	No , that is not so . Some parts of the body are not as strong as others . Yet we could not live without them .
46012023	And we look after some parts of our body more than others because they need it . The parts of our body that are not so fine in one way are made more fine in other ways . But the parts which are fine already do not need to be made fine . God made the body and has given more care to the parts that need it .
46012024	He did this so that the body would not be divided into groups , but all the parts would help each other . If one part has trouble , then all the other parts are troubled too . If one part is praised , then all the other parts are glad with it .
46012025	Now , all of you together are the body of Christ , and each one of you is a part of it .
46012026	God has given each person their right place in the church . First , there are the apostles . Second , there are prophets who speak words from God . Third , there are those who teach . Then there are those who do big works . Then there are those who have the gifts to heal people , those who help in the work of the church people , those who lead and guide others , and those who speak Gods words in different kinds of tongues or languages .
46012027	Are all the people apostles ? Can they all speak words from God ? Can they all teach ? Can they all do big works ?
46012028	Do they all have the gifts to heal the sick people ? Can they all speak in different tongues ? Can they all tell the meaning of these tongues ?
46012029	You should seek after the best gifts . But I will show you a way that is much better than any of them !
46012031	missing fehlt/missing
46013001	If I talk with the tongues of men and even of angels , but if I do not love people , then I am only like the sound of a big horn or a loud bell .
46013002	If I speak words from God , if I can understand all secrets , and know everything , if I can move mountains by believing , but if I do not love people , I am nothing , even though I can do all of these things .
46013003	If I give away all I have , and if I give my body to be burned , but if I do not love people , I get nothing out of it .
46013004	Love is patient and kind . Love is not jealous . Love is not proud and does not boast .
46013005	Love does not do things that are not nice . Love does not just think of itself . Love does not get angry . Love holds no wrong feelings in the heart .
46013006	Love is not glad when people do wrong things . But it is always glad when they do right .
46013007	Love forgives everything . Love is always trusting , and always hoping , and never gives up .
46013008	Love never ends . The gift of speaking words from God will end . The gift of speaking in different tongues or languages will stop . The gift of knowing many things will end .
46013009	Now we know only a little , and we can speak only a little of Gods words .
46013010	But when everything becomes perfect , that part will come to an end .
46013011	When I was a child , I talked like a child . I understood like a child . I thought like a child . But when I became a man , I stopped doing things like a child .
46013012	Now it is like looking in a looking-glass which does not make things clear . We cannot see and understand things plainly . But when things become perfect , then we shall fully know and understand everything , just as God knows .
46013013	These three things will remain for ever . They are faith , hope , and love . And love is the greatest of them .
46014001	Love is the thing you should want more than anything else . But you should also want other things the Spirit gives . You should want very much to be able to speak words from God .
46014002	The person who talks in tongues of a different language does not talk to people , but to God . People do not understand what he says . But he is saying secret things by the Spirit .
46014003	But the person who is a prophet speaks words from God to people plainly . He helps them to believe and to be strong , and he comforts them .
46014004	The person who talks in a different tongue helps himself . But the one who tells forth Gods word helps all the people in the church .
46014005	I wish that you could all talk in different tongues . But I want even more that you should speak words from God for all to hear and understand . The person who speaks words from God is greater than the person who talks in tongues-unless he is able to tell the meaning of his words , so that he helps all the people in the church .
46014006	My brothers , if I come to you and talk in tongues of a different language , how can I help you ? I cannot help you if I do not tell you something God has shown to me , or something I know , or Gods word , or some teaching .
46014007	Such things as horns or harps have no life , but they make sounds . Now if they dont make the right noise , no one will know what the sound means .
46014008	If the war drum gives a sound that has no meaning , then no one will get ready to fight .
46014009	If you say words that people cannot understand , they will not know what you say . You talk for nothing !
46014010	There are no doubt many different languages in the world . And every one of them has a meaning .
46014011	But if a person talks in a language and I do not know the meaning of it , I will be like a stranger to him and he will be like a stranger to me .
46014012	So it is with you . You want the gifts of the Spirit . Then you should want the gift which will make you better able to help the church people .
46014013	So then , the person who talks in a tongue of a different language , should ask God to help tell the meaning of the tongue .
46014014	If I pray to God in a tongue of a different language , then I am talking with my spirit , but I do not use my mind .
46014015	What then shall I do ? I will talk to God with my spirit and I will talk to God with my mind . I will sing with my spirit and I will sing with my mind .
46014016	If you thank God with your spirit only , an ordinary person cannot say , Amen , it is so ! He does not know what you say .
46014017	The way you thank God is good , but it does not help an ordinary person .
46014018	I thank God that I can talk in tongues more than any of you .
46014019	But in the church meeting it is better for me to say five words with my mind , so that I will teach other people also . This is better than to say ten thousand words in a tongue of a different language .
46014020	My brothers , do not be like children in your thinking . When it comes to doing wrong things , be like small babies . But in your thinking be grown up people .
46014021	The holy writings say , I will talk to these people by strangers and by people who talk in strange tongues . And yet , they will not listen to me . This is what the Lord says .
46014022	So then , tongues are a sign to people who do not believe God . They are not a sign to those who believe him . But speaking words from God like a prophet is a sign to those who believe . It is not a sign to those who do not believe .
46014023	Sometimes all the people of the church may be gathered together . If everyone talks in tongues , and if some people who do not know or believe come in , they will say that you are crazy .
46014024	But what happens if everyone speaks words from God ? If such people come in , then the words from God will prove to them that they have done wrong . They will all speak to the heart .
46014025	Such a person sees everything that has been hidden in his heart . Then he will kneel down and worship God . He will say , It is true . God is here among you .
46014026	What shall we do about it , my brothers ? When you meet together , every one of you has something to help the other . One has a song to sing . One has something to teach people . One has something which God has shown to him . One has something to say in a tongue . One can tell the meaning of a tongue . Do all of these things to help one another .
46014027	If any people talk in a tongue , only two or not more than three should talk . They must talk one at a time and someone must tell the meaning .
46014028	But if there is no one to tell the meaning , a person must not talk in a tongue of a different language in the church meeting . He should talk to himself and to God .
46014029	Two or three prophets may speak words from God and the others should say what they think about it .
46014030	But if another person is sitting by and God gives him something to say , then the first person should stop talking .
46014031	One by one you may speak words from God . In that way , all will learn something and all will be stronger in faith .
46014032	Those who speak words from God are able to keep their own spirits quiet .
46014033	God does not want things to be out of order . He wants peace in the church meeting . In all the churches of Gods people , the women should be quiet in the church meetings . They must not be allowed to talk . They must obey . The holy writings say this also .
46014035	If the women want to know something , they should ask their own husbands at home . It is a shame for a woman to talk in a church meeting .
46014036	Do you think that you were the first ones to tell the word of God ? Or do you think that you are the only people who have it ?
46014037	Perhaps someone thinks , I am the one to speak words from God , or , I have the Spirit . Then know this , the Lord has told me to write these things .
46014038	If anyone does not know this , then God will not know him .
46014039	So , my brothers , the thing you should want is to speak words from God . But at the same time , do not stop anyone from talking in tongues .
46014040	But everything should be done in the right way and in good order .
46015001	Now , my brothers , I want to bring the good news to your minds again . I told it to you and you received it . You now believe it .
46015002	You are saved by it , if you hold on to what I told you . If you do not , then you have believed for nothing .
46015003	I told you first what was told to me . I told you that Christ died for the wrong things we did , as the holy writings said .
46015004	He was buried . He was raised on the third day , as the holy writings said .
46015005	Peter saw him , and then all the twelve disciples saw him .
46015006	After that , more than five hundred Christian brothers saw him at one time . Most of them are still living , but some have died .
46015007	After that , James saw him . Then all the apostles saw him .
46015008	Last of all , I saw him too . I was like one who was born at the wrong time .
46015009	The other apostles are all greater than I am . I should not be called an apostle because I troubled the people of Gods church .
46015010	But God has been kind to me . He has made me what I am today . And he did not bless me for nothing . I did more work than any of them . Yet it was not I , but the loving kindness of God was working with me .
46015011	So it does not matter who gave the message , they or I . This is the message we gave , and this is the message you believed .
46015012	You have been told that Christ was raised from death . How can some of you say that dead people do not rise again ?
46015013	If dead people do not rise , Christ did not rise .
46015014	And if Christ did not rise , then what we told you was not true , and what you believe is not true .
46015015	If this were so , we would have been telling lies about God , because we said that God raised up Christ . He did not raise up Christ if dead people are not raised up .
46015016	If dead people are not raised , then Christ was not raised either .
46015017	If Christ was not raised , then what you believe is no good . Your wrong ways have not been forgiven .
46015018	If that were true , then the people who believed in Christ who have now died , are lost .
46015019	And if we have hope in Christ for our life in this world only , then we are the most unhappy of all people .
46015020	But Christ really has been raised from death . He was the first one to rise of all who have died .
46015021	It was a man who first brought death . So it was also a man who was first raised from death .
46015022	All people who are of Adam die . And so also , all people who belong to Christ will live .
46015023	But each one has his turn . Christ rose first . Then those who belong to Christ will rise when he comes again .
46015024	After that the end will come . Christ will hand over the ruling power to God the Father . Christ will stop all other rulers , and everyone who has any rights and power .
46015025	Christ must rule until God has all power over all his enemies .
46015026	Death is the last enemy to be destroyed .
46015027	The holy writings say , God has put all things under Christ . But it does not mean that God is under Christ . God is the one who put all things under him .
46015028	One day the Son will be over all things . And God will be over the Son . So in the end God will be over all things .
46015029	Another thing , what good is it for people to be baptized for dead people ? If dead people are not raised , why are some people baptized for them ?
46015030	And why are we in trouble all the time ?
46015031	I face death every day ! That is true . Just the way it is true that I am proud of you , my brothers . I am proud that you belong to Christ Jesus .
46015032	I fought against wild animals at Ephesus . If I was thinking only of life on earth , why did I do this ? If dead people do not rise , then we might just as well say , Let us eat and drink because we will die tomorrow .
46015033	Do not be fooled . If good people keep company with bad people , the good people will become bad too .
46015034	Wake up ! Do what is right . Stop doing wrong things . Some of you do not know God at all . I say these things to you to make you ashamed .
46015035	But someone will ask , How can dead people be raised ? What kind of body will they have when they come back from death ?
46015036	What foolish questions ! The seed you put in the ground must die before it can come to life .
46015037	You do not put a grown-up plant in the ground . You put in a seed , such as corn , wheat , rice , or something like that .
46015038	God gives the seed the body he wants it to have . He gives a different kind of body to every kind of seed .
46015039	Not all living bodies are alike . People have one kind of body . Animals have another kind of body . Fish another kind of body . Birds have another kind .
46015040	So too , there are bodies for the sky and bodies for the earth . The bodies for the sky are fine in one way , and the bodies for the earth are fine in another way . They are not alike .
46015041	The sun is fine in one way . The moon is fine in another way . The stars are fine in still another way . And one star is fine in a different way from another star .
46015042	So it is with the body that is raised from death . When it is put in the ground it is a body that dies . When it rises from death , it will never die again .
46015043	When it is put in the ground , it is not fine . When it rises , it is very fine . When it is put in the ground it has no strength . When it rises it is strong .
46015044	When it is put in the ground it is only a body for this world . When it rises it is a body for the spirit . If there is a body for this world , then there is also a body for the spirit .
46015045	The holy writings say , The first man , Adam , was of this world ! The last Adam [ Christ ] is a Spirit who gives life .
46015046	The body for the spirit does not come first . The body for this world comes first . Then comes the body for the spirit .
46015047	The first man came from earth . He was made from the dust of the earth . The second Adam is the Lord from heaven .
46015048	Those who are made of earth are like the man made of dust . Those who are for heaven are like the man from heaven .
46015049	We were made like the man of dust but we shall look like the man from heaven .
46015050	Now I tell you , my brothers , our bodies of flesh and blood can have no place in the kingdom where God rules . A body which will die can have no room in the kingdom of God where people will never die .
46015051	Listen ! I tell you a secret . We will not all die , but we will all be changed . It will happen very quickly , as fast as one can shut his eyes . It will be when the trumpet or horn is blown the last time . Someone will blow the trumpet , dead people will rise , and they will never die again . We ourselves will be changed .
46015052	This body which dies must become a body which will never die .
46015053	When this body which dies becomes one which will never die , what the holy writings say comes true . It says , Death is overcome by victory .
46015054	Death , you have lost the battle . Death , your power to hurt us is gone .
46015055	Death hurts us because we are bad people . And our wrong ways are so strong because of the law .
46015056	But I thank God that he gives us power to stop being wrong through our Lord Jesus Christ .
46015057	So , my dear brothers , stand strong . Do not be moved from what you believe . Work hard for the Lord . You know that your work for the Lord will not be for nothing .

46016001	Now I want to tell you about getting money together for Gods people . I told the churches in the province of Galatia how to do it . And I want you to do the same .
46016002	On the first day of the week , every one of you should put aside and save as much money as you can . Then you will not have to get money together when I come .
46016003	When I get there , I will send to Jerusalem the men you all choose . They will carry your gift with your letters of approval .
46016004	And if it seems good for me to go too , they will go with me .
46016005	I am going through the country of Macedonia . After I have gone through there , I will come to you .
46016006	Maybe I will stay with you for a while , or even for the winter . Then you can help me on the way to the next place I go .
46016007	I do not want to stop off to see you just while I am going through . I want to spend some time with you , if it is the Lords will .
46016008	I will stay in the city of Ephesus until the day of Pentecost .
46016009	A door has opened for me to do much good work here . But there are many people against me .
46016010	If Timothy comes to you , be good to him , so that his heart will not be troubled while he is with you . He is working for the Lord , just as I am .
46016011	So no one should despise him . But send him off with joy when he comes back to me . I will look for him to come with the other brothers .
46016012	Now about our brother Apollos . I have asked him many times to visit you with the others . But he does not want to come now . He will come when he has the time .
46016013	Be awake ! Stand strong in what you believe . Show that you are men . Be strong .
46016014	Do everything with love .
46016015	You know that Stephanas and his family were the first people in the country of Greece to believe the good news . They have made up their minds to help Gods people always .
46016016	So , my brothers , I ask you to obey men like that . And join happily with all others who are helpers and workers .
46016017	I am glad that Stephanas , Fortunatus , and Achaicus have come . They have made up for your not being here .
46016018	They have made me happy and you also . Show that you know the value of such men .
46016019	The people in the churches of Asia send greetings to you . Aquila and Priscilla and the Christians who meet in their house send you many Christian greetings .
46016020	All the Christian brothers send you greetings . Greet each other with a holy kiss .
46016021	And I , Paul , write this greeting with my own hand .
46016022	Anyone who does not love the Lord Jesus Christ , should be cut off from God . Come soon , Lord !
46016023	May the Lord Jesus bless you .
46016024	I send my Christian love to you all .
47001001	I am Paul . I am called by God to be an apostle of Jesus Christ . My Christian brother Timothy and I send greetings to the church of God in the city of Corinth . We also send greetings to all of Gods people in the country of Greece .
47001002	May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you with their loving kindness and peace . Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ! He is a very , very kind Father to us . He is a God who always comforts and helps people .
47001003	He helps us every time we have trouble . Then we are able to be strong and help other people every time they have trouble . We can do this with the same comfort that God gives us .
47001004	We have plenty of the same troubles that Christ had . But we also have plenty of comfort and help from him .
47001005	When we have trouble , it is for your sake so that you will be helped and saved . When we are comforted , this helps you . Then you will stand strong when you have the same troubles we have .
47001006	Our hope for you is strong . If you have the same trouble we have had , then you will also have the same comfort and help we have . This we know .
47001007	Brothers , we want you to know about the trouble we had in the country of Asia Minor . We were not strong enough to carry such a load of trouble . It was so heavy we thought we would die .
47001008	Yes , we really felt our time had come to die . This was to make us trust , not in ourselves , but in God . He brings people back to life .
47001009	He saved us from the death that was so near , and he still saves us . We believe that God will keep on saving us .
47001010	But you must help us also . You must talk to God about us . When many people ask God to help us , then many people will thank God for the way he has blessed us . ourselves . Our hearts tell us that we have lived the right way in the world , and even more so toward you . We have lived a clean and true life as God wants us to . We have not trusted in the wise things of men , but in the blessing of God .
47001011	We write you nothing but what you have been reading out to the people , and what you all know . I hope that you will really know what is right even to the end .
47001012	You already know something about us . I hope that you will come to know us fully . On the day when the Lord Jesus comes you will be proud of us . So too will we be proud of you .
47001013	Because I was sure of this , I wanted to visit you before . Then you would have had a double blessing .
47001014	I wanted to visit you and then go to Macedonia . I wanted to visit you again when I was on my way back from Macedonia . Then you would send me on my way to Judea .
47001015	That was what I wanted to do . Now then , did I act as if I did not know what I wanted ? When I make my plans , do you think I make them like a man of this world ? Do I say Yes when I mean to say No ?
47001016	As surely as God is true , our message to you was not Yes and No at the same time .
47001017	Silvanus and Timothy and I told you about the Son of God , Jesus Christ . His word was not Yes and No . It was always Yes .
47001018	To the many promises God has made Christ can say Yes . He can make them all come true . So then , it is because of Christ that we can say , Yes , it is so ! when we praise God .
47001019	It is God who makes us stand strong with you in Christ . God has chosen us and put his mark on us .
47001020	He has put his Spirit in our hearts . This is the first part of what we are to receive , and it proves that we will receive all God has promised .
47001021	Let God take my life if what I say is not true . I did not go to Corinth because I did not want to make you sad .
47001022	We do not rule over what you believe . But we work with you to make you glad . You are strong already by believing as you do .

47002001	I made up my mind that I would not go to visit you again if I had to make you sad .
47002002	For if I make you sad , who is going to make me glad ? No one , but the one I made sad .
47002003	That is why I wrote the letter . I did not want to come and be made sad by those who should make me glad . I am sure that what makes me glad makes you all glad too .
47002004	When I wrote to you , I was in great trouble and my heart was very heavy . I cried with many tears . I did not want you to be sad , but I just wanted to let you know that I love you very much who made me sad . It was not only me that he made sad . It was every one of you , in a way . I say in a way because I do not want to be too strong in what I say .
47002005	That man has been punished enough by what most of you did to him .
47002006	So now , you ought to forgive him and comfort him . If you do not , then he may be so sad he cannot bear it .
47002007	So I beg you , show your love to him again .
47002008	Here is why I wrote to you . I wanted to test you to find out if you obey me in all matters .
47002009	Anyone whom you forgive , I also forgive . And if I have had anything to forgive , I have already forgiven it for your sakes , just as if we were standing before Christ .
47002010	I have done this so that Satan will not get ahead of us . We know his tricks . of Troas to tell the good news of Christ , the door was open for me to work for the Lord .
47002011	But my mind was troubled because I did not find my brother Titus there . So I said goodbye to the people there and went on to the country of Macedonia . Christ . And Christ leads us to victory every time . To know Christ is like a sweet smell . And God lets us carry that sweet smell of his truth everywhere .
47002012	We are like a sweet smell to God . It is the smell of Christ we have . We have this sweet smell among the people who are saved and among those who are lost .
47002013	To some it smells like death and brings death to those who are lost . To others it smells like life and it brings life to those who are saved . Who is good enough for such things ?
47002014	We are not like some people . They tell Gods message to make money . But we tell it with a true heart just as God told it to us . We tell it as if we stood before God . And we tell it with Christs help .

47003001	Do you think we are starting again to tell how good we are ? Do we need letters to tell about us , as some teachers do ? We do not need letters to you or from you to praise us .
47003002	You yourselves are our letter . This letter has been written in our hearts . All people can read it and understand it .
47003003	All can see that you are a letter from Christ written by us . It is not written in ink , but it is written in the Spirit of the living God . It is not written on pieces of rock , but on the hearts of people .
47003004	We can say this because we trust in God . And we trust in God because of Christ .
47003005	We are not good enough to think we can do anything ourselves . But God makes us able to do it .
47003006	God has made a new start with people . He has given us a new way back to God . It is not a written law . The Spirit gives it to us . The written law brings death , but the Spirit gives life .
47003007	The old law that brought death was written on pieces of rock . There was a very bright light when God gave it to the people . The people of Israel could not look at Moses because his face was so bright . And even as they saw it , the light on his face was going away .
47003008	Now bringing the law was bright and wonderful . Will not bringing the Spirit be far more bright and wonderful ?
47003009	Bringing the law was a wonderful thing even though it brought death . So bringing the good news that people can be put right with God is much more wonderful .
47003010	The law was so bright and wonderful at first but has no light now . There is something else that is so much more bright and wonderful .
47003011	The one which does not stay alive for ever came first in a great light . Does not the one which does stay alive have a much brighter light ?
47003012	Because we believe this , we do not fear .
47003013	We are not like Moses . He put a cloth over his face so that the people of Israel would not see that the light from God was dying .
47003014	But their minds were made dull . Even today , when the old law of God is read , it is as if a cloth still covers it . It is Christ who takes the cloth away .
47003015	Yes , even today , when the books of Moses are read , it is as if a cloth covers their hearts and minds .
47003016	But when a man turns to the Lord , the cloth is taken away .
47003017	Now the Lord is the Spirit . Where the Spirit of the Lord is , people are set free .
47003018	All of us have no cloth over our faces . People can see that we have some of the bright and wonderful light that the Lord has . And we are becoming brighter and brighter , more and more like him . It is the Lord , the Spirit , who does this .
47004001	God in his kindness gave us this work . So we do not give up .
47004002	We never do wrong things nor do things in secret . We do not fool people nor change Gods message . No , we tell people the truth openly . We let every person judge us for himself . We know that God sees all we do .
47004003	If the good news which we tell is not clear to some people , it is because they are lost . They do not believe .
47004004	The god of this world has covered their minds so they cannot see . They cannot see with their minds the light of the good news of Christ . They cannot see how bright and wonderful Christ is . He is just like God himself .
47004005	We do not talk about ourselves , but about Christ Jesus our Lord . And we are your slaves for Jesus sake .
47004006	God said , Let light shine in the darkness . And he has let light shine in our hearts too . He gave us light that shows how bright and wonderful God is . We see this light when we look at the face of Christ .
47004007	This is something of great value within us , but we are like pots made of earth and clay . This power is greater than any other power . But it comes from God , not from us .
47004008	We have much trouble , but we do not give up . We are in hard places , but help always comes .
47004009	People trouble us , but God is always with us . We are beaten , but we are not killed .
47004010	We always feel as if our body is dying , just as Jesus died . Then the life of Jesus also can be seen in our body .
47004011	While we live we are always ready to die for Jesus . And so the life of Jesus is also seen in our bodies which will die .
47004012	So then , while death is at work in us , life is at work at the same time .
47004013	We believe the same way as the one who wrote , I believed , and so I talked . We also believe , and so we talk to you .
47004014	We know this . God raised up the Lord Jesus , and he will raise us up also with Jesus . He will bring us all to stand together before God .
47004015	All this is happening for you so that the blessings of God will reach more people . Then more people will thank God . And this will make Gods name greater . gets weak , but our heart gets new strength day after day .
47004016	The load of trouble we carry now is a little heavy . But this trouble is getting something great and wonderful ready for us which will last for ever .
47004017	We are not looking at things that can be seen , but at things that cannot be seen . The things which can be seen last only a little while . But the things which cannot be seen last for ever .

47005001	Our body is the house in which our spirit lives here on earth . When that house is destroyed , then God will give us another house . That house is not made by mans hand . But God made it . It will last for ever in heaven .
47005002	While we are in the house we have now , we are always crying and wanting to have our house from heaven .
47005003	When we have moved into it , then we are sure that we will never be left without a house .
47005004	While we are in this house , we cry and are troubled . It is not that we want to move out of this house , but we want to move into the other one . Then this body which will die will be changed into one which will live .
47005005	God is the one who has made us ready for this change . He has already given us the Spirit . This is the first part of what we are to receive , and it proves that we will get more .
47005006	So we always feel sure . While we live in our bodies we are not in our house with the Lord . We know that .
47005007	We do not see these things , but we believe them .
47005008	We feel sure that we will want to leave this body and go to live with the Lord .
47005009	So it does not matter if we are living here or go to live there . Wherever we are we want to please the Lord .
47005010	We must all stand before Christ to be judged . Then we will receive pay . If we have done well , our pay will be good . If we have not done well , our pay will not be good . must be feared , so we try to get people to believe . God knows what we are and what we do . And we hope that in your hearts you , too , know .
47005011	No , we are not praising ourselves again . But we are telling you this so that you may really be proud of us . Then you will be ready to answer people who are proud of themselves . They are proud of the things which can be seen . But in their hearts they have nothing to be proud of .
47005012	If we are crazy , it is for Gods sake . If we are right in our minds , it is for your sakes .
47005013	The love of Christ makes us do what we do to win men . We believe that one man died for all people . [ To God ] it is as if we all died with him .
47005014	He died for all , so that those who live would not live to please themselves . But they should live to please him who gave his life for them and rose again from death .
47005015	So then we no longer know people by what we see on the outside . There was a time when we knew Christ that way , but now we do not know him that way any longer .
47005016	So , if any man belongs to Christ , he is a new person . His old life has gone . You see , he has begun a new life .
47005017	But it is God who has done all this . He sent Christ to make peace with us and to bring us back to himself . Now he has given us the work of bringing other people back to God .
47005018	God was in Christ . He brought the world back to himself . He forgave them for the wrong things they had done . And he gave us the message that will bring people back to himself .
47005019	So we are messengers for Christ . God is using us to call people . So we are standing here for Christ and begging people , Come back to God !
47005020	Christ did no wrong thing . But for our sake God put the blame for our wrong ways on Christ . So now God sees us as good , because we are in Christ .

47006003	We put nothing in anyones way . So no one can say our work is bad .
47006004	In every way we try to show that we are good servants of God . We do not give up when there is much trouble , and things go wrong , and things are hard .
47006005	We are being beaten and put in prison . We are being knocked around . We work hard . We are awake at night and we go hungry .
47006006	We help you with our knowledge and by living a clean life , with the help of the Spirit . We are patient and kind . We help you by the Holy Spirit . We have shown true love .
47006007	We have told you the truth with the power of God . These are the right things to use in our fight , and we have used them with both hands .
47006008	Some people respect us and some do not . Some give us a good name and some a bad name . Some people say we fool people and yet we tell the truth .
47006009	Many people do not know us , and yet many people know us very well . We almost die and yet we live . People give us much trouble but they do not kill us . We are very sad and yet always glad .
47006010	We are poor , but we make many people rich . We have nothing , but really we have everything .
47006011	We talk plainly to you people in Corinth . We love you with all our hearts .
47006012	We have not stopped loving you , but you do not love us .
47006013	I say this as to my own children . You should love us with all your hearts . with those who do not believe . You and they are not equal . How can people who do right , work with those who do not obey God ? How can light and darkness be in the same place ?
47006014	How can Christ agree with Belial , the devil ? How can a person who believes work with a person who does not believe ?
47006015	Is there anything equal about a house of God and a house of idols ? We are a house of the living God . God has said , I will live in them and walk in them . I will be their God and they will be my people .
47006016	So the Lord says , Come away from among bad people . Stay away from them . Do not touch what is not clean . And I will receive you .

We should try to be altogether holy because we respect God with fear . place in your hearts . We have not done wrong to anyone . We have not hurt anyone . We have not taken anything from anyone .
47007002	I do not say this to bring something against you . I have already told you that we love you very much . If we live or if we die , we will be together with you .
47007003	I really trust you . I am very proud of you . I have received much comfort . Even in all of our troubles I am very glad .
47007004	When we came to the country of Macedonia , we had no rest for our bodies . We had all kinds of trouble everywhere . There was fighting around us and our hearts were full of fear .
47007005	But God comforts those who are in trouble , and when Titus came , we were comforted .
47007006	You comforted him , and that comforted us . He told us that you wanted very much to see us . He told us that you were very sorry for what you had done . He told us that you want to stand with me . So now I am even more happy .
47007007	I know that what I wrote in my letter made you sad . But I am not sorry I wrote it . Perhaps I was sorry at first , but now I am glad I sent it . I see the letter made you sad for a while .
47007008	I do not like to make you sad , but I am glad that it made you sad and made you turn from your wrong ways . You took it all as from God . So then , we did not really hurt you .
47007009	When we are sad the way God wants us to be , we turn from our wrong ways . Then we are saved and we can never be sorry about that . But the sorrow of the world brings death .
47007010	See what happened . When you were sad , the way God wanted you to be , then you tried to do the right thing . You wanted to free yourself from wrong . You hated what is wrong . You were afraid . You wanted very much to do what is right . You stood for the right . You punished wrong doing . In every way you showed that you did right in this matter .
47007011	So , even though I did write to you , it was not for the sake of the man who did wrong . And it was not for the sake of the man who had the wrong done to him . But I wrote so that you would see for yourselves , in the sight of God , how much we care for you .
47007012	And so we have been comforted . Besides this , we were even more happy to see how happy Titus was . All of you really made his heart glad .
47007013	I told him how proud I was of you . And really , I had nothing to be ashamed of . Everything we have said to you has been true . So also , what we told Titus about you proved true .
47007014	He loves you even more when he remembers how you all obeyed him . You feared and trembled .

47008001	My brothers , let me tell you how God has blessed the churches in Macedonia .
47008002	They are being tested by much trouble . But they are always very happy . And they are very poor . Because of these two things , they give to others as if they were rich .
47008003	I can tell you because I saw it myself . They gave as much as they could and even more than that . They did it all because they wanted to .
47008004	They begged us to let them give something to help Gods people .
47008005	And they did more than we thought they would do . First , they gave themselves to the Lord and to us , because we were doing Gods work .
47008006	That is why we asked Titus to see about your gift . He started you off in your giving . And so he is the one to see that you finish it .
47008007	We remember how well you do in everything . You do well in believing , in talking , in knowing things , in trying your best , and in the way you love us . So now , do well in giving this gift .
47008008	I am not saying that you must do it . But I want to prove how strong your love is . That is why I have told you how other people show their love .
47008009	You know how much love our Lord Jesus Christ had . He was rich , but he became poor for your sakes . Because he became poor , you can become rich .
47008010	I tell you what I think . It is best for you to finish what you started a year ago . You were the first to think of helping , and you started to give money .
47008011	So now , finish doing it . You wanted to do it , so now finish it . Give as much as you can .
47008012	If a man wants to give , he is judged by what he has to give . He is not judged by what he cannot give .
47008013	I do not want it to be easy for others and hard for you .
47008014	I want it to be equal for everyone . Right now , you have plenty and are able to help them . Another time , when they have plenty , they will help you when you need it . In that way things will be equal .
47008015	The holy writings say , The person who had plenty did not have too much . And the person who did not have much , had enough . care for you into the heart of Titus that I have .
47008016	He was glad to go when I asked him , but he is also coming to you because he himself wants to come .
47008017	We are sending another brother with him . This brother has a good name in all the churches because he tells the good news .
47008018	Not only that , but the churches have chosen him to travel with us as we take care of this gift . We are doing this so that the Lord will be praised . We want to help others .
47008019	We do not want anyone to say that we have not done the right thing . So we are taking care of this big gift in the right way . We want to do what the Lord says is right , but also what people say is right .
47008020	And we are also sending another brother with them . We have found him to be glad to help us in many matters , many times . And now he is much more glad to help because he trusts you very much .
47008021	I want to say this . Titus is my close friend and he works with me . And about our other brothers , they have been sent by the churches . They bring praise to Christ .
47008022	Now then , prove that you love them . Prove that what we have said about you is true . Then the churches will know it .

47009001	Of course , I really do not need to write to you about the money to be given to Gods people .
47009002	I know that you wanted to help . I am proud to tell the people of Macedonia about you . I tell them , The people in Greece have been ready for a year . And what you did has made most of them want to do something too .
47009003	But I am sending these brothers so that what we have said about you will be true in this way . I want you to be really ready with the gift , just as I said you would be .
47009004	If some men from Macedonia come with me and see that you are not ready , then we will be ashamed , and you too . We will be ashamed that we were so sure .
47009005	So I thought it would be good to send these brothers to you first . They will get this gift ready which you promised . Then it will be ready like a gift , and not as if you were forced to give it .
47009006	Here is something to remember . The man who plants a little bit will get only a little from it . The man who plants much will get much from it .
47009007	Everyone should give what he wants in his heart to give . He should be glad to give it , and should not give it because he was forced to give . God loves a person who gives gladly .
47009008	God is able to give you even more blessings than you need . In all things you will always have all you need for yourselves , and you will have enough to help all others .
47009009	The holy writings say , A good man gives away many things . He gives to the poor people . He will always be a good man in the sight of God .
47009010	God is the one who gives seed to plant and bread to eat . He will give you enough to give away and will make it become more and more . Of the good things you do he will give you a big harvest .
47009011	You will become rich in every way . And then you will have enough to give plenty to all people . And many people will thank God for your gifts which we will bring them .
47009012	This gift of money will help to give Gods people what they need . It will also make many people thank God .
47009013	This gift will prove something to them . They will praise God because you obey the good news of Christ . They will praise God because you have given this gift to help them and all the others .
47009014	They will love you and talk to God about you , because God has blessed you very much .
47009015	Thank God for his gift so great that no words can ever tell it all !
47010001	Now I , Paul , beg you to do something since you know that Christ was kind and gentle . You say I am weak when I am face to face with you , but when I am not with you , then I speak to you with hard words .
47010002	I beg you , do not force me to talk hard words when I come . I have made up my mind to talk hard words against some people . They think we are living for the things in this world .
47010003	Of course we are living in bodies made for this world . But we are not fighting for the things in this world .
47010004	We do not use the things of this world in our fighting , but we use the power of God . This power can break down the walls where the enemy hides .
47010005	We can break down what people think and every big idea that tries to stop people from knowing God . And we can make every thought a prisoner to obey Christ .
47010006	Only when you all obey , then we are ready to punish anyone who will not obey .
47010007	Surely you can see this . If one person is sure that he belongs to Christ , then he should see that we too belong to Christ just as he does .
47010008	The Lord gave us power to build you up , not to break you down . Maybe I talk about it too much . But I feel I am right in talking about it .
47010009	I do not want you to think that I am trying to make you afraid by my letters .
47010010	Some people say , Pauls letters make us listen . They are strong . But he himself is weak and what he says is not worth listening to .
47010011	People like that should know this . When we come we will do what we have said in our letters .
47010012	We do not want to be like those people who praise themselves . They measure themselves by their own ideas , and look at themselves to see how good they are . When they do that , they are foolish !
47010013	We will not talk of things we did not do . No , we will only be proud of those things which God has given us to do . And he has sent us even as far as you .
47010014	We are not going farther than we should when we come to you . We were the first to come all the way to you with the good news of Christ .
47010015	We will not be proud of other mens work which we did not do . We hope that you will believe more strongly , so that we can do more work among you , as God gives it to us .
47010016	Then we hope to tell the good news in places far beyond you . We will not be proud of the work given to someone else to do-work that was done before we got there .
47010017	The holy writings say that the person who is proud should be proud only of the Lord .
47010018	A man who praises himself is not a man who is good . The man who is really good is the man whom the Lord praises .
47011001	I want to say something a little bit foolish . But please listen to me !
47011002	I love you as God loves you . I see you as a woman who has not been married and I am giving you to be the wife of a husband . That husband is Christ .
47011003	But the snake fooled Eve by his trick . And I am afraid that your minds will be drawn away from a clean , pure love of Christ .
47011004	You listen to a new man when he comes to tell you about a different Jesus , which is not the one we told you about . And when you receive a spirit and a message which are not the ones you had first , then you listen too much .
47011005	But I really do not think that the chief apostles are any better than I am !
47011006	Maybe I am not a good talker , but I surely know what I am talking about ! Yes , we made this plain to you in every way in all things .
47011007	Perhaps it was wrong for me to bring myself down in order to raise you up . Do you think that ? Was it wrong for me to tell you the good news without pay ?
47011008	I took pay from other churches . I made them poor so that I might help you .
47011009	When I was with you and needed money , I did not make any of you pay me . When the brothers came from Macedonia , they gave me what I needed . So I was not , and I will not be , any trouble to you .
47011010	Surely , the true word of Christ is in me . I will never stop being proud of this anywhere in Achaia [ Greece ] .
47011011	Why is this ? Is it because I do not love you ? God knows that I love you .
47011012	And I will keep on doing what I am doing now . Some teachers are praising themselves . They say they are like us . By doing this I prove they are not like us .
47011013	Men like that are not true apostles . They work to fool people . They try to make themselves look like apostles of Christ .
47011014	I am not surprised . Satan tries to make himself look like an angel of light .
47011015	So it is not strange if his workers also try to make themselves look like Gods workers who do right . They will come to an end like the work they do ! think that I am foolish . But if you do , then please listen to me as if I were foolish . I also want to do a little talking about myself .
47011016	I am not talking like the Lord when I say this . It seems foolish to say so much about myself .
47011017	Many people talk about themselves in the world . So I will too .
47011018	Since you are wise , you still agree to listen to foolish people .
47011019	You listen to a man even if he makes slaves of you , even if he spends all your money , even if he catches you in a trap , even if he is proud of himself , even if he slaps you in the face .
47011020	I am ashamed , but I must say that we were too weak to be like that ! Anything that others want to be proud of , I can talk about too . And yet it is really foolish to do so .
47011021	Are they Hebrew people ? So am I . Are they Israels people ? So am I . Is Abraham their father ? He is mine too .
47011022	Are they workers for Christ ? ( I talk like one who is not in his right mind . ) I am a better worker . I have worked much harder . I have been in prison more often . I have been beaten many , many times . Often I have almost died .
47011023	The Jewish leaders five times gave me thirty nine strikes with the rope .
47011024	Three times people beat me with sticks , and once they threw rocks at me . Three times I was in a boat when it broke in the sea . I have been in the water all one night and day .
47011025	I have travelled much . I have crossed bad rivers . I have gone where men might steal my things . The Jews and those who are not Jews have troubled me . I have been in hard places in the city . I have had hard times in the desert . I have had hard times on the water . I have had hard times among those who should have been my brothers and were not .
47011026	I have worked hard . I have been tired out . I have often had no sleep at night . I have been hungry and thirsty . I have often had nothing to eat . I have been cold and did not have enough clothes to wear .
47011027	Beside all other things , my heart is troubled about the churches . That is a load I carry every day .
47011028	When anyone is weak , I am weak too . When anyone is made to fall away , my heart burns within me
47011030	If I must talk about myself , I will talk about the things that show I am weak .
47011031	God knows I am not telling lies . He is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ and he is to be praised forever . In the city of Damascus a man ruled for king Aretas . He had the gates of the city guarded because he wanted to catch me .
47011032	But I sat in a basket . Then it was put out through a window in the wall and was let down . And so I got away from him .
47011033	missing fehlt/missing
47012001	I must talk about myself even though it does no good . I will talk about visions and things which the Lord has shown me .
47012002	I know a Christian man . Fourteen years ago he was taken up into the place where God lives . I do not know if he was in his body when he went or not . God knows if he was .
47012003	I do know this . He was taken up into the place where God lives . And again I say , I do not know if he was in his body or not . God knows if he was .
47012004	This man heard things which cannot be told . No person on earth can speak them .
47012005	I will talk about such a man . But I will not talk about myself . If I do talk , it will be about the ways I am weak .
47012006	Now if I wanted to talk about myself , I would not be foolish . I would be telling the truth . But I will not say any more . This is why : I do not want anyone to think I am better than what he sees I am , or hears me teach . I want him to judge me only by what he can see in me and by what I say .
47012007	Because the things God showed me were so wonderful , I might have become too proud of myself . But something happened and stopped that . It was like a thorn in me . It came from Satan [ the devil ] to trouble me . It came to stop me from being too proud .
47012008	I begged the Lord three times that this trouble might leave me .
47012009	But he said to me , My kindness and strength is enough for you . When you are weak , my power is strong . So then , I am very glad to talk about how weak I am so that the power of Christ may live in me .
47012010	So then , for the sake of Christ I am glad to be weak , to have people say wrong things about me , to be poor , to have people trouble me , and to have hard times . When I am weak , that is the time I am really strong , have been acting like one with no sense , but you have made me do it . You should have been talking about the good things I have done . The very best apostles are not one bit better than I am , even though I am nothing at all .
47012011	There are signs that show a true apostle . I did all these things when I was among you . There were signs , wonderful works , and other big works which I did . You saw the power of God , even though I was being tested .
47012012	In what way did you not receive as much as the other churches ? Only this ! I did not trouble you to pay me . Forgive me for the wrong I did you !
47012013	Now , I am ready to come to you for the third time . And I will not trouble you to pay me . I do not want what belongs to you , but I want you . The children should not save up for their parents , but the parents should do it for their children .
47012014	For my part , I am glad to spend what I have , and to spend myself for the sake of your souls . But it seems to me that the more I love you the less you love me !
47012015	All right then , I did not trouble you for any money . But some of you think that I have been mean and played a trick on you .
47012016	Did I send anyone to you to get something for myself ? No !
47012017	I asked Titus to go and I sent our brother with him . Did Titus get anything for himself ? No ! Did we not act in the same spirit ? Did we not walk in the same steps ?
47012018	Am I saying all this just to you ? Are we just trying to make ourselves look right to you ? No , we say this before God and in Christ . And my dear people , I have done it all to make you better Christians .
47012019	I want to be pleased with you when I come . But I am afraid I will not be . And I am afraid that you will not be pleased with me . I fear that I may find quarrelling , jealousy , anger , and that I will find you are enemies to each other , that you are spoiling each others names , that you are telling stories about each other , that you are proud and do not obey rulers .
47012020	And I am afraid that when I come my God will make me ashamed of you . I am afraid that my heart will be very sad about you . Many have been doing wrong things for a long time . Many have not turned away from their dirty ways , their wrong use of sex , and the things they should be ashamed of .

47013001	This is the third time I am coming to you . The holy writings say Any complaint must be proved by the words of two or three people .
47013002	I have told you before , when I visited you the second time . And I tell you again now , while I am not there . When I come again , I will punish those who did wrong before and the others who have done wrong since .
47013003	This will be the proof you want that Christ speaks through me . Christ is not weak when he deals with you . No , he shows his power among you .
47013004	It is true that he was weak when he died on a cross . But now he is alive by the power of God . We are weak as he was , but we will also be alive as he is by the power God has . You will see this .
47013005	Look at yourselves and check to see if you still believe . Test yourselves . Do you not know Jesus Christ is in you ? If he is not in you , you do not pass the test .
47013006	I hope you will know that we pass the test .
47013007	We ask God to help you that you will do nothing wrong . That is not to show you that we pass the test . We want you to do what is right even if we do not pass the test .
47013008	After all , we have no power to work against what is true , but only for the truth .
47013009	We are glad to be weak , if you are made strong . And we ask God for this too , that you may become perfect .
47013010	That is why I am writing these things to you the way I am , before I reach you . Then , when I come to you , I do not want to be hard on you . I do not want to use the power which the Lord has given me . He gave it to me to help to make you better Christians , not to break you down .
47013011	Now , my brothers , in closing I say , Goodbye . Be what you should be . Listen to what I say . Be good to each other . Agree with one another . Live in peace with one another . And the God who gives love and peace will be with you .
47013012	Greet one another with a holy kiss .
47013013	All of Gods people send greetings to you .
47013014	And to all of you I say , May the kindness and blessing of the Lord Jesus Christ be upon you . May God show you his love . May you all have the Holy Spirit with you .
48001001	I am Paul the apostle , a messenger from God . Men did not call me to be an apostle . Men did not make me an apostle . Jesus Christ and God the Father made me an apostle . It was the same God the Father who raised Jesus from death .
48001002	All the Christian brothers who are with me and I , send greetings . To the churches in the province of Galatia :
48001003	May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you with his loving kindness and give you peace .
48001004	Christ gave his life to pay for the wrong things we have done . He did this to set us free from the wrong ways of this world . This is what our God and Father wanted him to do .
48001005	All the praise for this belongs to God for ever and ever . Yes , it does !
48001006	I am very much surprised . It is so soon , and you are leaving God who called you by the love of Christ . Instead you are listening to another good news .
48001007	There is really no other good news . But some people are making you think wrong things . They want to change the good news of Christ .
48001008	We are wrong if we tell you a different kind of good news . Even an angel from heaven is wrong to tell you something different . Let a punishment from God come upon us if we tell you a different kind of good news .
48001009	We have said it before , and I say it again now . A curse be on any one who tells you a kind of good news which is not the good news we have already told you .
48001010	Now , am I trying to please men or God ? If I were still trying to please men , then I would not be the servant of Christ .
48001011	My brothers , I want you to know this . The good news which I told you is not mans good news .
48001012	No man told it to me . No man taught it to me . But it was Jesus Christ who showed it to me .
48001013	You have heard how I lived while I was still under the law of the Jews . I troubled the church of God very much . And I even tried to stop the church people altogether .
48001014	I knew more about the law of the Jews than many of my own age among my people . I wanted much more than they did to obey the laws which our fathers passed down to us , even the ones that were not written .
48001015	But God chose me to be an apostle before I was born . And he called me by his love .
48001016	God wanted to show his Son to me so that I might tell people who are not Jews about him . I did not go and ask any other person about the good news .
48001017	I did not go to Jerusalem to the men who were apostles before I was . But I went away into the country of Arabia . Then afterwards , I came back to the city of Damascus .
48001018	Three years later , I went to Jerusalem to visit Peter , and stayed with him fifteen days .
48001019	James , the brother of the Lord , was the only other apostle I saw . I did not see any of the other apostles .
48001020	God knows that what I am writing to you is not a lie .
48001021	After I had been at Jerusalem , I went to the countries of Syria and Cilicia .
48001022	At that time the churches of Christ in Judea did not know me . They had never seen me .
48001023	They only heard people say , This is the man who used to trouble us and he is now telling others to believe what he once tried to stop .
48001024	And they praised God for what had happened to me .
48002001	Fourteen years later I went to Jerusalem again . This time I went with Barnabas and I took Titus with me .
48002002	God showed me that I should go . And I told them about the good news which I tell to people who are not Jews . I told those who seemed to be church leaders when I was alone with them . I did not want my work to come to nothing-the work I had done or the work I was doing .
48002003	Titus was with me . He was not a Jew , but they did not force him to be circumcised [ have the mark of a Jew made on his body ] .
48002004	But some men got in who were not true brothers . They came in secretly to spy on us to find out things about us . They did not want us to be free the way Christ Jesus has made us free . But they wanted to make us obey the old laws again [ which were given to Moses by God ] .
48002005	But we did not let them tell us what to do , no , not even for one minute . In that way the real good news will be yours always .
48002006	Those men who seemed to be leaders did not teach me anything new . It does not matter to me who they were . God does not love some people more than others .
48002007	No , the leaders saw that God called me to take the good news to those who are not circumcised [ not Jews ] , just as he called Peter to take the good news to those who are circumcised [ Jews ] .
48002008	The same God who made Peter an apostle to the Jews made me an apostle to those who are not Jews .
48002009	The leaders saw that God had blessed me . James , Peter , and John seemed to be leaders in the church . They saw that God had blessed me . So they accepted Barnabas and me as fellow workers . They agreed that we should go to the people who were not Jews and they themselves would go to the Jews .
48002010	One thing they asked us to do was to help the poor Christians . I was very glad to do this .
48002011	One day Peter came to the city of Antioch . Then I had to tell him face to face that he had done wrong . He really was wrong !
48002012	Here is what happened . Peter ate with those who were not Jews . Then some men came whom James had sent . When they came he stopped eating with those who were not Jews . He was afraid of what the Jews might think .
48002013	All the other Jewish Christians did the same as Peter did . They acted as if it was not right to eat with those who were not Jews . Even Barnabas did the same .
48002014	But I saw they were not doing right . They were not obeying the true teaching of the good news . So I said to Peter in front of them all , You are a Jew . But you live the way people do who are not Jews . How then can you force those who are not Jews to live the way the Jews do ?
48002015	We ourselves were born Jews . We are not of those who still follow wrong ways , those who are not Jews .
48002016	Yet we know that God does not call a man good because he tries to obey the law of the Jews . But we know that God puts a man right because he believes in Jesus Christ . So we also believed in Jesus Christ . And we are put right with God because we believe in Christ and not because we obey the law . No person will ever be called good by God just because he tries to obey the law of the Jews .
48002017	We came to Christ to be put right with God . That showed us how much we had been bad men . Was it Christ who made us bad men ? No , surely not !
48002018	If I build up again what I once broke down , I do wrong .
48002019	Through the law I died . Now the law has no power over me so that I may live for God .
48002020	I died when Christ died on a cross . I do not live now , but Christ lives in me . Now while I still live in my body , I live by believing in the Son of God . He loved me and gave himself for me .
48002021	So I do not make the love of God useless . But if a person can be made good by the law , then Christ died for nothing .
48003001	O you Galatians , have you no sense at all ? Who has fooled you ? You knew , just as if you had seen him with your own eyes , that Jesus Christ was killed on a cross .
48003002	Here is one thing I want to ask you . You received the Holy Spirit . Was that because you obeyed the law [ given to the Jews by Moses ] ? No , it was because you heard Gods word and believed it .
48003003	Have you no sense at all ? You began living your new life by the power of the Spirit . And are you now trying to finish living it by your own power [ to keep the law ] ?
48003004	So many things happened to you . Was it all for nothing ? Surely it was not for nothing .
48003005	God gives you the Spirit . He does wonderful works among you . Does he do this because you obey the law ? No , he does it because you heard the word of God and believed it .
48003006	So it was with Abraham . The holy writings say He believed God , and that was why God called him a good man .
48003007	You see then , the people who believe God are children of Abraham .
48003008	The holy writings say that he will put people right with himself if they believe him , even those who are not Jews . It was written down before God did it . The holy writings told the good news to Abraham ahead of time . It said , God will make you a blessing to all nations and people .
48003009	Abraham believed God and was blessed . And so those who believe God are blessed too , along with him .
48003010	A curse is on all people who are trying to become good by obeying the law . The holy writings say , Everyone is cursed who does not always obey everything that is written in the book of the law and do it .
48003011	Now , you can see this . No man is called a good man by God because he obeys the law . The holy writings say , Those who are right with God shall live by faith .
48003012	The law does not ask people to believe . It says , He who obeys the laws will live because of them .
48003013	Christ has saved us from the curse which the law put on us . He took the curse on himself . It should have been on us . The holy writings say , A curse be on everyone who hangs on a tree !
48003014	Christ Jesus did this so that those who are not Jews will have the blessing which Abraham had . He did this so that when we believe , we will receive the Spirit who was promised to us .
48003015	My brothers , it is the same as when a man makes a promise . He makes it good and strong . Then no one can break it or add anything to it .
48003016	God made his promises to Abraham and to his Son . The promise does not have the words , and to his sons , for that means many sons . But it says , and to his Son , and that Son is Christ .
48003017	Here is what I mean . The law was given [ to Moses ] four hundred and thirty years after God gave that promise to Abraham . But it cannot break the strong promise which God made . And the law cannot change Gods promise .
48003018	Do we get what God has promised us by obeying the law ? If we do , then we are not getting it by his promise . But God gave it to Abraham by his promise .
48003019	Why then was the law made ? God gave it after he made the promise , because so many people were doing what was wrong . The law was to be in power only until the Son came , the one to whom the promise was made . The law was handed down by Gods angels with the help of a middle man .
48003020	To need the help of a middle man there must be more than one person making the agreement . But God is the only one who made the promise .
48003021	Is the law against the promises of God ? No , it is not ! If a law had been given that could give people life , then surely people would have become good people by the law .
48003022	But the holy writings say it is like this . The whole world is in prison , kept there by the wrong things they have done . This was done so that people who believe in Jesus Christ would have the blessing . This blessing was promised to those who believe .
48003023	Before one came for us to believe in , the law held us in prison like slaves . We were kept there until the one to believe in should come .
48003024	The law watched over us , as if we were children , until Christ came . Then God would put us right with himself through faith in Christ .
48003025	But now that one has come for us to believe in , the law does not watch over us any longer .
48003026	You are all Gods children because you have believed in Christ Jesus .
48003027	All of you who have been baptised into Christ have taken Christ as your own .
48003028	There is no longer any difference between a Jew and one who is not a Jew; between a slave and a free man; between a man and a woman . When you are in the body of Christ Jesus , you are all alike .
48003029	If you belong to Christ , you are Abrahams children . And if you are Abrahams children , you will receive the blessing that God has promised .
48004001	Here is what I mean . When a man dies , his son is to receive his property . As long as the son is not grown up , he cannot have it . He has no more right than a servant , even though he really owns all the property .
48004002	He still has people who take care of him and he must obey them until the time set by his father .
48004003	So it is with us . Before we were grown up , we were like servants . We were just beginning to learn about the things of this world .
48004004	But when the right time came , God sent his Son to make us free . He was born by a woman during the time when men had to obey the law .
48004005	God sent him to set the people free who were under the law . God sent him so that we would receive our rights as sons of God .
48004006	Because you are sons , God has sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts . The Spirit calls out , Father !
48004007	So then , because of what God has done , you are no longer a slave but you are a son . And because you are a son , you will receive what he promised .
48004008	At first , you did not know God . At that time you obeyed things which are not real gods .
48004009	But now you know God . That is , God knows you . Then why do you turn to things that are weak and can do no good ? Do you want to obey them again ?
48004010	You have holy days , holy months , holy seasons , and holy years .
48004011	I fear that all my work for you has been for nothing .
48004012	My brothers , I beg you , be like me because I am like you . You did me no wrong .
48004013	You know that I was sick when I first told you the good news .
48004014	My sickness troubled you . But you did not think wrongly of me or turn away from me . You received me as if I were an angel from God , as if I were Christ Jesus .
48004015	Why are you not happy any more ? I saw myself that you would have taken out your own eyes and given them to me if you could do such a thing .
48004016	Do you hate me because I tell you the truth ?
48004017	Other people are trying hard to get you on their side . But they do not mean to help you . They want to get you away from Christ so that you will listen to them .
48004018	Of course , it is good if someone tries to help you , but only if it is for a good reason . It is always good , not only when I am with you .
48004019	My dear children , I feel pain for you again , like a mother when her child is being born . I will feel pain until Christ lives in your heart .
48004020	I wish I could be with you now , and not have to talk this way . But I am troubled about you .
48004021	Tell me , you people that want the law to control you , why do you not listen to the law ?
48004022	The holy writings say that Abraham had two sons . One was the son of the slave woman . The other one was the son of the free woman .
48004023	The child of the slave woman was born as any child is born . But the child of the free woman was born because God promised he would be born .
48004024	These things have another meaning . These two women are like two agreements . One agreement came from Mount Sinai . The children are born slaves . That agreement is like Hagar .
48004025	So Hagar means Mount Sinai in the country of Arabia . She is like the city of Jerusalem today , because Jerusalem is a slave and her children are too .
48004026	But the city of Jerusalem in heaven is free , and that is our mother .
48004027	The holy writings say , The woman who has not had a child , be happy ! You who do not feel the pain of bearing a child , open your mouth and shout . The woman who is left alone has more children than the woman who has a husband !
48004028	My brothers , we are like Isaac . We are born because God made a promise .
48004029	Abrahams child who was born as any child is born , troubled the other child who was born by the Spirit . It is that way today .
48004030	But what does the holy writings say ? They says , Put away the slave woman and her son . The son of the slave woman will have nothing when the father dies . The son of the free woman will have everything .
48004031	So , my brothers , we are not the children of the slave woman , but we are children of the free woman .
48005001	Christ has made us really free . So , stay free ! Do not let yourselves be made slaves again .
48005002	I , Paul , say to you again that if you let yourselves be circumcised , Christ is no help to you at all .
48005003	Again I say to every man who is circumcised , he must obey all the law .
48005004	Some of you are trying to obey the law , so that God will call you good . If you do this , you have been cut off from Christ . You have lost the blessing of God .
48005005	But we hope to be made right by believing in Christ . The Spirit helps us to do this .
48005006	So if a man belongs to Christ Jesus , it does not matter if he is circumcised or not . He must show by his love that he believes .
48005007	You were doing well . Who stopped you from doing what is right ?
48005008	God calls you but he is not the one who made you change your minds .
48005009	Even a little yeast makes all the bread rise .
48005010	The Lord makes me sure that you will not think any other way . But the teacher who is troubling your minds will be punished . It does not matter who he is .
48005011	My brothers , am I still telling people to be circumcised ? If I am , why are people still troubling me ? If it were true , the cross of Christ , which they do not like , has lost its power .
48005012	These teachers are troubling your minds . How I wish they would cut themselves off !
48005013	You , my brothers , were called to be free . But do not take that to mean that you can do as you please . But work for each other because you love each other .
48005014	This one law is the whole law : Love your neighbour as you love yourself .
48005015	But if you bite and chew each other , be careful , or you will be killed by each other .
48005016	So I say , let the Spirit tell you what you should do . Then you will not do the wrong things you yourselves want to do .
48005017	People want to do wrong things that the Spirit does not want them to do . And the Spirit wants people to do things they do not want to do . The Spirit and the wrong things you want to do are against each other , so that you do not do what you yourself want to do .
48005018	If you do what the Spirit wants you to do , then you will be free from the law .
48005019	It is easy to see the wrong things people want to do . Both married people and those who are not married commit adultery . People make themselves unclean because of their wrong use of sex . They do things they should be ashamed of doing .
48005020	They worship idols . They use witch-power . They hate . They quarrel . They are jealous . They get angry . They want their own way . They do not agree together and they join different groups against each other .
48005021	They want what other people have . They even kill . They drink too much strong drink . They like to take part in loud drinking and dancing . They do other things like these . I have told you before and I tell you again . Those who do these things will not be in the kingdom of God .
48005022	But these are the things which the Spirit wants you to show : love , joy , peace , patience , being kind , being good , being true , being gentle , and keeping the body under control . There is no law that says , These things are wrong .
48005023	Those who belong to Christ Jesus have stopped doing the wrong things they want to do . They have stopped them just as if they were killed on a cross . And they have even stopped wanting to do them .
48005024	The Spirit gives us life . And so we should do what the Spirit wants us to do .
48005025	We must not be proud of ourselves . We must not make one another angry . We must not want what other people have .

48006001	My brothers , perhaps a man has done something wrong . If so , you who are strong in the Spirit must help him to do the right thing again . Help him in a gentle way . Take care yourself , that you are not tried and will want to do wrong .
48006002	Help each other in your troubles . In that way you obey Christs law .
48006003	A man who thinks that he is an important person when he is not , that man fools himself .
48006004	Let every man test his own work . Then he will be proud of his own work . He will not be proud because he thinks his own work is better than someone elses work .
48006005	Each man must carry his own load .
48006006	People are taught the word of God . They should give some of all the good things they have to those who teach them .
48006007	Do not be fooled about this . God cannot be fooled . A man gets what he plants .
48006008	The man who plants the wrong things he wants to do will get death , because of those wrong things . But the person who plants what the Spirit wants him to do will live for ever , because of the Spirit .
48006009	We must not get tired of doing good things . If we do not stop doing them , we will get something back when the right time comes .
48006010	So then , when we can , we should do good to all people . But most of all , we should do it to those who are in Gods family .
48006011	( See , I am writing this to you in big letters with my own hand . )
48006012	Some people want to do things that can be seen . They try to force you to be circumcised . They want to hide from trouble which would come to them if they talk about the cross of Christ .
48006013	Even those who are circumcised do not obey the law . But they want you to be circumcised . Then they can be proud that they made you do it .
48006014	But I will not be proud of anything but of the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ . Because of it , the things of the world have become dead to me , and I have become dead to the world .
48006015	It does not matter if a person is circumcised or not , but he must become a new person .
48006016	May all who live by this rule have peace . And may God bless them . They are the true people of Israel and they belong to God .
48006017	From now on , please do not trouble me . For I have marks on my body that show I belong to the Lord Jesus .
48006018	My brothers , may the kindness and grace of our Lord Jesus Christ bless your spirit . May he do it !
49001001	I am Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ . It was Gods wish for me to be his messenger . I send greetings to Gods people in the city of Ephesus , to those who believe in Christ Jesus .
49001002	May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ in their kindness give you peace .
49001003	Praise God , the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ! He has blessed us in Christ with every blessing which is in heaven , such as the Spirit gives us .
49001004	Before the world was made , God chose us in Christ . He chose us that we should be holy and good before him .
49001005	Because he loved us , he planned that we should be his own children . It is through Jesus Christ that we are Gods children . That is the way God wanted it to be .
49001006	Praise him ! His kindness is great and wonderful . We have been accepted by God through Jesus Christ , whom he loves so much .
49001007	Jesus Christ has given his blood [ died ] to make us free . He has forgiven us for our wrong ways . We have been put right with God freely because of his great kindness .
49001008	He has given us blessing after blessing in his wisdom and understanding .
49001009	He has shown us the plan he had . This plan was what he wanted to do through Christ .
49001010	When the right time came , God planned to bring together everything in heaven and on earth , and make Christ head of them all .
49001011	In and through Christ we will have a share in all that belongs to him . Long ago God chose us for this . And he makes things happen that he wants to do .
49001012	We believed in Christ first , so we will praise him because he is so great and wonderful .
49001013	You also believed in Christ when you heard the true message . That message is the good news by which you were saved . You received the Holy Spirit whom God had promised . You were marked as belonging to him .
49001014	The Holy Spirit is the first part of what we are to receive from God . This proves that we will get all God has promised . Some day we shall have them all . Praise God ! He is very great and wonderful .
49001015	Here is why I always thank God for you . I have heard that you believe in the Lord Jesus and love all of Gods people . I think of you when I talk to God .
49001016	He is the God of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father who is very great and wonderful . I ask him to give you a mind that is wise and will understand about him .
49001017	I ask him that you may understand these things in your hearts . I ask him that you may know what a great hope you have because God has called you . I ask him that you may know the rich and great blessings God has promised to his people .
49001018	I ask him that you may know the wonderful power he has to do things for us who believe in Christ . His power is very strong .
49001019	God used that power when he raised Christ from death and had him sit at his right side in heaven .
49001020	He is greater than any ruler , power , chief , or king . His name is greater than any other name , not only in this world , but in the world that will come .
49001021	And God has put all things under Christ . He has made him the head of the church people in all matters .
49001022	The church [ all the people who believe in Jesus Christ ] is his body . The church people have everything that Christ has . He is the One who is in everything everywhere .
49001023	missing fehlt/missing
49002001	There was a time when you were dead . That was because of the bad and the wrong things you did .
49002002	At one time you did those wrong things , just like the people around you . You obeyed the ruler who has the power over things in the air . That ruler is the spirit who is working now in the people who do not obey God .
49002003	At one time we too all lived like them . We lived to please ourselves . We did what our bodies and our minds wanted us to do . We were people with whom God was angry , just like other people .
49002004	But God was very , very kind . He loved us very , very much .
49002005	We were dead because of the wrong things we had done . He has made us alive with Christ . You have been saved by his love and kindness .
49002006	God raised us from death with Christ Jesus and gave us a place to sit with him in heaven .
49002007	He did this to show us in all times to come how much he can bless people and how kind he is . It was Jesus Christ who brought this kindness to us .
49002008	You have been saved by Gods love and kindness because you believed . It was not because of anything you did , but it was a gift from God .
49002009	You were not saved by trying to do what the law says . So no one can be proud about it .
49002010	God has made us . In Jesus Christ God made us so that we can do good things . He planned that we should live that way .
49002011	So remember that you were not born Jews . ( They call you The Uncircumcised ) .
49002012	Remember you did not know Christ at that time . You were far away from the people of Israel . You had no part in the agreements which God promised to them . You had no hope and you were without God in this world .
49002013	At one time you were far away , but now you have been brought near to God by the blood [ death ] of Jesus Christ .
49002014	Christ has made peace between us . He has brought both Jews and non-Jews together into one people . He has broken down the wall that divided us .
49002015	In his own body Christ made an end of the law and its rules . He did this so that in him two peoples could become one . In this way , he made peace between us .
49002016	He did this so that by the cross he might bring both kinds of people back to God in one body . And by the cross he has stopped our hating each other .
49002017	He came and said that there is now peace . There is peace for you who were far away from God and for those who were near .
49002018	Because of what Christ has done , we can come to the Father by one Spirit .
49002019	So then you are no longer strangers or people far away . But you live with Gods people and belong to Gods family .
49002020	Gods family is like a house and you are part of the building . The apostles and prophets are like the lower walls of the house and you are the building on this foundation . Jesus Christ is the big stone at the corner .
49002021	He is the one who holds the whole house together , and it becomes a holy house belonging to the Lord .
49002022	You too are a part of this house . God himself lives in this house by his Spirit .
49003001	That is why I , Paul , am a prisoner who belongs to Jesus Christ . It is for the sake of you people who are not Jews .
49003002	I am sure you have heard that God gave me work to do for you .
49003003	He showed me what his plan was . And I have already written a little about it to you .
49003004	When you read this , you can understand why I know about his plan for Christ .
49003005	In the past , God did not tell his plan to people . But now the Holy Spirit has shown it to his holy apostles and prophets .
49003006	This is Gods plan . Those who are not Jews will also share in the blessings of God . They also are a part of the body of Jesus Christ . They also will receive the things God has promised in Jesus Christ through the good news .
49003007	God gave me the work of telling that good news . And he blessed me by his power .
49003008	I am less than the least of all Gods people , and yet he blessed me . It is my work to tell those who are not Jews about the wonderful blessings of Christ . There are so many that we cannot know them all .
49003009	God has blessed me so that I might tell all people plainly what his plan is . God , who made all things , did not tell anyone about his plan in all the times in the past .
49003010	Now he wants those who rule and have power in the sky to know how very wise God is . They will know this when they look at the church people .
49003011	This is what God has always planned to do . And he did it in Jesus Christ our Lord .
49003012	In Christ we are not to be afraid to come to God . We are sure we can come because we believe in Christ .
49003013	So I ask you not to be sad when you think of the troubles I have for your sake . You should be proud about it .
49003014	That is why I kneel down before the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
49003015	From him every family in heaven or on earth gets its name .
49003016	I ask him to make you very strong in heart by his Spirit . He has great and wonderful blessings and is able to do so because of the fullness of his glory .
49003017	And I ask that Christ may live in your hearts because you believe in him . I ask that you may live and grow in love .
49003018	I ask that God will give you power to know how wide and long and high and deep the love of Christ is . All Christians should know that .
49003019	I ask God that you may know the love of Christ which is more than we can ever know . I ask that you may be filled with everything that God has .
49003021	God can do much more than we ask him to do , or we even think of . He does it by his power which is working in us . So , praise him in the church meeting in Christ Jesus . Praise him for ever and ever ! May it be so !
49004001	I am a prisoner who belongs to the Lord . I beg you , live the way people should live who have been called by God .
49004002	Do not be proud at all . Be very humble . Love one another and be patient with each other .
49004003	The Spirit has made you all one . Try to stay like that . May you be at peace with one another .
49004004	There is one body of Christ and one Spirit . When God called you , there was one hope before you in your calling .
49004005	There is one Lord , one way to believe , and one baptism .
49004006	There is one God and Father of us all . He is over all . He works through all . And he is living in us all .
49004007	But each one of us has received a blessing , whatever amount Christ has given to each one .
49004008	So then , the holy writings say , When Christ went up to heaven he took those he had won with him . And he gave gifts to men .
49004009	Now , what does he went up mean ? Does it not mean that he also came down to the earth below ?
49004010	The one who came down is the same one who went up higher than all the heavens . He did this so that he would be everywhere .
49004011	The gifts he gave are these : some are to be apostles; some prophets; some evangelists; some pastors and teachers .
49004012	These gifts are to make Gods people better able to do their work for him and to make the body of Christ become stronger .
49004013	The gifts are given so that we will all believe the one way and all know the Son of God . They are given so that we will be really grown-up Christians , like Christ himself .
49004014	The body of Christ must grow so that we will no longer be like children . We are like children when we are pushed this way and that way . We change our minds every time people bring a different teaching . Some teachers teach the lies of men and fool people so that they believe wrong things .
49004015	We must say what is true and say it with love . In that way we will grow up in all things to be like Christ , who is the head of this body .
49004016	The whole body is joined and held together by every joint that it has . It is from Christ that the whole body grows as each different part does its work . It grows so that it becomes stronger in love .
49004017	Here then is what the Lord has told me to say . You must not live like the people who do not believe in God . They do not think clearly .
49004018	Their minds are dark . They are far away from Gods life because they do not know the truth . They have no love in their hearts .
49004019	Nothing makes them ashamed anymore . They live a very bad life . They do every kind of wrong thing . And they always want to do it more .
49004020	That is not what you have learned from Christ !
49004021	You were taught by him , and Jesus has the truth !
49004022	Stop being the person you used to be in your old life . That person was bad because he wanted to do wrong things .
49004023	Have a new mind and heart .
49004024	Be a new person . That new person has been made like God . He does what is right and holy because he knows the truth .
49004025	So stop telling lies . Tell the truth to each other . We all are parts of the same body .
49004026	When you are angry , do not do anything wrong . And do not stay angry after the sun goes down .
49004027	Do not let the devil control you .
49004028	The person who used to steal must not steal now . But he must do some good work with his own hands . Then he will have something to give to the poor people .
49004029	Do not let any bad words come out of your mouth . But say good things that will help people . Then those who hear you will also be blessed by what you say .
49004030	Do nothing that makes the Holy Spirit feel sad . He is the mark God has put on you until the day you will belong to God altogether .
49004031	You must stop all hate , big and small anger , loud talk , saying wrong things about people , and all wanting to do wrong things to people .
49004032	Be kind to one another . Have a loving and understanding heart . Forgive one another because God has forgiven you for Christs sake .
49005001	So try to be like God , because you are his own dear children .
49005002	Love others as Christ has loved us . He gave his life for us , a sweet smelling offering and a sacrifice to God .
49005003	As Gods people , you should not even talk about wrong living , any kind of wrong sex or wanting things you cannot have .
49005004	There should be no dirty talk , no foolish talk , no funny stories with a wrong meaning . This is not a good way to talk . But what you should do is thank God .
49005005	You know this . There are people who use sex wrongly , and who are always wanting what others have . No such a person has any place in the kingdom of Christ and of God . He is worshipping an idol .
49005006	Do not let anyone fool you by their empty talk . It is because people do these wrong things that God is very angry . He is angry with the people who do not obey him .
49005007	So then , have nothing to do with them .
49005008	You were in the dark before , but now the Lord has given you light . Live like people who have the light .
49005009	People who have the light do all that is good and right and true .
49005010	Learn what pleases the Lord .
49005011	Have no part in the empty things people do in the dark . Show them that they are wrong .
49005012	It is a shame even to talk about the things they do in secret .
49005013	But when the light shines on something , it can be seen . Anything that shows up wrong ways is light .
49005014	So it is said , Wake up , you who are asleep ! Rise from death . And Christ will give you light .
49005015	Take care how you live . Do not live like people who are not wise , but live like people who are wise .
49005016	Make good use of time because people live in very wrong ways these days .
49005017	So then , be wise and understand what the Lord wants .
49005018	Do not get drunk with wine . That is living in a wrong way . But be filled with the Spirit .
49005019	Speak to one another by the songs in the holy writings , and songs of praise , and Christian songs . Sing and make a joyful noise in your hearts to the Lord .
49005020	Always thank God the Father for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ .
49005021	Give way to each other because you respect Christ .
49005022	Wives , obey your husbands as you obey the Lord .
49005023	The husband is the head of the wife , just as Christ is the head of the church people . The church is his body and he saved it .
49005024	Wives should obey their husbands in everything , just as the church people obey Christ .
49005025	Husbands , love your wives , just as Christ loved the church people . He gave his life for the church .
49005026	He did that so that he might make the church people holy , when they were washed with water by Gods word .
49005027	He gave his life for the church so that one day he can look at the church and see that the people are great and wonderful . The people of the church must have no dirty spot or wrinkle or any thing like that . But they are to be holy and good .
49005028	So husbands should love their wives as they love their own bodies . The man who loves his wife loves himself .
49005029	No one ever hated his own body . But he feeds it and takes care of it .
49005030	In the same way Christ takes care of the church because we are parts of his body .
49005031	The holy writings say For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother . He shall be joined to his wife , and the two of them shall be like one person .
49005032	This is a wonderful plan of God . I am speaking here of the plan about Christ and the church people .
49005033	However , each one of you should love his wife as he loves himself . And the wife should respect her husband .
49006001	Children , obey your parents as the Lord wants you to . This is the right thing to do .
49006002	Respect your father and mother . This is the first law of God with a promise : So that all will be well with you , and that you may live long on earth .
49006003	Fathers , do not make your children angry . But teach them the things children need to know , and tell them what they must not do . Teach them what Christ would teach them .
49006004	Servants , obey your boss . Respect him with all your heart and try to please him as you would Christ .
49006005	Obey not only when he is looking at you , as if you were pleasing a man . But obey as the servants of Christ , and do with all your heart what God wants you to do .
49006006	Work gladly as if you were working for the Lord and not for men .
49006007	You know that the Lord will pay every man for the good things he does . It does not matter if he is a servant or a free man .
49006008	And you who are bosses , be good to your servants also . Do not talk loud , hard words to them . Remember that both their Lord and yours is in heaven . He does not love one person more than another .
49006009	Last of all , I say this . Be strong in the Lord and use the strength he gives .
49006010	Use everything that God has given you so that you can fight against the tricks of the devil .
49006011	We are not fighting against people of flesh and blood . But we are fighting against rulers and powers whom we cannot see . We are fighting against those who control the darkness of this world , and against bad spirits who have power in the air .
49006012	So use everything that God has given you , that you can fight when the bad time comes . You will need to do everything you can do to stand !
49006013	So then , stand and hold on tight to the truth like you put on a belt . Do what is right . Wear it as a cover for your body .
49006014	You have the good news of peace . Wear that like shoes on your feet .
49006015	You believe in God . Take that and cover all of yourself with it . With that you can stop all the poison arrows of the devil .
49006016	You have been saved . Wear your salvation like you wear something on your head to protect yourself . And take with you the big knife or sword of the Spirit , which is the word of God .
49006017	Always talk to God in the Spirit . Talk to him about everything and ask him for what you need . Put your mind on what you are saying , asking God to help all his people .
49006018	And also , ask God to help me to talk without fear and tell people Gods plan about the good news .
49006019	I am in prison with chains on because I speak the good news about Jesus Christ . Ask God to help me to tell the good news without fear as I should tell it .
49006020	Tychicus will tell you all about me and what I am doing . He is a brother whom I love and a very good helper in the Lords work .
49006021	I am sending him to you so that you will know about us , and so that he may comfort your hearts .
49006022	May God the Father , and the Lord Jesus Christ , give our brothers peace and love with faith .
49006023	May the kindness of God bless all who love our Lord Jesus Christ .

50001001	We , Paul and Timothy , are servants of Christ Jesus . We send greetings to all of Gods people who belong to Christ Jesus and who live in the city of Philippi . We send greetings to the leaders of the church people and those who have been chosen to help them .
50001002	May the loving kindness of God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace .
50001003	Every time I think of you I thank God for you .
50001004	I have joy in my heart every time I ask God to help you .
50001005	I thank God for the joy we share in telling the good news from the very first day until now .
50001006	God began to do a good work in you . And I am sure that he will keep on doing it until he has finished it . He will keep on until the day Jesus Christ comes again .
50001007	I have a right to feel this way about you all because I love you very much . God is good to me and you all share in this goodness . You share in my troubles in prison . You share in my work of staying true to the good news of Jesus .
50001008	I love you all as Jesus Christ loves you . God knows that what I say is true .

50001010	When I talk to God I ask that you may have more and more love . I ask him that you will also know and understand , so that you will be able to see what things are right . I want you to be clean with nothing wrong in you when Jesus Christ comes back .
50001011	I want you to be doing right by the help of Jesus Christ . That will make people praise God and will show how great he is .
50001012	My brothers , I want you to know that what has happened to me has made more people know about the good news .
50001013	All the soldiers here and all the other people know that I am in prison because of Christ .
50001014	Because I am in prison , most of my Christian brothers are stronger for the Lord . They are strong in the faith now and they are not afraid to tell Gods good news about Jesus Christ .
50001015	Some of them tell about Christ because they are jealous . They want to prove they are better than me . Some of them tell about Christ because they want to help me .
50001016	The first ones do it because they want to prove they are better than I am . They do not have a good reason . But they think they will make trouble for me while I am in prison .
50001017	These last ones do it because they love me . They know that I am here to speak for the good news .
50001018	But it does not matter . Every way , in the wrong way or in the right way , Christ is talked about . I will be glad because of that .
50001019	Yes , I will keep on being glad about it . I know that you will talk to God about me , and I know that the Spirit of Jesus Christ will help me . So I know that things will work out for me to be free .
50001020	I look forward to this very much and hope that I will not be ashamed at all . But I want to be very strong . I want to bring honour to Christ now as I always have . I can do this if I live or die .
50001021	All I live for is Christ , and to die would give me more blessing .
50001022	If I keep on living , then I will keep on doing my good work . I really do not know which I want more , to live or to die .
50001023	I am caught between these two . I want to die and go to be with Christ , which would be very much better .
50001024	But you need me more to stay here .
50001025	Because I am sure of this , I know that I will stay on and be here with you all . That will help you to be better Christians and happy ones .
50001026	Then you will be even more happy about what Christ Jesus has done for me because I have come back to you .
50001027	So whatever happens , live as people who believe the good news of Christ should live . Then , if I come and see you , or if I am away and hear about you , you will be standing strong together in one spirit . With one mind you will be working hard together for the good news .
50001028	Do not fear in any way those who are working against you . It is God who shows them they are lost and you are saved .
50001029	God has given you a special gift . You can not only believe in Christ but also suffer for him .
50001030	You have the same trouble which you saw me have . And you hear now that I still have it .
50002001	Does Christ speak to you ? Does love call to you ? Do you have a part in the Holy Spirit ? Do you have any love and care for others ?
50002002	Then make me very , very happy . Live in happiness with one another . Have the same love for each other . Think the same way . Agree together about things . All have one purpose in mind .
50002003	Do not try to prove you are better than others . Do not be proud of yourselves , but be humble . Think of other people as being better than yourselves .
50002004	Each one of you should not think only about himself , but about other people also .
50002005	Think the same way Jesus Christ thought .
50002006	He was in every way like God . Yet he did not think that being equal to God was something he must hold on to .
50002007	He gave this up and became a servant . He was born a baby .
50002008	And when he was a man , he was humble . He was even willing to die , yes , to die on a cross .
50002009	That is why God has made him very great . God has given him a name above every name .
50002010	Everyone in heaven , everyone on earth , and everyone under the earth will kneel before the name of Jesus .
50002011	Everyone will admit that Jesus Christ is Lord . They will praise God the Father for this .
50002012	My dear people , you have always obeyed me . God has saved you from wrong ways . Now show this by the good things that you do . You must live that way , not only when I am with you , but much more now that I am not with you . Think of how wrong it will be if you do not . Try hard to work out how to do it .
50002013	For God is at work in you . He helps you want to do it . And he helps you do what he wants you to do .
50002014	Do everything without grumbling or making trouble .
50002015	In that way you will be completely good . No one will be able to say anything wrong about you . You will be Gods good children living amongst bad people . Among them you will shine like lights in the world .
50002016	You will have the message of life for them . I will be proud of you when Christ comes . My work and trouble will not be for nothing .
50002017	The life you live because you believe in God is like a sacrifice . Even if I am killed , it will be like wine which people pour on a sacrifice . I am happy to do this for you , and I am happy about you .
50002018	In the same way you must be happy . And you must be happy about me .
50002019	I hope the Lord Jesus will let me send Timothy to you soon . I will be glad to hear about you .
50002020	I have no one like Timothy . He is troubled to know about you .
50002021	All the other people think only of themselves and not of Jesus Christ .
50002022	But you know what a good man Timothy is . You know that he has worked with me in telling the good news . He has worked just as a son works with his father .
50002023	So I hope to send him to you as soon as I see what happens to me .
50002024	And I trust that the Lord will let me come to you soon myself .
50002025	I thought I must send Epaphroditus , our Christian brother , back to you . He has worked with me and has also been a soldier of Christ with me . He was your messenger and he brought your gift for my needs .
50002026	I am sending him back because he has been lonely without you all . And his heart has been troubled because you heard that he was sick .
50002027	He was very sick ! He almost died ! But God was kind to him . He was not only kind to him , but also to me . God did not let me have one trouble after another .
50002028	I want even more to send him to you so that you will be happy when you see him again . And I will not be so troubled any more .
50002029	So receive him with much joy because he is a Christian brother . Give respect to men like him .
50002030	He almost died doing the work of Christ . You wished to help me , but you could not come . He came instead . He was willing to put his life in danger in order to help me .
50003001	Now , my brothers , I say be glad for what the Lord has done for you . It is not hard for me to write the same things to you over and over . And it is good for you .
50003002	Watch out for those teachers who are like dogs . Watch out for those teachers who do wrong things . And watch out for those teachers who want you to have the mark of a Jew cut in your bodies .
50003003	We have Gods Spirit and we worship God in the Spirit . So we are the people who have the mark of God . Christ Jesus is our reason for being joyful . We do not trust in having a mark cut in our bodies .
50003004	And yet I could trust in things about myself if I wanted to . If any other man thinks that he has something about himself to trust in , I have more things .
50003005	I had the mark of a Jew cut in my body when I was eight days old . I was born of the people of Israel . I belong to the family of Benjamin , so I was born a true Jew . I was a Pharisee , so I obeyed the Jewish law very carefully .
50003006	I was so full of my own ideas that I sent Christians to prison . But I was a good man in the way the Jewish law calls a man good .
50003007	But all these things that might have helped me , I call them all nothing , because of Christ .
50003008	Yes , I call them all nothing , because to know Christ Jesus my Lord is much better . It is for his sake that I have given them all up and call them just dirt . I have lost them but gained Christ .
50003009	I do it so that I will belong to him . I do not want to be called good because of the Jewish law . But I want to be made good by believing in Christ . I want to be put right with God through faith alone .
50003010	I want to know Christ . I want to know the power that raised him from death . I want to have a part in his trouble . I want to be like him in his death .
50003011	Then I hope to be raised from death .
50003012	I do not mean to say that I have got there yet , or that I am perfect yet . But I am trying hard to get there , because that is why Christ saved me .
50003013	My brothers , I do not yet think that I have got all the things of Christ . But there is one thing that I am doing . I forget what is behind me and reach out to what is ahead of me .
50003014	Like a man running a race , I try hard to reach the line so that I will receive the prize . Because we belong to Christ Jesus , God is calling us to receive this prize that he has for us in heaven .
50003015	All of us who are grown-up Christians should feel this way . And if you do not think this way , God will show you the right way .
50003016	But no matter how far we have gone , we must keep on going that way . And let us do it together , having the same things in mind .
50003017	My brothers , do as I do , all of you . Look at the people who live the way we have lived .
50003018	Many people live as if they hated the cross of Christ . I have often told you about them , and I tell you now with tears .
50003019	They will be lost for ever . Their belly is the god they worship . They boast about things they should be ashamed of . They think only about things of this world .
50003020	But we belong to heaven . And we are waiting for the Saviour to come from heaven . He is the Lord Jesus Christ .
50003021	He will change our body which was made for this world . He will make it like his own wonderful body . He will do this by his power to make all things obey him .
50004001	And so , my brothers , I love you and want very much to be with you . I am very happy about you . And you are like a prize I have won in a race . My dear people , keep on standing firm and strong in the Lord .
50004002	I beg Euodia and Syntyche to agree to work together . I ask them to be of the same mind in the Lord .
50004003	I beg you , my real helper , to help these women . They worked hard with me in telling the good news . Clement and my other helpers worked hard with me too . Their names are in Gods Book of Life . Always be glad for what the Lord has done . I will say it again , be glad .
50004004	Let everyone know that you think kindly of others before yourselves . The Lord is near .
50004005	Do not worry about anything . Talk to God about everything . Thank him for what you have . Ask him for what you need .
50004006	Then God will give you peace , a peace which is too wonderful to understand . That peace will keep your hearts and minds safe as you trust in Christ Jesus .
50004007	Here , my brothers , are some things I want you to think about . Think about things that are true , honest , right , clean and pure , things that are lovely , and things that are good to talk about . If they are good , and if they bring praise to God , think about these things .
50004008	I taught you , and you learned things from me . You heard the things I said , and you saw the things I did . Do these same things yourselves . Then God who gives peace will be with you .
50004009	The Lord made me very happy to know that you were thinking about me again . Yes , I know you were thinking of me before , but you had no way to help me .
50004010	I do not mean that I needed it . I have learned to be satisfied with what I have . I am happy with whatever happens to me .
50004011	I know how to live when I am poor , and I know how to live when I am rich . No matter how things are , I have learned how to live : when I have plenty of food , or when I am hungry; when I have more things than I need , and when I do not have enough .
50004012	I can do all things because Christ gives me strength .
50004013	But you were kind to help me when I was in trouble .
50004014	You people of Philippi know this too . When I first told the good news after I left the country of Macedonia , you were the only church people who helped me . You sent me money to pay my expenses .
50004015	Even when I was in the city of Thessalonica , you sent money to help me more than once .
50004016	It is not that I want the gift . But I want you to have more and more blessing because you give .
50004017	I have all I need and more . Yes , I have plenty because Epaphroditus gave me what you sent me . Your gift was like a sweet-smelling offering to God . It was a sacrifice which God took and it pleased him .
50004018	My God will give you everything you need . He has wonderful riches in heaven because of Christ Jesus .
50004019	Praise God our Father for ever . Yes , he will do it .
50004020	Please give my greetings to every one who belongs to Christ Jesus . The Christian brothers who are with me greet you .
50004021	All of Gods people send greetings to you , especially the people of Caesars house .
50004022	The loving kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all . Amen , may it be so !

51001001	I am Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ . God wanted me to be an apostle .
51001002	Timothy our brother , and I are writing this letter to Gods people , the Christian brothers in the city of Colossae . May the kindness of God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace .
51001003	We give thanks to God . He is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ . When we ask God to bless you , we always thank him for you .
51001004	We have heard that you believe in Christ Jesus and love all of Gods people .
51001005	And also , you are looking ahead to what you will have in heaven . You have heard about it already when the good news was told to you .
51001006	That message has reached you . It is doing good and it is spreading everywhere in the world . It is doing the same among you . It began the day you heard and understood Gods blessing , which came to you in a clear way .
51001007	Epaphras taught you the truth . He is Christs servant , as we are also , and we love him . He is a good worker to help you .
51001008	Also , it is he who told us of your love in the Spirit .
51001009	That is why we keep on talking to God about you since the day we heard about you . We ask him that you may know everything he wants you to do . We ask him that you may be very wise and that the Spirit will help you to understand .
51001010	We ask him that you will live the way the Lord wants you to live , so that you will please him in everything you do . We ask that you will do everything that is good . We ask that you will see the fruit from what you do . We ask that you will know more and more about God .
51001011	God has wonderful power . And we ask him to give you all the strength you need to go through all your troubles , to be very patient in them , and to be happy .
51001012	Thank the Father who has made us ready to be with the people of God who live in his light .
51001013	He has set us free from the kingdom where it is dark . And he has put us into the kingdom where his dear Son rules .
51001014	Because of his Son , we are set free and the wrong things we have done are forgiven .
51001015	The Son is like God who cannot be seen . He was his Son before anything was made .
51001016	He made everything in the sky and on the earth . He made the things which can be seen and the things which cannot be seen . That means angels , kings , great powers , and rulers . They were all made by him and for him .
51001017	He himself was before all things . And he holds all things together .
51001018	He is also the head of the body which is the church [ the people who believe in Jesus Christ ] . He is the beginning , the first one to rise from death , so that he would be the first one in everything .
51001019	God wanted Christ to have everything in himself .
51001020	And God chose him to be the one who would bring all things back to himself . God made peace by the blood which Christ gave on his cross . He would bring back all things on earth and in heaven .
51001021	At one time you were far away from God . You hated him in your hearts and you did wrong things .
51001022	But now Christ himself has died on a cross , and he has brought you back to God . Christ will bring you before God holy , clean , and good .
51001023	But you must keep on believing and stand strong and true . Let nothing shake the hope which the good news brought you . You heard the same good news as is told to everyone in the whole world . I , Paul , was given the work of telling that same good news .
51001024	And now , even though I suffer for you , I am happy . There are still some things for Christ to suffer in his body , which is the church . So I am glad to take my share of his suffering in my body .
51001025	God gave me work to do for the church people so that you might know all of Gods message .
51001026	This message is about the secret plan of God . People who lived in all the past times of the world did not know about this plan . But now it has been told to Gods people .
51001027	He wanted them to know that his plan is very great and wonderful for those who are not Jews . And this plan is that Christ is in you ! He is your hope for all the wonderful things that are to come .
51001028	We tell about him . We tell everyone to be careful to live in the right way . We teach everyone all he needs to know . We do this so that we can bring everyone before God and he will be grown up in the things of Christ .
51001029	And I am working for this with all the strength that God gives me .
51002001	I want you to know how much I care for you and those in the city of Laodicea , and even all those who have never seen me .
51002002	I want them to be strong and to love one another . I want them to understand everything . I want them to know in a more perfect way about Gods plan , which is Christ .
51002003	All the wonderful things there are to know about the plan are found in Christ .
51002004	I say this so that no one may lead you the wrong way by their fine words .
51002005	Even though I am not with you in body , I am with you in spirit . I am happy to see that you stand together well and that you keep on believing in Christ .
51002006	You received Christ Jesus the Lord . So live in him .
51002007	Let your heart be planted in him . Grow up in him . Believe with all your heart what you were taught . And be very thankful to God .
51002008	Do not let anyone fool you by his wise words . They are not true . They are what men say . They are the teachings of this world and not what Christ says .
51002009	Christ has everything that God has .
51002010	And you , too , have everything when you are in him . He rules over every power and ruler .
51002011	In Christ you were not circumcised by mens hands . But you were circumcised in Christs way when all the wrong things you did in your bodies were taken away .
51002012	You were buried with Christ when you were baptised . You were also raised with him to a new life when you were baptised . You were raised because you believed in the power of God who raised Christ from death .
51002013	You were dead because of the wrong things you had done , and because your lives had not been made clean . But God gave you life with Christ . He forgave you for all the wrong things you did .
51002014	He wiped out all the things that were written against us in the laws . He took the writing away and nailed it to a cross .
51002015	He won the victory over powers and rulers . He showed that they had no power at all . He showed the world his victory through the cross .
51002016	So do not let anyone say you are wrong about what you eat or drink , or about a feast , or a special holy day or a Sabbath day .
51002017	They are like a shadow of what is to come . But Christ is the body that makes the shadow .
51002018	Do not let anyone tell you that you are wrong and that to be humble you must worship angels . He talks about things he has not seen . He is very proud , but he has nothing to be proud of , because his thoughts come from his own mind .
51002019	He is not joined to the real head which is Christ . It is from him that the whole body receives strength and is held together by its joints and muscles . It is from him that the body grows as God makes it grow .
51002020	Did you die with Christ ? Then you left the teachings of this world . So why do you obey laws as if you were still living in this world ?
51002021	I mean laws like this : " Do not touch that . Do not eat this . Do not put your hand on that . "
51002022	All such things are gone as soon as they are used . These are laws made and taught by men .
51002023	These laws look as if they are good laws . They make a show of doing things for God . They make people humble themselves in some way . They make people control their bodies in certain ways . But they have no power to keep people from doing all the wrong things they want to do .
51003001	Were you raised from death with Christ ? Then look for the things which are in heaven . There Christ is sitting at the right hand of God .
51003002	Think about the things that are in heaven , not about things that are on earth .
51003003	Your old life died with Christ and your new life is kept with Christ in God .
51003004	Christ is our life . When he comes again and is seen , then you will also be seen with him . And you will be great .
51003005	So then , put to death those things of this world which are in you . I mean these things : wrong sex , things that are not clean , a heart that is burning to do wrong things , wanting what is wrong , and wanting to have what other people have . This last one is like worshipping an idol .
51003006	They are things that make God angry .
51003007	You used to do these things when you lived that way .
51003008	But now you must stop all these : being angry , hating people , wrong feelings toward others , saying wrong things about people , and dirty talking .
51003009	Do not tell lies to one another . You have stopped being the person you used to be who did wrong things .
51003010	And now you have become a new person . That new person is always learning more and more until he becomes like God who made him .
51003011	In this new person , there is no difference between a Greek and a Jew . There is no difference between a man who is circumcised with the mark of the Jew and a man who is not circumcised . There is no difference between a person from a friendly country or someone from a country which is not friendly . There is no difference between a slave and a person who is free . Christ is everything and is in all of them .
51003012	You are chosen by God . He loves you and has made you holy . So then , care for one another . Be kind . Do not be proud . Be humble . Be patient .
51003013	Be patient with one another . If any one has a complaint against another , forgive that one . Christ forgave you . So you should forgive each other .
51003014	Beside all these , you must have love . This joins everything together as it should be .
51003015	Hold on to the peace of God which is in your hearts . You were called to have peace because you are all like one body . Be thankful .
51003016	Let your hearts be filled with the word of Christ . Be very wise when you teach people and help them to understand what is right and wrong . Sing with music . Sing praises and Christian songs . Sing to the Lord with praise in your hearts .
51003017	Whatever you say , or whatever you do , do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus . Give thanks to God the Father through Jesus .
51003018	Wives , obey your husbands . This is the right way to live when you belong to the Lord .
51003019	Husbands , love your wives and do not be unkind to them .
51003020	Children , obey your parents in everything . This pleases the Lord .
51003021	Fathers , do not make your children angry . They might stop trying to do right .
51003022	Servants , obey your boss in everything . Obey always , not only when he is looking at you as if you were pleasing a man . Do it with all your heart because you respect the Lord .
51003023	Whatever your work is , do it gladly . Do it as you would do it unto the Lord and not for people .
51003024	You know you will get pay from the Lord , for you are the servants of the Lord Christ .
51003025	The person who does wrong will be punished for the wrong he has done . God does not love one person more than another .
51004001	You who are a boss , do what is right to your servants . You know that you also have a Master in heaven .
51004002	Always take time to talk to God . Put your mind on what you are saying . And thank God for what he has done .
51004003	Talk to God about us too . Ask him to open a way for us to tell people his message . We want to tell Gods plan about Christ . That is why I am in prison because of that plan .
51004004	I want to be free to talk about it as I should do .
51004005	Act the right way to people who are not Christians . Make good use of your time .
51004006	Always say good things when you talk . Talk in a way that will make people listen . Then you will know how to answer people .
51004007	Tychicus will tell you all about me . He is a brother whom I love . He is a very good helper and works with me in the Lords work .
51004008	I am sending him to you so that you will know about us and so that he may comfort your hearts .
51004009	I am sending Onesimus with him . He is also a good brother whom I love . He is one of you . They will tell you all about everything here .
51004010	Here are the people who send you greetings : Aristarchus , who is in prison with me , and Mark , a cousin of Barnabas . I have already told you to welcome him if he comes to you .
51004011	Jesus , whose other name is Justus , also sends greetings . These men are the only Jews who are doing Gods work with me . And they have comforted me much .
51004012	Epaphras sends you greetings . He is one of you and is a servant of Christ Jesus . He always talks to God about you with all his heart . He asks God to help you to be strong so that you will become grown-up Christians and know all that God wants you to do .
51004013	I myself have seen how hard he has worked for you and for the people in the cities of Laodicea and Hierapolis .
51004014	Luke , the doctor whom I love , and Demas also greet you .
51004015	Give my greetings to the brothers at Laodicea , and also to Nympha and the church people who meet in her house .
51004016	When you have read this letter , then be sure that it is also read to the church people in Laodicea . And be sure that you read the letter which will be sent to you from Laodicea .
51004017	Tell Archippus , See that you do all the work which the Lord has given you to do .
51004018	I , Paul , write this greeting with my own hand . Remember that I am in prison . God bless you .
52001001	Paul , Silvanus , and Timothy , send greetings to the church people in the city of Thessalonica . The people of this church belong to God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ . May the kindness of God bless you and give you peace . for all of you , and we always talk to him about you .
52001002	You do good things because you believe . You work very hard because you have love in your hearts . You are patient because you have hope in our Lord Jesus Christ . We remember these things when we talk to God our Father about you .
52001003	My brothers , God loves you and we know that he has chosen you .
52001004	The good news we brought you was not just words . It had power . It had the Holy Spirit . It made people very sure it was true . And you also know how we lived when we were with you to help you .
52001005	You tried hard to be like us and like the Lord . You had much trouble because you believed our message . Yet the Holy Spirit made you very happy .
52001006	You have shown all the Christians in the countries of Macedonia and Greece how they should live .
52001007	People in Macedonia and Greece have heard from you the message about the Lord . And people everywhere have heard that you believe in God . So there is no need for us to write about your faith .
52001008	They tell us how glad you were to see us . They tell us about how you left your idols and turned to God . You worship the God who is the living and true God .
52001009	And you wait for his Son to come again from heaven . God raised his Son Jesus from death . It is Jesus who saves us from Gods great anger which is to come .

52002001	My brothers , you yourselves know that our visit to you was not for nothing .
52002002	The people at the city of Philippi treated us very badly . As you know , we had much trouble . But God helped us , and we did not fear to tell you Gods good news . But many things were against us and tried to stop us .
52002003	Our message was not a lie . What we told you was not wrong . And we did not try to fool you .
52002004	But God chose us to tell people the good news . And so we do not speak to please men , but to please God . He is the one who knows what is in our hearts .
52002005	We never said nice things about people that were not true . You know this . We never talked to get something out of it for ourselves . God knows this .
52002006	And we did not ask you or anybody else to help us or to praise us . Of course , we are apostles of Christ , and we had the right to do so .
52002007	But we were kind when we were with you . We were like a woman taking care of her own children .
52002008	Because we loved you , we were glad to give you Gods good news . We were also glad to give you our lives , because we loved you very much .
52002009	My brothers , you remember how hard we worked . We worked night and day so that we would not trouble any of you . And we told you Gods good news .
52002010	We lived in a holy and right way among you Christians . We did nothing wrong to you . You know this yourselves and God knows it too .
52002011	You know how we talked to each of you as a father talks to his children . We comforted , helped , and taught you .
52002012	We told you to live to please God . He called you to his own kingdom and greatness .
52002013	And here is another reason why we always thank God all the time . When you heard Gods word from us , you did not say , That is mens word . But you said , That is Gods word . And it really is Gods word . The word is working in you Christians .
52002014	My brothers , you were like the churches of God in Judea which belong to Christ Jesus . The people of your own country troubled you in the same way that the Jews troubled them .
52002015	The Jewish leaders killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets . And they drove us out of their country . They do not please God and they are against all other people .
52002016	They try to stop us from talking to those people who are not Jews . They do not want them to be saved . So they are always doing wrong things . And now at last , God has become very angry with them . have been away from you for a short time in body , but not in heart . We wanted very much to see you face to face , and we tried hard to come .
52002017	We wanted to come to you . Twice , I , Paul , wanted to come . But Satan stopped us .
52002018	What is our hope when our Lord Jesus comes ? What will make us happy and proud then ? It is you people !
52002019	You are ones of whom we are proud . You make us happy .

52003001	We felt we could not wait any longer . So we thought it best to stay at the city of Athens alone .
52003002	And we sent our brother Timothy to you . He works for God by telling the good news about Christ . We sent him to help you be strong and to encourage you in what you believe .
52003003	We do not want anyone to give up because of the trouble . You yourselves know that we all will surely have trouble .
52003004	When we were with you , we told you that we would have trouble . Trouble came . And now you know what we said is true .
52003005	That is why I could not wait any longer . I sent Timothy to find out if you were still believing . I was afraid that Satan had tried you too much . Then our work would have been for nothing .
52003006	But now Timothy has come back to us from you . He has brought us the good news that you are still believing and have love in your hearts . He has told us that you always remember us . He also told us that you want to see us , just as we want to see you .
52003007	My brothers , the way you believe has comforted us in all our troubles .
52003008	It gives us new life now to know that you are standing strong in the Lord .
52003009	We cannot thank God enough for you . We are very happy about you as we talk to God .
52003010	Night and day we ask God that we may see you face to face . We want to help you know more about what you believe .
52003011	Now may our God and Father himself , and our Lord Jesus , open the way for us to come to you .
52003012	May the Lord make you stronger in your love for each other . Love others in the way we love you .
52003013	We want the Lord to help you to stand strong . And then , when the Lord Jesus comes with all Gods people , you will be holy in the eyes of our God and Father . He will see no fault in you .
52004001	And now , brothers , here is what we ask you to do . We beg you in the name of the Lord Jesus . We taught you how to live and to please God . You are living that way now , and we want you to do so more and more .
52004002	You know what we told you through the Lord Jesus Christ .
52004003	This is what God wants . He wants you to live clean lives . He wants you to keep away from wrong sex .
52004004	Each of you should know how to control yourself . Honour your body to make it holy .
52004005	Do not have sex with a person you are not married to . Control your strong feelings . Do not act like the people who do not know God .
52004006	Do not do wrong to your Christian brother by taking his wife for yourself . The Lord will surely punish all those who do wrong in these things . We have already told you that and made it very clear .
52004007	God did not call us to live unclean lives . He wants you to live clean and holy lives .
52004008	So anyone who does not obey is not just disobeying a man , but he is disobeying God . And it is God who has given us his Holy Spirit .
52004009	You do not need anyone to write to you about how to love each other . God himself has taught you to be loving towards each other .
52004010	And you do love all the Christian brothers who are in the whole country of Macedonia . But we beg you , brothers , love them more and more .
52004011	Please try to live a quiet life . Mind your own business . Work with your hands as we told you to do .
52004012	Then people who do not belong to the church will respect you . And you will not need help from anyone . here is something I want you to know about those who have died . You should not cry for them like people cry who have no hope .
52004013	We believe that Jesus died and rose again . And because of what Jesus did , God will bring back with him those who have died .
52004014	We tell you what the Lord said . We who are still alive when the Lord comes , will not go ahead of those who have died .
52004015	The Lord himself will come down from heaven . There will be a shout , a great angel will speak , and Gods loud horn or trumpet will be blown .
52004016	Then we who are still alive on earth will be caught up together with those who were dead . We will be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air . And then we will be with the Lord forever !
52004017	Therefore , comfort one another with these words .

52005001	My brothers , you do not need anyone to write to you about the day or the year when these things will happen .
52005002	You your-selves surely know that the day of the Lord will come just like a person who comes to steal in the night .
52005003	When people are saying , Everything is quiet and safe , they will be destroyed . It will all happen very quickly . And there will be no way out . It will be like the pain that a woman has when a child is born .
52005004	But you , my brothers , are not in the dark . That day should not surprise you like a person who comes to steal .
52005005	You all belong to the light . You belong to the day . We do not belong to the night or to the dark .
52005006	So then , we must not go to sleep like other people . No , we must keep watching and not get drunk .
52005007	Because we belong to the day , we must not get drunk . But we must be ready like people dressed for war . We must keep believing in God . We must be loving towards each other . Faith and love will be like strong clothes to cover our bodies . The hope of being saved will protect us like a hat or helmet covers our head .
52005008	God did not choose us so that he might be angry with us . But he chose us so that we might be saved through our Lord Jesus Christ .
52005009	He died for us so that , if we are alive or dead , we will live with him .
52005010	So comfort and strengthen one another , just as you are doing . you to respect those who are working among you . They are your leaders in the Lords work , and they tell you what you should do .
52005011	My brothers , we beg you , tell this to people who do not do what they should do . Talk to those who fear , and say something that will make them strong . Help those who are weak . Be patient with all people .
52005012	Do not let anyone do a wrong thing to a person if that person did a wrong thing to him . Always do good to one another . Be good to each other and to all men .
52005013	Always be happy .
52005014	Talk to God at all times .
52005015	Thank God for everything . This is what God wants you to do through Christ Jesus .
52005016	Do not stop the Spirit when he wants to do something .
52005017	Do not despise people who speak words from God .
52005018	But test everything that is said . Keep what is good .
52005019	Have nothing to do with any kind of wrong thing .
52005020	May God himself , who gives peace , make you pure and clean . You are set apart and belong only to him . And may your spirit and soul and body all together be kept free from fault until our Lord Jesus Christ comes .
52005021	) It is God who calls you , and he can be trusted . He will surely do what he has said .
52005022	My brothers , ask God to help us .
52005023	Greet all the brothers with a kiss that is holy .
52005024	I give you this order from the Lord . Read this letter to all the Christian brothers .

53001001	Paul , Silvanus , and Timothy send greetings to the church people in the city of Thessalonica . This church belongs to God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
53001002	May God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ , in their kindness , give you much happiness and peace .
53001003	My brothers , we thank God for you always . It is the right thing to do . You trust him more and more . You all love each other more and more .
53001004	So we are proud of you . We tell the churches of God about you because you are standing strong and you keep on believing in God . Your troubles and hard times do not stop you .
53001005	This proves that God will judge right . And he will say that you are good enough for the kingdom of God because you suffer for it .
53001006	God will do what is right . He will give trouble to those who are troubling you .
53001007	And he will give rest to you who are having troubles , and to us also . He will give this rest when our Lord Jesus comes back from heaven . The Lord Jesus will come with his strong angels in flaming fire .
53001008	He will punish those who do not know God , and those who do not obey the good news of our Lord Jesus .
53001009	They will be destroyed for ever . That will be their punishment . They will be for ever separated from the Lord and from his great and wonderful power .
53001010	This will happen on the day he comes . On that day his people will show how great and wonderful he is . And all those who have believed in him will be surprised at how great he is . That means you also , because you believed what we told you .
53001011	That is why we always talk to God about you . We want our God to make you fit for the good work to which he called you . We ask him to finish his good work of faith which trusts in his power .
53001012	In that way you will make the name of our Lord Jesus Christ great . And he will make you great . This will be because of the kindness of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ .
53002001	My brothers , we want to talk to you about the time when our Lord Jesus Christ comes again and we are taken to meet him .
53002002	Do not let your minds be easily upset . Do not be troubled by a spirit , or a message , or a letter . Do not be troubled if you hear that the day of the Lord has already come . Some people will say it came from us .
53002003	Do not let anyone fool you in any way . Before the day of the Lord comes , many people will stop believing God . The Man of Evil will be seen . He is the evil one who will be destroyed for ever .
53002004	He will put himself against God . He will put himself above everything to do with God , and above everything that people worship . He will sit in Gods holy place and tell people that he is God .
53002005	You remember that I told you these things when I was still with you .
53002006	And you know what is holding that evil man back . He will not be seen until it is his time to be seen .
53002007	The plan to make people wrong has already begun to work . But someone is holding back that plan . He will stop the law-breaker for a time .
53002008	Then that evil man will be seen . The Lord Jesus will kill him with the breath from his mouth . The coming of the Lord Jesus will be so bright and wonderful that it will put the evil man to an end .
53002009	The coming of the evil man is the work of Satan . He will come in great power with signs that are not true , and wonderful things .
53002010	And by his bad tricks he will fool people who are lost . They will not love the true message which would have saved them .
53002011	That is why God lets them be fooled so that they will believe what is not true .
53002012	They will all be judged . I mean the people who have not believed in the true message but who wanted to do what is wrong .
53002013	My brothers , the Lord loves you . We should thank God for you always . Here is why . From the beginning God chose you to be saved . You were saved because the Spirit made you holy and because you believed the true message .
53002014	God called you to be saved by the good news we brought you . He did this so that you would have some of the honour which the Lord Jesus Christ has .
53002015	So my brothers , be strong . Hold on to the things we taught you by our words or by letter .
53002016	God has loved us and made us happy through his kindness . He gave us everlasting comfort and good hope .
53002017	May our Lord Jesus Christ himself , and God our Father , comfort your hearts and make you strong to do and say everything that is good .
53003001	My brothers , please talk to God about us . Ask God that the Lords message may reach many people quickly and that they may receive it gladly as you did .
53003002	Ask God that we may be saved from bad people who do wrong things . Not everyone believes in Christ .
53003003	But the Lord can be trusted . He will make you strong . He will keep you safe from all that is wrong .
53003004	The Lord makes us feel sure about you . We are sure that you are doing , and will do , what we tell you to do .
53003005	May the Lord lead you to love God and be patient like Christ .
53003006	Now , my brothers , we tell you to do this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ . Have nothing to do with any lazy brother who is not living the way we taught you .
53003007	You yourselves know how you should be like us . We were not lazy when we were with you .
53003008	We did not eat anyones food without paying for it . But we worked very hard day and night because we did not want to trouble any one of you .
53003009	We have the right to be helped . But we wanted to show you what you should do in this matter .
53003010	Even when we were with you , we told you this , If any man will not work , do not let him eat .
53003011	We hear that some of you are lazy . You do not work , but you trouble other people .
53003012	We say to such lazy people , in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ , Do your work quietly . Earn your own food .
53003013	My brothers , do not get tired of doing what is good .
53003014	If any one will not obey what we say in this letter , look at that man and remember him . Have nothing to do with him , so that he will be ashamed .
53003015	Do not treat him like an enemy . Tell him , as you would tell a brother , what he should do .
53003016	The Lord gives peace . May he give his peace to you at all times in every way . May the Lord be with you all .
53003017	I , Paul , write these words of greeting with my own hand . This is the sign in all my letters that I wrote them .
53003018	The loving kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all .
54001001	I am Paul . I am an apostle of Christ Jesus . God and Christ Jesus told me to be an apostle . God is our Saviour , and Christ is the one who gives us hope .
54001002	Timothy , you are my true son because you believe the way I do . I ask God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord to show you love and kindness , and give you peace .
54001003	When I went to the country of Macedonia , I asked you to stay in the city of Ephesus . I wanted you to tell some of the teachers not to teach wrong things .
54001004	Tell them not to use stories that are not true , and long histories of names . These things often make people quarrel . These things do not make people believe and follow Gods way .
54001005	Here is what teachers should aim at . Gods people should love each other with a love which comes from a clean heart , a clear mind , and true faith .
54001006	Some teachers have not tried to do these things and so they talk about things that do no good .
54001007	They want to teach the law . But they do not understand what they say . And they do not know what they are trying to prove .
54001008	We know that the law is good when anyone uses it in the right way .
54001009	He must understand that the law was not made for the man who lives right . It was made for those who do not want any laws over them , and for those who will not obey . It was made for those who do not respect God , and those who are bad people . It was made for those who do not respect anything that is holy or belongs to God . It was made for those who beat their fathers or mothers , and for those who kill people .
54001010	It was made for those who use sex in the wrong way and for men who have sex with other men . It was made for those who steal people , for those who tell lies , for those who make a promise that is not true , and for any other thing that is not right .
54001011	The wonderful good news of God teaches what is right . Praise him ! And he has trusted me to tell this good news .
54001012	I thank Christ Jesus our Lord , who gave me power to tell the good news . I thank him because he believed he could trust me , and he chose me for this work .
54001013	There was a time when I did not respect him . I troubled his people . I said wrong things about him . But he was very kind to me , because I did not know what I was doing and I did not believe in him .
54001014	Our Lord showed me much love and kindness . I believed in him and had the love which comes from Christ Jesus .
54001015	These are true words and everyone should believe them . Christ Jesus came into the world to save bad people . And I am the worst of all .
54001016	Jesus Christ wanted to show that he is very , very patient . And so he was kind to me who was the worst . He did this so that others would believe in him and live for ever .
54001017	Give honour and praise for ever and ever to the one who is King for ever . He will never die . He cannot be seen . He is the only God . Yes , he is !
54001018	My son Timothy , here is what I tell you to do . And it is what the prophets said about you before . Remember their words , and fight like a good soldier .
54001019	Keep on believing . Do only what you know is right . Some people have not done that and they have stopped believing .
54001020	Hymenaeus and Alexander are among them . I have given them to Satan so that they will be punished and learn not to teach things that do not respect God .
54002001	First of all , I want Gods people to do this . They must talk to God for all the people . They must ask God to help them . They must ask God to give them what they need . They must thank God for all that he gives them .
54002002	They must talk to God for all the kings and all rulers . They must do this so that we may live in peace and quiet , so that we may please God and do what is right .
54002003	This is a good thing . And God , our Saviour , is pleased when people do it .
54002004	He wants all people to be saved and to know what is true .
54002005	There is one God . There is also one man who can open the way between God and all people . That man is Christ Jesus .
54002006	He gave his life to set all men free . This matter was told at the right time .
54002007	I was chosen to tell about this and to be an apostle . I am telling the truth . I am not lying . I was chosen to teach people who are not Jews . I must teach them to believe and to know what is true .
54002008	So I want men in every place to talk to God . They must have clean lives when they lift up their hands to talk to God . They must not be angry . They must have faith in God .
54002009	I also want women to wear the right kind of clothes . They should not make a show of themselves , but use good sense . They should not fix up their hair in a fancy way , or wear gold and fine stones , or clothes that cost much money .
54002010	But women should busy themselves with good works . This is the right thing for women who say they worship God .
54002011	A woman must learn quietly and be very humble .
54002012	I do not allow any woman to teach or to rule over a man . She must remain quiet .
54002013	Adam was not fooled . But the woman was fooled and did wrong .
54002014	But anyway , the women will come safely through the time of delivering a child , if they keep on believing and loving God , and if they live a clean life and keep humble .
54002015	missing fehlt/missing
54003001	These are true words . If a man wants to be a leader of the church people , he seeks a good thing .
54003002	For a man to be a church leader , people must speak well of him . He must have only one wife . He must be able to control himself . He must use good sense . He must behave himself well . He must be kind to strangers in his house . He must be a good teacher .
54003003	He must not get drunk . He must not fight . But he must be kind . He must not quarrel . He must not love money .
54003004	He must be a good leader for his own family . His children must obey him and respect him .
54003005	If a man does not know how to lead his own family , how can he take care of the church of God ?
54003006	A church leader must not be a new believer . If he were a new believer , he might become proud and set himself up like the devil did .
54003007	People who are not church people must also speak well of a church leader , so that he will not fall into the devils trap .
54003008	In the same way , the leaders helpers must be men whom people respect . They must not say one thing one time and something different another time . They must not drink too much wine . They must not try to get rich in wrong ways .
54003009	They must know Gods plan and what we believe . They must do only what they know is right .
54003010	Try these men first . Then let them help the church people if they have done nothing wrong .
54003011	In the same way , their wives must be women whom people respect . They must not tell lies about anyone . They must be able to control themselves . They must live so that people can trust them in all things .
54003012	The leaders helpers must have only one wife . They must be good leaders for their children and family .
54003013	When they have done the work of a helper well , people will respect them . If they do well , they will not fear to tell what they believe about Christ Jesus .
54003014	I am writing to you about these matters even though I hope to come to you soon .
54003015	Then if I do not come right away , you will know what people should do in Gods family . This family is the church of the living God . The church people hold what is true and keeps it strong .
54003016	Gods plan is very great as we all know . Here it is : we saw God as a man; Gods Spirit proved he was right; angels saw him; the nations were told about him; people of the world believed in him; God took him up into heaven .
54004001	The Spirit of God says very plainly that in later times some people will stop believing . They will listen to other spirits that fool them , and to the teaching of bad spirits .
54004002	Men will tell lies and make people believe they are something when they are not . These men will have made their hearts so hard that they will not know they are doing wrong .
54004003	They will teach people that they should not marry . They will teach them not to eat some kinds of food . God made the food and he wanted people to take it and thank him for it . Those who believe and know what is true do this .
54004004	Everything that God has made for food is good . It is all right to eat it if people thank God for it .
54004005	Gods word and asking him to bless the food makes it good for people to eat .
54004006	Tell the Christian brothers and sisters these things and you will do the work of Christ Jesus well . Your own heart will be fed by the things you have believed and the good teaching you have followed .
54004007	Have nothing to do with foolish stories . Make yourself strong in the things that please God .
54004008	To make the body strong helps a little , but the things of God help us in all ways . The things of God promise us life now and life in heaven .
54004009	These are true words and everyone should believe them .
54004010	That is why we work hard and put up with troubles . We trust in the living God who came to save all people . He makes a way for those who believe in him .
54004011	Tell people these things and teach them to do them .
54004012	Do not let anyone despise you because you are a young man . Show those who believe how they should live . Show them by the way you talk . Show them by the way you live . Show them by the way you love . Show them how to believe by the way you believe . Show them how to live a clean life by the way you live a clean life .
54004013	Until I come , read the holy writings to people . Talk to them and teach them .
54004014	Use the gift you have . It was given to you when the church leaders put their hands on your head and gave you a message from God .
54004015	Take time to think about these things . Then everybody will see how well you are going ahead in your work .
54004016	Take care of yourself and what you teach . Keep on doing this . If you do , you will save yourself and those who listen to you .
54005001	Do not be angry with an older man if he has done something wrong , but talk kindly to him as you would talk to your father . Talk to the young men like brothers .
54005002	Talk to the older women like mothers . Talk to the young women like sisters . And be sure to keep a clean mind and heart in all this .
54005003	Help widow women , whose husbands are dead , if they have no one to help them .
54005004	If they have children or grandchildren , they should learn that the first place to do Gods work is in the home to help their own family . They should help their parents because their parents have helped them . This will please God .
54005005	A widow who has no one to help her , and is alone , trusts in God . Day and night she talks to God and asks him for the things she needs .
54005006	But a woman who spends her time in pleasing herself is really dead , even while she still lives .
54005007	Tell them these things so that they will do what is right .
54005008	A man must care for his own people . At least he must care for his family . If he does not care for them , he shows that he does not believe in God . He is worse than one who has never believed .
54005009	A widow who is over sixty years old , may be chosen to help the church people . But she must have been the wife of one husband .
54005010	People must speak well of the good works she has done . Has she brought up children ? Has she been kind to strangers and cared for them in her house ? Has she washed the feet of Gods people ? Has she helped people who were in trouble ? Has she done every kind of good thing to help people ?
54005011	But do not choose young women . When they begin to love other things more than Christ , they will want to marry again .
54005012	And that will be wrong for them because they have not kept their first promise .
54005013	Not only that , but they also become lazy . They walk about going from house to house . Not only are they lazy but they talk too much and tell stories about people . They tell things they should not tell .
54005014	So I would like young women to marry again and have children . They should care for their homes . They should do nothing that would make the enemy say wrong things about them .
54005015	Some have already turned away to follow Satan .
54005016	Do any Christians have in their families women whose husbands are dead ? If they do , they should help them . The church people should not have to care for them . Then the church can help the women who have no one to help them .
54005017	The leaders of the church people who rule well should be given greater honour and reward . At least do this for those who work hard in speaking and teaching .
54005018	The holy writings say , You may not tie the mouth of a cow when it is walking on the grain to beat it out . And also , The man who works should be paid for it .
54005019	Do not listen to a complaint against a leader if what he has done has not been seen and proved by two or three people .
54005020	Talk to those who live a wrong life and tell them to stop it . Talk to them in front of all the church members . Then the others will be afraid to do it .
54005021	I say this before God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels of God . Do these things in an honest way . Do not treat one person better than another person .
54005022	Do not be in a hurry to place your hands on a man as a sign for him to be a leader . Do not take part in the wrong things another man does . Keep yourself clean .
54005023	Do not drink water only . But drink a little wine to help your stomach because you are sick so often .
54005024	The wrong things some men do can be seen clearly and show that they should be punished . But wrong things other people do are not seen until later .
54005025	So also , the good things are seen clearly . Even when they are not seen at first , they will be seen later .
54006001	Servants should respect their bosses in every way . Then people will not say wrong things about Gods name and what we teach .
54006002	Those who work for Christian masters should not take life easy just because the person they work for is a Christian . They should work all the better because they are loved by them . Teach these things and tell people to do them .
54006003	Is there anyone who teaches something different ? Or is there anyone who does not agree with the true words of our Lord Jesus Christ ? Or does he not agree with teaching about the things of God ?
54006004	If there is such a person , he is full of pride . He knows nothing . He wants to quarrel and talk about words . Such things make people jealous of each other . They think wrong thoughts about each other which are not true .
54006005	They quarrel . The minds of these men are bad . They do not know what is true . They think that worshipping God makes people rich . Keep away from such people .
54006006	It is true that people are much better off if they live to please God and if they are satisfied .
54006007	When we were born , we brought nothing into this world , and when we die , we can take nothing out of the world .
54006008	If we have food and clothes , that should be enough .
54006009	People who want to be rich have trouble . They get caught in a trap . They want many foolish things which are wrong for them . Because of this , men are lost and punished for ever .
54006010	Because people love money they do all kinds of wrong things . Some people have stopped believing in God because they want money so much . And it brings them many troubles .
54006011	But you belong to God , Timothy . Have nothing to do with all this . But do what is right . Do what God wants you to do . Believe in Christ . Be loving . Be patient . Be kind .
54006012	Work hard at believing in God more and more . Make sure that you get everlasting life; God called you to have it . You stood before many people and said that you believed in Christ . That was the right thing to say .
54006013	Now we stand before God who gives life to all things . We stand before Christ who said what was right when he was in court before Pontius Pilate . I tell you to do this .
54006014	Do what you have been told to do . And do it so there will be nothing wrong , until our Lord Jesus Christ comes .
54006015	At the right time God will bring Christ back . Praise God ! He alone is ruler . He is King over all kings , and Lord over all lords .
54006016	He alone has everlasting life . He lives in such light that no one can go near him . No person has ever seen him , or can see him . May he have honour and respect and have everlasting power . May it be so !
54006017	Tell the rich people in this world not to be proud . Tell them to trust in God not in short-lived riches . He gives us richly all things to make us happy .
54006018	Tell the rich people to do good . Tell them to do many good things . Tell them to give to other people , and to help those who are in need .
54006019	In this way they will store up good things for themselves for the time to come . Then they will get that life which really is the true life .
54006020	Timothy , take good care of what has been given to you . Some teachers say they know many things , but these things are not true . Do not teach these foolish things that do not come from God . Do not teach these things that do not agree together .
54006021	Some men have believed these things and have stopped believing in Christ . May God bless all of you .
55001001	I am Paul . I am an apostle of Christ Jesus because God wanted me to be . This is because God has promised life through Christ Jesus .
55001002	Timothy , you are my son and I love you very much . May God the Father , and Christ Jesus our Lord , bless you . May they be kind to you and give you peace .
55001003	I worship God with a clean heart , as my fathers did . And I thank God when I talk to him about you . I always do this night and day .
55001004	I want very much to see you . I remember how you cried when we left you . When I see you , how happy I shall be !
55001005	I remember that you really believe . Your grandmother Lois believed first . Your mother Eunice believed too . I am sure that you believe in the same way .
55001006	That is why I am telling you again . You must use Gods gift . It was given to you when I put my hands on your head .
55001007	God has not given us a spirit of fear . But he has given us a spirit of power and love and self-control .
55001008	So do not be ashamed to talk about our Lord . And do not be ashamed of me . I am his prisoner . Be patient in your trouble also , because you tell the good news . God will give you the power to do it .
55001009	God saved us and called us to live a holy life . He did not do it because of the good things we have done . He did it because he himself planned to do it , and wanted to do it . That was the blessing he gave us in Christ Jesus . He had this plan before he made the world .
55001010	But now he has made it real through the coming of Jesus Christ who saves . He has put death out of the way . He has shown people can have everlasting life by telling them the good news .
55001011	I have been chosen to tell that good news . I have been chosen to go out and teach it to those who are not Jews .
55001012	That is why I have this trouble . But I am not ashamed of it because I know the one whom I have trusted . And I am sure he is able to keep safe what I have trusted to him . He will keep it safe until that great day when he comes again .
55001013	Take what I have taught you as a guide for good teaching . Keep believing in Christ Jesus and loving him .
55001014	Keep safe that good thing which was trusted to you . The Holy Spirit who lives in us will help you .
55001015	You know that all the men who live in the country of Asia Minor have left me . Phygellus and Hermogenes are among them .
55001016	I hope the Lord will be kind to the family of Onesiphorus . He has often helped me . He has not been ashamed of me in prison .
55001017	When he came to the city of Rome , he looked for me until he found me .
55001018	I hope the Lord will be kind to him on that great day . You know very well all that he did for me in the city of Ephesus .
55002001	So , my son Timothy , be strong . Christ Jesus has blessed you so that you can be strong .
55002002	You and many others heard what I taught . Now you must teach these things to men who can be trusted , men who will be able to teach them to other people also .
55002003	Be patient in your trouble like a good soldier of Christ Jesus .
55002004	A soldier who is fighting does not live the way other people do . He wants to please the one who chose him .
55002005	A man runs a race . But he does not win if he does not obey the rules .
55002006	A farmer works hard planting . He should be the first one to have the food that grows .
55002007	Think about what I say and the Lord will help you understand everything .
55002008	Keep your mind on Jesus Christ . He was raised from death . He was of the family of David . That is the good news I tell people .
55002009	Because of that , I have trouble . I am even tied with chains like a bad man . But the word of God is not tied up .
55002010	That is why I bear all my trouble for the sake of Gods chosen people . I do it so that they also may be saved by Christ Jesus and be made great for ever .
55002011	These are true words : If we died with Christ , we shall also live with him .
55002012	If we bear all our troubles , we shall also rule with him . If we say we do not know him , then he will also say he does not know us .
55002013	If we do not believe in him , he still is true , because he cannot say he is not what he is .
55002014	Tell people these things again . Tell them before the Lord not to quarrel in their teaching . There is no good in doing that . It upsets the minds of those who listen to them .
55002015	Try to show God that you are a good worker . Do nothing you would be ashamed of . Tell the true message in the right way .
55002016	Have no part in foolish talk that does not come from God . That kind of talk will take people farther and farther away from God .
55002017	Their teaching will spread like bad sickness . Hymenaeus and Philetus are two like that .
55002018	These men say that the time when people are raised from death is past already . That is not true . And what they say is making some people stop believing .
55002019	But the truth of God stands strong . It cannot change . These words are sure : The Lord knows the people who belong to him and , Let all those who use the name of the Lord stop their wrong ways .
55002020	In a large house there are many pots . They are not all made of gold and silver . Some are made of wood , and some of earth . Some are used for fine things and some are used for things that are not so fine .
55002021	So if a person keeps himself clean from these things , he will be like a dish that is used for a fine work . It is kept as a better dish for the head man of the house , and it is ready for any good thing he wants to use it for .
55002022	Have no part at all in the wrong things that young men like to do . Believe . Have love . Follow what is right . Live at peace . Do these things along with others who have a clean heart and talk to God .
55002023	Keep out of foolish quarrels . You know that they start fights .
55002024	The Lords servant must not fight . But he must be kind to all people . He must be a good teacher to them . He must be patient with them .
55002025	When he corrects those who are against him , he must do it in a gentle way . It may be that God will turn their hearts to know what is true .
55002026	And they may get free again from the devils trap . He has caught them to do what he wants them to do .
55003001	Be sure of this . In the last days hard times will come .
55003002	People will love themselves . They will love money . They will talk about themselves and be proud . They will say wrong things about people . They will not obey their parents . They will not be thankful . They will not keep anything holy .
55003003	They will have no love . They will not agree with anybody . They will tell lies about people . They will have no self-control . They will beat people . They will not love anything that is good .
55003004	They cannot be trusted . They will act quickly , without thinking . They are proud of themselves . They love to have fun more than they love God .
55003005	They act as if they worshipped God , yet they do not let Gods power work in their lives . Keep away from people like that .
55003006	They are the kind who go quietly into peoples houses . There they get foolish women to believe them . These women know that they have done many wrong things . And they want to do many kinds of wrong things .
55003007	They are always trying to learn , but never able to find out what is really true .
55003008	Jannes and Jambres were two men who were very much against Moses . In the same way , these men I am talking about are against what is true . They are men who have wrong thoughts in their minds . They do not believe .
55003009	But these men will not get very far . Everyone will see that they are wrong , just as people saw that Jannes and Jambres were wrong .
55003010	Timothy , you know my teaching and the way I lived . You know what I want to do and what I believe . You know my patience , my love , and my strength to bear trouble .
55003011	You know about my troubles . You know what happened to me in Antioch , in Iconium , and in Lystra . You know how badly the people treated me . But the Lord brought me safely through it all .
55003012	Yes , all who want to live a good life in Christ Jesus will be troubled by other people .
55003013	Bad men and those who fool other people will grow worse and worse . They will fool other people , and other people will fool them .
55003014	But you , Timothy , must keep on doing the things you have learned . You know they are right . You know who taught them to you .
55003015	From the time you were a child you knew the holy writings . They showed you how to be saved by believing in Christ Jesus .
55003016	All that is written in the holy writings comes from the Spirit of God . The holy writings are good for these things : to teach people , to show them when they are wrong , to make them see what is right , to teach them to do what is right .
55003017	In this way a person who belongs to God has all he needs . He is ready for every kind of good work .
55004001	I say this before God and the Lord Jesus Christ , who will judge people who are living and people who are dead . I say this to you because he will come back and rule over all .
55004002	Tell people the word of God . Be ready to do it at any time . Show people they are wrong and talk to them about it . Tell them what they should do . Be very patient with them and teach them in many ways .
55004003	The time is coming when people will not listen to good teaching . They will want to listen to the things they like to hear . And they will bring in many teachers who will teach them just what they want to do .
55004004	They will not listen to what is true , but will turn away and listen to strange stories .
55004005	But you , Timothy , must always be watching . Be patient in your troubles . Tell the good news . Do all the work God has given you to do .
55004006	My life is already being poured out as an offering to God . The time is here for me to leave this life .
55004007	I have fought the kind of fight that is good . I have reached the mark on the road that God wanted me to reach . And I have kept on believing in him .
55004008	From now on , my reward is waiting for me , because I have done what is right . The Lord will repay me on the day when he comes back . He judges the right way . I will not be the only one to get a reward from him . But he will repay all those who want very much to see him .
55004009	Try to come to me soon .
55004010	Demas has left me because he loved the things of this world . He has gone to the city of Thessalonica . Crescens has gone to Galatia , and Titus to Dalmatia .
55004011	Only Luke is with me . Get Mark and bring him with you . He helps me very much in my work .
55004012	I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus .
55004013	I left a coat with Carpus in Troas . Bring it with you when you come , and also bring the books . But most of all , I want the written papers .
55004014	Alexander , the man who makes things from copper , did many wrong things to me . The Lord will punish him for what he has done .
55004015	You too must keep away from him , for he was very much against what we said .
55004016	The first time I spoke for myself in court , no one was on my side . All left me . I hope that God will forgive them .
55004017	But the Lord was with me . He gave me strength to tell the message . All those who are not Jews heard it . And I was saved out of the mouth of the lion .
55004018	The Lord will save me from every wrong thing . He will bring me safely into the kingdom of heaven . Praise him for ever and ever . Yes , he will !
55004019	Give my greetings to Priscilla and Aquila , and to the people who belong to the house of Onesiphorus .
55004020	Erastus stayed in the city of Corinth . Trophimus was sick when I left him at Miletus .
55004021	Try to come before the cold time of the year . Eubulus sends you greetings . So do Pudens , Linus , and Claudia and all the Christian brothers .
55004022	The Lord be with your spirit . May he in his kindness bless you . Amen . May it be so !
56001001	I am Paul . I am a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ . I have been sent to Gods chosen people so that they will believe and know what is true . This will make them more like God wants them to be .
56001002	I do this work because then they can hope to have everlasting life . God does not fool people . He promised everlasting life before he made the world .
56001003	And at the right time he sent men to tell people his word . God , who saves us , trusted me and told me to tell that word .
56001004	Titus , I send greetings to you . You are my true son because you believe the same way I do . May God the Father and Christ Jesus our Saviour bless you , and be kind to you , and give you peace . of Crete . I want you to finish putting things in order . And I want you to choose leaders among the church people in every city as I told you to do .
56001005	A leader must be a good man , that no one can blame for doing anything wrong . He must have only one wife . His children should believe . They must not live wrong lives .
56001006	The church leader must be a good man because he looks after Gods work . He must not want his own way . He must not get angry or get drunk . He must not fight . He must not try to get rich in wrong ways .
56001007	But he must be kind to strangers in his house . He must love what is good . He must be wise . He must do what is right . He must live a holy life . He must know how to control himself .
56001008	He must hold strongly to the true message which he has been taught . Then he will be able to teach other people what is right . And he will be able to answer people who talk against it .
56001009	There are many people who do not obey Gods truth . They talk about things that do no good , and they fool people by it . The Jewish leaders do this very much .
56001010	You must put a stop to their talking . They stop whole families from believing in Christ because they teach things which they have no right to teach . They teach because they want to get paid for it , even though it is wrong .
56001011	One of their own prophets said , The people of Crete are always telling lies . They are like wild , bad animals . They are lazy and want to eat too much .
56001012	What he said is true . You must tell them that they are wrong . Tell them to stop it . They must believe what is true .
56001013	They must not use the old Jewish stories . They must not use the rules which were made by men who do not believe what is true .
56001014	All things are clean to those who have a clean mind . But nothing is clean to those who do wrong things and do not believe . Their minds and their hearts are full of wrong things .
56001015	They say that they know God . But what they do shows that they do not know him . They live in a way that God hates . They do not obey . They can do nothing that is good .

56002001	But as for you , Titus , you must teach what is right .
56002002	Tell the older men that they must not drink too much wine . They must be men whom people respect . They must be wise . They must believe what is true . They must be loving and patient .
56002003	Tell the older women also that they must live like Christians . They must not tell lies about anyone . They must not drink much wine . They must teach what is good .
56002004	They must teach the young women to love their husbands and their children .
56002005	They must teach young women to have good sense , to live a clean life , to care for their homes , to be kind , and to obey their husbands . Then people cannot say wrong things about Gods word .
56002006	Also tell the young men to have good sense .
56002007	Titus , show them what they should do in all matters by the good things you do . Do not mix your teaching with things that are not true . Teach in such a way that people will respect you .
56002008	Be sure that what you say is true , so that no one can say anything against it . Then anyone who is against us will be made ashamed because he can find nothing wrong to say about us .
56002009	Tell servants to obey their master in everything . Tell them to please them and not talk back to them .
56002010	They must not steal , but be very honest so the person they work for can trust them . In all things they must show that the teaching about God our Saviour is good .
56002011	Gods loving kindness has come . It is through that blessing that all men are saved .
56002012	It teaches us to say no to the things that are not true of God , and to the things of this world . It teaches us to use good sense , to do what is right , and to please God while we live in this world .
56002013	All this is while we wait and hope to see the one who brings blessing . We are waiting for our great God to come in Jesus Christ . He is the One who will save us . He is wonderful !
56002014	Christ gave himself for us so that he might make us free from all that is wrong . He gave himself to make us into clean people who belong to him and want to do good .
56002015	Talk about these things . Tell people they must do them . And use all your power to stop people if they are doing wrong . Do not let anyone despise you .
56003001	Tell the people again to obey their rulers and governments , and to do what they tell them to do . Tell them to be ready to do any honest work .
56003002	They must not say wrong things about anyone . They must not quarrel . They must be kind and polite to everyone .
56003003	There was a time when we ourselves did not have understanding . We did not obey God . We were fooled by people . We did many wrong things we wanted to do . We did what we pleased . We lived our days in planning to do wrong things and wanting what other people had . People hated us , and we hated each other .
56003004	God who saves us showed how kind and good he is .
56003005	We were not saved by any good things we did ourselves , but he saved us because he is so kind . He washed us clean . We were born again as a new person . The Holy Spirit has made us new .
56003006	God is rich . And he gave the Holy Spirit to us because of Jesus Christ our Saviour .
56003007	He did this so that we can be put right with God , by his kindness . He did this so that we can become his children . So now we can look forward to everlasting life .
56003008	These are true words . And I want you to tell the people these things . Then those who have believed God will try to do good things . These things are right and help people .
56003009	Have nothing to do with : foolish quarrels; lists of people who lived long ago; those who make trouble and argue about the law . These things do not help people and are good for nothing .
56003010	Talk to any who do not believe right . Talk to them about it once or twice . Then , if they will not listen , have nothing more to do with them .
56003011	You know that such people are wrong and what they do is wrong . They themselves know that they are wrong . Tychicus to you , do your best to come to me at the city of Nicopolis . I have planned to stay there while it is the cold time of the year .
56003012	Do your best to send Zenas the lawyer , and Apollos on their way . Give them all they need .
56003013	Our people should learn to spend their time in doing good things to help people who are poor . In that way , our people will not waste their time . Greet those who believe as we do and who love us . God bless you all .

57001001	I am Paul . I am in prison because I belong to Christ Jesus . Our brother Timothy and I send greetings to you , Philemon . We love you very much . And you work with us .
57001002	We also send greetings to our sister Apphia; to Archippus who is worker in Gods army as we are; and to the people who meet as a church in your house .
57001003	May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you in their kindness and give you peace .
57001004	I always thank my God when I talk to him about you .
57001005	I have heard that you love all of Gods people and that you believe in our Lord Jesus Christ .
57001006	You believe as I do . I ask God that he may help you to know more and more of every good thing that we have in Christ .
57001007	My brother , your love made me very glad and it comforted my heart . I know that Gods people were glad because you loved them .
57001008	Because I am Christs apostle , I could tell you what you must do .
57001009	But because I love you , I would rather not tell you , but ask you to do this for me . I , Paul , am an old man and now I am in prison because I belong to Jesus Christ .
57001010	I am asking you to do something for my son . He became a Christian here in prison . This son is Onesimus .
57001011	At one time he was no help to you . But now he is a big help to you and to me .
57001012	I am sending him back to you and it is like sending you my own heart .
57001013	I would like to keep him with me . He can help me while I am in prison for the sake of the good news . That would be just as if you were here to help me .
57001014	But I did not want to do anything unless you agreed . I did not want you to do this because you were forced to do it , but because you wanted to do it .
57001015	Maybe it was good for him to be away from you for a while . Now you will have him with you for ever .
57001016	Now he is not like a slave who must work for you . He is better than a slave . He is a Christian brother and you will love him . I love him very much . But you will love him even more because he belongs to you and he is a Christian .
57001017	So if you think of me as a real friend , take him back just as you would take me back .
57001018	If he has done you any wrong , or if he owes you a debt , then ask me to pay it .
57001019	I , Paul , write this with my own hand . I will repay it . I do not need to tell you that you have your life because of what I did for you .
57001020	Yes , my brother , give me some help in the Lord . Make me happy in Christ .
57001021	I believe that you will do what I ask you to do . And so I am writing to you . I know that you will do even more than I ask you to do .
57001022	At the same time , please make a place ready for me to stay . I know you are asking God to set me free , so I believe he will let me come to see you .
57001023	Epaphras is in prison with me for the sake of Christ Jesus . He sends greetings to you .
57001024	Mark , Aristarchus , Demas , and Luke are working with me . They all send greetings too .
57001025	May the loving kindness of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit . Amen ! May it be so !
58001001	Long ago , God talked to our fathers through the prophets . He talked many times and in many ways .
58001002	In these last days , he talked to us through his Son . God chose him to be the one to whom he would give all things . God also made the world by this Son .
58001003	He shines as bright as God . He is just like God himself . He holds up the world by the power of his word . He made people clean from their wrong ways . Then he sat down beside God in heaven .
58001004	He is much greater than the angels because God has given him a much better name than theirs .
58001005	Did God ever say to any of the angels , You are my Son , and I am your Father today ? Did God ever say to an angel , I will be your Father and you will be my Son ?
58001006	When God brings his first-born Son into the world , he says , All of Gods angels must worship him .
58001007	Here is what he says about the angels : God makes his angels to be like the winds . He makes his helpers to be like flames of fire .
58001008	But here is what God says about his Son : O God , you will sit and rule for ever . You will rule in the right way .
58001009	You have loved what is good and you have hated what is wrong . That is why God has poured out happiness on you , more than on those who are with you .
58001010	He also said , Lord , you made the world in the beginning . The sky was made by your hands .
58001011	These things will come to an end , but you will live on . They will all wear out like clothes .
58001012	You will fold up the world and the sky as if they were a blanket . They will not stay as they are now . But you will always be as you are now . The years of your life will never end .
58001013	But did God ever say to any of the angels , Sit down beside me until I put your enemies under you ?
58001014	Are not all the angels spirits that help ? They are sent out to help the people who will be saved .
58002001	That is why we must listen very carefully to the things we have heard . We must never forget them .
58002002	What the angels said proved to be true . Every one who broke the law , and who did not obey it , was punished as he should be punished .
58002003	If that is so , then we will not get away without being punished . We will be punished if we forget or throw away this wonderful way to be saved . It was the Lord who first told people how to be saved . Then those who heard him told us the true way .
58002004	God also proved that it was the true way . He gave signs . He did things that surprised people . He did many things by his power . He gave the gifts of the Holy Spirit to people just as he wanted to .
58002005	God did not put the next world under angels for them to rule over . That is the world we are talking about .
58002006	In one place the holy writings say , What is man and why do you think about him ? What is the Son of a Man and why do you care about him ?
58002007	You made him lower than angels for a little while . But then you made him very great and high .
58002008	You put everything under him for him to rule over . When God gave him the right to rule over everything , nothing was left out which he did not have the right to rule . But we do not yet see him ruling over everything .
58002009	But we do see Jesus ! For a short time he was lower than the angels . Because he died , we see him made great and high . He did this so that he could die for every person . God is so good !
58002010	Everything was made for God and by God . It seemed good to him that Jesus life should be made complete , by going through the hard things that happened to him . This was because Jesus leads many people to heaven as Gods children . And he is the one who saves them .
58002011	Jesus , who makes people holy , and those who are made holy , all have one Father in heaven . That is why Jesus is not ashamed to call them his brothers .
58002012	He said , I will tell my brothers about you . I will sing praise about you among those who gather together for worship .
58002013	He also said , I will trust God . And again , Here am I and the children God has given to me .
58002014	Gods children all have a body . That is why Jesus himself had the same . But because Jesus also had a body , he was able to die and stop the devil . The devil has power to make people die . But Jesus , by his own death , was able to stop the power of death .
58002015	People were afraid to die . All their lives they were like slaves . When Jesus died , he was able to set them free from their fear .
58002016	Jesus did not come to help angels . He came to help people who were born in Abrahams family .
58002017	So he had to be made like his brothers in every way . Then he could be a high priest to make a way to God for them , a priest who was kind and true . He could make it possible for God to forgive people for the wrong things they had done .
58002018	He had a very hard time when he was tested . But because he was tested , he is able to help people who are tested .
58003001	My brothers , you are holy . You are also called to go to heaven . Take time to think carefully about Jesus . God sent him . He is the high priest we believe in .
58003002	He did what God sent him to do , just as Moses did in Gods house .
58003003	But Jesus is much greater than Moses-as the one who builds a house is greater than the house itself .
58003004	Every house is built by someone , but God is the one who builds all things .
58003005	Moses did what he was told to do as a servant in all of Gods house . He showed things that God would say later .
58003006	But Jesus Christ was true as a Son over Gods house . We are Gods house if we keep on believing and telling others what we hope to have .
58003007	So as the Holy Spirit says , Today , when you hear me speak , do not make your hearts hard .
58003008	That is what happened when the people tested me in the desert and I became angry .
58003009	There your fathers tested me and tried me . And they saw what I did for forty years .
58003010	So I was very angry with the people of that time . I said , " Their minds are always dark . They have not known my ways . "
58003011	I said when I was angry , " They will never go into my resting place . "
58003012	My brothers , take care that not one of you has a heart that does not believe . Such a heart will take you away from the living God .
58003013	But talk to each other every day while Today lasts , so that wrong ways will not fool any one of you and your hearts become hard .
58003014	We have our part with Christ if we go on to the end and believe in him as we did at first .
58003015	God is still saying now , Today , when you hear me speak , do not make your hearts hard . That is what happened when the people turned against me .
58003016	Who were the people who heard him and yet made him very angry ? It was all the people whom Moses led out of the country of Egypt .
58003017	With whom was God angry for forty years ? He was angry with the people who had done wrong . And they died in the desert .
58003018	Who were the people God said would never go into his resting place ? They were the people who would not listen to him .
58003019	So then , we see that they could not go in because they did not believe him .
58004001	We still have Gods promise that people will go into his resting place . So let us take care that not one of you will be kept out .
58004002	The good news has been told to us just as it was told to the people in the desert . But the message which they heard did not do them any good . Even though they heard it , they did not believe it .
58004003	But we who believe , will go into that resting place of God . It is as God said , When I was angry , I said , " They will never go into my resting place . " He said this even though his work had been finished ever since he had made the world .
58004004	Here is what he said , somewhere in the holy writings , about the seventh day : And God rested on the seventh day after doing all his work .
58004005	And now here he says again , They will never go into my resting place .
58004006	So that means some people will go in . But the people who first heard the good news about it did not go in . They did not believe it .
58004007	So he chose another day called Today . He spoke through David many years later , who said , Today , when you hear his voice , do not make your hearts hard .
58004008	If Joshua had led those people to rest , God would not have talked later about another day .
58004009	So there is still a rest for Gods people , like a Sabbath day .
58004010	The person who goes into Gods resting place will rest after doing his work , just as God rested after doing his work .
58004011	So let us do our best to go into that resting place . Those people died in the wilderness because they did not believe . So let us take care that the same thing does not happen to one of us .
58004012	Gods word is living and full of power . It is more sharp than any sword that cuts on both sides . What God says cuts through and divides the mind and spirit . It cuts through and divides the place where the bones are joined , and the part inside the bone . What God says is able to judge the things people think and plan in their hearts .
58004013	God is the one we must meet . Nothing can be hidden from him . Everything is open and he can see it .
58004014	We have a great high priest who has gone into heaven . He is Jesus , the Son of God . Because we have such a great high priest , let us hold on to the things we believe .
58004015	We have a high priest who can feel with us when we are weak . He has been tested in every way , just as we are . But he did not do anything wrong .
58004016	So let us trust him when we come to worship God . He is so good . He will be kind to us and help us when we need it .
58005001	Every high priest is chosen from among men . His work is to stand before God for people . He brings gifts and makes sacrifices to God for the wrong things people have done .
58005002	Such a high priest can be kind to people who do not know what is right and who do wrong . He knows how to share in the suffering of others because he himself is weak .
58005003	Because he is weak himself , he must make sacrifices to God for the wrong things he has done , just as he does for the people .
58005004	No one chooses himself to be high priest . But God calls him , just as he called Aaron .
58005005	So Christ did not choose himself to be a high priest . But he was chosen by the One who said to him , You are my Son , and I am your Father today .
58005006	In another place in the holy writings God said , You are a priest for ever like Melchizedek .
58005007	When Jesus was a man , he talked to God who was able to save him from death . He called loudly to him with tears . God heard him because he honoured and respected God .
58005008	Even though Jesus was his Son , he learned to obey God in the troubles he had .
58005009	When he became perfect , he saved for ever all who obeyed him .
58005010	God called him a high priest like Melchizedek was a priest .
58005011	We have many things to say about him . But they are hard to explain to you . You are so slow to understand what we tell you .
58005012	By this time you should be able to teach others . But you need someone to teach you Gods word again from the very beginning . Like children , you need milk , not meat .
58005013	Anyone who takes milk does not understand the message about which things are right .
58005014	But meat is for people who are grown up . It is for people who have trained their minds to know the difference between what is good and what is bad .
58006001	So , let us leave behind the first teachings about Christ . And let us go on to things that are grown up . We must not go back to the beginning again and talk about turning away from doing things that bring death to us . We must not go back again and talk about believing in God . Let us go forward .
58006002	We must not go back to teaching about baptizing people in water , about putting hands on peoples heads , about people being raised from death , and about people being judged for ever .
58006003	If God will let us , we will go on to build on these things .
58006004	Some people had light in their hearts once . They knew the gift from heaven .
58006005	They had the Holy Spirit . They knew the word of God is good and felt the powers of the next world .
58006006	If people who were like that leave their faith in Christ , they cannot come to God again . They themselves nail Gods Son up on the cross again . They are holding him up to shame before everyone .
58006007	The ground drinks the water that often rains on it . It makes plants grow for the people who take care of it . And God blesses that ground .
58006008	But if it grows thorns and weeds , it is no good . It will soon be cursed . In the end , it will be burned with fire .
58006009	This is the way we talk . But dear people , we are sure that better things are true about you . Yes , you show all the good ways of people who have been saved from their wrong ways .
58006010	God does what is right . He will not forget your work and the love you have shown for him . You have helped Gods people and you are still helping them .
58006011	We want every one of you to try in the same way . Then you will get what you hope for right up to the end .
58006012	Do not give up . But be like the people who get what God has promised . They believe God and keep on believing for a long time .
58006013	God made a promise to Abraham . God did not have anyone greater than himself to hear his promise .
58006014	So he promised to himself when he said , I will surely bless you and you will have many children .
58006015	Abraham kept on believing God . And so he got what God had promised him .
58006016	When men make a promise , they ask someone to hear it who is greater than they are . When someone great has heard a promise , it stops any quarrel about it .
58006017	God made a promise to people . He wanted to show them that he would surely do as he said . So he promised to himself to keep the promise .
58006018	These two things cannot be changed and God cannot lie about them . So we can trust him . We have run to him to get what he has promised us .
58006019	This promise gives our hearts something to hold on to . It keeps our hearts strong and steady . It will take us into the Holy Place right inside Gods house .
58006020	Jesus has gone there ahead of us . He has been made high priest for ever like Melchizedek .
58007001	Melchizedek was king of the city of Salem . He was a priest of God who is the greatest of all . Melchizedek met Abraham when Abraham came back from killing some bad kings . And Melchizedek blessed him .
58007002	Abraham divided all that he took away from the kings into ten parts . He gave Melchizedek one part . First , the name Melchizedek means the king who is true and right with God . Then he was king of Salem . That means king of peace .
58007003	He has no father or mother . The names of the family from which he comes are not written down . It is not written down that he was born or that he died . But , like the Son of God , he stays on being a priest for ever .
58007004	Just think how great he was ! Even Abraham , the father of our people , gave him a tenth , one part out of ten , of all he brought back .
58007005	The sons of Levi , who are priests , have the right by law to take a tenth of what the people have . These people are their own brothers . They also are Abrahams children .
58007006	But Melchizedek was not from Levis family . Yet he took a tenth of what Abraham had . And he blessed Abraham , to whom God made the promise .
58007007	Everyone knows this is true . The person who is blessed is not so great as the person who blesses him .
58007008	Here , priests take their tenth , but they are people who will die one day . But Melchizedek , who took his tenth , never dies . The holy writings say it is so .
58007009	And we say that Levi , the priest who takes the tenth from the people , gave his tenth through Abraham .
58007010	He was not yet born when Melchizedek met Abraham .
58007011	It was while the sons of Levi were priests that the law was made for the people . If those priests were good enough , why would another priest need to come who was like Melchizedek ? Why would he not be like Aaron ?
58007012	If the kind of priest is changed , then the law must be changed also .
58007013	The one we are talking about belonged to another tribe . No man from his tribe ever made sacrifices in Gods house .
58007014	Everyone knows that our Lord Jesus came from the tribe of Judah . And Moses never said anything about priests coming from that tribe .
58007015	You can understand it even better when another priest comes who is like Melchizedek .
58007016	He was not made a priest by law . The law said that the priest must come from a certain tribe . But he was made a priest because he has power to live for ever .
58007017	This is what the holy writings say about him , You are a priest for ever , like Melchizedek .
58007018	The old law given to Moses by God was put away . It was weak and no good .
58007019	The law did not make anything right . But something better has been brought to us . It is Gods promise . And by that promise we come near to God .
58007020	Also Christ was not made a priest without Gods strong promise . The others were made priests without Gods strong promise .
58007021	But this man was made priest by Gods strong promise . God said to him , The Lord has made a strong promise , and he will not change it . " You are a priest for ever . "
58007022	Also because of this , Jesus makes a better agreement with God for people .
58007023	The other priests were many , because they died and could not go on with their work .
58007024	But because Jesus lives forever , he is a priest for ever and no one takes his place .
58007025	Because of that , he is able to save people for ever , if they come to God by him . He lives for ever to talk to God for them .
58007026	We needed such a high priest as he is . He is holy . He is good . He has never done any wrong . He has been taken away from among bad people , and taken up higher than the sky .
58007027	He does not need to make sacrifices every day . The other high priests make sacrifices every day , first for the wrong things they have done , and then for the people . He did it once when he offered himself as the sacrifice .
58007028	The law makes men high priests , and they are weak . But the word of Gods promise came after the law . It makes his Son high priest for ever , and he is all right .
58008001	The real point of what we are saying is this . We now have a high priest who sits beside Gods throne or chief chair in heaven .
58008002	He is priest in the true holy place where God lives . The Lord made that place , man did not .
58008003	Every high priest is chosen to offer gifts and sacrifices . So this high priest must have something to offer also .
58008004	If he were still on earth , he would not be a priest . There are priests on earth already who offer gifts the way the law says .
58008005	The work they do shows what the work of the priest in heaven is . When Moses made a house for God , here is what God told him to do . He said , Be sure you make everything like I showed you on the mountain .
58008006	But Christ has been given a much better work , because he is the man who is between God and men in making an agreement . This is a much better agreement . It was made by better promises .
58008007	If the first agreement had been all right , there would have been no need to make another .
58008008	When the people had done wrong , Gods words to them were , The days will come , the Lord says , when I will make a new agreement with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah .
58008009	It will not be like the agreement that I made with their fathers . I made that agreement the day I led them by the hand out of the country of Egypt . But they did not keep their part of my agreement , so I left them alone , the Lord says .
58008010	After those days , the Lord says , I will make an agreement with the people of Israel . This is my agreement . I will put my laws in their minds . I will write them in their hearts . I will be their God and they will be my people .
58008011	A man will not need to teach another man , or his brother . He will not say , " Know the Lord , " because everyone from the youngest to the oldest will know me .
58008012	I will be kind even when they do what is not right , and I will never remember the wrong things they do .
58008013	God says this is a new agreement , and that makes the first one old . When a thing is old and no good , it is about ready to be thrown away .
58009001	The first agreement had laws about worship . And it had a holy place on earth where the agreement was kept .
58009002	A house was made . In the first part of the house were the light , the table , and the bread of God . This first part was called the Holy Place .
58009003	The next part of the house was called the Most Holy Place .
58009004	In the Most Holy Place was a pan made of gold . In this pan a fire could burn to make a sweet-smelling smoke . The box of the agreement was also in the Most Holy Place . It was covered all over with gold . In this box were : the golden pot , which had some of the food God sent from heaven for the people in the desert; Aarons stick which grew flowers on it; and the stones which had Gods agreement written on them .
58009005	On top of the box were the shapes of two angels . They showed that God is great . Their wings spread over the cover of the box . It was the place where God showed that he is kind . But we cannot take time to tell about every part of these things now .
58009006	These things were made ready . The priests always went into the first part of the house to do their work for God .
58009007	But only the high priest went into the second part . And he went in only once a year . He never went in without taking blood with him . He gave the blood to God for the wrong things he had done and for the wrong things people had done .
58009008	This is how the Holy Spirit showed that the way into the Most Holy Place was not yet open to everybody . It was not open as long as the first house was still standing .
58009009	This first part is a picture of the time we are in now . In it gifts and sacrifices are made to God . But they cannot make a persons heart clean to worship God .
58009010	These are only things to eat and drink and different kinds of washings . They are laws made for the body until the time when everything is made right again .
58009011	But Christ has come as the high priest of the good things which have come . He went through a greater and better house which was not made by mens hands . It is not a part of this world .
58009012	He did not take the blood of goats and young cows . He took his own blood . And he went into the Most Holy Place just once . He paid for our sins and made us free for ever .
58009013	The priest takes the blood of bulls and goats , and the ashes from a young cow that has been burned . He puts this on the people who have done wrong things . This makes their bodies clean .
58009014	If the blood of animals can do that , then the blood of Christ will clean our hearts much better . Christ gave himself to God as the sacrifice . He did this by the Spirit who lives for ever . He was a perfect sacrifice . He will clean our hearts from useless acts of worship . Then we can serve the living God .
58009015	That is why he is the middle man of a new agreement . He died and paid for the wrong things that were done under the first agreement . Because he is a middle man , those people who are called by God can have what he promised . This will belong to them for ever .
58009016	A person can say who will get his things when he dies . He writes this agreement down . Before anyone can have them , it must be proved that the person has died .
58009017	The agreement has no power until the one who made it has died . It has no power as long as the one who made it is living .
58009018	So even the old agreement made by God was not begun without blood .
58009019	Moses told all the people every part of the law . Then he took the blood of young cows and goats . He put some of the blood on the book of the law itself and on all the people . He took water and red wool and a plant called hyssop .
58009020	As he did this , he said , This is the blood for the agreement which God has made for you .
58009021	In the same way , he put some of the blood on the house he had made for God , and on all the things that were used in worship .
58009022	Yes , by the old law almost everything is made clean with blood . If no animal is killed to give blood , then there is no way for people to be forgiven for the wrong things they have done .
58009023	These things on earth show in a little way what things in heaven are like . The things on earth had to be cleaned by the blood of animals . But the things in heaven had to be cleaned with better sacrifices than these .
58009024	Christ did not go into a holy place made by mens hands . The holy places on earth only show in a little way what the true holy place in heaven is like . He went into heaven itself . Now he stands before God for our sake .
58009025	Christ did not have to offer himself as a sacrifice many times . He is not like the high priest who went into the Holy Place every year and took blood that was not his own blood .
58009026	If Christ were like him , he would have had to die many times ever since the world was first made . But as it is now , Christ came once in the last days of the world . He came to clean away what is wrong by giving himself as a sacrifice .
58009027	People must die , and after that they will be judged .
58009028	So Christ gave himself as a sacrifice only once . He took on himself the wrong things many people have done . He will come a second time . But he will not come to do anything about the wrong things people have done . He will come to save those who are looking and waiting for him .
58010001	The law can show only a little about the good things that are coming . It cannot show the good things themselves . People come to worship God . But the law can never make them all right by the same sacrifices that are brought every year .
58010002	If the law could make people all right , they would stop making sacrifices . The people who come to worship would be made clean for all time , and they would not remember the wrong things they had done .
58010003	But , by making these sacrifices , they show that they do remember the wrong things they have done .
58010004	The blood of bulls and goats can never clean wrong things from peoples hearts .
58010005	That is why Christ said when he came into the world , You did not want sacrifices and gifts . But you made a body for me .
58010006	Animals that are burned for sacrifices , and animals killed to clean away the wrong things that people do , did not satisfy you .
58010007	Then I said , " See , I have come to do what you , God , want me to do . " This is what is written about me in the book of the law .
58010008	First he said , You did not want sacrifices and gifts , and animals that are given to be burned as sacrifices , and animals killed to clean away peoples wrong ways . You did not like them . These sacrifices are made to obey the law .
58010009	Then he said , See , I have come to do what you want me to do . He took away the first kind of sacrifices so that the second kind would remain .
58010010	God wanted us to be made holy . We have been made holy by Jesus Christ . He made us holy by once making his body a sacrifice .
58010011	Every priest stands day after day doing his work . He makes the same sacrifices many times . But these sacrifices can never clean away the wrong things people have done .
58010012	But Christ made one sacrifice to clean away their wrong ways for ever . Then he sat down beside God .
58010013	Since then , he is waiting till his enemies are put under him .
58010014	By one sacrifice Christ has made right for ever all those people who are being made holy .
58010015	The Holy Spirit tells us about this also .
58010016	First he said , This is the agreement that I will make with them after those days , says the Lord . I will put my laws in their hearts . I will write them in their minds .
58010017	Then he also said , I will never remember the wrong things they have done and the times they did not obey .
58010018	When these wrong things have been forgiven , a sacrifice is not needed for them again .
58010019	So , my brothers , we can go into the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus .
58010020	He made a new and living way for us . He opened up Gods way specially for us . It lets us through the big curtain or cloth which hides God from us . This happened when Jesus gave his body as a sacrifice .
58010021	Also , we have a high priest who has charge of Gods people .
58010022	So let us come to him with a true heart . Let us come because we believe all these things . Let us come with our hearts washed clean from our wrong ways . Let us come with our bodies washed with clean water .
58010023	We must hold on to Gods promise that we have said we believed . And we must never let go . He has promised and he will do it .
58010024	Let us think of one another and help one another to love and to do good things .
58010025	Do not stop going to church meetings . Some people do stop . But help each other to be strong . You must do it all the more as you see the Great Day coming closer .
58010026	Do we go on doing what is wrong after we know the truth ? If we do , then there is no sacrifice any more for the wrong things we do .
58010027	But we will be judged , and that makes us fear . Gods anger will be like a very hot fire that will burn up those who are against him .
58010028	Any man who broke the law of Moses was killed , if two or three people proved that he had broken the law . He will not be forgiven .
58010029	But the person who should have much bigger punishment is the one who turns against the Son of God . That person was made holy by the blood of the new agreement and then calls it nothing . He no longer honours and respects the Spirit who has been so kind to him .
58010030	We know God who has said , I am the one who will punish people . I will repay them . Also , The Lord will judge his people .
58010031	People should fear very much to be punished by the living God .
58010032	Remember the first days when you had the light of Gods truth . In those days you were strong , even though you had to fight against many troubles .
58010033	Sometimes it was because people said and did wrong things to you and everybody saw it . And sometimes it was because you stood with others who had wrong things done to them .
58010034	You shared in the troubles of those who were in prison . When your things were taken from you , you were happy . You knew that you had better things in heaven , things that would always belong to you .
58010035	So do not stop believing God now . Your faith will bring you much reward .
58010036	You must not give up believing . Then you will do what God wants you to do . Then you will get what he promised you .
58010037	The holy writings say In a little while , the one who is to come will come . He will not wait any longer .
58010038	If a person does what is right because he believes in God , he will live . If he turns back , I will not be pleased with him .
58010039	We are not the people who turn back and so are lost . But we are people who believe , and so we are saved .
58011001	If people believe God , then they know they have the things they hope to get . It is the proof of things we do not see .
58011002	There were people long ago believed God . He said they were good because they believed him .
58011003	We believe in God , so that is how we know that God made the world by his word . The things we see were made out of things that cannot be seen .
58011004	Because Abel believed God , he made a sacrifice that pleased God more than the one Cain made . Because Abel believed God , God showed that he was good . God was pleased with his gifts . Abel died . But because he believed God , he still speaks to us through his faith .
58011005	Because Enoch believed God , he was taken up into heaven without dying . The people could not find him because God had taken him . Before he was taken up , the holy writings say that he pleased God .
58011006	If a person does not believe God , he cannot please him . Anyone who comes to God must believe that God is real . And he must believe that God will bless those who try to find him . God will reward a person , if he really tries to find God .
58011007	God told Noah about things that would happen . These things had never happened before . Noah believed God; he respected God . He built a big house on a boat , and so his family was saved [ from the big flood ] . By believing God he showed that the other people were wrong . He was put right with God because he believed .
58011008	God called Abraham to go away to a place which he would have as his own . Because Abraham believed God , he obeyed him . He went even though he did not know where he was to go .
58011009	Because he believed God , he lived like a stranger in the land God promised him . He lived in tents with Isaac and Jacob . They had the same promise he had .
58011010	Abraham was looking for a city which will last for ever . It was the city God planned and made .
58011011	Sarah also believed God , and she was able to have a baby even though she was too old to have children . But she trusted God to do what he had promised .
58011012	Abraham was too old to be a father , but a great nation was born from that one man . They are as many as the stars in the sky and as the sands on the seaside . No man can count them .
58011013	These people all died still believing God . They did not get the things God had promised them . But they saw them far away and were glad to see them . They said they did not belong to this world , but were only travelling in it .
58011014	People who say such things mean they are looking for a country which will be their own .
58011015	If they had wanted the country they left behind , they could have gone back to it .
58011016	But now they want a better country . They want a place in heaven . That is why God wants to be called their God . He has made a city ready for them .
58011017	Abraham believed God when he was tested . The test was to give Isaac as a sacrifice . Abraham gave up his only son , even though God had made a promise to him about Isaac .
58011018	God had said to Abraham , Isaacs children will be called your family .
58011019	Abraham said in his heart that God could bring Isaac back to life . And so it was just as if he did get his son back .
58011020	Isaac believed God . He gave Jacob and Esau blessings that were to come .
58011021	Jacob believed God . When he was dying , he blessed Josephs two sons . He leaned on his walking stick as he worshipped God .
58011022	Joseph believed God . When he died , he remembered Gods promise and talked about the time the people of Israel would leave Egypt . He told them what to do with his bones when they left Egypt .
58011023	The father and mother of Moses believed God . When he was born , they hid him for three months because they saw that he was a very nice baby . They were not afraid of the kings orders .
58011024	Moses believed God . When he was grown up , he did not want to be called the son of Pharaohs daughter .
58011025	He chose to have troubles along with Gods people . He thought that was better than the fun which he could have living a wrong life . The fun would last only for a short time .
58011026	He thought it was better to take shame , as Christ did , than to be a rich man in Egypt . He was looking for Gods blessings .
58011027	He believed God and left Egypt . He was not afraid of the kings anger . He was strong because he saw the one who cannot be seen .
58011028	He believed God and obeyed his law about the Passover Feast , and put blood on the door posts . He did this so that the angel who killed the oldest sons of the Egyptians , would pass over . Then he would not kill the oldest sons in the families of the Jews .
58011029	The people believed God and went through the Red Sea on dry land . When the people of Egypt tried to do that , they were drowned .
58011030	The people believed God and walked around the walls of the city of Jericho for seven days . The walls fell down .
58011031	Rahab was a woman who used her body wrongly for sex to get money . But she believed in God , so she did not die with the people who did not believe in God . This was when the men came to spy out her country . She took them into her house in peace .
58011032	What more should I say ? I do not have time to tell about Gideon , Barak , Samson , Jephthah , David , Samuel , and the prophets .
58011033	Men believed God and were able to win over other nations . They made people do what was right . They got what God promised them . They were not eaten by lions .
58011034	The big , hot fire did not burn them . They got away from men who wanted to kill them with long knives or swords . They were weak , but they became strong . They became very strong to fight . They drove away the armies of their enemies .
58011035	Women had children who died and were raised to life again . Some people allowed themselves to be beaten to death . They would not go free because they wanted to rise again to a better life .
58011036	Others were laughed at and beaten very hard . They were even tied with chains and put into prison .
58011037	They were killed with stones . They were tested . They were cut in pieces . They were killed with swords . They walked about wearing skins of sheep and goats . They were very poor . They were treated very badly . They were punished .
58011038	They were really too good to be in this world . They walked about in the desert and in the mountains , and in the holes in the hills and in the holes among the rocks on the earth .
58011039	All of these people had good things said about them because they believed God . But they did not get what God had promised .
58011040	God planned something better . They will be made perfect but only with us .
58012001	We have all these people all around us , proving to us that we should believe God . So then , like people running a race , we must take off everything that is heavy . We must put off all wrong , wrong things that get in our way . We must not stop running until we reach the mark that has been put in front of us .
58012002	We must keep our eyes on Jesus . He believed from first to last . What was put in front of him made him glad , so he did not give up when the people nailed him on a cross . He did not care about the shame . And now he is sitting beside God .
58012003	Think about him . He did not give up when bad people said wrong things about him . When you think about him , you will not become tired and your hearts will not give up .
58012004	You have been fighting against bad people . But you have not been hurt very much .
58012005	You have forgotten the words spoken to you as sons . My son , when the Lord punishes you , do not think it is a little thing . Do not give up when he tells you that you do wrong .
58012006	The Lord punishes the person he loves . And he beats every son he takes into his family .
58012007	Do not give up when you are punished . God is treating you like sons . Is there a son who has never been punished by his father ?
58012008	You are punished like the other children in the family . If you are not , you do not belong to the family as the other children do .
58012009	And what is more , our fathers on earth punished us and we respected them . We should obey even more the Father of our spirits . If we do , we will live .
58012010	Our fathers on earth punished us for a short time the way they wanted to . But God punishes us the way it is good for us . He is holy and good , so he wants us to become holy also .
58012011	At the time a person is punished , he is not glad . He is sad . But after it is over , there is peace . Then those who are trained by it do what is right .
58012012	So lift up your hands that are hanging down . Make your weak knees strong .
58012013	Walk straight ahead . Then weak feet will not get worse , but will be made well .
58012014	Try to be at peace with all people . And try to be holy . If a person is not holy , he will not see the Lord .
58012015	Take care that no one loses Gods blessing . Take care so that no angry feeling starts to grow in anyone . It will make trouble and many people will become bad .
58012016	Take care that no one takes part in wrong ways of using sex . And take care that no one is like Esau and forgets God . He was the older son . But he sold all that he would get from his father . He sold it for a little food .
58012017	You know that later he wanted to get the blessing , but he did not get it . He could not turn back . He even cried as he begged for the blessing .
58012018	You have not come to the mountain that can be touched and is burning with a big fire . You have not come to the place of darkness and night and storm .
58012019	You have not come to a place where a loud trumpet or horn is blown , and a loud voice is talking . When the people heard the voice , they begged that God would not say anything more to them .
58012020	They were afraid of what he said . He said , If even an animal touches this mountain , it must be killed with stones .
58012021	Moses was afraid when he saw all this . He said , I fear very much and I tremble .
58012022	But you have come to a hill called Zion . You have come to the city of the living God . It is the Jerusalem in heaven . You have come to many thousands of angels in a happy gathering .
58012023	You have come to the church people . They are Gods first sons , and their names are written in heaven . You have come to God who is the judge of all people . You have come to the spirits of good people who have been made right .
58012024	You have come to Jesus who is the middle man of a new agreement . You have come to the place where the spilling of his blood has more power than Abels .
58012025	Take care that you listen to God who is talking now . The people were punished when they would not listen to the One who talked on earth . And we will be punished much worse if we will not listen to the One who talks from heaven .
58012026	That time his voice shook the earth . But now he has said , Only once more I will shake the earth and the sky also .
58012027	The words , Only once more mean that the things that are shaken will be taken away . They are things that were made . The things which are not shaken will stay .
58012028	We have a place in heaven that cannot be shaken . So let us be glad and worship God and please him . Let us respect and fear him .
58012029	Our God is a fire that can burn up .
58013001	Keep on loving your Christian brothers .
58013002	Take strangers to your home and care for them . Some people who have done this found out the strangers were angels .
58013003	Remember those who are in prison as if you were in prison with them . And remember those who are having troubles , as if you were having the same troubles .
58013004	Everyone must respect marriage . And the bed must be kept clean . God will punish those who use their bodies for wrong sex .
58013005	Do not let the love of money control your life . Be satisfied with what you have . God himself has said , I will never be away from you . I will never leave you alone .
58013006	So we can be strong and say , The Lord will help me . I will not be afraid . What can men do to me ?
58013007	Remember your leaders . They have told you the word of God . Think about the way they lived and died , and keep on believing as they did .
58013008	Jesus Christ is the same yesterday , and today , and for ever .
58013009	Do not listen to all kinds of different teaching and strange things . It is better to have a heart that is strong because of Gods blessing than a heart that is thinking about different kinds of food . Different kinds of food do not help people who put their trust in them .
58013010	We have a sacrifice . But priests who serve God on earth have no right to eat from this sacrifice .
58013011	The high priest takes into the Most Holy Place the blood of animals that are sacrificed . He gives it to God to pay for the wrong things people have done . The bodies of these animals are burned outside the town .
58013012	So also Jesus was put to death outside the town . Then he could make the people holy by his own blood .
58013013	So let us go to him outside the town and take the shame as he did .
58013014	Here we do not have a city that will last for ever , but we are looking for the city that will come .
58013015	Let us always give a sacrifice of praise to God through Jesus . We do it by thanking him for all that he has done and also by talking about him . That is the sacrifice we make with our lips to his name .
58013016	But do not forget to do good things for people , and to give what you have to those who need it . These are sacrifices that please God .
58013017	Obey your leaders and do what they tell you . They are watching over your souls . They must give a report . Obey them so they will be glad , and not sad , to give a report . If you make them sad , it is no help to you .
58013018	Talk to God about us . We know that what we do is right . We want to do what is right in every way .
58013019	Here is why I want very much that you talk to God about me . If you do , I will be free to come to you sooner .
58013020	God gives peace . He brought back our Lord Jesus from death . Our Lord Jesus cares for Gods people and he gave his blood for the agreement that stands for ever .
58013021	May God give you everything good so that you will do what he wants you to do . He will do in us , through Jesus Christ , what pleases him . Praise him for ever . May it be so !
58013022	Please , brothers , be patient with the words I have given to help you . I have written a short letter .
58013023	I want you to know that our brother Timothy is free . If he comes here soon , I will come with him to see you .
58013024	Greet all your leaders and all of Gods people . Those who belong to the country of Italy send you greetings .
58013025	May Gods loving kindness be with you all . Amen ! May it be so !
59001001	I am James . I am a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ . I send greetings to all of Gods people wherever they live .
59001002	My brothers , be very happy when you are tested by having troubles of many kinds .
59001003	You know this , that when you prove you believe , you become stronger to take troubles .
59001004	But you must keep on being strong to take trouble . Then you will be all right in every way . You will not need anything more .
59001005	If any of you need to be wise , ask God to make you wise . He gives plenty of wisdom to all people . He is not angry because you ask him . He will make you wise .
59001006	But when you ask , you must believe that God will do it . You must not doubt and think , Perhaps God will not do it . A person who doubts is like a wave on the sea . The wind drives it this way and that way .
59001007	That person must not think that he will get anything from the Lord .
59001008	A person like that has two minds . He cannot go straight in any of his ways .
59001009	A Christian brother who is poor should be glad : he is in a high place now he is a Christian .
59001010	A Christian brother who is rich should be glad : he is in a low place now he is a Christian . A rich man will pass away like a flower on the grass .
59001011	The sun shines and is very hot . Then the grass dries and its flower falls off . It was nice at first , but now it is not nice any more . In the same way , the rich man will die while he is going around trying to make money .
59001012	God will bless any man who is strong to take his trouble , when he is being tested . When he has proved he is strong , he will live for ever . That is what the Lord has promised to those who love him .
59001013	No one who wants to do something wrong should say , God is trying to make me do this wrong thing . God cannot do anything wrong .
59001014	It is their own heart which is wrong . That is why he wants to do something wrong . It fools him .
59001015	Then the wrong in his heart makes him do the wrong thing . And the wrong thing he has done leads to death .
59001016	My dear brothers , do not fool yourselves .
59001017	Every good thing and every fine gift comes from heaven . It comes from the Father of all light . He does not change and he makes no shadow by turning .
59001018	He made us his children because he wanted us . He made us his children by giving us his true word . He made us his children so that we would be the first and best of all he made .
59001019	My dear brothers , do not forget this . Every man should be quick to listen , slow to speak , and slow to be angry .
59001020	When a man is angry , he does not do what God says is right .
59001021	So stop all your dirty living . Stop doing so many wrong things . Listen quietly to the word that has been put in your hearts . It is able to save you .
59001022	But obey Gods word . Do not just listen to it . If you just listen to it , you fool yourselves .
59001023	Anyone who just listens to the word , and does not obey it , is like a man who looks at his face in a looking glass .
59001024	He looks at himself and goes away , and right away he forgets what he looked like .
59001025	But there is a law that is all right . It sets people free from their old ways . Anyone who looks into that law and remembers it , is happy because he obeys the law . He does not just listen to the law and forget it , but he obeys what the law says .
59001026	Some of you think that you are doing what God wants . But you are not careful what you say . If you are like that , you are fooling yourself . And you are not doing what God wants .
59001027	This is what God the Father wants . It is clean and right . Go and help those who have no father and mother . Go and help widow women whose husbands are dead . These people have troubles . And keep yourself clean from the wrong things in the world .
59002001	My brothers , you believe in our Lord , the wonderful Jesus Christ . So you must not think one man is better than another .
59002002	A man comes in to your church meeting . He has a gold ring and wears fine clothes . A poor man also comes in . He wears old clothes .
59002003	You look at the man who wears fine clothes . And you say to him , Sit here on this good chair . But you say to the poor man , Stand over there , or you say , Sit on the floor by my feet .
59002004	If you do these things , you think some people are better than others . You are wrong when you judge people this way .
59002005	Listen , my dear brothers . God has chosen people who are poor in this world . They believe very much . They will have a place in the kingdom which he has promised to give to those who love him .
59002006	But you made the poor man ashamed . Is it not the rich people who trouble you ? Are not they the ones who take you to court ?
59002007	Are not they the ones who say wrong things about the good name you have ?
59002008	The holy writings say , Love your neighbour as you love yourself . If you obey this law of your King you do well .
59002009	But if you think one man is better than another , that is wrong . The law says you are a bad person .
59002010	Anyone who obeys the law , but then breaks one of the laws , has broken all the laws .
59002011	God made the law , Do not use sex wrongly . God also made the law , Do not kill . If you do not have wrong sex , but you kill , you have broken the law .
59002012	There is a law that makes people free . It is the law of showing kindness . Always talk and live like men who will be judged by that law .
59002013	When God judges , he will not be kind to a person who has not been kind . It is better to be kind than it is to judge people .
59002014	My brothers , perhaps a man says , I believe . What good is that if he does not do anything ? Can just believing save him ?
59002015	Perhaps a brother or a sister needs clothes and has no food .
59002016	Perhaps one of you says to them , God bless you . Be warm . Eat all you want . But what good is that if you do not give them what they need for their bodies ?
59002017	Believing is like that . If it does not do anything it is no good . Belief by itself is dead .
59002018	In that case someone may say , You believe . And I do good things . Try to show me that you believe without doing any acts of kindness . I will show you that I believe by doing acts of kindness .
59002019	You believe that there is one God . That is right . But even the bad spirits believe that . And they shake with fear .
59002020	You are foolish ! Believing is no good if it does not do anything good . Do you want to know that for sure ?
59002021	Look at Abraham . God called our father Abraham a good man . This was because he gave his son Isaac to God on the holy table for a sacrifice .
59002022	You can see he believed . His faith and the things he did worked together . His believing was made all right because he did something .
59002023	The words of the holy writings came true . They say , Abraham believed God . And he was called a good man because of it . In another place he was called Gods friend .
59002024	You see , a man is a good man because of the things he does , and not just because he believes .
59002025	Rahab was a bad woman . But in the same way God called her a good woman because of something she did . She took the men into her house and then let them go out another way .
59002026	A body is dead if it does not breathe . In the same way , believing is dead if it does not do anything good .
59003001	My brothers , not many of you should be teachers . You know that we who teach will be punished more than other people .
59003002	We all do many wrong things . Any man who never says anything wrong is right in every way . He is able to make his whole body do what is right .
59003003	We put a piece of iron in the mouths of horses so they will obey us . Then we can make their whole bodies go where we want them to go .
59003004	Look at the big boats also . They are very big . The strong winds push them along . But a man uses a small piece of wood and makes the boat go where he wants it to go .
59003005	A persons tongue is like that . It is a small part of the body but it talks about big things . A very small fire can burn a big pile of wood !
59003006	The tongue is like a fire . It is like a whole world of trouble . It is a part of our body . And it makes our whole body bad . It burns up our whole life . And the fire that makes the tongue burn comes from hell .
59003007	People have been able to tame all kinds of animals , birds , snakes , and fish .
59003008	But no one can tame the tongue . It is a bad thing that will not be ruled . It is full of poison that can kill .
59003009	We praise our Lord and Father with our tongues . And we speak wrong words about people with our tongues , even though they were made like God .
59003010	Praising and wrong words come out of the same mouth ! My brothers , this should not be so .
59003011	Do good water and bad water both come from the same place ?
59003012	My brothers , do olives come from a fig tree ? Or do figs come from a vine ? No , they do not ! Salt water and fresh water do not both come from the same place .
59003013	Who among you is wise and knows about things ? He should show what he knows by his good life . He will not be proud because he is wise .
59003014	Are you a person who is very jealous ? In your hearts you want to be better than others ? Then stop being proud of yourself . Do not say what is not true .
59003015	God did not give you wisdom like that . But it comes from this world . It comes from people . It comes from bad spirits .
59003016	If people are jealous of others , their lives are not right . They do every kind of wrong thing to get what they want . They confuse and upset people .
59003017	First of all , when God makes people wise , they are holy . They do not fight . They are gentle . They listen to what other people say . They are very kind and do many good things . They do not quarrel . They do not say what is not true .
59003018	People who do not quarrel have peace . When there is peace , there is a good life .
59004001	Why do you fight and quarrel ? It is because your feelings are fighting inside of you . That is why you fight .
59004002	You want something but you cannot get it . Then you kill . You want something very much and cannot get it . So you quarrel and fight . You do not get it because you do not ask God for it .
59004003	You ask for it , but you do not get it , because you ask in a wrong way . You want to use it for yourselves and not for others .
59004004	You people promised God you would be true to him , but you did not stay true ! Do you not know that if you love the world you hate God ? Anyone who wants to be a lover of the world makes himself an enemy of God .
59004005	The holy writings say , God gave his Spirit to live in us . And that Spirit wants us for himself . Do you think this means nothing ?
59004006	But God helps you even more than that . That is why the holy writings say , God fights against those who are proud , but he helps those who are not proud .
59004007	So let God control you . Fight the devil and he will run away from you .
59004008	Come to God and he will come to you . You bad people , make your hands clean ! You love what is good and what is wrong at the same time . Make your hearts clean .
59004009	Be sad about this , and cry . Turn your laughing into crying . Stop being happy . Be sad .
59004010	Do not be proud before the Lord . Then he will lift you up .
59004011	My brothers , do not say wrong things about each other . A man who says wrong things about his brother or judges his brother is saying wrong things about Gods law and he is judging Gods law . If you judge the law , you are not obeying the law , but you are a judge .
59004012	God made the law and he is the judge . And he is the one who can save you or kill you . Who are you that you should judge your neighbour ?
59004013	Listen to me ! You say , Today or tomorrow we will go to that town . We will stay there a year . We will buy and sell and get rich . But you do not know what will happen to you tomorrow .
59004014	What is your life like ? It is like a cloud . It is here for a little while and then it is gone .
59004015	You should say If the Lord wants to do it , we will live and do this or that .
59004016	But now you talk about the big things you will do . All that kind of talk is wrong !
59004017	But if a person knows what he should do and he does not do it , he has done something wrong .
59005001	Rich people , listen to me ! Cry loud and long because of the troubles you will have .
59005002	Your things are spoiled . Bugs have eaten your clothes .
59005003	Your gold and silver are all spoiled . The wrong in them will prove that you have done wrong . The wrong will burn you up like fire . You have kept all these things and now time is almost ended .
59005004	Listen ! Men worked in your fields to cut your grain and you did not pay them ! That money shouts against you . The men who cut your harvest have called out to the Lord who has power and he has heard them .
59005005	You have had a good time on earth . You have done anything you wanted to do . Your lives are full of everything . Like a fat animal , you will soon be killed .
59005006	You have punished good people . You have killed them . And they do not stop you .
59005007	So brothers , take your troubles quietly and wait until the Lord comes . A farmer waits until the harvest grows from the ground . He waits for it a long time until it has had the first and second rain .
59005008	You must wait also . Keep your hearts strong , because the Lord will come soon .
59005009	Brothers , do not say mean things to each other . If you do , you will be judged . Listen , the judge is standing at the door now .
59005010	My brothers , look at the lives of the prophets of God who spoke in the name of the Lord . See the troubles they had . They took them and waited . Do as they did .
59005011	God blesses those who take their troubles quietly and keep on believing . You have heard about Jobs troubles and how he took them . And you have seen what the Lord did for him at the end . The Lord is very kind and helps people .
59005012	My brothers , here is something that matters very much . When you make a promise do not ask heaven to hear it , or the earth , or any other thing . When you mean Yes , just say , Yes . And when you mean No , just say , No . If you do that , you will not be judged .
59005013	Is any one of you in trouble ? He should talk to God about it . Is any one of you happy ? He should sing songs of praise to God .
59005014	Is any one of you sick ? He should call for the leaders of the church people . They should talk to God about him and put oil on him in the name of the Lord .
59005015	Because they talk to God , and believe , he will hear them . The sick man will be healed . The Lord will make him well again . If the sick man has done wrong things , the Lord will forgive him .
59005016	So tell one another the wrong things you have done . And tell God about each others needs , so that you will be healed . When a good man talks to God , big things can be done .
59005017	Elijah was a man like us . He asked God not to let it rain . And for three years and six months it did not rain on the earth .
59005018	Then he talked to God again . And it rained . Plants grew on the earth .
59005019	My brothers , has one of you left the right way ? Has another person brought him back again ?
59005020	Do not forget that the person who has brought a man back from his wrong ways will save that man from death . He will cover up many wrong things and be forgiven .
60001001	I am Peter . I am an apostle of Jesus Christ . I send this letter to Gods chosen people . You are like people on a journey . You live in the countries of Pontus , Galatia , Cappadocia , Asia , and Bithynia . But you do not belong there .
60001002	God the Father chose you as he planned to do long ago . You were made holy by the Spirit . You were chosen to obey Jesus Christ and to be made clean by the blood of his death . May you have much blessing and peace .
60001003	Praise the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ! He was very kind to us , and made us his children . So we have a new hope . This hope is a living hope because Jesus Christ was raised from death .
60001004	Because we are Gods children , one day we shall receive special blessings . They cannot be spoiled in any way , and they will last for ever . They are kept safe in heaven for you .
60001005	You are saved by Gods power because you believe . You will then be fully saved . The way is ready and you will see it when the end of time comes .
60001006	This makes you very glad , even though now maybe you are sad because you have troubles of many kinds . They are only for a short time .
60001007	To believe is worth more than to have gold . Gold can spoil , but it is tested by fire to show that it is good . So troubles test you to prove that you believe . Then , because you really believe , you will be praised and made great and have honour when Jesus Christ comes again .
60001008	You love him even though you have not seen him . You trust him even though you do not see him . And so you are very happy . No words can tell how happy you are . Your joy is very great .
60001009	God will reward you because you have believed . You will then be fully saved .
60001010	The prophets of God long ago told about this way of being saved . They tried to find out about it and asked much about it . They spoke words from God telling about the blessing God would give you .
60001011	The Spirit of Christ in them showed them that Christ would have troubles and after that he would be great . They tried to find out when these things would happen or how things would be when they did happen .
60001012	The Spirit showed them that they told these things not for themselves , but for you . And now the men who told you the good news have told you these same things . They spoke by the power of the Holy Spirit who was sent from heaven . Even the angels wanted very much to know about these things .
60001013	So think clearly . Keep awake . When Jesus Christ comes , he will bring you blessing . Set all your hope on that .
60001014	Be children who obey . Do not be like what you were before you knew Christ . Then you did anything you wanted to do .
60001015	But be holy in all the things you do . Be holy because the one who has called you is holy .
60001016	God says in the holy writings , You must be holy , because I am holy .
60001017	You call God your Father . He does not think one man is better than another . He judges everyone by what he has done . So then you must fear him as you live your life here on earth .
60001018	You know this . You lived the way your fathers taught you to live , and it was not a good way to live . You were bought and set free from that way of life . But you were not bought with silver or gold money , which can spoil .
60001019	You were bought with blood that is worth much . It is like the blood of a sheep that is perfect with nothing wrong in its body . You were bought with the blood of Christ .
60001020	Before the world was made God chose Christ to do it , and Christ came at the end of time for your sake .
60001021	It is through Christ that you believe in God . God raised Christ from death and made him great . And that is why you are able to believe and hope in God .
60001022	You have obeyed what is true and that has made your hearts clean . And now you really love your Christian brothers . So with your clean hearts , love each other very much .
60001023	You have been made Gods children . He did not make you his children by something that dies , but by something that cannot die . That is the word of God .
60001024	The holy writings say , People may be great . But they are like a flower on the grass . The grass dies and the flower falls off .
60001025	But the word of the Lord cannot die ! And this word is the good news which has been told to you .
60002001	So stop all the wrong things you do . Stop all the ways you cheat people . Stop fooling people . Stop being jealous . Stop saying wrong things about people .
60002002	Babies who have just been born want milk very much . In the same way , you should want Gods word . That is like good milk . It will make you grow up so that you will then be fully saved .
60002003	You should want Gods word if you have already tasted and know that the Lord is good .
60002004	Come to the Lord Jesus . He is like a living stone . People did not want to use it . But God chose it . It was worth very much to him .
60002005	You also are like living stones . You are being built into a temple , a holy place for God . You are to be holy priests there . You are to give sacrifices to God from your heart . God will accept them because of Jesus Christ .
60002006	The holy writings say , Listen , I am placing a stone in Zion . It is the main stone of the house . I have chosen it and it is worth very much . Anyone who believes in him will not be ashamed .
60002007	He is worth very much to you who believe in him . But some people do not believe in him . To them he is , the stone that the men who were building would not use . But now it is the chief stone at the corner .
60002008	And to them he is also , a stone on which people will hit their feet , and a rock that will make them fall down . They hit their feet on it , because they do not obey the word . It was planned that this would happen to them ! But you are a chosen people . You are priests to your king . You are a holy nation . You are Gods very own people . All this is so that you will tell how good he is . He called you out of darkness into his wonderful light .
60002009	At one time you were not Gods people . But now you are Gods people . At one time you did not know Gods kindness . Now you do .
60002010	Dear brothers , you are people who do not belong to this world . You are like visitors who are on a journey . I beg you , do not do the things your body wants to do . Those things fight against your soul .
60002011	Live good lives among the people who do not believe . They may talk about you as if you do wrong things . But when they see the good things you do , they will praise God on the day he comes to help you .
60002012	Obey every officer of the government to please the Lord . Obey the king because he is over all .
60002013	Obey the rulers because they are sent by him . They are sent to punish those who do wrong things and to praise those who do good things .
60002014	That is what God wants you to do . He wants you to do good things . By doing good things , you will stop foolish people from saying wrong things about you . They say wrong things about you because they do not know you .
60002015	You are free people . But do not think , I am free so I can do wrong things . You are Gods servants .
60002016	Respect all men . Love your Christian brothers . Fear God . Respect the king .
60002017	Servants , respect and obey your masters in all things . Obey not only those who are good to you . But also obey those who are hard on you .
60002018	Maybe a person is punished when he has done nothing wrong . If he takes these troubles to please God , he does a very good thing .
60002019	What praise will you have if you take a beating when you have done something wrong ? But when you do right and are punished , if you take it quietly , God is pleased .
60002020	You have been called to do this because Christ also was punished for you . He showed you what you should do . So do as he did .
60002021	He did no wrong . And he told no lie .
60002022	When people said wrong things to him , he did not say wrong things to them . When he was punished , he did not say , I will do something to you ! But he trusted in God who judges what is right .
60002023	Christ in his own body took the wrong things we have done to the cross . He did this so that we would stop our bad ways and live right . Because he was punished , you were healed .
60002024	Like lost sheep , you were going away from God . But now you have come back to the one who takes care of you and helps you .
60002025	missing fehlt/missing
60003001	Wives , respect and obey your husbands in the same way . Then the husbands who do not obey the word of God will want to know God . They will want to know God because their wives live good lives , even though they say nothing about God .
60003002	They will see that you live holy lives and respect your husbands .
60003003	You should not be fine on the outside only . Some women make their hair nice . They wear gold things . They have fine clothes .
60003004	But you must be fine in your heart . Have a heart that is gentle and quiet . That will not wear out . And God thinks it is worth very much .
60003005	There were holy women long ago who trusted in God . They made themselves nice in this way . They obeyed their husbands .
60003006	Sarah obeyed Abraham . She called him her master . You are her children if you do what is right and are not afraid of trouble .
60003007	Husbands , also live with your wife the way you know is right . Respect her because she is a woman . She is not as strong as a man . Also respect her because God has given her , as well as you , the blessing of life . In this way , you will not stop God from doing what you ask him to do .
60003008	Here is one thing more . You must all agree . You must care when others have trouble . You must love your Christian brothers . You must be kind . You must not be proud .
60003009	You must not do wrong things to those who do wrong things to you . You must not say wrong things to those who say wrong things to you . But ask God to bless those people . This is what you have been called to do . Then God will bless you .
60003010	The holy writings say , A man who wants to live and have good days must not say wrong things . He must not say anything that is not true .
60003011	He must turn away from anything wrong and do what is good . He must try hard to find peace , and keep on looking for it .
60003012	The Lord watches over those who do good . He listens when they talk to him . But the Lord is against those who do wrong things .
60003013	Who will do something bad to you if you want to do what is good ?
60003014	But even if people trouble you because you do right , God will bless you . Do not be afraid of them . And do not be troubled .
60003015	Worship Christ as Lord in your hearts . Always be ready to give an answer to anyone who asks you about the hope you have . But be gentle and respect him .
60003016	Keep your hearts clean . Then when people say wrong things about you , they will be ashamed because they have talked wrongly about your good Christian life .
60003017	It is better to have trouble for doing right , if God allows it , than to have trouble for doing wrong .
60003018	For Christ died that once because of our wrong ways . He was good and he died for those who were bad . He did this to bring us to God . His body died , but his spirit had new life .
60003019	His spirit went and gave his message to peoples spirits who were in prison .
60003020	In the days long ago , they did not obey God . God waited for them to do so while Noah was building the big house on the boat . A few people , only eight , were saved by going through the water .
60003021	The water of baptism is like that . It saves you . It does not save you because it washes dirt from your bodies . But it saves you because you bring yourselves to God with a clean heart . It saves you because Jesus Christ has been raised from death .
60003022	He has gone up into heaven . He is now at the right side of God . Angels , rulers , and governments obey him .
60004001	Christ suffered in his body . You also must be ready to have the same trouble happen to you . When a man has suffered in his body , he has stopped doing wrong things .
60004002	For the rest of his life on earth he will not do what people want to do . He will do what God wants him to do .
60004003	In the time past you did the same things as people who do not believe God . Let that be enough . You did things you should be ashamed of . You did what you wanted to do . You got drunk . You got into fights . You took part in noisy feasting with dancing . You did wrong by worshipping idols .
60004004	Those people are surprised now that you do not do the same wrong things they do . And they say wrong things about you .
60004005	They will have to explain what they are doing . They will have to talk to God about what they have done . He is ready to judge living people and dead people .
60004006	That is why the good news was also told to those who are now dead . They will be judged like men who are alive . This was done so that they could live like God in the spirit .
60004007	It is almost the time when the world will end . So be wise and watch and talk to God .
60004008	Here is something that matters very much . You must love each other very much . Love will cover up many wrong things .
60004009	Be glad to take other Christians into your house and care for them . And do not grumble about it .
60004010	God has given each person a gift . That gift is something he can do . Each one should use his gift to help the others . In that way you all make good use of the many blessings God has given you .
60004011	Has God blessed you by knowing how to talk ? Then you should talk the words of God . Are you a helper ? Then you should help with the strength God has given you . In all that you do , you should show that God is great through Jesus Christ . He has praise and power for ever . Yes , he has !
60004012	My dear brothers , do not be surprised by the hard trouble like fire that comes to test you . Do not think some new thing is happening to you .
60004013	Be glad when you suffer as Christ did . Then you will also be very glad when he comes and you see how great he is .
60004014	Do men say wrong things about you because you are a Christian ? Then you are blessed because the wonderful Spirit , the Spirit of God , is with you .
60004015	Do not kill . Do not steal . Do not do wrong . Do not try to boss other people . None of you should suffer because you have done these things .
60004016	But if a man suffers because he is a Christian , he should not be ashamed of it . He should praise God that he is a Christian .
60004017	The time has come for God to judge people . Gods people will be judged first . If we are judged first , what will happen at the end to those who do not obey the good news of God ?
60004018	The holy writings say , If it is hard for a good person to be saved , what will happen to a person who is against God and lives a bad life ?
60004019	If God allows you to suffer , trust him . He made you and you can trust him . But keep on doing good things .
60005001	So I am talking to the leaders among you . I am also a leader . I saw the sufferings of Christ . And I will have some part of his greatness when he comes again .
60005002	Take good care of Gods people . They have been given to you to care for . Do this , not because you must do it , but because you want to please God . Do it not for the money that you get for doing it , but because you are glad to do it .
60005003	Do not be like a boss over the people you care for , telling them how to live . But show them how to live by the way you live .
60005004	Christ the big Shepherd who takes care of all people is coming . When he comes , he will give you a crown to show that you are great . You will have it for ever .
60005005	Also , you who are younger men , obey your leaders . I say to all of you , do not be proud . Do not think you are better than the others . The holy writings say , God fights against proud people , but he helps those who are not proud .
60005006	You are under Gods power . Do not be proud , so that at the right time he may put you into a higher place .
60005007	Turn all your troubles over to him , because he cares for you and is watching over you .
60005008	Keep awake ! Watch ! Your enemy the devil is walking around like a growling lion . He is looking for someone to catch .
60005009	Fight against the devil . Be strong because you believe . Remember that your brothers all over the world suffer the same kind of trouble as you .
60005010	God gives all blessings . He has called you through Christ to be great with him for ever . When you have suffered for a short time , he will make you all right . He will make you strong and steady .
60005011	He has power for ever . Yes , he has !
60005012	Silas has written this short letter for me . I believe he is a brother who can be trusted . I have written to help you and tell you the true way to have Gods blessing . Stand firm in that way !
60005013	The church people in the city of Babylon greet you . God has also chosen them . My son Mark also greets you .
60005014	Greet one another with a kiss of love . May all of you who are Christians have peace .
61001001	I am Simon Peter . I am a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ . I send greetings to you who have believed as we have . Believing is worth just as much to you as it is to us . This is because our God and Saviour , Jesus Christ , is right and good .
61001002	May the loving kindness of God bless you and give you more and more peace because you know God and Jesus our Lord .
61001003	Christ is God and by his own power he has given us everything that we need to live and to please God . He has given this to us because we know him , and he has called us because he is great and good .
61001004	Because of these things , he has promised us things that are worth very much and are very great . He has promised these things to us so that by them you may become like God too . By them you will be kept free from the selfish desires of the people in the world . These desires lead to death .
61001005	So now you believe , try to live a good life . When you live a good life , try to learn more about God .
61001006	When you have learned more , be strong to do what is right . Then go on doing what is right , even if it is hard . As you go about doing right , keep close to God .
61001007	As you keep close to God , love your Christian brothers . When you love your Christian brothers , love everyone !
61001008	If you do these things and you do them more and more , you will be good Christians and you will know more and more about our Lord Jesus Christ .
61001009	But the man who does not do these things is like a blind man . He can see only a little way . He has forgotten that he was made clean from the wrong things he used to do .
61001010	So my brothers , try to show that God has called you and chosen you . If you do these things , you will never fall .
61001011	That will make it easy for you to go into the kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ . His kingdom will be for ever .
61001012	I do want always to bring these things to your minds . I will do this even though you know them , and even though you are strong in the true way that you already have .
61001013	I think it is right , as long as I live , to keep these things in your minds .
61001014	I know that I will not live long now . Our Lord Jesus Christ has told me about that .
61001015	But I will try to see that you have something to bring these things to your minds , even after I am gone .
61001016	We have told you about the power of our Lord Jesus Christ and that he is coming again . We did not tell you stories someone told us . We ourselves saw how great he is .
61001017	God the Father praised him and showed that he is great . A voice came from the bright cloud and said to him , This is my Son . I love him and he pleases me very much .
61001018	We heard this voice which came from heaven . It happened when we were on the holy hill with Jesus .
61001019	And so we are more sure about what the prophets of God said long ago . You will do well to listen to them . It is like a lamp shining in a dark place . Then the daylight will come and the morning star will shine in your hearts .
61001020	First you must understand this . The words from the prophets in the holy writings did not come from their own minds .
61001021	The prophets did not say what they wanted to say . But the Holy Spirit made them speak . And they spoke Gods message .
61002001	But prophets who were not true were also among the people of Israel . Also there will be teachers who will not be true among you . They will bring in wrong teaching that leads to death . They will even say that they do not belong to the Master who bought them . And so they will quickly bring themselves to death .
61002002	Many people will do the same wrong things they do . And because of them , men will say wrong things about the true way .
61002003	Because they are greedy for money , they will trick you with lies . For a long time God has planned to punish them . They will be punished at the right time .
61002004	God punished the angels who did wrong . He put them into the darkest part of hell . They must be kept there until the time when they will be judged .
61002005	In the days long ago , God punished the world . But he saved Noah who told people what was right . And God saved seven other people . But he made water cover the world full of bad people .
61002006	God burned up the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah . He punished them so that no cities were left . He did this to show what would happen to bad people .
61002007	But God saved Lot out of the trouble . Lot was a good man . He did not like the wrong way the bad people lived .
61002008	That good man lived among the bad people and he saw and heard what they did . Day after day , the bad things they did troubled his heart because he was a good man .
61002009	The Lord knows how to save good people out of the trouble that tests them . And he knows how to keep bad people until the day when he will judge them . And they are being punished even now .
61002010	Most of all , he will punish people who do the wrong things they want to do and who will not obey the men who rule over them . They are very bold and proud . They do not fear to say wrong things about those who are great , even about the angels .
61002011	Angels have more strength and power than they . And yet the angels do not judge them and say wrong things about them to the Lord .
61002012	These people are like animals that cannot think . They are like animals that are born to be caught and killed . They say wrong things about things they do not understand . They will die like the animals .
61002013	Bad things will happen to them because they have done wrong things . They think it is fun to have a good time during the day . They are like spots and sores . They like to eat and drink at the love feasts with you . They are trying to fool you .
61002014	They are always looking for women to have sex with them . They never stop their wrong ways . They fool people whose hearts are not strong to do right . They always want more and more money . Gods curse is on them !
61002015	They have left the right road and have done wrong . They follow the same road that Balaam walked . He was the son of Beor . He loved the pay he would get for doing a wrong thing .
61002016	But he was told to stop doing wrong . The animal he was riding talked with a mans voice . It tried to make the prophet stop his foolish way .
61002017	These men are like wells with no water in them . They are like fog that is blown away by a strong wind . A very dark place has been kept to put them in .
61002018	They say big and foolish things . They fool people who have just left those who live in wrong ways . They fool them by making them want to do wrong things with their bodies .
61002019	They promise them that they will be free . But they themselves are slaves of death . A man is a slave of anything that rules over him .
61002020	They left the wrong ways of the world because they knew our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ . Then when they went back to the wrong ways again , they were ruled by them . Then they will have more trouble than they had at first .
61002021	It would have been better for them if they had never known the right way ! Because they knew the right way , it was very wrong for them to turn from the holy law God gave them .
61002022	They show that this saying is true , The dog goes back to eat what his own stomach threw up ! and , A pig that is washed rolls in the mud again !
61003001	My dear brothers , this is my second letter to you . In both of my letters I have tried to bring some things to your good minds .
61003002	I want you to remember what Gods prophets said would happen . And I want you to remember what we apostles told you that our Lord and Saviour said .
61003003	Here is the first thing . In the last days , men will come who will make fun of holy things . They will do what they themselves want to do .
61003004	They will say , He promised to come . Where is he ? Our fathers have died . And since then everything is just the same as it has been since the world was made .
61003005	They do not want to remember that long ago God spoke and made the sky . He made the land come up from the water .
61003006	But later on these same waters covered the world in a flood and the people died .
61003007	The sky and the earth that are here now are being kept because God spoke . They are kept to be burned up . This will happen on the day when God judges people and they will die .
61003008	My dear brothers , do not forget this one thing . One day is like a thousand years to the Lord . And a thousand years are like one day .
61003009	God will do what he promised . He is not slow though , as some people think he is . But he is waiting a long time for you . He does not want anyone to die , but he wants all people to stop their wrong ways .
61003010	The day of the Lord will come like a man who wants to steal . There will be a loud noise and the sky will go away . The elements will melt with fire and they will be gone . The earth and everything on it will be burned up .
61003011	That is the way the whole world will go . So think what kind of people you should be ! Think how holy and true to God your lives should be !
61003012	You should look for the day of God and do everything you can to make it come quickly . On that day the sky will be on fire and go away . The elements will burn and melt away .
61003013	But we are looking for a new sky and a new earth which God has promised . Only good things will be in them .
61003014	My dear brothers , you are looking for these things . So do all you can so that the Lord will find you without any bad or wrong thing in your lives . Let him find you at peace with one another .
61003015	Think of this . He is waiting a long time so that people will be saved . Our dear brother Paul also wrote these things to you , because God has made him wise .
61003016	He also tells about them in all his letters . Some things in his letters are hard to understand . Some people do not know about these things and they are not strong in their faith . They change the meaning of the things Paul wrote . They do this to other things in the holy writings also . Because they do this , they will die .
61003017	My dear brothers , you know about these things before they happen . Take care that you do not do the same things that bad people do . Take care that you do not stop believing the right way .
61003018	Have more and more of Gods blessing and kindness . Learn more and more about our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ . He is great now , and he will be great for ever ! Amen ! Yes he will !
62001001	The Word of life always was living , even from the beginning . We heard him . We saw him with our own eyes . We looked at him , and we touched him with our own hands . We are writing to you about this Word of life .
62001002	This life came to earth . We saw him , and we know about him . And we tell you about this life that lives for ever . This life was with the Father and came to us .
62001003	We tell you also what we have seen and heard . We tell you so that you also will belong with us . And we belong with the Father and the Son .
62001004	We write these things to you so that we all will be very happy .
62001005	God is like light and he is not dark at all . That is the message we heard from him . That is the message we are telling you .
62001006	Do we say that we belong with him ? And at the same time , do we live in the dark ? Then what we say is not true , and what we do is not right .
62001007	Do we live in the light , as God is in the light ? Then we belong with others who belong to him . And the blood of the death of Jesus Christ makes us clean from all the wrong things we have done .
62001008	Do we say , We have no wrong ways ? Then we are fooling ourselves , and we do not know what is true .
62001009	Let us tell God about our wrong ways . God can be trusted . He does what is right . He will forgive us for the wrong things we have done . He will make us clean from all that was wrong .
62001010	Do we say , We have not done anything wrong ? This is like saying that God is not true . That means we do not accept Gods word .
62002001	My children , I am writing these things to you so that you will not do wrong things . But if anyone does something wrong , we have a Friend to help us . He speaks to God for us . He is Jesus Christ who does what is right .
62002002	He himself is the sacrifice God offered to pay for the wrong we have done . And he pays for the wrong things all people in all the world have done .
62002003	We can be sure that we know him when we obey his laws .
62002004	If any man says , I know him and does not obey his laws , he is telling a lie . He does not know what is true .
62002005	But if any man obeys his word , he really loves God . Here is the way that we may be sure that we belong to him .
62002006	If any man says he belongs to him , he must live in the same way Christ lived .
62002007	My dear brothers , I am not writing you a new law . This is an old law . You had it from the beginning . The old law is the word which you have heard .
62002008	But in a way , I am writing you a new law . The darkness is going away and the true light is shining already .
62002009	Does anyone say he is in the light , and hates his brother ? Then he is still in the dark .
62002010	The man who loves his brother lives in the light . There is nothing in him to make him do wrong .
62002011	But the man who hates his brother is in the dark . He lives in the dark . He does not know where he is going , because the darkness has made him blind .
62002012	Children , I am writing to you because God has forgiven the wrong things you have done . Your wrong ways have been forgiven because of what Christ did .
62002013	Fathers , I am writing to you because you know the One who has lived from the beginning . Young men , I am writing to you because you have won the victory over the devil . Children , I write to you because you know Father God .
62002014	Fathers , I write to you because you know him , the one who has lived from the beginning . Young men , I write to you because you are strong . You believe Gods word . You have won the victory over the devil .
62002015	Do not love the world , or the things in the world . If anyone loves the world , he does not love the Father .
62002016	Nothing in the world comes from the Father . I mean the wrong things people like to do with their bodies . I mean the things people see and want to have . I mean all the things people are proud of in this life . These things come from the world , not the Father .
62002017	And the world will go away and all the things in it that people like to do . But the person who does what God wants him to do will live for ever .
62002018	Children , we are very near the end of time . You have heard that someone will come who is against Christ . Many who are against Christ have already come . That is how we know that we are very near the end of time .
62002019	They left us , but they did not belong with us . If they had belonged with us , they would have stayed with us . But they left us so that people could see that all of them did not belong with us .
62002020	But the Holy One has given you a gift of understanding so that you all may know what is true .
62002021	I write to you , not because you do not know what is true , but because you do know . And you know that no lie is true .
62002022	Who then is the one who says what is not true ? It is the one who says that Jesus is not the Christ . That person is against Christ , because he says there is no Father and there is no Son .
62002023	Everyone who says Jesus is not the Son does not know the Father . And everyone who says Jesus is the Son knows the Father .
62002024	So keep what you have heard from the beginning . If you keep what you have heard from the beginning , you too belong to the Son and to the Father .
62002025	And he himself has promised us that we will live for ever .
62002026	I have written these things to you about the ones who try to fool you .
62002027	You have a gift of understanding from Christ . That gift stays with you . You do not need anyone to teach you . His gift teaches you about everything . It is true . It is not a lie . So stay with him as he has taught you .
62002028	Now , my children , stay with Christ . Then we will not be afraid on that day when we see him again . We will not be ashamed to stand before him when he comes again .
62002029	You know that he does what is right . So you know also that everyone who does what is right is his child .
62003001	See how much the Father has loved us ! We are called Gods children . It is true , we are Gods children . People in this world did not know him and so they do not know us .
62003002	My dear brothers , we are Gods children now . No one knows yet what we shall be like . But we know that when Jesus comes , we will be like him . We will see him as he really is .
62003003	Everyone who has this hope about Christ makes his life holy . He makes his life holy and clean , just as Christ is holy .
62003004	Everyone who does wrong things is breaking Gods law . Doing wrong things is breaking the law .
62003005	You know that Christ came to take away the wrong things people have done . He is the one who has done no wrong .
62003006	Everyone who stays with him does not do wrong things . Everyone who does wrong things has never seen him and has never known him .
62003007	My children , do not let anyone fool you . Anyone who does what is good , is good just as Christ is good .
62003008	Anyone who does what is wrong belongs to the devil . The devil has done what is wrong from the beginning . That is why Gods Son came . He came to stop what the devil does .
62003009	No one who is Gods child does wrong things , because Gods life is in him . And he cannot keep on doing wrong things , because he is Gods child .
62003010	This is how people can know who are Gods children and who are the devils children . Everyone who does not do right is not Gods child . And anyone who does not love his brother is not Gods child .
62003011	This is the word you have heard from the beginning . We must love one another .
62003012	We must not be like Cain . He was a child of the devil and killed his brother . Why did he kill him ? He killed him because the things he himself did were wrong , and the things his brother did were right with God .
62003013	My brothers , do not be surprised if people in this world hate you .
62003014	We know that we have gone from death to life . We know this because we love the Christian brothers . Anyone who does not love them has not gone from death to life .
62003015	Everyone who hates his brother is like a man who kills a person . And you know that no one who kills a person has life that will live for ever .
62003016	Christ died for us . That is how we know what love is . We also should be willing to die for our brothers .
62003017	Perhaps a man has plenty of food and things . He sees that his brother needs some . If he does not want to help his brother , does he love God ?
62003018	My children , we must not only talk about loving people; we must show we love people by what we do for them . We must really love them .
62003019	And this is how we will know that we are true . This is why we will not be afraid in front of God .
62003020	Even if our hearts think we are wrong , God is greater than our hearts and he knows everything .
62003021	My dear brothers , if our hearts do not think we are wrong , we will not be afraid in front of God .
62003022	If we ask God for something , we get it . We get it because we obey his laws . We get it because we do what pleases him .
62003023	This is his law . We must believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ . And we must love one another as he told us to do .
62003024	If anyone obeys his laws , he belongs to God and God belongs to him . God has given us the Holy Spirit . That is how we know that God is with us .
62004001	My dear brothers , do not trust every spirit . But test the spirits to see if they belong to God . There are many prophets who are not true who have gone out into the world .
62004002	Here is how you can know the Spirit of God . Every spirit that believes that Jesus Christ has come in the body of a man is from God .
62004003	And every spirit that does not say this about Jesus , does not belong to God . That is the spirit of the one who is against Christ . You have heard that he is coming . And now he is already in the world .
62004004	My children , you belong to God . You have won the victory over those prophets who are not true . You have won because the Spirit that is in you is stronger than the spirit that is in the world .
62004005	Those prophets belong to the world . That is why they teach about things in the world . And that is why the people of the world listen to them .
62004006	But we belong to God . Anyone who knows God listens to us . Anyone who does not belong to God does not listen to us . This is how we know if a spirit is true or not true .
62004007	My dear brothers , we must love one another , because love comes from God . Everyone who loves others is Gods child and he knows God .
62004008	But anyone who does not love others does not know God , because God is love .
62004009	This is how God showed his love for us . He sent his only Son into the world to give us life .
62004010	This is love ! We did not love God , but he loved us . And he sent his Son to be the sacrifice to pay for the wrong things we have done .
62004011	My dear brothers , if God loved us so much , we must love one another also .
62004012	No man has ever seen God . But God lives in us if we love one another . And in loving one another , his love is made perfect .
62004013	He has given us of his own Spirit . That is how we know that we are in him and he is in us .
62004014	And we have seen and we are telling you that the Father sent his Son to save the people in the world .
62004015	If anyone says , Jesus is the Son of God , God is in him and he is in God .
62004016	We know and we believe that God loves us . God is love . And anyone who loves others is in God and God is in him .
62004017	That is why we love each other very much . Then we will not be afraid on the day when people are judged . We are like Christ in this world .
62004018	Where Gods love is , there is no fear . Gods perfect love takes away fear . It is punishment that makes a person fear . Anyone who has fear does not have perfect love .
62004019	We love others because God first loved us .
62004020	If anyone says , I love God , and he hates his brother , he is telling a lie . If he does not love his brother whom he has seen , how can he love God whom he has not seen ?
62004021	God gave us this law . The person who loves God must love his brother also .
62005001	Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is Gods child . And everyone who loves the Father loves his child .
62005002	This is how we know we love Gods children . We love God and we obey his laws .
62005003	We show that we love God when we obey his laws . His laws are not hard to obey .
62005004	Everyone who is Gods child wins a victory over the world . We win because we believe God .
62005005	Who wins a victory over the world ? It is only the person who believes that Jesus is the Son of God .
62005006	There was water and there was blood when Jesus Christ came . There was not water only , but there was water and there was blood . The Spirit proves this is true , because the Spirit is true .
62005007	There are three in heaven who prove it is true . They are the Father , the Word , and the Holy Spirit . These three are one .
62005008	There are three on earth who prove it is true . They are the spirit , the water , and the blood . These three all prove the same thing .
62005009	We believe what people prove to us . But when God proves something it is stronger than what people prove . This is what God proved about his Son .
62005010	Anyone who believes in Gods Son believes what God says about him . Anyone who does not believe God shows that he thinks what God says is not true . He has not believed what God says about his Son .
62005011	Here is what God says . He has given us life that will last for ever . And this life is in his Son .
62005012	So anyone who has the Son has this life . Anyone who does not have the Son of God does not have this life .
62005013	I have written these things to you who believe on the name of the Son of God . I have written them so that you will know that you will live for ever .
62005014	And we are sure God will do this . If we ask him for anything that he wants us to have , he will listen to us .
62005015	And if we know he listens to us when we ask for anything , then we know that we have what we asked him for .
62005016	Maybe a man sees his brother do something wrong , but not so bad that he must die for it . The man should ask God and God will let his brother live . God will let people live if the things they have done are not so bad that they must die for them . But there are things so wrong that a person must die for them . If he has done such as that , I do not tell the man to ask God to let him live .
62005017	Everything that is wrong is a bad thing . But not every bad thing is so wrong that a person must die for it .
62005018	We know that any child of God does not do wrong things . The Son of God keeps him safe and the devil cannot touch him .
62005019	We know that we belong to God and the whole world belongs to the devil .
62005020	We know that the Son of God has come . He has given us a heart to know him who is true . We belong to him who is true , because we belong to his Son Jesus Christ . He is the true God . He has the life that will live for ever .
62005021	My children , have nothing to do with false gods or idols .
63001001	From the leader of the church people . I send greetings to the lady whom God has chosen , and to her children . I love you all because you have the truth about Christ . I am not the only one who loves you . All those who know the truth , love you also .
63001002	We love you because of the truth we share which is in our hearts and will be with us for ever .
63001003	God the Father and Jesus Christ , the Fathers son , will bless us . They will be kind to us . They will give us peace . They will do these things because they are true , and they love us .
63001004	I was very glad to find that some of your children are living in the right way . They are living the way the Father told us to live .
63001005	And now I want to ask you to do something . I am not telling you to do something new . It is the same law we had from the beginning . It is this , We must love one another .
63001006	We love God when we live the way God has told us . This is the law you heard from the beginning . You must live by it .
63001007	Many men who fool people have gone out into the world . They believe that Jesus Christ did not come to live as a man with a body . These men belong to the one who fools people . He is against Christ .
63001008	Watch out for yourselves ! Do not lose what you have worked for , but receive all the reward that you should have .
63001009	Everyone who goes too far , and does not believe what Christ taught , does not believe God . Anyone who believes what Christ taught , believes both the Father and the Son .
63001010	If anyone comes to you who does not teach what Christ taught , do not take him into your house . Do not even greet him .
63001011	Anyone who greets him helps him in the wrong things he does .
63001012	I have much to write to you . But I do not want to write it on paper . I hope to come to visit you and talk with you . Then we will be very happy .
63001013	The children of your sister whom God has chosen send their greetings .
64001001	From the leader of the church people . I send greetings to my dear Gaius . I love you because you have Christ .
64001002	My dear brother , I ask God that you may be all right in every way and that your body may be well . I know that your soul is all right .
64001003	I was very happy when the brothers came and told me that you have been true . They said you are really living the right way .
64001004	Nothing can make me more happy than to hear that my children are living in the right way . My dear brother , when you help your Christian brothers in any way , even though you do not know them , you show that you do what you say you believe .
64001005	They have told the people of the church here how you showed your love to them . Please send them on their way as God would have you do .
64001006	They went out to do Christs work . And they have not taken any help from people who do not believe in God .
64001007	So we should help such men with what they need . Then we are doing our part to tell the true message . I wrote a letter to the people of the church . But Diotrephes wants to be the leader . He will not listen to us .
64001008	So if I come , I will show what he is doing . He is saying wrong things about us . And that is not all . He does not take our brothers into his own home . And he stops other people who want to take them in . He will not let them be church members any longer .
64001009	My dear brother , do not do the wrong things people do , but do the good things people do . Anyone who does good things belongs to God . Anyone who does wrong things has never seen God .
64001010	Everyone says Demetrius is a good man . All this is true . We say the same thing too . And you know that what we say is true .
64001011	I have much to write to you . But I do not want to write to you with pen and ink .
64001012	I hope to see you very soon . Then we will talk together .
64001013	May God give you peace . Our friends greet you . Greet everyone of my friends .

64001015	
65001001	I am Jude . I am a servant of Jesus Christ and I am a brother of James . I send greetings to you whom God the Father has called . He has loved you and kept you safe for Jesus Christ .
65001002	May God be kind to you . May he give you peace . May he love you very much .
65001003	My dear brothers , I wanted very much to write to you and tell you how we all are saved . But then I saw that I must write and tell you to hold very strongly to what you do believe . Fight against those who want to change it . The right way to believe has been given to Gods people once for all times .
65001004	Some men have come in quietly . They are bad men . The holy writings told us long ago that they would be punished . These men change the blessing of our God to do the wrong things they want to do . They show by their lives that they do not belong to Jesus Christ , our only Master and Lord
65001005	You know all these things for all times . But I want to bring them to your minds . First , the Lord saved his people from the country of Egypt . At a time after that , he killed those who did not believe in him .
65001006	Remember the angels also . Some of them did not keep the high place they had . But they left their home . God has them tied in chains for ever , and he is keeping them in a very dark place . He will keep them there until that big day when they will be judged .
65001007	Also Sodom and Gomorrah and the other cities near them show what will happen . The people there had wrong ways of using sex and did wrong things that people should not do with each other . They were punished and are in fire that burns for ever . God did this to show what will happen to others .
65001008	And yet these men do the same wrong things . They think of and do wrong things with their bodies . They will not obey the men who rule over them . And they say wrong things about those who are great , even about the angels .
65001009	At one time Michael the chief angel had a quarrel with the devil about who should have the body of Moses . But he did not dare to judge the devil and say wrong things about him . He said , May the Lord tell you to stop !
65001010	But these men say wrong things about everything they do not understand . They know some things just like animals that cannot think . And they will die because they do those wrong things .
65001011	They will have trouble ! They have lived like Cain . They have done wrong things for pay like Balaam . They have talked against those who are over them . Korah did that . And so they will die as he did .
65001012	These men spoil your love feasts . They are not afraid to eat and drink with you . They take care only of themselves . They are like clouds that do not give rain , and are blown around by the winds . They are like trees when their leaves are gone and they have no fruit . These trees are also dead because they have been pulled up by the roots .
65001013	These men are like big waves on the sea . Big waves cause much trouble . And these men also show the wrong things they do . They are like stars that have fallen from their place in the sky . A very dark place has been kept for ever in which to put these men .
65001014	Enoch was the seventh in Adams family line . He spoke words from God to these men also . He said , Listen ! The Lord came with many thousands of his angels .
65001015	He came to judge all people and to punish all the bad people for all the wrong things they have done . And he came to punish bad people for all the wrong things that they have said against him .
65001016	These men complain about the way things are . They do not like it . They do what they themselves want to do . They say big things . They say nice things to people to get what they want from them .
65001017	But , my dear brothers , you must remember what the apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ said would happen .
65001018	They said to you , At the end of time , men will come who will make fun of holy things . They will do the wrong things they themselves want to do .
65001019	These are the men who make people go into different groups in the church meetings . They have only a mans heart . They do not have the Holy Spirit .
65001020	But you , my dear brothers , must make your lives better in the holy things you believe . Talk to God in the Holy Spirit .
65001021	Keep yourselves in Gods love . Wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to come and help you . He will give you life that will live for ever .
65001022	Some people are not sure what they believe . Be kind to them by sharing in their troubles .
65001023	Pull them out of the fire and save them . There are other people to whom you must be kind , but be careful about it . But you must hate even the clothes that bad people have worn .
65001024	God can keep you from doing anything wrong . He can bring you to the place where he is great and you will be all good . You will be very happy .
65001025	He is the only God . And he is our Saviour through our Lord Jesus Christ . He is great ! He is wonderful ! He has power ! He has the right to rule ! He was like that before time began ! He is like that now ! And he will be like that for ever . Yes , he will !
66001001	God showed these things to Jesus Christ to show to his servants . These are things that must happen soon . Then God sent his angel and showed them to John , his servant .
66001002	John wrote down what God said and what Jesus showed to him . These words tell all that He saw .
66001003	God will bless the person who reads the words of this book . God will bless those who hear the words of this book and obey the things written in it .
66001004	Here is what John wrote to the people of the seven churches which are in the country of Asia Minor : May Gods loving kindness bless you and give you peace . He lives now , he always has lived , and he will come again . May the seven Spirits bless you and give you peace . They stand in front of Gods throne [ chief chair of a king ] .
66001005	May Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace . What he says is true . He was the first to rise from death . And he is ruler of the kings of the earth . He loves us . By his own blood [ death ] he has made us free from the wrong things we have done .
66001006	He has made us into kings and priests to his God and Father . Praise him ! He is great and has power for ever ! Yes , it is so !
66001007	Watch ! He will come in the clouds . Every one will see him . Those who stuck a spear in him will also see him . All the tribes on earth will cry when they see him . That is the way it will be . Yes it will !
66001008	The Lord God says , I am the First and the Last . I am the beginning and the ending . I live now . I always have lived , and I will come again . I have all power .
66001009	I am John , your brother . I belong to Jesus and I am having big trouble just as you are . I also belong to his kingdom and I wait patiently for it . I was on an island called Patmos because I told the word of God and talked about Jesus Christ .
66001010	I was in the Spirit on the Lords day . Behind me I heard a loud voice like the sound of a trumpet or horn .
66001011	The voice said , Write what you see in a book . Send it to the seven churches in the cities of Ephesus , Smyrna , Pergamum , Thyatira , Sardis , Philadelphia , and Laodicea .
66001012	I turned to see who was talking to me . I saw seven gold lamps .
66001013	In the centre of the seven lamps I saw someone like the Son of Man . He was wearing a long gown with a wide , gold belt around his chest .
66001014	The hair on his head was white like sheeps hair , white as snow . His eyes shone like a flame of fire .
66001015	His feet shone like fine brass that has been made pure by fire . His voice was like the sound of much water flowing .
66001016	In his right hand he had seven stars . Out of his mouth came a long knife or sword , sharp on both sides . His face shone like the sun when it is shining very brightly .
66001017	When I saw him , I fell down in front of him as if I had died . He put his right hand on me and said , Do not be afraid . I am the First and the Last .
66001018	I am he who lives . I died . But look , I am alive for ever . I have the keys to death and to the world of the dead .
66001019	So write what you have seen . Write the things that are now and the things that will happen after them .
66001020	You saw seven stars in my right hand . I will tell you the secret meaning of them and of the seven gold lamps . The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches . The seven lamps are the seven churches .
66002001	Write this to the angel of the church people in Ephesus : Here are the words of the one who holds the seven stars in his hand , the one who walks among the seven gold lamps .
66002002	He says , " I know the things you do . I know that you work hard and are patient . I know that you have nothing to do with bad men . You tested those who say they are messengers from God but are not . You proved that they are not true apostles .
66002003	I know that you are patient and are strong for my names sake . And you have not given up .
66002004	But here is what I say against you . You do not love as you loved at first .
66002005	So remember what you were like at first . Stop ! Live the way you did at first . If you do not , I will come and move your lamp from its place . I will do it if you do not stop .
66002006	But this is good : you hate the things which the people called Nicolaitans do . I hate the things they do also . "
66002007	He who can hear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches . He says , " I will let the person who wins eat fruit from the tree of life . It grows in Gods garden . "
66002008	Write this to the angel of the church people in Smyrna : Here are the words of the one who is the First and the Last . He is the one who died but lived again .
66002009	He says , " I know the things you do and the trouble you have . I know you are poor . But you are rich in some ways . I know some people do not respect God . They call themselves Jews . But they are not real Jews . They belong to Satans people .
66002010	Do not be afraid of the troubles you will have . Yes , the devil will put some of you into prison where you will be tested . You will have trouble for ten days . But keep on believing , even if you have to die for it . I will give you life for ever . "
66002011	He who can hear should listen to the message of the Spirit to the churches . He says , " The person who wins will not be hurt by the second death . "
66002012	Write this to the angel of the church people in Pergamum : Here are the words of the one who has the long knife which is sharp on both sides .
66002013	He says , " I know where you live . You live where Satan rules . But you keep my name and you have never said that you do not believe in me . You kept on believing in me even in the time of Antipas . He said he believed in me and was true to me . He was killed among you where Satan lives .
66002014	But I have a few things to say against you . You have some people there who believe the teaching of Balaam . He showed Balak how to trick the people of Israel and make them do wrong . They ate food that was given to idols , and they used sex wrongly .
66002015	Also , you have people among you who believe the teaching of the Nicolaitans . I hate the things they do .
66002016	Stop ! If you do not , I will come soon and I will fight against them with the long knife that comes from my mouth . "
66002017	He who can hear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches . He says , " I will give some of the secret food to the person who wins . And I will give him a white stone . A new name will be written on the stone . No one will know the name but the one who gets the stone . "
66002018	Write this to the angel of the church people in Thyatira : Here are the words of the Son of God . He is the one whose eyes shine like a flame of fire , and his feet shine like fine brass .
66002019	He says , " I know the things you do . I know that you love me , believe in me , work for me , and are patient . I know that you do these things more now than you did at first .
66002020	But I have this to say against you . You let that woman named Jezebel keep on teaching . She calls herself a prophet of God but teaches my servants wrong things . She fools them to use sex wrongly and eat food that has been given to idols .
66002021	I gave her time to stop , but she will not stop her wrong sexual ways and turn back to God .
66002022	Look , I will make her very sick , and also those who love her . I will do it if they do not stop what they are doing with her .
66002023	I will kill her children . Then all the churches will know that I find out what is in a persons mind and heart . I will pay each one of you for the good or wrong things you have done .
66002024	But some of you in Thyatira do not listen to that womans teaching . You have not learned what some people call the deep things of Satan . To you I say , I will put no other load on you .
66002025	The only thing I say to you is to keep on believing until I come .
66002026	If a person wins and does what I want him to do until the end , I will make him rule with me over all peoples .
66002027	The holy writings said this long ago : He will rule them with an iron stick . He will break them to pieces like pots made of clay . This is the same power as I received from my Father .
66002028	And I will give him the morning star . "
66002029	He who can hear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches .
66003001	Write this to the angel of the church people in Sardis : Here are the words of the one who has the seven Spirits of God , and the seven stars . He says , " I know what you do . People say that you are alive , but you are dead .
66003002	Wake up ! You still have a little life left in you . Make it stronger before it dies altogether . I have not seen you do anything that looked right to God .
66003003	So remember the things you were told and the things you have heard . Obey them . Stop the things you have been doing . If you do not wake up , I will come to you like a thief . You will not know when I will come to you .
66003004	But you have a few people in Sardis who have not made their clothes dirty . They will walk with me in white clothes , because they are good enough .
66003005	He who wins will wear white clothes . I will not take his name out of the book of life . I will tell his name to my Father and to his angels . "
66003006	He who can hear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches .
66003007	Write this to the angel of the church people in Philadelphia : Here are the words of the one who is holy and true . He has Davids key . No one will shut what he opens . And no one will open what he shuts .
66003008	He says , " I know what you do . Look , I have opened a door in front of you . No one can shut it . I know that you do not have much power . But you have obeyed my word and you have never said you did not believe in me .
66003009	Look ! I will bring some people who belong to Satans group . They call themselves Jews , but they are not real Jews . They lie . Look , I will make them come and kneel down in front of you . They will know that I have loved you .
66003010	You have obeyed my word and been patient . So I will keep you safe in the time of trouble which will come all over the world . It will test the people who live on earth .
66003011	I am coming again soon ! Hold on to the faith which you have , so that no one will stop you receiving your reward in heaven .
66003012	I will make the person who wins become a strong post in the temple of my God . I will keep him strong . He will never leave it again . I will write on him the name of my God and the name of my Gods city . This city is the new Jerusalem . It comes down out of heaven from my God . And I will write my new name on him . "
66003013	He who can hear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches .
66003014	Write this to the angel of the church people in Laodicea : Here are the words of the one whose name is Truth . What he says can be trusted . He is the one who began all that God made .
66003015	He says , " I know what you do . I know that you are neither cold nor hot . And I wish that you were cold or hot .
66003016	So I will spit you out of my mouth , because you are only warm and not hot or cold .
66003017	You say , I am rich and have many things . I need nothing . You do not know that you are in trouble and need help . You are poor . You are blind . And you have no clothes to wear .
66003018	I tell you what you should do . You should buy from me gold that has been made clean by fire . Then you will be rich . And you should buy from me white clothes to wear . Then people will not see that you have no clothes , and you will not be ashamed . You should buy from me healing oil to put on your eyes . Then you will be able to see .
66003019	I tell off and punish the people I love . So get busy and stop doing wrong .
66003020	Listen , I stand at the door and knock . If any one hears my voice and opens the door , I will come in to him . I will eat with him , and he will eat with me .
66003021	He who wins will sit with me on my throne in heaven . I won too , and I sat down with my Father on his throne . "
66003022	He who can hear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches .
66004001	After this , I looked and saw a door open in heaven . I heard the same voice that I had heard before . It was like the sound of a horn or trumpet . It said , Come up here . I will show you the things that must happen after this .
66004002	Right away , I was in the Spirit . I saw a throne or chief chair in heaven .
66004003	The one who sat on the throne looked very fine and bright . He looked like fine stones called jasper and carnelian . All around his chair was a rainbow that looked like a fine stone called emerald .
66004004	Around his throne I saw twenty-four other thrones . On them sat twenty-four leaders . They wore white clothes and had gold crowns on their heads .
66004005	From the throne came lightning , loud noises , and thunder . In front of the throne , seven bright lamps were burning . These lamps are the seven Spirits of God .
66004006	In front of the throne , it was like a sea of glass . It looked like a stone called crystal . Around the throne on the four sides of it were four living beings . They had many eyes in their faces and in their back .
66004007	The first living thing was like a lion . The second one was like a young cow . The third one had the face of a man . The fourth one was like a flying eagle .
66004008	Each of the four living beings had six wings . They had many eyes all over their bodies and under their wings . They say all the time , day and night : Holy , holy , holy is the Lord God . He has all power . He always has lived . He lives now . And he always will live .
66004009	The living beings give praise and honour and thanks to the one who sits on the throne and lives for ever and ever .
66004010	Every time they do this , the twenty-four leaders kneel down in front of the one who sits on the throne . And they worship the one who lives for ever and ever . They take the crowns off their heads and lay them down in front of his throne .
66004011	They say : Our Lord and God , it is right for you to have praise and honour and power . You made all things . They were made and have life because you wanted them .
66005001	I saw a book in the right hand of the one who sat on the chief chair . It had writing on the front and the back . It was locked with seven locks .
66005002	I saw a strong angel calling with a loud voice . He said , Who can open the book and break its locks ?
66005003	And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth could open the book or look in it .
66005004	I cried very much because no one could open the book or look in it .
66005005	Then one of the leaders said to me , Do not cry . See , the Lion of the tribe of Judah has won ! The One who was born into Davids family has won ! He can open the book and break its seven locks .
66005006	I saw a Lamb standing in front of the throne and the four living beings , and in front of the leaders . It looked as if it had been killed . It had seven horns and seven eyes . They are the seven Spirits of God who are sent out all over the earth .
66005007	He went and took the book from the right hand of the One who sat on the throne .
66005008	And when he took the book , the four living beings and the twenty-four leaders kneeled down in front of the Lamb . Every one of them had a harp and a gold bowl . The bowls were full of incense that smelled very sweet when it was burned . These bowls are the words of Gods people when they talk to him .
66005009	And the four living beings and the leaders sang a new song . The new song was : You are able to take the book and to open its locks , because you were killed . You have set the people free and bought them for God with the cost of your blood . They are from every tribe , language , nation , and country .
66005010	You have made them into kings and priests for our God . They will rule on the earth .
66005011	Then I saw and heard many angels . They were around the chair , and the living beings , and the leaders . There were many , many thousands .
66005012	They said with a loud voice , The Lamb of God who was killed is the only one good enough to be given power , riches , wisdom , strength , honour , praise , and blessing !
66005013	Then I heard everything in heaven , on earth , under the earth , and on the sea , and everything in them say , Blessing , honour , praise , and power belong for ever and ever to the One who sits on the throne , and to the Lamb !
66005014	Then the four living beings said , Amen ! May it be so ! And the leaders kneeled down and worshipped the One who lives for ever and ever .
66006001	I saw the Lamb open one of the seven locks . I heard the voice of one of the four living beings call , Come ! It sounded like thunder .
66006002	And I looked and saw a white horse . The man who rode on it had a bow to shoot arrows . A gold crown for his head was given to him . And he went out fighting to win the victory over his enemies .
66006003	When the Lamb opened the second lock , I heard the second living being call , Come !
66006004	And another horse came out . It was red . The man who rode on it was allowed to take peace away from the earth , so that men would kill each other . The man who rode on it was given a long knife or sword .
66006005	When the Lamb opened the third lock , I heard the third living being call , Come ! I looked and saw a black horse . The man who rode on it had scales in his hand to weigh things .
66006006	I heard a voice among the four living beings . It said , Four cups of wheat for bread will sell for a days wages . Twelve cups of barley will sell for a days wages . But do not destroy the oil and the wine .
66006007	When the Lamb opened the fourth lock , I heard the fourth living being call , Come !
66006008	I saw a horse the colour of ashes . The name of the man who rode it was Death . And the one who controls the world of the dead followed him . They were given power over a fourth part of the world . They could kill people with a sword , or by making them go without food to eat , or by making them sick , or with wild animals .
66006009	When the Lamb opened the fifth lock , I saw the souls of people who had been killed . They were under the holy table where incense is burned . They had been killed because they believed Gods word and said they believed it .
66006010	They called in a loud voice , Lord , you are holy and true . How long will you wait before you judge and punish the people on earth because they killed us ?
66006011	Then each one of them was given a white gown to wear . They were told to wait a little longer for the other Christian brothers . Those who worked with them for the Lord would be killed as they had been .
66006012	I saw the Lamb opening the sixth lock . The earth shook very much . The sun became very dark , like the black cloth people wear to show they are sad . The full moon became red like blood .
66006013	The stars in the sky fell to the earth . They fell like figs that are not ripe when the fig tree is shaken by a strong wind .
66006014	The sky was taken away like paper being rolled up . Every big hill and island was shaken out of its place .
66006015	The kings of the world , the great men , the army captains , the rich people , the strong people , every slave , and every freeman hid themselves in holes and the rocks on the big hills .
66006016	They called to the hills and to the rocks and said , Fall on us ! Hide us so the One on the throne will not see us . Hide us from the Lamb who is angry with us .
66006017	The great day has come , and he is very angry with us . Who can stand before him ?
66007001	After this , I saw four angels standing at four different places on the earth . They were holding back the winds coming from every way . They did this so that no wind would blow on the earth , or on the sea , or on any tree .
66007002	Then I saw another angel coming up from the place where the sun rises . He had something to put the mark of the living God on people . He called out in a loud voice to the four angels . They had been given power to hurt the earth and the sea .
66007003	The angel said , Do not hurt the earth , the sea , or the trees until we have put a mark on the foreheads of Gods servants .
66007004	And I heard that one hundred and forty-four thousand people were marked . They were from every tribe of Israel .
66007005	Twelve thousand people were marked from each of these tribes : Judah , Reuben , Gad , Asher , Naphtali , Manasseh , Simeon , Levi , Issachar , Zebulun , Joseph , Benjamin .
66007009	After this , I looked and saw many people . There were so many that no person could count them all . They were from every country , tribe , nation , and language . I saw them standing in front of the throne and the Lamb . They wore white clothes and they had palm branches in their hands .
66007010	They called in a loud voice and said , Our God who sits on the throne , and the Lamb : they are the Ones who save people . Salvation belongs to them !
66007011	All the angels were standing around the throne and around the leaders and the four living beings . They bowed down their faces in front of the throne and worshipped God .
66007012	They said , May it be so ! Blessing , praise , glory and wisdom , thanks , honour , power , and strength belong to our God for ever and ever ! Amen !
66007013	Then one of the leaders talked to me . He said , Who are these people wearing white clothes ? Where did they come from ?
66007014	Then I said to him , Sir , I do not know . And he said to me , These are the people who have had much trouble . They have washed their clothes in the blood of the Lamb and made them white .
66007015	That is why they are in front of Gods throne . They worship him day and night in his temple . The one who sits on the throne will keep them safe because he is with them .
66007016	They will not be hungry or thirsty again . The sun or any other heat will not burn them .
66007017	The Lamb who is in front of the throne will take care of them . He will guide them to the places where there is water that gives life . And God will wipe every tear from their eyes .
66008001	When the Lamb opened the seventh lock , all was quiet in heaven for about a half hour .
66008002	Then I saw the seven angels stand in front of God . Seven horns or trumpets were given to them .
66008003	Another angel came and stood at the altar . He had a gold bowl . Plenty of incense was given to him . He was to put it with all the words of all Gods people when they talk to him . He was to put it on the gold altar in front of Gods throne .
66008004	The sweet smelling smoke of the burning incense went up at the same time as the prayer words of Gods people . They went up from the hand of the angel that was standing in front of God .
66008005	Then the angel took the bowl and filled it with fire from the altar . He threw it on the earth . There was thunder , loud noises , and lightning . And the earth shook .
66008006	The seven angels who had the seven horns or trumpets got ready to blow them .
66008007	The first angel blew his trumpet . Rain like stones , and fire mixed with blood , fell on the earth . A third part of the earth was burned . A third of the trees was burned . And one third of all the green grass was burned .
66008008	The second angel blew his trumpet . Then something like a big hill , burning with fire , was thrown into the sea .
66008009	Then a third of the sea became blood . A third of all things that lived in the sea died . A third of all the boats was broken .
66008010	The third angel blew his trumpet . A big star fell from the sky . It burned and gave a bright light . It fell on a third of the rivers and places where there is water .
66008011	The name of the star is Bitter . A third part of the water became bitter . Many men died because the water was made bad to drink .
66008012	The fourth angel blew his trumpet . A third of the sun was made dark . And a third of the moon and a third of the stars were made dark . A third part of them became dark . A third part of the day had no light , and also a third part of the night .
66008013	Then I looked and heard an angel who was flying across the sky . He called in a loud voice and said , Trouble ! Trouble ! Trouble to the people who live on earth ! Big trouble will come when the sound of the other trumpets is heard . The three angels are now ready to blow their trumpets !
66009001	Then the fifth angel blew his trumpet . I saw a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth . The key to the big hole that has no bottom was given to the angel .
66009002	He opened the big hole and smoke came out . It was like the smoke of a very big fire . The sun and the air were made dark by the smoke from the big hole .
66009003	Then out of the smoke came locusts on the earth like big grasshoppers . They were given the power to hurt people the way that scorpions do .
66009004	They were told not to spoil any of the grass , nor any green plant , nor any tree on earth . They were told to hurt only the people who did not have Gods mark on their foreheads .
66009005	They were told not to kill them , but to trouble them for five months . The pain they give is like the pain a scorpion gives when it strikes a person .
66009006	In those days people will look for death , but they will not be able to find it . They will want to die , but death will fly away from them .
66009007	The locusts looked like horses ready to go to war . On their heads were gold crowns . And they had faces like people .
66009008	Their hair was like womens hair and their teeth like lions teeth .
66009009	Their bodies were covered by something like pieces of iron . The noise of their wings sounded like many wagons and horses running to war .
66009010	The locusts had tails like scorpions that could strike people and hurt them for five months .
66009011	The king of the locusts is the angel of the big hole that has no bottom . His name is Abaddon in the Jews language and Apollyon in the Greek language . ( This means , the one who destroys . )
66009012	The first trouble is gone . Two more troubles are coming after it .
66009013	The sixth angel blew his trumpet . I heard a voice from the four horns of the gold altar in front of God .
66009014	The voice said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet , Untie the four angels who are tied at the big river Euphrates .
66009015	So the four angels were let free . They were ready for the hour , the day , the month , and the year when they would kill a third of the people .
66009016	In their army were many , many thousands of men on horses . I heard the number of them .
66009017	I saw what the horses and the men that sat on them looked like . The bodies of the men were covered by pieces of iron that looked red like fire and blue , and yellow . The heads of the horses were like lions heads . Fire , smoke and dust came out of their mouths . The dust was sulphur which choked and killed people when it burned in the fire .
66009018	By these three big troubles a third part of the people were killed . They were killed by the fire , smoke , and choking sulphur dust that came out of the mouths of the horses .
66009019	The power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails . Their tails have heads and are like snakes . They hurt people with them .
66009020	The other people were not killed by these big troubles . But they did not stop worshipping what they had made with their hands . They did not stop worshipping bad spirits and idols made of gold , silver , brass , stone , and wood . These idols cannot see or hear or walk .
66009021	And they did not stop their killing , or their witchcraft , or their wrong ways of using sex , or their stealing .
66010001	Then I saw another strong angel coming down from the sky . A cloud was around him and a rainbow was over his head . His face was like the sun and his legs were like posts of fire .
66010002	In his hand he had a small book that was open . He put his right foot on the sea , and his left foot on the land .
66010003	He called in a very loud voice like a lion roaring . When he called , it was like the voices of seven thunders .
66010004	When the seven thunders had spoken , I was going to write down what they said . But I heard a voice from the sky that said , Do not tell what the seven thunders said . Do not write it down .
66010005	The angel that I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand toward the sky .
66010006	He made a promise in the name of the one who lives for ever and ever . He made it in the name of the one who made the sky and everything in it , who made the earth and everything in it , and the sea and everything in it . He said , There is no more time .
66010007	But when the seventh angel calls by blowing his trumpet , then the secret plan of God will be finished . It will happen just as God told his servants , the prophets .
66010008	The voice I heard in the sky talked to me again . It said , Go to the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land . Take the open book from his hand .
66010009	So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the little book . He said to me , Take it and eat it . It will be bitter inside you , but it will be sweet like honey in your mouth .
66010010	So I took the little book from the angels hand and ate it . It was sweet like honey in my mouth . But when I had eaten it , my belly was bitter .
66010011	Then he said to me , You must tell again what God is saying to many nations , countries , languages , and kings .
66011001	Then I was given a long stick . And he said , Go and measure Gods temple and the altar , and count the people who worship there .
66011002	Do not measure the part outside the temple . Leave it out , because it has been given to the people who do not believe in God . They will walk in the holy city for forty-two months .
66011003	I will give power to the two men who speak for me . They will speak words from God . They will continue to speak for forty-two months . They will wear clothes like people wear to show they are sad .
66011004	These two men are the two olive trees and the two lamps which stand in front of the Lord of the earth .
66011005	If any one wants to hurt them , fire comes out of their mouths and burns up their enemies . If anyone wants to hurt them , he must be killed in this way .
66011006	These two men can stop the sky from raining all the days that they speak words from God . And they can turn the water into blood . They can bring all kinds of trouble to the earth as often as they want .
66011007	There is a beast which is a wild animal in the big hole that has no bottom . When the two men have finished talking , the beast will come up out of the hole . It will fight with the men . It will win over them and kill them .
66011008	Their dead bodies will lie in the street of the big city . This city is called , Sodom and Egypt , because it is like them . Also it is where our Lord was nailed to a cross .
66011009	People from many nations , tribes , languages , and countries will look at their dead bodies for three and a half days . They will not let anyone bury them .
66011010	The people on earth will be very glad to see them dead . They will have a happy time . They will give gifts to each other because these two men from God had troubled the people on the earth .
66011011	But after the three and a half days , life came into them . They stood on their feet . And all those who saw them were very much afraid .
66011012	Then they heard a loud voice from the sky saying to them , Come up here ! They went up into the sky in a cloud . And the men who hated them saw them go up .
66011013	At that time , the earth shook very much . A tenth part of the city fell down . Seven thousand people were killed by the shaking of the earth . The other people were very much afraid and they give glory to God in heaven .
66011014	The second trouble is gone . The third trouble is coming soon .
66011015	Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet . Loud voices were heard in the sky . They said , The kingdom of the world now belongs to our Lord and to his Christ . He will rule for ever and ever .
66011016	Then the twenty-four leaders who sat on their thrones in front of God kneeled down and worshipped God .
66011017	They said , We thank you , Lord God , who has all power . You live now and you always have lived . We thank you because you have now used your power and started to rule .
66011018	The people who did not believe you became angry . But now you are angry . It is time for dead people to be judged . And it is time to reward your servants , the prophets of God , and your holy people and all who respect your name-those who are great and those who are not so great . It is time to destroy those who destroy the earth .
66011019	Then the temple of God in heaven was opened . The box where his agreement was kept was seen inside the temple . And there was lightning , loud noises , and thunder . The earth shook and much rain , like stones , fell .
66012001	I saw a wonderful thing in the sky . A woman was wearing the sun like a dress . She stood on the moon . On her head she had twelve stars in a big ring like a crown . She was going to have a baby .
66012002	She cried out in pain because it was time for the baby to be born .
66012003	And another wonderful thing was seen in the sky . It was a big red dragon . He had seven heads and ten horns . He had seven big rings on his heads .
66012004	His tail struck a third part of the stars from the sky to the earth . The dragon stood in front of the woman who would soon have a baby . He wanted to eat her baby when it was born .
66012005	Then her baby boy was born . He will rule all the countries with an iron stick . Her child was taken up to God , to Gods throne .
66012006	The woman ran away into the wilderness . There God had made a place ready for her . There she will have food for forty-two months .
66012007	Then there was fighting in heaven . Michael and his angels fought with the dragon . The dragon and his angels fought back .
66012008	But they did not win the fight and no longer were they allowed to stay in heaven .
66012009	The dragon was thrown down . He was that old snake who is called the devil and Satan . He fools all the people in the world . He was thrown down to earth and his angels were thrown down with him .
66012010	I heard a loud voice in the sky . It said , Now the time has come for God to save people . He will use his strength . His kingdom will come and his Christ will use his power . The one who says bad things about our brothers to God day and night has been thrown down .
66012011	They have won the fight against him by the blood of the Lambs death , and by what they said . They did not try to save their lives , but were willing to die .
66012012	Heaven , and those who live in heaven , be glad because of it ! Big trouble will come to the earth and sea ! The devil has come down to you . He is very angry . He knows that he has only a short time !
66012013	And when the dragon saw that he had been thrown down to earth , he troubled the woman to whom a baby boy had been born .
66012014	But the woman was given two wings like a big eagles wings . With them she could fly away from the dragon into the wilderness to her place where she would have food for three and a half periods of time .
66012015	The dragon poured water like a river out of his mouth after her . He wanted the water to carry her away .
66012016	But the earth helped the woman . It opened a big hole . And the river which the dragon had poured out of his mouth went down the hole .
66012017	Then the dragon was very angry with the woman . He went away to fight against the other children of the woman . They are the ones who keep the laws of God and tell the truth about Jesus .
66013001	Then I stood on the sand by the sea . I saw a wild animal come up out of the sea . The beast had seven heads and ten horns . On its horns were ten big crowns . On its heads it had names that did not respect God .
66013002	The beast I saw was like a leopard . It had feet like a bear and a mouth like a lion . The dragon gave it his own strength , his own throne , and great power .
66013003	One of its heads had a cut , bad enough to kill it . But the bad cut was healed . All the people on earth were much surprised and followed the beast .
66013004	They worshipped the dragon because he had given this power to the beast . And they worshipped the beast too . They said , Who is like this beast ? Who can fight against it ?
66013005	The beast was given a mouth that spoke proud words against God . It was given power to rule for forty-two months .
66013006	It opened its mouth to speak against God , to speak against his name and the place where he lives , and to speak against those who live in heaven .
66013007	It was also given power to fight against Gods people and to win the fight against them . It was given power to rule over every tribe , nation , language , and country .
66013008	Everyone on earth will worship the beast , if they do not have their names in the book of life . The book of life belongs to the Lamb who was killed . That was Gods plan since the world was made .
66013009	He who can hear should listen :
66013010	Anyone who puts people in prison will go to prison . Any one who kills others with a long knife or sword will be killed by a long knife or sword . This is why Gods people are patient and keep on believing .
66013011	Then I saw another beast come up out of the earth . It had two horns like a lamb but talked like a dragon .
66013012	It uses all the power of the first beast and stands with it . It makes all the earth and those who live on it worship the first beast . That was the beast whose bad cut was healed .
66013013	The second beast does wonderful things . It even makes fire fall from the sky to the earth for everyone to see .
66013014	It fools the people who live on earth by the wonderful things which it has been given power to do , while the first beast looks on . It tells the people on earth to make an idol like the first beast that was cut by the big knife but lived .
66013015	It was given power to make the idol of the beast live . The idol of the beast could speak and command all those who would not worship the idol to be killed .
66013016	It makes all the people take a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads . That means all people , those who are great and those who are not great , the poor , free men , and slaves .
66013017	No one could buy or sell anything if he did not have this mark . This mark is the name of the beast or the number of its name .
66013018	Here wisdom is needed . If a person understands , he should count the number of the beast . It is the number of a mans name . Its number is six hundred and sixty-six .
66014001	The song of the 144,000 Then I looked and saw the Lamb standing on a hill called Zion . With him were one hundred and forty-four thousand people . They had his name and the name of his Father written on their foreheads .
66014002	I heard a sound from the sky like the sound of much water flowing , and like the sound of much thunder . The sound I heard was like people playing music on their harps .
66014003	They were singing a new song in front of Gods chief chair , in front of the four living beings and the leaders . No one could learn that song but the one hundred and forty-four thousand people . They have been bought from the earth .
66014004	They are the people who have not had sex with women . They are clean . They are the people who follow the Lamb wherever he goes . They lived among people on earth . They have been bought from the earth . They are the first among men to have been bought for God and the Lamb .
66014005	They never told lies . They are found to be without any wrong ways as they stand before the throne of God .
66014006	Then I saw another angel flying across the sky . He had good news that will last for ever to tell the people who live on the earth . The good news is for every country , tribe , language , and nation .
66014007	He said in a loud voice , Respect and honour God and give him glory ! The time has come for him to judge people , to tell them how good or bad they are . Worship him . He made heaven and earth , the sea , and the rivers .
66014008	A second angel followed him . He said , The great city of Babylon has fallen down . It has fallen down because it filled all the countries with its wrong ways . It has made people to suffer Gods anger .
66014010	A third angel followed the other two . He said in a loud voice , Any person who worships the beast or its idol , and takes its mark on his forehead or on his hand , will also feel Gods anger . He is very angry . That person will be burned with fire and dust that chokes people when it burns . He will be burned in front of the holy angels and the Lamb .
66014011	The smoke of that fire goes up for ever and ever . Those who worship the animal and its idol , and anyone who takes the mark of its name , will get no rest day or night .
66014012	This is why Gods people must be patient . They are the ones who keep the laws of God and believe in Jesus .
66014013	I heard a voice from the sky . It said , Write this : From now on , happy are those who die believing in the Lord . Yes , says the Spirit . They will have rest from their troubles . The good things they have done will go with them .
66014014	I looked and saw a white cloud . I saw someone like the Son of Man sitting on the cloud . He had a big gold crown on his head and a sharp harvest knife in his hand .
66014015	Another angel came out of Gods temple . He called in a loud voice to the one who was sitting on the cloud . He said , Take your knife and cut the harvest . The time has come to take in the harvest because the earth is ready .
66014016	So the one who sat on the cloud used his knife on earth . And the harvest on earth was cut .
66014017	Then another angel came out of the temple in heaven . He also had a sharp knife .
66014018	And another angel came from the altar . He had power over fire . He called in a loud voice to the angel who had the sharp knife . He said , Take your sharp knife and gather the fruit that grows on the vine on the earth . Its fruit is ripe .
66014019	So the angel used his knife on earth . He gathered the fruit of the vine on the earth . He put it in the big place where the water of the fruit is pressed out . This place is Gods anger .
66014020	It was outside the city that they pressed the fruit . Blood ran out of the place . It came up as high as the horses heads for about two hundred miles .
66015001	I saw another big and wonderful thing in the sky . I saw seven angels who carried the seven big troubles . They are the last troubles . When these troubles have come , Gods anger is ended . I saw something that looked like a sea of glass mixed with fire . And I saw those people who had won the fight against the beast , and its idol , and its mark , and the number of its name . They were standing on the sea of glass and they had the harps of God in their hands .
66015002	They sing the song of Moses who is the servant of God , and the song of the Lamb . They say , Lord God who has all power , the things you do are great and wonderful ! King for ever , your ways are right and true !
66015003	Who will not respect and honour you and praise your name , Lord ? You are the only one who is holy . People from all countries will come and worship you because they have seen that you are right and fair .
66015004	After this I looked . The temple in heaven was open . It was the place where Gods agreement was kept .
66015005	The seven angels who carried the seven troubles came out of the temple . They were wearing linen clothes , clean and shining . Around their chests they wore gold belts .
66015006	One of the four living beings gave the angels seven gold bowls . The bowls were full of the anger of God who lives for ever and ever .
66015007	The temple was full of smoke because God is so great and has so much power . No one could go into the temple until the seven troubles , which the seven angels had , were ended .
66015008	missing fehlt/missing
66016001	I heard a loud voice coming from the temple . It said to the seven angels , Go and pour the seven bowls of Gods anger on the earth .
66016002	So the first angel went and poured his bowl on the earth . Then a bad , dirty sore came on the people who had the mark of the animal on them , and who worshipped its idol .
66016003	The second angel poured his bowl on the sea . It turned into blood like that of a person who has been killed . Everything in the sea that had life died .
66016004	The third angel poured his bowl on the rivers and the places where there was water . They turned into blood .
66016005	And I heard the angel of the water say , Holy One , you who live now and who always have lived , and will live for ever; you are right because you have punished them this way .
66016006	They killed Gods people and the prophets . Now you have given them blood to drink . This is what they should get !
66016007	I heard the people under the altar say , Yes , Lord God , you have all power ! The way you punish is true and right !
66016008	The fourth angel poured his bowl on the sun . Then the sun was given the power to burn people with fire .
66016009	People were burned because the sun was so hot . And they spoke wrongly about the name of God , cursing him because he had the power to send these troubles . But they would not stop the wrong things they were doing . They would not respect and honour God .
66016010	The fifth angel poured his bowl on the throne of the beast . The place where he ruled became dark . People bit their tongues because of the pain they had .
66016011	They cursed God in heaven because of their pain and sores . But they did not stop the wrong things they were doing . They would not turn back to God .
66016012	The sixth angel poured his bowl on the big river Euphrates . Its water dried up so that a road was made ready for the kings to come from the east .
66016013	I saw three bad spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon , and out of the mouth of the beast , and out of the mouth of the prophet who is not true .
66016014	They are the spirits of gods who are not true , and they do wonderful things . They go to the kings of the whole world and gather them to fight on the great day of God who has all power .
66016015	Look ! I will come like a thief . The person who stays awake and dressed will be glad he did ! He will not be without clothes and he will not be ashamed .
66016016	They gathered at the place called Armageddon in the Hebrew language .
66016017	Then the seventh angel poured his bowl into the air . A loud voice came from the temple and the chair . It said , It is finished !
66016018	There were lightnings , loud noises , and thunder . The earth shook very much . It shook more than it had ever shaken since people have been on earth .
66016019	The big city was broken into three parts . And the cities of the nations fell down . God remembered Babylon , the big city . He made it feel all of his great anger .
66016020	The islands all went away , and the mountains could not be seen .
66016021	Rain like big stones fell from the sky on men . Each stone weighed about a hundred pounds . Men cursed God because the big rain of stones fell on them . The trouble was very bad .
66017001	One of the seven angels who had carried the seven bowls came and talked to me . He said , Come , and I will show you the woman who has given herself over to wrong ways of using sex . She is sitting over many waters . I will show you how she will be punished .
66017002	The kings on earth have been with her and copied her . And the people on earth gladly copy her wrong ways .
66017003	Then the angel took me away in the Spirit to a wilderness . There I saw a woman sitting on a red beast that had names against God written all over it . It had seven heads and ten horns .
66017004	The woman was wearing blue and red clothes . She was shining with gold , fine stones , and pearls . In her hand she held a gold cup . It was full of the wrong things she did and of her dirty ways of using sex .
66017005	A name was written on her forehead . It has a secret meaning . The name is Great Babylon , the mother of all people who give their bodies for wrong ways of using sex . The mother of all things done on earth too bad to talk about .
66017006	And I saw the woman was drunk because of the blood she drank . It was the blood of Gods people , and the blood of people who had been killed because they belonged to Jesus . When I saw her , I was very much surprised .
66017007	The angel asked me , Why are you surprised ? I will tell you the secret meaning of the woman and the beast with seven heads and horns that carries her .
66017008	The beast that you saw was alive at one time , then it was dead . It will come up from the big hole that has no bottom and it will be killed . The people on earth will be surprised when they see the beast , because it was alive and then it was dead , and it comes alive again . These are the people who do not have their names written in the book of life from the time the world was made .
66017009	To understand this , one must be wise . The seven heads are the seven hills on which the woman is sitting .
66017010	They are also seven kings . Five have already lost their power . One is ruling now , and the other one has not yet come . When he comes he will rule for a short time .
66017011	The beast that was alive at the one time , and then was dead , is the eighth king . He is really one of the seven . He will be killed .
66017012	The ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet ruled . They will have power for one hour to rule with the animal .
66017013	These ten all think the same way , and they give to the beast their power and right to rule .
66017014	They will fight against the Lamb , but the Lamb will win the fight against them . He will win because he is Lord of lords and King of kings . Those who are with the Lamb will also win . God has called them and chosen them , and they believe in him .
66017015	And the angel said to me , You saw the water on which the bad woman is sitting . The water is the many nations , many people , many countries , and many languages .
66017016	You saw the ten horns and the animal . They will hate the bad woman . They will take away everything she has and her fine clothes . They will eat her body and burn her up in a fire .
66017017	God has put it into their hearts to do what he wants done to her . They will all agree . They will give to the beast their power to rule until what God has said comes true .
66017018	The woman whom you saw is the big city that rules over the kings on earth .
66018001	After that I saw another angel coming down from the sky . He had much power . The bright light that shone from him lit up the earth .
66018002	He called in a loud voice and said , The big city of Babylon has fallen down ! It has fallen down ! Bad spirits live in it . All bad spirits hide there . And all kinds of dirty birds that people hate hide there .
66018003	All the nations are broken down because they are full of its wrong ways . The kings of the earth have joined with it . The traders of the earth have become rich because of its wrong ways .
66018004	Then I heard another voice from the sky that said , Come out of it , my people , so that you will have no part in the wrong things it does . Come out of it so that you will not have the big troubles it will have .
66018005	Its wrong ways are piled as high as the sky and God has remembered the wrong things it has done .
66018006	Do to it what it did to you . Yes , do two times as much to it as it did to you ! From the cup it gave you to drink , give it two times as much to drink as it gave to you .
66018007	It is proud of itself and has done wrong things . Give it that much trouble and crying . It says in its heart , " I am like a queen . I am not like a woman who has lost her husband . I will never know sorrow . "
66018008	So then , its big troubles will come in one day . Those troubles are death , crying , hunger , and being burned in a fire . The Lord who has punished it is strong .
66018009	And the kings of the earth were joined with it in its wrong ways . They will cry and be sad about it when they see the smoke while it burns .
66018010	They will stand far away from it because they are afraid of the trouble it is having . They will say , " Trouble ! Trouble ! You big , strong city Babylon ! In one hour your punishment has come ! "
66018011	And the traders of the earth will cry and be sad about it , because no one buys the things they bring to sell .
66018012	They have many things to sell : gold , silver , fine stones , and pearls . They have linen clothes and blue cloth , silk cloth and red cloth . They have all kinds of sweet smelling wood . They have all kinds of things made of ivory . They have all kinds of things made of wood that costs much money , of brass , of iron , and of a stone called marble .
66018013	They have spices and perfume . They have incense and a sweet-smelling oil . They have frankincense and wine and oil . They have fine flour and wheat . They have cows , sheep , horses , and wagons . They have slaves and people to sell .
66018014	The things that your heart wanted are gone from you . All your fine food and clothes are gone from you . You will never find them again .
66018015	The traders will sell these things and got much money from the city . They will stand far away from it because they are afraid of the trouble it is having . They will cry and be sad about it .
66018016	They will say " How terrible for you , you big strong city ! You were wearing linen clothes and purple and red clothes . You were shining with gold , fine stones , and pearls .
66018017	In one hour all your great riches are lost . " And all the captains of the boats and all the seamen , the sailors , and all that do business on the sea stood away from it .
66018018	They called out loud when they saw the smoke while it burned . They said , " What city is like that big city ? "
66018019	They threw dust on their heads and they called out loud . They cried and were sad . They said , " How terrible for that big city ! All the men who had boats on the sea became rich because it was rich . In one hour it is all lost . "
66018020	Be glad for what has happened to it , all you who are in heaven , Gods people , apostles and prophets . God has punished it for what it did to you !
66018021	Then a strong angel took up a very heavy stone and threw it into the sea . He said , So hard will Babylon the big city be thrown down . It will not be seen again .
66018022	People will not hear music in you again . No harps , no singing , no pipes or horns will ever be heard in you again . No one will make things in you again . The noise of people grinding grain will not be heard in you again .
66018023	No lamp will shine in you again . No one will hear the voice of people being married . Your traders were the big people of the world . All the countries were fooled by your witch doctors .
66018024	The blood of prophets and of Gods people and of all who have been killed on earth was found in that city .
66019001	After this I heard a loud sound in heaven . It sounded like many people calling . They said , Praise our God ! He saves people . He is great and power belongs to him .
66019002	The way God punishes is true and right . He has punished the bad woman who spoiled the earth with her wrong ways . He has made her pay for the killing of his servants .
66019003	They said again , Praise God ! The smoke where she burns goes up for ever and ever !
66019004	Then the twenty-four leaders and the four living beings kneeled down . They worshipped God who was sitting on his throne , and they said , Amen ! Yes , it is so ! Praise God !
66019005	A voice from the throne said , Praise our God , all his servants , all who respect and honour him : you who are great and you who are not great , praise him !
66019006	Then I heard a sound in heaven . It sounded like many people and much water flowing and like loud thunder . They said , Praise God ! The Lord our God , who has all power , rules !
66019007	We will be glad and very happy ! We will praise him . The time has come for the Lamb to marry . The woman who will marry him is ready .
66019008	She was given the right to wear fine linen , shining and clean . The fine linen means the good things Gods people have done .
66019009	The angel said to me , Write this : God blesses those who are called to come to the wedding feast of the Lamb . And he said to me , These are the true words of God .
66019010	Then I kneeled down in front of him to worship him . But he said to me , You must not do that ! I am only a servant like you and like your brothers who tell about Jesus . Worship God ! Those who tell about Jesus have the spirit of a prophet .
66019011	Then I saw heaven open , and I saw a white horse ! The One who rode him is called One who can be Trusted and The True One . He punishes and makes war in the right way .
66019012	His eyes were like a flame of fire . On his head were many crowns . He had a name written on him , but no man knew what it was but he himself .
66019013	He wore clothes that had been dipped in blood . His name is The Word of God .
66019014	The armies of heaven followed him on white horses and they were dressed in fine linen , shining and clean .
66019015	A long knife or sword comes from his mouth . With it he will punish and control the people of the nations . He will rule them with an iron stick . He is like the winepress that presses the water out of the fruit . It is the place where God , who has all power , shows his great anger .
66019016	A name is written on his clothes and on his leg : it is King of kings , and Lord of lords .
66019017	I saw an angel standing in the sun . He called in a loud voice to all the birds that fly across the sky . He said , Come , gather for Gods big feast .
66019018	Come to eat the bodies of kings , the bodies of captains , the bodies of strong men , the bodies of horses and those who ride them , the bodies of all free men and of slaves , those who are great and those who are not great .
66019019	I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies . They were gathered to fight against the One riding the horse and his army .
66019020	Then the beast was caught and the prophet who is not true was caught . The prophet had done big works for the beast to see . By the things which he did , he had fooled the people who had the mark of the beast and who worshipped its idol . The beast and the prophet were thrown alive into the big fire which burns with dust that chokes people .
66019021	Their armies were killed by the man riding the horse . He killed them with the sword that came out of his mouth . All the birds ate all they wanted of their dead bodies .
66020001	Then I saw an angel coming down from the sky . In his hand he had the key to the big hole that has no bottom , and a big chain .
66020002	He caught the dragon , that old snake who is called the devil and Satan . The angel tied him for a thousand years .
66020003	Then the angel threw him into the big hole that has no bottom . He shut it and locked him in . He did this so that the devil would not fool the nations again until the end of the thousand years . After that , the devil will be let free for a short time .
66020004	Then I saw thrones . Those who sat on them were given the right to judge . And I saw the souls of those who had their heads cut off because they told about Jesus and Gods word . They had not worshipped the beast or its idol . And they had not taken its mark on their foreheads or on their hands . They became alive again and ruled with Christ for a thousand years .
66020005	The other dead people did not live again until the end of the thousand years . This is the first rising from death .
66020006	God has blessed those who rise this first time , and they are holy . They will not die the second kind of death . But they will be priests of God and of Christ . They will rule with him for the thousand years .
66020007	When the end of the thousand years comes , Satan will be set free from his prison .
66020008	He will go out to fool the nations all over the world . He will fool Gog and Magog . He will gather them to fight . They are many , as many as the sand on the seashore .
66020009	They marched far over the earth . They went all around the camp of Gods people and the city his people loved . Then fire came down from the sky and burned them .
66020010	The devil who fooled them was thrown into the big fire which burns with dust that chokes people . The animal , and the prophet who is not true , were already in the fire . They will have a very hard time day and night , for ever and ever .
66020011	Then I saw a big white throne and the person sitting on it . The earth and sky went away from him . They were not there any more .
66020012	I saw the dead people , those who were great and those not great . They were standing in front of Gods throne . Some books were opened . And another book was opened which is the book of life . The dead people were judged by the things they had done , which were written in the books .
66020013	The dead people in the sea came out . People came out of death and the world of the dead . One by one , each one was judged by the things he had done .
66020014	Then death and the world of the dead were thrown into the big fire . This fire is the second death .
66020015	Every person whose name was not written in the book of life was thrown into this big fire .
66021001	Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth . The first heaven and the first earth had gone away . There was no sea any more .
66021002	I saw the holy city , New Jerusalem , coming down out of heaven from God . It was all ready and waiting , like a woman dressed for her wedding and ready to meet her husband .
66021003	I heard a loud voice in heaven . It said , Look ! Gods house is now set up among the people . God will live with them . They will be his people and God himself will be with them .
66021004	He will wipe every tear from their eyes . No one will die . No one will ever cry or be sad for any reason . No one will ever have trouble . The old things are gone .
66021005	The One who sat on the throne said , Look , I make all things new . And he said , Write this , because these words can be trusted . they are true .
66021006	He said to me , It is finished ! I am the First and the Last ! I am the Beginning and the End . I will give the river of water that gives life to those who are thirsty . It will cost no money .
66021007	The one who wins will have these things . I will be his God and he will be my son .
66021008	Some people will be thrown into the big fire which burns with sulphur dust that chokes people . These are the people : those who give in to fear , those who do not believe , those who are bad , those who kill , those with wrong ways of using sex , the witch-doctors , those who worship idols , and all those who love lies . That fire is the second death .
66021009	Then one of the seven angels who carried the seven bowls full of the last troubles came and talked to me . He said , Come , I will show you the young woman who is the wife of the Lamb .
66021010	The angel took me away in the Spirit to a very big hill . He showed me Jerusalem , the holy city , coming down out of heaven from God .
66021011	The light of God was shining from it . It was bright like a very fine stone called jasper . It was as clear as glass .
66021012	The city had a wall that was big and high . It had twelve doors . At the doors were twelve angels . Names were written on the doors . They are the names of the twelve tribes of the people of Israel .
66021013	There were three doors on the east side . There were three doors on the north side . There were three doors on the south side and three doors on the west side .
66021014	The wall of the city had twelve foundation stones . On them were written the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb .
66021015	The angel who talked to me had a gold stick to measure the city , its doors , and its walls .
66021016	The city is square . It is as long as it is wide . The angel measured the city with his stick and it was about fifteen hundred miles . It is as long as it is wide and as high as it is long .
66021017	Then he measured its wall . It was two hundred and sixteen feet by the way a man measures . That is the way the angel measured .
66021018	The wall of the city was made of a very fine stone called jasper . The city was all made of pure gold . It was clear like glass .
66021019	The bottom of the city wall was covered with all kinds of fine stones . The first stone was red jasper . The second stone was blue sapphire . The third stone was of many colours called agate . The fourth stone was green emerald .
66021020	The fifth stone was onyx . The sixth stone was red carnelian . The seventh stone was green crysolite . The eighth stone was green beryl . The ninth stone was yellow topaz . The tenth stone was green chrysoprase . The eleventh stone was red jacinth . And the twelfth stone was a blue amethyst .
66021021	The twelve doors were twelve pearls . Each door was made from one big pearl . The street of the city was all pure gold . It was as clear as glass .
66021022	I did not see any temple in the city . The Lord God , who has all power , and the Lamb , are its temple .
66021023	The city does not need the sun or the moon to give light in it . The glory of God gives light , and the Lamb is its lamp .
66021024	Those who are saved will walk in its light . The kings of the earth will bring their glory into it .
66021025	The doors of the city will never be shut in the day time , and there will be no night .
66021026	The glory and the honour of all nations will be brought into the city .
66021027	Nothing that is not holy will ever go in . People who do wrong things and tell lies will never go in . Only those whose names are written in the Lambs book of life will go in .
66022001	Then the angel showed me a river of the water which gives life . It was as clear as glass . It flows from the throne of God and the Lamb .
66022002	It flows through the middle of the street of the city . On each side of the river is the tree which gives life . It has twelve kinds of fruit , and it bears its fruit each month . The leaves of the tree could heal the people of all nations .
66022003	Nothing that God hates will be in the city any more . The throne of God and of the Lamb will be there . And his servants will serve him .
66022004	They will see his face , and his name will be on their foreheads .
66022005	There will be no night there . They do not need the light of a lamp nor the light of the sun . The Lord God will give them light . They will rule for ever and ever .
66022006	Then the angel said to me , These words can be trusted . They are true . The Lord God who gave his Spirit to the prophets has sent his angel to show his servants what must happen soon .
66022007	Look ! I will come soon ! God will bless the person who obeys the words in this book .
66022008	I , John , heard and saw these things . And when I heard and saw them I kneeled down to worship in front of the angel who showed them to me .
66022009	But He said to me , You must not do that . I am only a servant like you and your brothers , the prophets , and those who obey the words of this book . Worship God .
66022010	The angel said to me , Do not keep secret the words of Gods message in this book . The time is near .
66022011	Let the bad man keep on doing wrong things . Let the person who does dirty things , keep on being dirty . Let the good person keep on doing what is good . Let the holy person keep on being holy .
66022012	Look , I will come soon ! When I come , I will pay every man for what he has done .
66022013	I am the First and the Last . I am the Beginning and the End .
66022014	God will bless the people who do what he says and keep themselves pure and clean . They can eat fruit from the tree that gives life . And they can go through the doors into the city .
66022015	Outside the city are the dirty people , and the witch-doctors , and those with wrong ways of using sex , those who kill people , those who worship idols , and all those who like lies and tell them .
66022016	I , Jesus , have sent my angel to tell these things to you in the churches . I am the root and the branch of David . I am the bright star in the morning .
66022017	The Spirit and the Lambs wife say , Come . He who hears should say , Come . He who is thirsty should come . Anyone who wishes should drink the water that gives life . It costs no money .
66022018	I am talking to everyone who hears the words of Gods message in this book . If any one adds anything to this book , God will add to him the troubles that are written in this book .
66022019	If any one takes away any of the words of Gods message , God will take away from him his share of the tree which gives life and the holy city . This book tells about them .
66022020	He who shows these things says , Yes , I will come soon . Amen , Lord Jesus , come !
66022021	May the love and mercy of the Lord Jesus bless you all . Amen .
